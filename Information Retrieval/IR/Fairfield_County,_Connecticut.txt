Fairfield County is the southwestern-most and most populous county of the 
U.S. state of Connecticut. As of the 2010 census, the county's population 
was 916,829, estimated to have increased by 3.4% to 948,053 in 2015.[1] 
The county contains four of the state's largest cities (Bridgeport (1st), 
Stamford (3rd), Norwalk (6th) and Danbury (7th)), whose combined population 
of 433,368 is almost half the county's. The United States Office of Management 
and Budget has designated Fairfield County as the Bridgeport-Stamford-Norwalk, 
CT Metropolitan Statistical Area.[2] The United States Census Bureau ranked 
the Bridgeport-Stamford-Norwalk, CT Metropolitan Statistical Area as the 
57th most populous metropolitan statistical area of the United States as 
of July 1, 2012.[3] The Office of Management and Budget has further designated 
the Bridgeport-Stamford-Norwalk, CT Metropolitan Statistical Area as a 
component of the more extensive New York-Newark, NY-NJ-CT-PA Combined Statistical 
Area,[2] the most populous combined statistical area and primary statistical 
area of the United States.[4] As is the case with all eight of Connecticut's 
counties, there is no county government and no county seat. As an area 
it is only a geographical point of reference. In Connecticut the cities 
and towns are responsible for all local governmental activities including 
fire and rescue, schools, and snow removal; in a few cases, neighboring 
towns will share certain resources. Fairfield County's Gold Coast helped 
rank it sixth in the US in per-capita personal income by the Bureau of 
Economic Analysis in 2005,[5] contributing substantially to Connecticut 
being one of the most affluent states in the US.[6] Other communities are 
more densely populated and economically diverse than the affluent areas 
for which the county is better known. Fairfield County was the home of 
many Native American tribes prior to the coming of the Europeans. People 
of the Schaghticoke tribe lived in the area of present-day New Fairfield 
and Sherman.[7] From east to west the Wappinger sachemships included the 
Paugussetts, Tankiteke, and the Siwanoy. There were also Paquioque and 
Potatuck inhabitants of Fairfield County. The Dutch explorer Adriaen Block 
explored coastal Connecticut in the Spring and early Summer of 1614 in 
the North American built vessel Onrust. The first European settlers of 
the county, however, were Puritans and Congregationalists from England. 
Roger Ludlow (1590–1664), one of the founders of the Colony of Connecticut, 
helped to purchase and charter the towns of Fairfield (1639)[8] and Norwalk 
(purchased 1640, chartered as a town in 1651). Ludlow is credited as having 
chosen the name Fairfield. Fairfield is a descriptive name referring to 
the beauty of its fields.[9] The town of Stratford was settled in 1639 
as well by Adam Blakeman (1596–1665). William Beardsley (1605–1661) was 
also one of the first settlers of Stratford in 1639. Fairfield County was 
established by an act of the Connecticut General Court in Hartford along 
with Hartford County, New Haven County, and New London County; which were 
the first four Connecticut counties, on May 10, 1666. From transcriptions 
of the Connecticut Colonial Records for that day: The original Fairfield 
County consisted of the towns of Rye, Greenwich, Stamford, Norwalk, Fairfield, 
and Stratford. In 1673, the town of Woodbury was incorporated and added 
to Fairfield County. In 1683, New York and Connecticut reached a final 
agreement regarding their common border. This resulted in the cession of 
the town of Rye and all claims to the Oblong to New York. From the late 
17th to early 18th centuries, several new towns were incorporated in western 
Connecticut and added to Fairfield County, namely Danbury (1687), Ridgefield 
(1709), Newtown (1711), and New Fairfield (1740). In 1751, Litchfield County 
was constituted, taking over the town of Woodbury. The final boundary adjustment 
to Fairfield County occurred in 1788 when the town of Brookfield was incorporated 
from parts of Newtown, Danbury, and New Milford, with Fairfield County 
gaining territory from Litchfield County. Other early county inhabitants 
include: During the Revolutionary War, Connecticut's prodigious agricultural 
output led to it being known informally as "the Provisions State".[11] 
In the spring of 1777, the British Commander-in-Chief, North America General 
William Howe, in New York City, ordered William Tryon to interrupt the 
flow of supplies from Connecticut that were reaching the Continental Army. 
Tryon and Henry Duncan led a fleet of 26 ships carrying 2,000 men to Westport's 
Compo Beach to raid Continental Army supply depots in Danbury on April 
22, 1777. American Major General David Wooster (1710–1777), who was born 
in Stratford, was in charge of the stores at Danbury and defended them 
with a force of only 700 troops. Sybil Ludington helped rally New York 
militia to aid in the defense of Danbury. The New York militia included 
Sybil's father Colonel Henry Ludington. Though they arrived too late to 
save Danbury from burning, the elder Ludington and the New York militia 
helped support the Danbury troops and ensuing engagement of the British 
known as the Battle of Ridgefield on April 27, 1777. Wooster was wounded 
at Ridgefield and died five days later in Danbury. Two years later during 
a British raid on Greenwich on February 26, 1779 General Israel Putnam, 
who had stayed at Knapp's Tavern the previous night, rode away on his horse 
to warn the people of Stamford. Putnam was shot at by the British raiders 
but was able to escape. The hat he was wearing with a musket ball hole 
in it is on display at Knapp's Tavern in Greenwich (which is commonly, 
albeit somewhat erroneously, called Putnam's cottage).[12] In the summer 
of 1779, General William Tryon sought to punish Americans by attacking 
civilian targets in coastal Connecticut with a force of about 2,600 British 
troops. New Haven was raided on July 5, Fairfield was raided on the 7th 
and burned. Norwalk was raided on July 10 and burned on the 11th. Norwalk 
militia leader Captain Stephen Betts put up resistance to the invaders, 
but was overwhelmed by the powerful British raiders and was forced to retreat. 
David Sherman Boardman (1786–1864) was a prominent early lawyer and judge 
in this and neighboring Litchfield County. On October 7, 1801, Neremiah 
Dodge and other members of the Danbury Baptist Association wrote a letter 
to then president Thomas Jefferson expressing their concern that as Baptists 
they may not be able to express full religious liberty in the state of 
Connecticut whose "ancient charter" was adopted before the establishment 
of a Baptist church in the state. Jefferson replied in a letter to Dodge 
and the other members of the Danbury church on January 1, 1802 in which 
he thought that there was "a wall of separation between church and State" 
that protected them.[13] This well-known phrase occurs in Jefferson's letter 
to the Danbury church members and not in the First Amendment to the United 
States Constitution, nor in later amendments. Although it is often viewed 
as an extension of metro-New York City, Fairfield County has had much industry 
in its own right. Bridgeport Machines, Inc., a milling machine manufacturer, 
was founded in Bridgeport in 1938. Stamford, Connecticut is an example 
of edge city urbanization, with many large and important companies having 
offices there and benefitting from proximity to New York. At the height 
of its influence in the 1920s, the Ku Klux Klan had a distinct presence 
in the county and county politics. The group was most active in Darien.[14] 
The Klan has since disappeared from the county. Fairfield County, along 
with all other Connecticut counties, was abolished as a governmental agency 
in accord with state legislation that took effect October 1, 1960.[15] 
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of 837 
square miles (2,170 km2), of which 625 square miles (1,620 km2) is land 
and 212 square miles (550 km2) (25.3%) is water.[16] The terrain of the 
county trends from flat near the coast to hilly and higher near its northern 
extremity. The highest elevation is 1,290 feet (393 m) above sea level 
along the New York state line south of Branch Hill in the Town of Sherman; 
the lowest point is sea level itself. The Taconic Mountains and the Berkshire 
Mountains ranges of the Appalachian Mountains run through Fairfield County. 
The Taconics begin roughly in Ridgefield and the Berkshires begin roughly 
in Northern Trumbull, both running north to Litchfield County and beyond. 
A portion of the Taconics also is in rural Greenwich and rural North Stamford 
in Fairfield County and run north into Westchester County, New York, eventually 
re-entering Fairfield County in Ridgefield. Also a small portion of the 
Appalachian Trail runs through the county. The Appalachian Trail enters 
Connecticut in the northernmost and least populous town in the county, 
Sherman, and moves east into Litchfield County which encompasses the majority 
of the Appalachian Trail in Connecticut. The section of the Taconic Mountains 
range that runs through Greenwich and North Stamford of Fairfield County 
is also the part of the Appalachians that is closest to the coast out of 
the entire Appalachian Mountains. The agreed 1684 territorial limits of 
the county are defined as 20 miles (32 km) east of New York's Hudson River, 
which extends into Long Island Sound with a southernly limit of half way 
to Long Island, New York. The eastern limit is mostly a natural border 
defined as the half way point of the Housatonic River with New Haven County 
with the exception of several islands belonging wholly to Stratford. The 
depth of the Sound varies between 60 and 120 feet (37 m). The county is 
home to the Byram River, Housatonic River, Mianus River, Mill River, Norwalk 
River, Pequonnock River, Rippowam River, Saugatuck River, and the Still 
River. The Still River is polluted with mercury nitrate from the hat industry 
in Danbury, which has flowed into the Housatonic River and into Long Island 
Sound.[17][18] The Housatonic River is polluted with Monsanto chemicals 
called Aroclor, polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs. From circa 1932 until 
1977, the river received PCBs pollution discharges from the General Electric 
plant at Pittsfield, Massachusetts.[19] Refer to List of Mountains and 
Summits in Fairfield County, Connecticut. As of the census[25] of 2000, 
there were 882,567 people, 324,232 households, and 228,259 families residing 
in the county. The population density was 1,410 people per square mile 
(545/km²). There were 339,466 housing units at an average density of 542 
per square mile (209/km²). The racial makeup of the county was 79.31% White, 
10.01% Black or African American, 0.20% Native American, 3.25% Asian, 0.04% 
Pacific Islander, 4.70% from other races, and 2.49% from two or more races. 
11.88% of the population were Hispanic or Latino of any race. 17.6% were 
of Italian, 12.4% Irish, 6.5% German and 6.4% English ancestry. In 2010, 
66.2% of Fairfield County's population was non-Hispanic whites and 10.8% 
of the population was black. Asians were 4.6% of the population. Hispanics 
now constituted 16.9% of the population.[26] As of 2000, 76.2% spoke English, 
11.0% Spanish, 2.0% Portuguese, 1.7% Italian and 1.1% French as their first 
language. Some of the last group were Haitians, although other Haitians 
would identify Haitian creole as their first language. There were 324,232 
households out of which 34.20% had children under the age of 18 living 
with them, 55.50% were married couples living together, 11.50% had a female 
householder with no husband present, and 29.60% were non-families. 24.00% 
of all households were made up of individuals and 9.40% had someone living 
alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 
2.67 and the average family size was 3.18. In the county the population 
was spread out with 25.60% under the age of 18, 7.00% from 18 to 24, 30.90% 
from 25 to 44, 23.30% from 45 to 64, and 13.30% who were 65 years of age 
or older. The median age was 37 years. For every 100 females there were 
93.40 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 89.60 males. 
The median income for a household in the county was $65,249, and the median 
income for a family was $77,690. Males had a median income of $51,996 versus 
$37,108 for females. The per capita income for the county was $38,350. 
About 5.00% of families and 6.90% of the population were below the poverty 
line, including 8.30% of those under age 18 and 6.60% of those age 65 or 
over. As of the 2010 United States Census, there were 916,829 people, 335,545 households, 
and 232,896 families residing in the county.[27] The population density 
was 1,467.2 inhabitants per square mile (566.5/km2). There were 361,221 
housing units at an average density of 578.1 per square mile (223.2/km2).[28] 
The racial makeup of the county was 74.8% white, 10.8% black or African 
American, 4.6% Asian, 0.3% American Indian, 6.8% from other races, and 
2.6% from two or more races. Those of Hispanic or Latino origin made up 
16.9% of the population.[27] In terms of ancestry, 18.1% were Italian, 
15.9% were Irish, 9.8% were German, 8.7% were English, 5.5% were Polish, 
and 2.7% were American.[29] Of the 335,545 households, 36.4% had children

together, 12.3% had a female householder with no husband present, 30.6% 
were non-families, and 24.9% of all households were made up of individuals. 
The average household size was 2.68 and the average family size was 3.21. 
The median age was 39.5 years.[27] The median income for a household in 
the county was $81,268 and the median income for a family was $100,593. 
Males had a median income of $70,187 versus $50,038 for females. The per 
capita income for the county was $48,295. About 5.6% of families and 8.0% 
of the population were below the poverty line, including 9.4% of those 
under age 18 and 6.4% of those age 65 or over.[30] Data is from the 2010 
United States Census and the 2006-2010 American Community Survey 5-Year 
Estimates.[31][32] Data is from the 2007-2011 American Community Survey 
5-Year Estimates, ACS Demographic and Housing Estimates, "Race alone or 
in combination with one or more other races."[33] As of 1960, counties 
in Connecticut do not have any associated county government structure. 
Thus Fairfield County is only a geographical point of reference. All municipal 
services are provided by the towns, who sometimes will share certain resources 
through regionalization. In order to address issues concerning more than 
one town, several regional agencies that help coordinate the towns for 
infrastructure, land use, and economic development concerns have been established. 
Within the geographical area of Fairfield County, the regional agencies 
are: Several former county municipal buildings are used by other state 
or local agencies, including: Law enforcement within the geographic area 
of the county is provided by the respective town police departments, whereas 
in other states in the region such as New York and Vermont law enforcement 
would be provided by the local county sheriff's department. In the less 
dense areas, such as Sherman, law enforcement is primarily provided by 
the Connecticut State Police. Prior to 2000, a County Sheriff's Department 
existed for the purpose of executing judicial warrants, prisoner transport, 
court security, Bailiff, and county and state executions. These responsibilities 
have now been taken over by the Connecticut State Marshal System. Some 
municipalities in the county still maintain a sheriff's department to fill 
the void of the abolishment of the county sheriff's department, such as 
the City of Shelton which has established the Shelton Sheriff's Department 
to carry out warrants in the city. The geographic area of the county is 
served by the three separate judicial districts: Danbury, Stamford-Norwalk, 
and Fairfield. Each judicial district has a superior court located, respectively, 
in Danbury, Stamford, and Bridgeport. Each judicial district has one or 
more geographical area courts ("GA"'s), subdivisions of the judicial districts 
that handle lesser cases such as criminal misdemeanors, small claims, traffic 
violations, and other civil actions. Fire protection in the county is provided 
by the towns. Several towns also have fire districts that provide services 
to a section of the town. Education in the county is usually provided by 
the town governments. The exceptions are the towns of Redding and Easton, 
which joined together to form a regional school district (Region 9). Fairfield 
County has a low crime index of 2050.2 (per 100,000 citizens) as well as 
a murder closure rate of over 70%.[34] Several Governmental agencies, as 
well as private security contractors, have made note of Fairfield's low 
crime rates and the County currently has 6 cities and towns with a percentile 
safety index of 90% or higher compared to the rest of the continental United 
States (based on violent and property crimes).[35] In the late 1960s and 
early 1970s corporations began moving their headquarters to Fairfield County 
from Manhattan; Thomas J. Lueck of The New York Times said that the trend 
"permanently decentralized big business in the New York region." During 
the 1980s many buyouts and reorganizations and an economic recession lead 
to companies vacating much of the suburban office space in Fairfield County. 
In 1992 Fairfield County had the headquarters of over 25 major multinational 
corporations, giving it the third largest concentration of those companies 
in the United States after New York City and Chicago.[36] Recently, Fairfield 
County has been described as a "hedge fund ghetto" due to the large concentration 
of investment management firms in the area, most notably Bridgewater Associates 
(one of the world's largest hedge fund companies), Aladdin Capital Management 
and Point72 Asset Management.[citation needed] With Interstate 95 and the 
Merritt Parkway increasingly clogged with traffic, state officials are 
looking toward mass transit to ease the county's major thoroughfares' traffic 
burden. New office buildings are being concentrated near railroad stations 
in Stamford, Bridgeport and other municipalities in the county to allow 
for more rail commuting. Proximity to Stamford's Metro-North train station 
was cited by the Royal Bank of Scotland as a key reason for locating its 
new U.S. headquarters building in downtown Stamford; construction on the 
office tower started in late 2006. Within Fairfield County there are two 
regional airports: Igor I. Sikorsky Memorial Airport in Stratford and the 
Danbury Municipal Airport in Danbury. The county is also served by larger 
airports such as Bradley International Airport, John F. Kennedy International 
Airport, LaGuardia Airport, Newark Liberty International Airport, Tweed 
New Haven Regional Airport, and Westchester County Airport. Connecticut 
Transit's Stamford division runs local and inter-city buses to the southern 
part of the county.[37] The Norwalk Transit District serves the Norwalk 
area in the southern central portion of the county; the Greater Bridgeport 
Transit Authority serves Bridgeport and eastern Fairfield County; and the 
Housatonic Area Regional Transit agency serves Danbury and the northern 
portions of the county. The Bridgeport & Port Jefferson Ferry carries passengers 
and cars from Bridgeport to Port Jefferson, New York across Long Island 
Sound. Ferry lines in and out of Stamford are also in development. Commuter 
Rail is perhaps Fairfield County's most important transportation artery, 
as it allows its residents an efficient ride to Grand Central Terminal 
in New York City. Service is provided on Metro-North's New Haven Line, 
and every town on the shoreline has at least one station. Connecting lines 
bring service to New Canaan from Stamford on the New Canaan Branch, and 
to Danbury from South Norwalk on the Danbury Branch. Many trains run express 
from New York to Stamford, making it an easy 45-minute ride. In the 2005 
and 2006 sessions of the Legislature, massive appropriations were made 
to buy replacements for the 343 rail cars for the Metro-North New Haven 
Line and branch lines. The approximately 30-year-old cars will be replaced 
with new cars at a rate of ten per month starting in 2010.[38] Bridgeport 
and Stamford are also served by Amtrak, and both cities see a significant 
number of boardings on the "Regional Northeast Route" (Boston to Newport 
News, VA). This route also serves other Amtrak stations in Connecticut, 
including New Haven, New London, and Mystic. U.S. 1 is the oldest east-west 
route in the county, running through all of its shoreline cities and towns. 
Known by various names along its length, most commonly "Boston Post Road" 
or simply "Post Road", it gradually gains latitude from west to east. Thus 
U.S. 1 west is officially designated "South" and east is "North". Though 
contiguous, U.S.1 changes name by locality. In Greenwich it is Putnam Avenue. 
In Stamford it becomes Main Street or Tresser Boulevard. In Darien it is 
Boston Post Road or "the Post Road". In Norwalk it is Connecticut Avenue 
in the west, Van Zant St, Cross St, and North Av in the center, and Westport 
Avenue in the east. In Westport, it is Post Road West from the Norwalk 
town line until the Saugatuck River and then it becomes Post Road East 
until Fairfield. In Fairfield it is again Boston Post Road or "the Post 
Road". In Bridgeport it follows Kings Highway in the west, North Avenue 
in the center, and Boston Avenue in the east. Finally, it becomes Barnum 
Avenue in Stratford. The western portions of Interstate 95 in Connecticut 
are known as the Connecticut Turnpike or the Governor John Davis Lodge 
Turnpike in Fairfield County and it crosses the state approximately parallel 
to U.S. Route 1. The road is most commonly referred to as "I-95". The highway 
is six lanes (sometimes eight lanes) throughout the county. It was completed 
in 1958 and is often clogged with traffic particularly during morning and 
evening rush hours. With the cost of land so high along the Gold Coast, 
state lawmakers say they don't consider widening the highway to be fiscally 
feasible, although occasional stretches between entrances and nearby exits 
are now sometimes connected with a fourth "operational improvement" lane 
(for instance, westbound between the Exit 10 interchange in Darien and 
Exit 8 in Stamford). Expect similar added lanes in Darien and elsewhere 
in the Fairfield County portion of the highway in the future, lawmakers 
and state Department of Transportation officials say.[citation needed] 
The Merritt Parkway, also known as "The Merritt" or Connecticut Route 15, 
is a truck-free scenic parkway that runs through the county parallel and 
generally several miles north of Interstate 95. It begins at the New York 
state line where it is the Hutchinson River Parkway and terminates on the 
Igor I. Sikorsky Memorial Bridge where it becomes the Wilbur Cross Parkway 
at the New Haven county line. The interchange between the Merritt Parkway 
and Route 7 in Norwalk was completed around the year 2000. The project 
was held up in a lawsuit won by preservationists concerned about the historic 
Merritt Parkway bridges. It is now exit 39 off the Merritt, and exit 15 
off I-95. The parkway is a National Scenic Byway and is listed on the National 
Register of Historic Places.[39] Interstate 84, which runs through Danbury, 
is scheduled to be widened to a six-lane highway at all points between 
Danbury and Waterbury. State officials say they hope the widening will 
not only benefit drivers regularly on the route but also entice some cars 
from the more crowded Interstate 95, which is roughly parallel to it. Heavier 
trucks are unlikely to use Interstate 84 more often, however, because the 
route is much hillier than I-95 according to a state Department of Transportation 
official. With its southern terminus at Interstate 95 in central Norwalk, 
U.S. Route 7 heads north through Wilton, Ridgefield, and Danbury to points 
north. In Danbury and almost all of Norwalk, the route is a highway (known 
as "Super 7" in the Danbury area or "The Connector" in Norwalk) but it 
becomes a four-lane road just south of the Wilton-Norwalk border and up 
to Danbury. There is significant opposition to making the route a limited 
access highway for the entire length by residents of Wilton and Ridgefield. 
As a compromise between freeway supporters and opponents, the Connecticut 
Department of Transportation is upgrading the existing 2-lane section to 
4 lanes, with a median in some locations. The state has also bypassed the 
original 2-lane Route 7 around Brookfield with a freeway, where town officials 
have long supported an expressway to divert traffic away from the town 
center. Route 8 terminates in downtown Bridgeport from I-95 with Connecticut 
Route 25 and goes north. It splits from Connecticut Route 25 at the Bridgeport—Trumbull 
town line and continues north into southeastern Trumbull and Shelton, then 
beyond the county through some of towns of the Naugatuck River Valley to 
Waterbury and beyond. Construction of the route provided some impetus for 
the creation of office parks in Shelton and home construction there and 
in other parts of The Valley. Route 25 Starts in downtown Bridgeport from 
I 95 with Route 8 and goes north. It splits from Connecticut Route 8 at 
the Bridgeport—Trumbull town line and continues into Trumbull. The limited 
access divided expressway ends in northern Trumbull, but Route 25 continues 
into Monroe, Newtown, and Brookfield Three minor league teams call Fairfield 
County their home: the Danbury Whalers (Federal Hockey League) [until early 
2015],[40] the Class A affiliate of the Elmira Jackals; the Bridgeport 
Bluefish in baseball's independent Atlantic League; and the Bridgeport 
Sound Tigers, who are the New York Islanders' American Hockey League affiliate.
