Joseph Matthew Blanton (born December 11, 1980) is an American professional 
pitcher who is a free agent. He has played in Major League Baseball (MLB) 
for the Oakland Athletics, Philadelphia Phillies, Los Angeles Angels of 
Anaheim, Kansas City Royals, Pittsburgh Pirates and Los Angeles Dodgers. 
After playing college baseball for the University of Kentucky, Blanton 
was drafted by the Athletics. While pitching for the Phillies in the 2008 
World Series, Blanton hit a home run. Joe Blanton was born in Nashville, 
Tennessee, but grew up in Chalybeate, Kentucky.[1] He graduated from Franklin-Simpson 
High School (Kentucky) in 1999. He pitched three seasons for the University 
of Kentucky, with a 13–12 record from 2000 to 2002, and led the Southeastern 
Conference with 133 strikeouts in his final season, finishing with a 4.59 
ERA.[2] Blanton was selected by the Oakland Athletics in the first round 
(24th overall) of the 2002 Major League Baseball draft,[3] This draft was 
chronicled by Michael Lewis in his book Moneyball: The Art of Winning an 
Unfair Game. In 2003, while pitching for the Kane County Cougars and the 
Midland RockHounds,[4] Blanton ranked second in all of minor league baseball 
with a combined 174 strikeouts. The next season, he helped the Triple-A 
Sacramento River Cats win the Pacific Coast League Championship with an 
11–8 record and a 4.19 ERA. He struck out 143 batters in 176 innings, tossing 
one complete game in 26 starts.[4] Joe Blanton made his debut on September 
21, 2004, against the Texas Rangers. He made three appearances and pitched 
eight innings. He posted a 5.63 ERA, but did not get a decision in any 
of his games. In 2005, Blanton joined the starting rotation that had lost 
pitchers Mark Mulder and Tim Hudson to trades.[5] He made his first start 
on April 8 against the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, pitching five innings and 
allowing two runs. After losing his first five decisions, he picked up 
his first win when he worked seven innings against the Toronto Blue Jays 
on June 4. Blanton was third on the team in innings pitched, but still 
exceeded 200 innings in his first full season.[6] He posted a 12–12 record 
with a 3.53 ERA in 33 starts, and his 33 starts set an Oakland rookie record 
for most games started which had broken the previous mark of 32 set by 
Matt Keough in 1978. His ERA was best among all rookies with 100 or more 
innings pitched.[7] He also tied the Oakland rookie record for most wins 
in a season with 12.[7] His first career complete game came as a 1–0 loss 
to the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim on April 24, 2005;[8] he was the only 
rookie to post two complete games in 2005.[7] Blanton's high loss total 
was attributed to poor run support, as the A's only posted six runs total 
in all twelve of his losses combined, while posting 62 runs in his 12 wins.[7] 
Blanton was also named the American League Rookie of the Month for June, 
as he tied with teammate Dan Haren for the AL lead in wins and finished 
third in ERA in June.[7] In 2006, Blanton's ERA rose over a full point 
to 4.82 and gave up the fifth highest number of hits in the American League 
(241),[9] resulting in a .309 batting average against. However, he had 
four more wins than the previous year, posting a 16–12 record, striking 
out 107 batters and walking 58.[10] He pitched his first career complete 
game shutout against the Kansas City Royals on May 31.[9] Blanton did not 
pitch in the ALDS for the Athletics, but was named to the roster for the 
ALCS, where he pitched two innings in one appearance, allowing no hits 
or runs.[11] Blanton had a 14–10 record in 230 innings pitched in 2007. 
He struck out 140 batters, walked 40, and gave up 101 earned runs, resulting 
in a 3.95 ERA for the year.[12] Though Blanton's road and home records 
were the same (7–5), his home ERA was 2.69 compared with 5.11 on the road.[13] 
He also pitched three complete games in 2007, but his first one of the 
season was his third career complete-game loss, on April 25.[13] Blanton 
made his 100th career appearance at the end of the season, a 7–3 win against 
the Texas Rangers on September 15.[13] The A's traded Blanton, who had 
a 5–12 record and a 4.96 ERA to the Philadelphia Phillies for second baseman 
Adrian Cardenas, pitcher Josh Outman, and outfielder Matthew Spencer on 
July 17, 2008.[14] In Blanton's first start for the Phillies, he pitched 
six innings and allowed five runs; however, he did not factor in the decision 
as the Phillies scored six runs off the Mets' bullpen in the ninth inning 
to win.[15] On August 2, Blanton recorded his first win as a Phillie against 
the St. Louis Cardinals by a score of 2–1 in his third Phillies start. 
For the season, 51% of his strikeouts were "looking", the highest percentage 
in the majors.[16] In Game 4 of the 2008 World Series, Blanton hit his 
first major league home run to become the 13th pitcher overall and first 
since Ken Holtzman in 1974 to hit a home run in a World Series game. He 
was also credited with the win in the Phillies' Game 4 victory over the 
Tampa Bay Rays. On January 21, 2010, the Phillies announced Joe Blanton 
agreed to a three-year extension worth $24 million.[17] On August 3, 2012, 
Blanton was traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers for a player to be named 
later (minor league prospect Ryan O'Sullivan). He started 10 games for 
the Dodgers and was 2–4 with a 4.99 ERA. On December 5, 2012, Blanton signed 
a two-year deal worth $15 million with the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim[18] 
The contract became official on December 12, 2012.[19] Blanton would go 
on to finish the 2013 season with a disappointing 2–14 record and a 6.04 
ERA.[20] Most of his struggles were attributed to the home run ball, giving 
up 29 in 132.2 innings. On March 26, 2014, Blanton was granted his unconditional 
release from the Angels.[21] On March 31, 2014, the Oakland Athletics signed 
Blanton to a minor league deal and sent him to the Triple-A Sacramento 
River Cats.[22] He made two starts in the minors and then on April 13, 
2014, Blanton announced his retirement from baseball.[23][24] After working 
out in the offseason with Gallatin, Tennessee, neighbor and fellow pitcher 
Zach Duke,[25][26] Blanton announced that he would attempt a comeback for 
the 2015 season.[27] He pitched in a pro day at Volunteer State Community 
College in Gallatin to demonstrate his pitching for potential major league 
clubs.[26] On February 13, 2015, Blanton signed a minor league contract 
with the Kansas City Royals.[28] Blanton would earn $1 million at the major 
league level with up to $3 million in incentives. The contract contained 
an invitation to spring training, and two opt-out clauses on April 1 and 
May 15.[29] Blanton pitched on May 16 against the Yankees, pitching four 
innings of relief with one earned run in a 5–1 loss. On July 28, Blanton 
was designated for assignment to make room for Johnny Cueto. Despite the 
fact that he was traded before the Royals' World Series run that year, 
he still received a World Series ring, his second in his career.[30] On 
July 29, 2015, Blanton was traded to the Pittsburgh Pirates for cash considerations.[31] 
With the Pirates, Blanton appeared in 21 games, going 5–0 with a 1.57 ERA. 
He struck out 39 batters in 34 1⁄3 innings pitched. On January 19, 2016, 
Blanton signed a one-year, $4 million contract to return to the Dodgers.[32] 
He became the Dodgers primary setup man, appearing in 75 games with a 7–2 
record and a 2.48 ERA in 80 innings.[33] He pitched five scoreless innings 
in the 2016 National League Division Series against the Washington Nationals[34] 
but struggled in the 2016 National League Championship Series against the 
Chicago Cubs, allowing seven earned runs in only three innings of work 
to be credited with the loss in two games.[35] Blanton throws a low-90's 
fastball, along with a 12–6 curveball, a slider, and a straight changeup.[36] 
His curveball is his best secondary pitch, drawing comparisons to former
