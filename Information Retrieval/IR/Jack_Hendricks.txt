As Player As Manager John Charles Hendricks (April 9, 1875 – May 13, 1943) 
was an American professional baseball player and manager. He played parts 
of two seasons in Major League Baseball as an outfielder, but is best known 
as the manager of the Cincinnati Reds from 1924 to 1929. Hendricks' brief 
playing career consisted of half a game with the New York Giants and two 
with the Chicago Orphans in 1902, and 32 games with the Washington Senators 
in 1903 following the death of Ed Delahanty. After retiring as a player, 
he started managing in the minor leagues, eventually getting his major 
league opportunity when Miller Huggins was fired by the St. Louis Cardinals 
after the 1917 season. After a 51–78 record and a last-place finish, Hendricks 
quit. In the 1924 season, the Reds had reported to spring training in Orlando, 
Florida when their manager Pat Moran died of Bright's disease. Hendricks, 
who had resigned his post as athletic director of the Knights of Columbus 
to become a Reds coach that year, took over the club. His best finish as 
manager was second place in the 1926 season, behind his former team, the 
Cardinals. He was fired in 1929 after a seventh-place finish. His overall 
managerial record was 520–528 (.496). Hendricks was one of only seven major 
league managers to hold a law degree or pass a state bar. The others are 
Huggins, Branch Rickey (his successor in St. Louis), John Montgomery Ward, 
Hughie Jennings, Muddy Ruel, and Tony La Russa. Hendricks died in Chicago
