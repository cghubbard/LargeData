The Hofstra Pride (formerly the Hofstra Flying Dutchmen until 2015) are 
composed of 17 teams representing Hofstra University in intercollegiate 
athletics, including men and women's basketball, cross country, golf, lacrosse, 
soccer, and tennis. Men's sports include baseball and wrestling. Women's 
sports include volleyball, field hockey, and softball. The Pride compete 
in the NCAA Division I and have been members of the Colonial Athletic Association 
in most sports since 2001.[2] They were previously members of the American 
East Conference. The men's basketball team experienced its most successful 
period in 2000 and 2001, winning back-to-back America East Men's Basketball 
Tournament titles and making their first appearances in the Division I 
championship for the first time since the 1970s. The Hofstra University 
Pride Wrestling team competes in the Eastern Intercollegiate Wrestling 
Association in the NCAA Division I Wrestling Championships. Dennis Papadatos, 
who became the 12th Head Wrestling Coach in Hofstra history on April 4, 
2014, is in his 1st season as the head wrestling coach of the Pride in 
2014-15.[3] The Pride wrestling team competes on campus in the Mack Sports 
Complex. Former Pride wrestler Chris Weidman was a 2-time NCAA Division 
I All-American (6th in 2006 & 3rd in 2007, both at 197Â lb) and is now the 
current UFC Middleweight Champion. Hofstra's wrestling team was formerly 
a member of the CAA like all other Pride teams until the CAA ended sponsorship 
of wrestling in 2013. The school fielded a football team from 1937 to 2009, 
when the sport was cancelled due to costs and declining attendance.[4] 
The team was an associate member of the Atlantic 10 Conference from 2001 
until 2009. Two of Bill Cosby's early comedy albums include routines about 
a game between the now-defunct Hofstra football team and Temple University.[5] 
The routines are "TV Football" (from I Started Out as a Child) and its 
expanded re-telling "Hofstra" (from Why Is There Air?). An entire episode 
of Everybody Loves Raymond was devoted to a main character, Frank Barone, 
catching a record-setting field-goal ball kicked by a Hofstra player at 
a game Ray Barone predicted to be a "tickle fight." Hofstra Athletics have 
been commended for its performance the 2014-2015 year.[citation needed]
