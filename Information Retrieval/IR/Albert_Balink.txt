Albert Balink (3 August 1906 – 8 February 1976) was a Dutch-Indonesian 
journalist and filmmaker who made important contributions to the Indonesian 
cinema in the 1930s. Born in the Netherlands, he made his start in the 
Dutch East Indies as a journalist writing extensively on film. Having learned 
filmmaking from books, in the mid-1930s he released a documentary and two 
feature films. In 1938 he immigrated to the United States and married, 
founding and becoming the editor of The Knickerbocker. His two feature 
films, Pareh (1936) and Terang Boelan (1937), have been considered the 
most important films from the Dutch East Indies of the 1930s. Balink, of 
Dutch-Indonesian descent, was born on 3 August 1906 in 's-Hertogenbosch, 
Netherlands.[1][2][3] In the 1920s and early 1930s Balink was a reporter 
with De Locomotief, a newspaper based in Semarang,[4] as well as the Soematra 
Post based out of Medan.[5] Among his main interests as a journalist while 
with these papers was film.[4] With the Wong brothers, Balink started the 
Java Pacific Film production company in 1934, in what was then the Dutch 
East Indies. At the time Balink was inexperienced with film, having only 
book knowledge.[6] Java Pacific Film, which was headquartered in an old 
tapioca flour factory, first produced the documentary film De Merapi Dreigt 
(Mount Merapi Looms), in 1934. Advertised as the first documentary film 
with sound in the Dutch East Indies, it was a critical success.[7] However, 
Balink's main interest was in feature films. All feature films released 
in the Dutch East Indies between 1934 and 1935 had been directed by The 
Teng Chun, based on Chinese mythology or martial arts, and targeted at 
low-class audiences, generally ethnic Chinese. Balink intended to reach 
an upper-class audience.[8] The studio, working with Mannus Franken, then 
produced Pareh (Rice; 1936), an ethnographic film considered a forerunner 
for the "Indonesia Indah" films.[9][10] Balink had brought Franken to the 
country to ensure its artistic quality and worked to secure funding from 
various sponsors; he also spent more than a year scouring the country to 
cast the film, as he had already decided what the characters would be like. 
However, the film, which had cost 75,000 gulden to produce, was a flop 
and bankrupted the company, including Balink, despite being well received 
in the Netherlands.[2][11][4] Balink then found financial backing to establish 
the Dutch Indies Film Syndicate (Algemeen Nederlandsch Indisch Filmsyndicaat, 
or ANIF), which produced its first newsreel on 22 December 1936; this reel 
showed the Gambir Market, festivities at the governor-general's palace, 
and the inauguration of Tjarda van Starkenborgh Stachouwer.[7] In 1937, 
Balink directed Terang Boelan (Full Moon), "often described as the first 
full-length Indonesian film in Malay".[12] The story, following a young 
couple who have not received their parents' blessings, was written by the 
reporter Saeroen.[13] Terang Boelan proved to be the most commercially 
successful local production until 1953's Krisis (Crisis), released after 
Indonesia had become independent.[14] However, the studio's backers disapproved 
of Balink's interest in feature films, leading to him leaving the Indies 
to unsuccessfully try to become a Hollywood director.[15] In 1991 the American 
visual anthropologist Karl G. Heider wrote that Pareh and Terang Boelan 
were the two most important cinematic works from the Dutch East Indies 
during the 1930s.[16] In March 1938[17] Balink immigrated to the United 
States, became a citizen, and worked as a correspondent for de Volkskrant.[18][19] 
The 1940 United States Census indicates him living in Queens, New York, 
with his wife Lydia, a woman from New Jersey 12 years his junior; Lydia 
worked with him as a secretary.[20] In 1948, he published a socioeconomic 
study of the Caribbean, My Paradise is Hell.[21] In the 1950s he was editor 
of the magazine The Knickerbocker, a publication for Dutch Americans which 
he had established. With the magazine he helped the baseball player Han 
Urbanus train with the New York Giants and chaired the William the Silent 
Award Committee.[22][23][24] In early 1953 he served as executive of Holland 
Flood Relief Inc., which helped coordinate relief efforts during the North 
Sea flood of 1953.[25] He was also an active amateur tennis player.[26]
