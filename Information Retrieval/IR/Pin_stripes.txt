Pinstripes are a pattern of very thin stripes of any color running in parallel 
often found in cloth. The pinstriped suit has become associated with conservative 
business attire, although many designers now produce the fashionable pinstripe 
patterns for fashion-conscious consumers[citation needed]. Although found 
mostly in men's suits, any type of fabric can be pinstriped. The Chicago 
Cubs' baseball uniforms have had pinstripes since 1907 and they are recognized 
as the first Major League Baseball team to incorporate pinstriping into 
a baseball uniform.[1] Many other former and current Major League Baseball 
teams — including the Minnesota Twins, Montreal Expos, Colorado Rockies, 
New York Mets, New York Yankees, Chicago White Sox, and Philadelphia Phillies 
— later adopted pinstripes on their own uniforms. This was later carried 
over into the NBA, with teams like the Chicago Bulls, Charlotte Hornets
