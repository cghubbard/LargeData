José Canseco Capas Jr. (born July 2, 1964),[1] is a Cuban-American former 
Major League Baseball (MLB) outfielder, and designated hitter. Canseco 
has admitted using performance-enhancing drugs during his playing career, 
and in 2005 wrote a tell-all book, Juiced: Wild Times, Rampant 'Roids, 
Smash Hits & How Baseball Got Big, in which he claimed that the vast majority 
of MLB players use steroids. After retiring from Major League Baseball, 
he also competed in boxing and mixed martial arts. Canseco is the identical 
twin brother of former major league player Ozzie Canseco. Canseco was born 
in Havana, Cuba, the son of Jose Sr. and Barbara Canseco. He has a twin 
brother, Ozzie. When Fidel Castro came into power in 1959, Jose Sr., a 
territory manager for the oil and gasoline corporation Esso as well as 
a part-time English teacher, lost his job and eventually his home. The 
family was allowed to leave Cuba in 1965, when the twins were barely 1 
year old, and settled in the Miami area, where Jose Sr. became a territory 
manager for another oil and gasoline concern, Amoco, and a part-time security 
guard. The younger Jose Canseco played baseball at Miami Coral Park High 
School, where he failed to make the varsity team until his senior year. 
He was named Most Valuable Player of the junior varsity team in his junior 
year, and of the varsity team the following year. He graduated in 1982 
and was drafted by the Oakland Athletics.[1] The Oakland Athletics drafted 
Canseco in the 15th round of the 1982 Major League Baseball draft. He played 
minor league baseball with the Medford A's, Madison Muskies, Idaho Falls 
A's, and the Modesto A's. Canseco started the 1985 season with the Class-AA 
Huntsville Stars and became known as "Parkway Jose"[2] for his long home 
runs (25 in half a season) that went close to the Memorial Parkway behind 
Joe Davis Stadium. In 1985, Canseco won the Baseball America Minor League 
Player of the Year Award, and was a late season call-up for the Oakland 
Athletics. He made his Major League debut on September 2 and struck out 
in his one at-bat against the Baltimore Orioles. His first hit was off 
Ron Guidry of the New York Yankees on September 7.[3] and his first home 
run was off Jeff Russell of the Texas Rangers on September 9.[4] He played 
in 29 games in the major leagues in 1985. He established himself in 1986, 
his first full season, being named the American League's Rookie of the 
Year (the first by an Athletic since Harry Byrd in 1952 with what were 
then the Philadelphia Athletics), with 33 home runs and 117 RBIs. In 1987, 
Mark McGwire joined Canseco on the Athletics; McGwire hit 49 home runs 
that year and was also named the American League Rookie of the Year. Together, 
he and Canseco formed a fearsome offensive tandem, known as the "Bash Brothers". 
In April 1988, Canseco guaranteed he would hit at least 40 home runs and 
steal at least 40 bases in the upcoming season.[5] He went on to record 
42 home runs and 40 steals becoming the first player in MLB history to 
hit the 40-40 mark in a single season (a fact unknown to him at that time). 
In recognition of his record the street in front of his former high school 
was named after him but was later rescinded in 2008 after he admitted to 
previously using drugs throughout his career.[6][7] That same year, he 
helped the Athletics sweep the Boston Red Sox in 4 games in the ALCS, for 
the series Canseco had a .313 batting average with 3 home runs in 4 games. 
The A's then met the Los Angeles Dodgers in the World Series, a matchup 
that would feature the best hitter in the AL facing the best pitcher and 
eventual NL Cy Young Award winner in Orel Hershiser, the Dodgers would 
prevail, upsetting the A's in five games. Canseco hit a grand slam in Game 
1 in his first official World Series at bat, but it would be his only hit 
in the Series. He was unanimously named the American League's Most Valuable 
Player in 1988, with a .307 batting average, 120 runs scored, 124 RBIs, 
42 home runs, and 40 stolen bases. In 1989, Canseco missed 97 games of 
the regular season with a broken wrist, despite not playing a single game 
in the first half he was voted as a starting outfielder for the American 
League All Star team and still managed to hit 17 home runs with 57 RBIs 
in barely 65 games played (a rate equivalent to 40+ home runs and 130+ 
RBIs had he played a full season) as the Athletics won the AL West and 
their first World Series since 1974, beating the San Francisco Giants in 
four games. Canseco had a solid postseason hitting for a .323 batting average 
and 2 home runs including one in the ALCS against the Blue Jays that reached 
the upper deck of the Sky Dome. Against the Giants in the World Series 
he hit for a .357 average with a home run in game 3. The 1989 Series was 
interrupted before Game 3 by a major earthquake in the San Francisco Bay 
Area. Canseco came back to form in 1990, and was selected to the all star 
game with the most votes in the Junior Circuit. During the regular season 
he hit 37 home runs despite being hampered in the latter part of the year 
by what would become a recurring back problem. During this season he was 
given a then-record 5-year/23.5 million dollar contract making him the 
highest paid player in MLB history at the time. The A's returned to the 
World Series once again, but were swept by the Cincinnati Reds in four 
games. Canseco continued to be productive the following year, by the All 
Star break of the '91 season he had 21 home runs and 63 RBIs but inexplicably 
did not received All Star Game considerations by either the fans or as 
a back up, as his own A's skipper Tony LaRussa, managing the AL for the 
3rd stright year, went instead with Athletics outfielder Dave Henderson, 
who had lesser offensive numbers than Jose, leading many to believe that 
the relationship between Canseco and LaRussa had started to deteriorate. 
He finished the 1991 season with 44 home runs and captured the second home 
run crown of his career (tied with Detroit's Cecil Fielder) while finishing 
4th in the MVP ballot, the Athletics however missed the playoffs for the 
first time in three years, finishing 4th in the AL West. The Athletics 
returned to contention in 1992 and with 18 home runs by the All Star break, 
Canseco was voted to start his 4th Mid Summer Classic in 5 years but he 
was un able to play due to injury. From 1986 to 1992 with the A's and despite 
missing roughly 120 games between 1989 and 1990 and about 20 more during 
the first half of the 1992 season, Canseco averaged 32 home runs a year, 
had 100+ RBIs 5 times, captured AL Rookie of the Year honors, 2 home run 
titles, an MVP award, 3 Silver Slugger Awards, 3 American League Pennants, 
a World Series ring, 8 post season home runs and was selected to 5 All 
Star Games in his first 7 full Major League seasons. On August 31, 1992, 
in the middle of a game and while he was in the on-deck circle, the A's 
traded Canseco to the Texas Rangers for Rubén Sierra, Jeff Russell, and 
Bobby Witt. On May 26, 1993, during a game against the Cleveland Indians, 
Carlos Martínez hit a fly ball that Canseco lost sight of as he was crossing 
the warning track. The ball hit him in the head and bounced over the wall 
for a home run.[8] The cap[8][9][10] Canseco was wearing on that play, 
which This Week in Baseball rated in 1998 as the greatest blooper of the 
show's first 21 years, is in the Seth Swirsky collection. After the incident, 
the Harrisburg Heat offered him a soccer contract.[11] Three days later, 
Canseco asked his manager, Kevin Kennedy, to let him pitch the eighth inning 
of a runaway loss to the Boston Red Sox; he injured his arm, underwent 
Tommy John surgery, and was lost for the remainder of the season.[12] In 
his pitching appearance, Canseco allowed three earned runs on two hits 
and three walks, throwing 33 pitches, but only 12 for strikes.[13] In the 
1994 strike shortened season, Canseco again returned to his former status 
of power hitter with 31 home runs and 90 RBIs in 111 games. Canseco also 
stole 15 bases and posted a .282 batting average. He was named comeback 
player of the year in 1994, and finished in eleventh place in the American 
League Most Valuable Player voting. After playing with the Rangers from 
1992 to 1994, Canseco moved on to play with the Boston Red Sox in 1995 
along with (former MVP) Roger Clemens and (eventual '95 MVP) Mo Vaughn. 
The Red Sox captured the AL East Division title to advance to the ALDS 
making it Canseco's first post season in 5 years, for the regular season 
he hit 24 home runs with a .306 batting average, his highest since '88. 
His last home run of the '95 season against Jesse Orosco was Canseco's 
300th for his career. In 1996 Canseco had a great first half hitting 26 
home runs by the all star break but he was sidelined during August and 
part of September due to a back injury. He finished the season with 28 
homers in 96 games. In January 1997, he was traded to the Oakland Athletics, 
reuniting him with Bash Brother Mark McGwire. Health-wise, Canseco had 
a promising start to the season, playing in 83 games in the first half 
of the season with 18 home runs by the All-Star break, but his season was 
again cut short due to injury. His 23 home runs of the season gave him 
a total of 254 in an A's uniform, good for 4th in franchise history. McGwire, 
who was traded to St. Louis that same season, is the all-time leader for 
the Athletics with 363. After signing a one-year/2 million dollar contract, 
Canseco had a productive season again with the Toronto Blue Jays in 1998 
playing alongside former Red Sox teammate Roger Clemens. For the first 
time in his career he wore other than his traditional #33, switching to 
#44 for the first part of the season (long-time Blue Jay and World Series 
hero Ed Sprague wore #33 for the Jays until he was traded later in the 
'98 season). He finished the season playing 151 games, his highest in 7 
years. Splitting duties as DH and in the outfield, he hit a career-high 
46 home runs, 3rd best in the AL, and stole 29 bases, the most he had stolen 
since the 40 he stole in 1988. He also lead the league in strikeouts with 
159. He won the AL Silver Slugger award (4th of his career) but his comeback 
was missed by most fans because of the home run race in the National League 
between Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa. Despite maintaining regularity with 
the Blue Jays and hitting a career-high 46 Home Runs in 1998, Canseco drew 
minimal attention in the free agent market. In 1999 he went to the Tampa 
Bay Devil Rays, signing a 3-year deal to finish his career in his hometown 
state, the contract included a clause stating that if Canseco were to be 
elected to the Hall of Fame he would be depicted as a meber of the Devil 
Rays. That year he took the American League by storm, hitting 10 home runs 
in April, and a total of 31 by the All-Star break (including number 400 
for his career against Toronto's Kelvim Escobar). On pace for 60+ homers 
for the season, he was voted to the AL All-Star team as the DH, making 
his first All Star selection in 7 years. However, he injured his back days 
before the mid-summer classic and missed the game, as well as the Home 
Run Derby in Fenway Park where he planned to participate along with former 
Bash Brother Mark McGwire. He would come back for the final part of the 
year, finishing with 34 home runs for the 1999 season. He began the 2000 
season with the Devil Rays, hitting only 9 home runs in 61 games, and, 
by August, was claimed off waivers by the New York Yankees, which caught 
many, including Yankees manager Joe Torre off guard, as the Yankees had 
four other players who fulfilled a similar role to Canseco.[14] Yankees 
General Manager Brian Cashman made the claim to prevent the Athletics, 
Red Sox and Blue Jays, who were in a close race with the Yankees, from 
acquiring Canseco.[15] In a lesser roll, splitting duties as Outfielder, 
DH and Pinch Hitter, Canseco played in 37 games hitting .243 with 6 Home 
Runs. He struck out in his only plate appearance in the 2000 World Series 
against the New York Mets but earned his second World Series ring when 
they defeated the Mets in five games. Despite this achievement Canseco 
later called his Yankees tenure "the worst time of [his] life" due to receiving 
limited playing time. His short stint with the Yankees represented the 
third time he was Roger Clemens' teammate, a fact later magnified by the 
media due to the steriod controversy, the Mitchell Report and the infamous 
pool party at Canseco's house two years prior while both played with the 
Blue Jays.[15] Canseco played with the Chicago White Sox in 2001, his 6th 
club in as many years, after being cut by the Anaheim Angels in spring 
training and spending half of the season with the Newark Bears of the independent 
Atlantic League As the White Sox DH he finished the season with 16 home 
runs and 49 RBI in 76 games, including the last multi-home run game of 
his career against the Kansas City Royals on August 1. His 462nd and last 
career home run came against Mike Mussina of the New York Yankees. In 2002, 
Canseco was signed by the (Major League Baseball-ran) Montreal Expos, he 
was expected to be their left fielder and DH during inter-league play, 
in what would have been Canseco' first time playing for a National League 
team, however, he was released prior to the regular season. Canseco officially 
retired from Major League Baseball in May 2002 after spending some time 
playing for the White Sox Triple-A affiliate Charlotte Knights. He made 
a brief comeback attempt in 2004, but was not offered a spot with the Los 
Angeles Dodgers after a spring fling. As of 2016 his 462 career home runs 
rank him 35th on the MLB all-time list. Canseco was at one time the all-time 
leader in home runs among Latino players; he was later surpassed by Manny 
Ramirez, Albert Pujols, David Ortiz, Carlos Delgado, Rafael Palmeiro, Alex 
Rodriguez, and Sammy Sosa. He was the first player to hit 30 home runs 
for 4 different clubs; Oakland 33 in '86, Texas 31 in '94, Toronto 46 in 
'98 and Tampa Bay 34 in '99 (this feat was later surpassed by Fred McGriff 
and Gary Sheffield who did it for 5 different teams). Canseco was distinguished 
four times with the Silver Slugger award: three times as an AL outfielder 
in 1988, 1990, and 1991, and once as a Designated Hitter in 1998. He ranks 
4th all time in A's history with 254 home runs and he's one of 11 players 
in MLB history with 400 home runs and 200 stolen bases. Despite his many 
injuries during the later part of his career Canseco averaged 40 home runs 
and 121 RBIs per every 162 games. On June 29, 2006, the independent Golden 
Baseball League announced Canseco had agreed to a one-year contract to 
play with the San Diego Surf Dawgs. The League said Canseco had agreed 
to be subjected to its drug-testing policy "that immediately expels any 
players found using steroids or illegal drugs."[16] After playing one game 
for the Surf Dawgs, Canseco was traded to the Long Beach Armada on July 
5, 2006. He requested the trade due to "family obligations."[17] On July 
31, 2006, Canseco won the Golden Baseball League's Home Run Derby.[18] 
Canseco signed a short team deal with the Laredo Broncos of the United 
Baseball League on August 14, 2010. He served as bench coach and designated 
hitter.[19] On April 11, 2011, Canseco signed a deal as a player/manager 
for the Yuma Scorpions of the North American League.[19] Canseco joined 
the Quintana Roo Tigres of the Mexican League in 2012, but was reportedly 
banned for using testosterone.[20] On April 20, 2012, the Worcester Tornadoes, 
of the Canadian American Association of Professional Baseball, announced 
that they had signed Canseco to a one-season contract[21] for a salary 
of one thousand dollars a month.[22] In the beginning of August 2012, Canseco 
left the Tornadoes due to concerns of not receiving his salary, a conflict 
which led him to sue the team.[23] Canseco quickly signed with the Rio 
Grande Valley WhiteWings of the North American League. However, his debut 
was delayed due to a family emergency.[24] In early 2013 Canseco played 
in the Texas Winter League but was only 3 for 16 at the plate.[25] He signed 
with the Fort Worth Cats of the United League to start the 2013 season.[26] 
In March 2011, Canseco played a few games with the Valley Rays in the Pacific 
Coast Baseball League in Los Angeles. In May 2016, Canseco made an appearance 
for the SoCal Glory in the 35+ MSBL Las Vegas Open – National Tournament. 
In 2005, Canseco admitted to using anabolic steroids with Jorge Delgado, 
Damaso Moreno and Manuel Collado in a tell-all book, Juiced: Wild Times, 
Rampant 'Roids, Smash Hits & How Baseball Got Big. Canseco also claimed 
that up to 85% of major league players took steroids, a figure disputed 
by many in the game. In the book, Canseco specifically identified former 
teammates Mark McGwire, Rafael Palmeiro, Jason Giambi, Iván Rodríguez and 
Juan González as fellow steroid users, and admitted that he injected them.[27] 
Most of the players named in the book initially denied steroid use, though 
Giambi admitted to steroid use in testimony before a grand jury investigating 
the BALCO case and on January 11, 2010, McGwire admitted publicly to using 
steroids. At a Congressional hearing on the subject of steroids in sports, 
Palmeiro categorically denied using performance-enhancing drugs, while 
McGwire repeatedly and somewhat conspicuously refused to answer questions 
on his own suspected use, saying he "didn't want to talk about the past." 
Canseco's book became a New York Times bestseller. On August 1, 2005, Palmeiro 
was suspended for 10 days by Major League Baseball after testing positive 
for steroids. On December 13, 2007, José Canseco and Jorge Delgado were 
cited in the Mitchell Report (The Report to the Commissioner of Baseball 
of an Independent Investigation into the Illegal Use of Steroids and Other 
Performance Enhancing Substances by Players in Major League Baseball).[28] 
On December 20, 2007, Canseco was also named in Jason Grimsley's unsealed 
affidavit as a user of steroids. Canseco and Grimsley were teammates on 
the 2000 New York Yankees.[29] On December 30, 2007, it was announced that 
Canseco had reached a deal for his sequel to Juiced. The sequel is titled 
Vindicated, which hit bookstores by Opening Day 2008. This book has information 
on Alex Rodriguez, and Albert Belle as suggested by Canseco. The book was 
a "clarification" of names that should've been mentioned in the Mitchell 
Report. In a 2012 Sportsnet Interview article, Canseco said one of his 
only seasons without performance-enhancing drugs was in 1998 with the Toronto 
Blue Jays because he was in the process of a divorce and "didn’t want to 
use steroids while handling breakup-induced depression".[30] While still 
a player, he has guest starred on The Simpsons and Nash Bridges. Since 
his retirement, Canseco has appeared on Late Show with David Letterman, 
60 Minutes, The Big Idea with Donny Deutsch, "Boomer and Carton", Howard 
Stern, Jimmy Kimmel Live!, CMI: The Chris Myers Interview, and Kathy Griffin: 
My Life on the D-List. In 2003, he was featured in the reality-TV special 
Stripper's Ball: Jenna Jameson with Dennis Rodman and Magic Johnson.[31] 
He was a cast member in Season 5 of The Surreal Life with Janice Dickinson, 
Pepa of Salt-N-Pepa, Bronson Pinchot, Omarosa Manigault-Stallworth, Caprice 
Bourret, and Carey Hart.[32] In 2007, he received 6 Hall of Fame votes. 
This accounted for 1.1% of the ballots, failing to reach the 5% threshold 
necessary to stay on the ballot for another year. However, he can be elected 
to the Hall of Fame by the Committee of Baseball Veterans. In May 2008, 
Philadelphia sportscaster and former NFL football player Vai Sikahema accepted 
a challenge from Canseco to fight him for $30,000. Canseco claims to have 
earned black belts in Kung Fu and Taekwondo, while Sikahema fought in the 
Golden Gloves tournament won by Sugar Ray Leonard. The fight took place 
on July 12 in Atlantic City at the Bernie Robbins stadium.[33] The 5 ft 
9 in (1.75 m) Sikahema knocked out the 6 ft 4 in (1.93 m) Canseco in the 
first round. On January 24, 2009, Canseco fought radio personality and 
former child actor Danny Bonaduce in Aston Township, Pennsylvania; the 
three-round match ended in a majority draw.[34][35] Canseco claims to hold 
black belts in karate and taekwondo, and to practice Muay Thai, as well 
as describing himself as "an expert with nunchakus".[36] He made his mixed 
martial arts debut at Dream 9 on May 26, 2009, where he lost in the first 
round against 7 ft 2 in (2.18 m) kickboxer and occasional mixed martial 
artist Choi Hong-man as part of Dream's Super Hulk Tournament.[37][38] 
On November 6, 2009, Canseco defeated Todd Poulton in a Celebrity Boxing 
Federation bout in Springfield, Massachusetts.[39] As of December 2010, 
he has launched a Twitter campaign in hopes of getting invited to Spring 
training by Mets GM Sandy Alderson. Beginning March 6, 2011, Canseco was 
a contestant on The Celebrity Apprentice. He quit the show on the April 
3, 2011, citing his father's ailing health. Canseco later announced on 
Twitter that his father died shortly after he left the show. Canseco did 
earn $25,000 for his charity, the Baseball Assistance Team. He is also 
a columnist for Vice magazine. Recently, Lane Patorti and Edward Stoney 
Landon have finished a reality show concept based on former professional 
athletes being placed into smalltown sports leagues. TMZ reported Canseco 
is currently in talks to star in the show, "A League of His Own." In May 
2013, Jose Canseco provided the foreword to the novel Air Force Gator 2: 
Scales of Justice by Dan Ryckert.[40] In it, he claims the book about the 
alcoholic alligator pilot is a "weakly veiled" metaphor for his own life.[41] 
On October 28, 2014, Canseco accidentally shot himself on his left hand 
injuring one of his fingers while attempting to clean his gun at home in 
Las Vegas. After having surgery performed he was able to recover the full 
use of the hand.[42] On February 10, 1989, Canseco was arrested for reckless 
driving after allegedly leading an officer on a 15-mile chase. He was found 
guilty and fined $500.[43] On April 11, 1989, Canseco was arrested in California 
for carrying a loaded semi-automatic pistol in his car.[44] He was released 
on $2,500 bail and pleaded no contest.[45][46] On February 13, 1992, he 
was charged with aggravated battery for allegedly ramming his then-wife 
Esther's BMW with his Porsche.[44] On March 19, 1992, Canseco pleaded not 
guilty to charges of aggravated assault and later underwent counseling 
and fulfilled a community-service requirement.[47] Canseco was arrested 
in November 1997 for hitting his then-wife, Jessica. In January 1998, he 
pleaded no contest and was sentenced to one year probation and required 
to attend counseling.[48] In October 2001, Canseco and his brother, Ozzie, 
got into a fight with two California tourists at a Miami Beach nightclub 
that left one man with a broken nose and another needing 20 stitches in 
his lip; both were charged with two counts of aggravated battery. The brothers 
both pleaded guilty and received both probation and community service.[49] 
Following his retirement in May of 2002 Canseco speculated about been "blackballed" 
from Major League Baseball, it was then when he announced he was writing 
a tell-all book about his baseball career and the growing use of steroids 
around baseball. In March 2003, Canseco missed a court appearance while 
in California working out a custody dispute over his 6-year-old. The judge 
revoked his probation and sentenced him to two years under house arrest 
followed by three years probation.[50] In June 2003, Canseco was arrested 
at his home for probation violation after he tested positive for steroids. 
Canseco spent a month in jail without bail.[51] In May 2008, Canseco revealed 
that he had lost his house in Encino, California to foreclosure saying 
his two divorces had cost him $7 to $8 million each.[52] On October 10, 
2008, Canseco was detained by immigration officials at a San Diego border 
crossing as he tried to bring a fertility drug from Mexico. He stated the 
drug was to help with his hormone replacement therapy, needed due to his 
use of steroids.[53] On November 4, 2008, Canseco pleaded guilty in Federal 
court and was sentenced to 12 months' unsupervised probation by U.S. Magistrate 
Judge Ruben B. Brooks.[54] The 2008 A&E Network documentary Jose Canseco: 
Last Shot chronicles Canseco's attempts to end his steroid use. In it he 
also regrets ever writing his tell-all books and naming former teammates 
as steroid users, as he was never given the opportunity to participate 
in MLB-affiliated baseball. Since, he has try unsuccessfuly to reach out 
to former Bash Brother Mark McGwire and other ex-teammates [55] In 2014 
he returned to the Oakland coliseum to take part in the reunion celebrating 
the 25th anniversary of the 1989 World Series championship team, this marked 
the first time Canseco took part in a oficial Major League event in almost 
13 years. Mark McGwire, at the time coach for the Los Angels Dodgers, did 
not attend the event. In 2012, Canseco accepted a home run derby challenge 
by Canadian Twitter user Evan Malamud, father of an autistic child, as 
part of a fundraiser for an initiative called Home Runs For Autism.[56] 
Canseco still remains[when?] active with the charity as their spokesperson.[citation 
needed] On May 22, 2013, Canseco was named as a suspect in a rape allegation 
in Las Vegas. He broke the news himself on Twitter, denying the allegations 
and posting pictures and defamatory information about his accuser. On June 
7, 2013, Canseco was cleared of any wrongdoing following an investigation.
