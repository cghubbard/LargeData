Oak Woods Cemetery was established on February 12, 1853;[2] it covers an 
area of 74 hectares (183 acres) and is located at 1035 E. 67th Street in 
the Greater Grand Crossing area of Chicago's South Side. The first burials 
took place in 1860. Soon after the American Civil War, several thousand 
Confederate soldiers, prisoners who died at Camp Douglas, were buried here. 
A monument says that 6,000 soldiers were buried here and lists names of 
more than 4,000.[3] These bodies had originally been buried at City Cemetery 
but were exhumed and reinterred together in a mass grave, which came to 
be known as Confederate Mound, reported to be the largest mass grave in 
the Western Hemisphere.[4] Roland Burris, the U.S. Senator appointed by 
Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich, constructed a family tomb at 41°46′16″N 
87°36′08″W﻿ / ﻿41.77122°N 87.60215°W﻿ / 41.77122; -87.60215 in the Oak 
Woods cemetery, in preparation for his and his wife's eventual interment. 
The tomb received considerable publicity (generally negative) since Burris' 
appointment by the since-convicted governor.[5][6][7] The rear portion 
of the large stone structure resembles a triptych, forward of which are 
two burial vaults; the left one is engraved with Burris' name and birth 
date and the right vault with the name of Burris' wife. The central segment 
of the triptych includes a large inscription of the words "TRAIL BLAZER" 
along the top. The segments of the triptych also include accomplishments 
of Burris and his wife, both of whom are still living. These note that 
Burris was the first African American to be Attorney General of Illinois, 
the first African-American exchange student from Southern Illinois University 
to the University of Hamburg, Germany, and the first non-CPA to be on the
