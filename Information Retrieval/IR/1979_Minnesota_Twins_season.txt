The 1979 Minnesota Twins season was a season in American baseball. The 
team finished 82-80, fourth in the American League West. In January 1979, 
the Twins attempted to trade first baseman Rod Carew to the New York Yankees 
in exchange for Chris Chambliss, Juan Beníquez, Dámaso García, and Dave 
Righetti, but were unable to finalize a deal.[1] Carew would instead be 
traded to the California Angels on February 3. Three Minnesota Twins homered 
in the May 15 win over Texas, the sixteenth straight Minnesota game with 
at least one Twins homer. The streak will end on May 16. Nine players homered 
28 times during the club's record-setting streak. Only one Twins player 
made the All-Star Game: shortstop Roy Smalley. Smalley hit 24 HR, drove 
in 95 runs, and scored 85 runs, all team-leading totals. Ken Landreaux, 
acquired in the Carew trade, batted .305 with 15 HR and 83 RBI. Ron Jackson, 
acquired in the Dan Ford trade, hit 14 HR and collected 68 RBI. Reliever 
Mike Marshall continued as manager Gene Mauch's all-purpose reliever, pitching 
in a league-leading 90 games, racking up 10 relief wins along with a league-leading 
32 saves. Veteran Jerry Koosman won 20 games. Dave Goltz (14-13) and Geoff 
Zahn (13-7) had double-digit wins. Smalley turned 144 double plays this 
year, setting a major league record for shortstops. The team total of 203 
double plays set a new season record. Third baseman John Castino shared 
the AL Rookie of the Year award with Alfredo Griffin of the Toronto Blue 
Jays. Each received 7 first place votes.[7] 1,070,521 fans attended Twins 
games, the fourth lowest total in the American League. It was only the 
second time since 1970 the team attracted over one million fans. [1] [2]
