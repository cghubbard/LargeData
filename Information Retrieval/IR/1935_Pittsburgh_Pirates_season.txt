The 1935 Pittsburgh Pirates season was a season in American baseball which 
involved the Pirates finishing fourth in the National League. The roster 
featured five future Hall of Famers: player-manager Pie Traynor, pitcher 
Waite Hoyt, shortstop Arky Vaughan, center fielder Lloyd Waner, and right 
fielder Paul Waner. Vaughan hit .385 on his way to being named the NL's 
Most Valuable Player by The Sporting News. It is considered the best offensive 
season ever by a shortstop other than Honus Wagner.[3] On May 25, 1935, 
Babe Ruth of the Boston Braves hit the final three home runs of his career 
in one game against the Pirates at Forbes Field.[4] [1] [2] [3] [4] [5]
