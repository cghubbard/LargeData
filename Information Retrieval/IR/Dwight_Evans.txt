Dwight Michael "Dewey" Evans (born November 3, 1951) [1] is an American 
former professional baseball right fielder and right-handed batter who 
played with the Boston Red Sox (1972–90) and Baltimore Orioles (1991) in 
Major League Baseball. Evans won eight Gold Glove Awards (1976, 1978–79 
and 1981–85). In the 1970s and 1980s, Evans played in the outfield with 
Hall of Famer Jim Rice as well as all-stars Fred Lynn and Tony Armas. Evans 
was born in Santa Monica, California. He played Pony League and Colt League 
Baseball in Northridge, California with Doug DeCinces. Dwight attended 
Granada Hills High School in the tenth grade, but was not happy with the 
poor treatment he received from the baseball coaches. He then transferred 
to Chatsworth High School and played alongside Rick Rieger. Evans started 
his career by winning International League MVP honors, but in his early 
major league career, he was primarily a defensive standout with a modest 
bat. In the second half of his career, he became a powerful batter, twice 
winning the Silver Slugger award (1981, 1987). Evans acquired the nickname 
Dewey while playing for the Winston-Salem Red Sox during his third year 
of professional ball in 1971. It was coined by manager Don Lock who had 
already called Don Newhauser "Newie" and another teammate "Louie."[2] Evans 
made his Major League Baseball debut for the Boston Red Sox on September 
16, 1972 in a game against the Cleveland Indians. The Red Sox won 10–0 
behind the pitching of Luis Tiant who threw a 3-hit complete game. Evans 
pinch ran for Reggie Smith in the 6th but was stranded at 2B; he played 
in right field where he recorded 1 PO. Evans went 0–1 at the plate in his 
debut. Evans played in 18 games in 1972 for the Red Sox, and had 57 plate 
appearances (.263 BA, 15 H, 2 R, 6 RBI, 1 HR). In the historic 6th game 
of the 1975 World Series, with the score tied 6-6 in the 11th inning, Evans 
made a spectacular catch of a drive hit by Cincinnati Reds second baseman 
Joe Morgan. He threw to first base to complete an inning-ending double 
play. Carlton Fisk hit the famous walk off home run in the 12th inning 
to win the game for the Red Sox 7-6. Despite the strike-shortened 1981 
season, Evans had his best all-around year. He paced the league in total 
bases (215), OPS (.937), walks (85), times on base (208), and tied Eddie 
Murray, Tony Armas and Bobby Grich for the home run title with 22. He also 
ranked second in runs scored (84) and on-base percentage (.415), and third 
in slugging percentage (.522). He added a .296 batting average with 71 
runs batted in. In 1987, at age 35, Evans recorded career highs in batting 
average (.305), HRs (34) and RBI (123). He signed a one-year contract with 
the Baltimore Orioles on December 6, 1990.[3] He batted .270 with six homers 
and drove in 38 runs in 101 games in his only season with the Orioles. 
Based on his uncertain medical status, Evans was released by the Orioles 
in spring training on March 15, 1992.[4] Evans was named an Outfielder 
on The Sporting News AL All-Star team in 1982, 1984 and 1987 and was also 
tabbed as an Outfielder on the AL Silver Slugger Team by The Sporting News 
in 1981 and 1987. Evans would win the Gold Glove award in 1976, 1978, 1979, 
1981, 1982, 1983, 1984, and 1985. In his 20-year career, Evans batted .272, 
with 385 home runs, 1384 RBI, 1470 runs, 2446 hits, 483 doubles, 73 triples, 
and 78 stolen bases in 2606 games. Only Carl Yastrzemski (3308) played 
more games for the Red Sox than Evans (2505). Evans also played for the 
Red Sox in two World Series. In 1975 against the Cincinnati Reds, he batted 
.292 with excellent defensive play in right field, and in 1986 against 
the New York Mets, he batted .308 with 2 home runs and 9 RBI. Evans hit 
a home run four times on Opening Day. On April 7, 1986, he set a major 
league record by hitting the first pitch of the season for a home run, 
eclipsing the mark held by the Chicago Cubs' Bump Wills, who hit the second 
pitch for a home run on April 4, 1982. Originally Evans was assigned the 
uniform number 40 but quietly he wanted to wear number 24, the number of 
his idol Willie Mays. In 1973 the Sox gave him number 24, the number he 
wore for the rest of his career in Boston and one year with Baltimore. 
Other Red Sox players to wear the same jersey number since Evans retired 
include Kevin Mitchell, Mike Stanley, Manny Ramírez, Takashi Saito, and 
David Price. In 2000, Dwight Evans was selected to the Boston Red Sox Hall 
of Fame. In 2002, Evans served as hitting coach for the Red Sox and wore 
uniform number 25. In 2003, Evans was named a Player Development Consultant 
for the Red Sox. Evans was dropped from the Baseball Hall of Fame ballot 
when he did not receive the minimum five percent of votes in his third 
year of eligibility. Evans received 5.9% in 1997, 10.4% in 1998, and 3.6% 
in 1999. Evans' low vote total in 1999 is attributed to the appearance 
of future Hall of Fame players Nolan Ryan, George Brett, Robin Yount, and 
Carlton Fisk on the 1999 ballot. Based on his win shares metric, baseball 
statistician Bill James has argued that Evans is a worthy candidate for
