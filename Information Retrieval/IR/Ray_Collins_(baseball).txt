Ray Williston Collins (February 11, 1887 – January 9, 1970) was a starting 
pitcher in Major League Baseball who played his entire career for the Boston 
Red Sox. A native of Colchester, Vermont, Collins batted and threw left-handed. 
He debuted on July 19, 1909, and played his final game on October 7, 1915. 
In a seven-season career, Collins posted an 84–62 record with 511 strikeouts 
and a 2.51 ERA in 1336 innings, including 19 shutouts and 90 complete games. 
A graduate of the University of Vermont, Collins was a good-hitting pitcher 
and an outstanding fielder, but the key to his success was his remarkable 
control. He consistently ranked among the American League leaders in fewest 
walks allowed per nine innings, finishing third in the league in 1912 (1.90), 
second in 1913 (1.35) and fourth in 1914 (1.85). He also averaged 16 wins 
from 1910 to 1914, including a combined 39 wins in 1913–14, and was a member 
of the 1912 Red Sox world champion team. Collins became a regular in Boston 
rotation in 1910. In his first full season, he pitched a one-hitter against 
the Chicago White Sox and compiled a 13–11 record, making him the second-winningest 
pitcher on the Red Sox behind Eddie Cicotte (15–11). He was 3–6 at one 
point in 1911, but turned his season around, finishing at 11–12 with a 
2.40 ERA. Collins missed the first two months of the 1912 season with a 
knee injury, during which time the Red Sox christened their new stadium, 
Fenway Park. He did not start a game until early June, but won two games 
in three days over the Philadelphia Athletics at Shibe Park, 7–3 on July 
3 and 5–3 on July 5. Collins finished fifth in the AL with four shutouts, 
by all of them came in the second half of the season. He compiled a 13–8 
mark and his ERA stood at 2.53, fifth-best in the league. The only left-hander 
in Boston rotation, Collins was considered the second-best on the pitching 
staff behind Smoky Joe Wood (34–5) as the Red Sox clinched the American 
League pennant. Collins started Game Two of the World Series against Christy 
Mathewson and the New York Giants. He led 4–2 after seven innings and was 
pulled in the eight with only one out after the Giants rallied for three 
runs. The game was called on account of darkness after 11 innings with 
the score tied 6–6. Collins was supposed to start again in Game Six, but 
Red Sox manager Jake Stahl opted by Buck O'Brien, coming off a 20–13 season. 
The Giants shelled him for five runs in the first inning. Then, Collins 
relieved in the second and pitched shutout ball for seven innings in a 
5–2 lost cause. Collins enjoyed his best season yet in 1913, finishing 
at 19–8, as his .714 winning percentage was the second-highest in the league. 
In the midseason, he pitched a four-hit, 9–0 shutout and hit a home run 
St. Louis Browns on July 9. Later, on July 26, he pitched a five-hitter 
and hit a bases-loaded triple to give Boston a 4–1 victory over the Chicago 
White Sox. Collins also faced great Walter Johnson and the Washington Senators 
three times that season. Each game finished 1–0, with Collins winning two 
of them, including scoreless ball for 11 innings on August 29. Collins 
became the ace of Boston pitching staff in 1914 with a 20–13 record and 
a 2.51 ERA. His six shutouts ranked him fourth in the American League that 
season, and he was one of only three pitchers in the league to reach the 
20-win plateau, joining Walter Johnson (28) and Stan Coveleski (22). Collins 
picked up his 19th and 20th victories on September 22, by pitching complete 
games in both ends of a doubleheader against the Detroit Tigers at Navin 
Field, winning by scores of 5–3 in the opener and 5–0 in the nightcap. 
In 1915, the Red Sox were in the enviable position of having too many good 
(and younger) pitchers: Rube Foster, Ernie Shore, Dutch Leonard, and Babe 
Ruth made up the best rotation in major league baseball. Then Collins was 
relegated to the bullpen. Starting only nine games, the fewest since his 
rookie year, Collins finished with a 4–7 record and a 4.30 ERA in 25 pitching 
appearances. He did not pitch a single inning in the 1915 World Series 
as Boston defeated the Philadelphia Phillies in five games. After the season 
the Red Sox expected him to take a cut in salary, but Collins, at age 29, 
announced his retirement from professional baseball stating simply that 
he was "discouraged by his failure to show old-time form." After his playing 
career, Collins returned to the University of Vermont where he served as 
baseball coach. He represented his hometown of Colchester in the Vermont 
House of Representatives from 1941 to 1943. During the 1950s, he served 
on UVM's board of trustees, presiding over the school's transition from 
private to public university. Collins had five children with wife Lillian, 
the last surviving of whom (Ray Jr) died on September 14, 2013, aged 99.[1] 
Collins died in Burlington, Vermont, at age 82. In 2012, Collins was part
