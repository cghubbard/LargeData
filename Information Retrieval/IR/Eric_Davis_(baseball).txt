Eric Keith Davis (born May 29, 1962) is a former center fielder for several 
Major League Baseball teams. Davis was 21 years old when he broke into 
the big leagues on May 19, 1984 with the Cincinnati Reds, the team for 
which he is most remembered. Blessed with a rare combination of excellent 
foot speed and bat speed, Davis became the first major league player to 
hit at least 30 home runs and steal at least 50 bases in the same season 
in 1987. A series of injuries derailed his career as he moved to the Dodgers 
and then the Tigers, and he retired in 1994. In 1996, Davis successfully 
restarted his baseball career with the Reds and was named the comeback 
player of the year. He moved to the Baltimore Orioles and, despite fighting 
colon cancer, he had one of his best statistical seasons in 1998. Injuries 
again slowed Davis over the next few seasons and he retired for good in 
2001. Along with other business interests, Davis currently works as a roving 
instructor in the Reds organization. When Eric Davis first appeared in 
1984, his physical talents gave him the potential to be one of the most 
exciting players in the game. He was a rare five-tool player with home 
run power as well as sheer speed on the basepaths. He made a habit of robbing 
home runs and elicited comparisons to Willie Mays. Davis showed what he 
could do in 1986 hitting .277 with 27 homers and stealing 80 bases. He 
and Rickey Henderson remain the only players in major league history to 
be members of the "20/80 club".[1] He built on that success by hitting 
.293 with 37 homers and 50 steals in 1987, despite playing in only 129 
games. From 1986 to 1990, he averaged 30 home runs and 40 steals. During 
this time he was one of the game's most exciting players and a very visible 
superstar player. He drew some MVP support every year in 1986–90, finishing 
in the top 15 in the voting every year. In 1986–89 he also finished in 
the NL's top 10 in home runs, slugging percentage, and OPS each year. While 
he had some other good seasons later in his career, injuries prevented 
him from reaching this type of peak again. In 1990, with a solid team around 
him, Davis was a key player in Cincinnati's "wire-to-wire" championship 
season. One of Davis' most famous moments was when he homered off Oakland's 
Dave Stewart in his first World Series at bat in 1990. The home run triggered 
a World Series sweep for the Reds. While diving for a ball during game 
4 of the Series, Davis suffered a lacerated kidney which required surgery. 
He also underwent off-season surgery on a knee that he had injured earlier 
in the season. After 1990, Davis was unable to get his career back on track. 
Injuries sabotaged his play in 1991 and he was traded to Los Angeles for 
Tim Belcher and John Wetteland. He suffered several more injuries in 1992 
and was largely ineffective. On August 23, 1993, the Dodgers dealt Davis 
to the Detroit Tigers for a player to be named later. One week later the 
Tigers sent pitcher John DeSilva to the Dodgers to complete the trade. 
The Tigers, who in 1993 had one of the top offenses in the majors, were 
seeking to upgrade one of their few weaknesses, the center field position. 
Davis, who replaced Milt Cuyler, batted relatively well in 29 games down 
the stretch with the Tigers, batting fifth or sixth and finishing with 
an adjusted OPS of 142, and his sixth 20/20 season. Davis was expected 
to be the Tigers' primary center fielder in 1994, but injuries limited 
him to just 37 games and batting average of just .183. Following the strike-shortened 
1994 season, Davis was granted free agency by the Tigers and chose to retire. 
After recuperating for one season, he felt healthy enough to return to 
baseball with Cincinnati in 1996. He had a solid season with a .287 average 
and 26 home runs, although injuries cut into his playing time. He had played 
well enough, however, to convince Baltimore to sign him as a free agent. 
In May 1997, Davis was diagnosed with colon cancer. By September, while 
he was still in treatment, Davis returned to the team. His cancer treatment 
left him tired but he worked very hard to regain his form. Davis was well 
enough to hammer a game-winning home run in the 1997 American League Championship 
Series. After the season, he was given the Roberto Clemente Award. He serves 
as an honorary board member of the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation. 
Davis was brought back for 1998 and went on to have one of his best seasons, 
batting .327, the 4th best average in the AL, and hitting 28 homers. He 
also hit in 30 consecutive games that season. 1999 would be the beginning 
of the end for Davis. He spent three injury-plagued seasons with St. Louis 
and San Francisco before retiring in 2001. In 1999, Davis wrote his autobiography, 
Born to Play, in which he credited Pete Rose for having faith in him and 
teaching him about the game. He also had harsh words for Ray Knight, who 
was the Reds manager in 1996, and with whom Davis had had a memorable on-field 
fight in 1986.[2] He claimed Knight did not support his comeback and did 
not stand up for him in contract negotiations after the season. Davis remains 
bitter about the Reds' treatment of him after his World Series injury. 
Davis was left behind in Oakland after the series and requested that the 
Reds provide a private plane to bring him back to Cincinnati. Davis claimed 
that he was refused a number of times and made his own way home after the 
hospital released him. According to former Reds teammate Paul O'Neill, 
Davis was "the best hitter, best runner, best outfielder, best everything" 
he ever saw.[3] Where are they now? Eric Davis Autobiography: Born To Play,
