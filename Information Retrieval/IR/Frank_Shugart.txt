Frank Harry Shugart (December 10, 1866 in Luthersburg, Pennsylvania â€“ September 
9, 1944 in Clearfield, Pennsylvania), was a professional baseball player 
who played shortstop in the Major Leagues from 1890 to 1901. He played 
for the Chicago Pirates, Pittsburgh Pirates, St. Louis Browns, Louisville 
Colonels, Philadelphia Phillies, and Chicago White Sox. Shugart was blacklisted 
from baseball after the 1901 season because of an altercation on August 
21, 1901, in which he punched an umpire in the face and teammate Jack Katoll 
beaned the umpire in the leg. Katoll only received an 11-game suspension,
