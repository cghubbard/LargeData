In Major League Baseball (MLB), the 20–20–20 club is the group of batters 
who have collected 20 doubles, 20 triples and 20 home runs in a single 
season.[1][2][3] Frank Schulte was the first to achieve this, doing so 
in 1911. The last players to reach the milestone—Curtis Granderson and 
Jimmy Rollins—attained 20–20–20 during the 2007 season. This marked the 
first time that two players accomplished the achievement in the same season. 
In total, only seven players are members of the 20–20–20 club.[4] Of these, 
five were left-handed batters, one was right-handed and one was a switch 
hitter, meaning he could bat from either side of the plate. Two players—George 
Brett and Willie Mays—are also members of the 3,000 hit club,[5] and Mays 
is also a member of the 500 home run club.[6] Schulte, Rollins, and Jim 
Bottomley won the Most Valuable Player (MVP) Award in the same year as 
their 20–20–20 season.[7][8][9] Both Mays and Rollins joined the club while 
also hitting 30 home runs and stealing 30 bases that same season to join 
the 30–30 club.[10][11][12] Brett and Rollins collected more than 200 hits 
alongside achieving 20–20–20.[7][13] Furthermore, four players amassed 
20 or more stolen bases during their 20–20–20 season. These players are 
collectively referred to as the 20–20–20–20 club.[14][15][16] Historically, 
there have been numerous players who have hit 20 doubles and 20 home runs 
in a year. It is the component of triples, however, that makes the 20–20–20 
club so difficult to achieve. This is because hitting triples often comes 
under a similar hit placement as doubles, but may require impressive speed 
on the part of the runner.[17] This would pose a challenge for both a slugger, 
who may be slower at running the bases[18] and have the tendency to hit 
line drives and fly balls out of the park for a home run,[19] as well as 
a speedster, who may be more swift around the bases[19] but may not supply 
much power to drive the ball far. Due to the rare occurrence and low membership 
of the 20–20–20 club, Baseball Digest called it "the most exclusive club 
in the Majors"[20] in 1979, when there were only four members. Of the five 
members eligible for the Baseball Hall of Fame, three have been elected
