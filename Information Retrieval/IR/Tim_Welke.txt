Timothy James Welke (born August 23, 1957) is a former American professional 
baseball umpire. He worked in the American League from 1984 to 1999 and 
has worked throughout Major League Baseball from 2000-2015. He had been 
a crew chief since 2000. Welke wore number 30 when he joined the American 
League staff, then switched to 3 after the AL and National League umpiring 
staffs merged in 2000. His brother Bill is also a major league umpire. 
Tim has umpired in four World Series, seven League Championship Series, 
eight Division Series and two All-Star Games. A youth baseball umpire since 
the age of 16, Welke entered minor league umpiring in 1977. He appeared 
in the Gulf Coast League (1977), Florida State League (1978–79), Eastern 
League (1980), American Association (1981–83), Florida Instructional League 
(1977–80) and Dominican Winter League (1981–83) prior to his major league 
promotion in 1984.[1] Welke umpired in the World Series in 1996, 2000, 
2003, and 2008. He also worked the League Championship Series in 1991, 
1998, 2001, 2002, 2004, 2006, and 2011; and the Division Series in 1995, 
1996, 1999, 2000, 2003, 2008, 2010, and 2013. He served as crew chief for 
the NLCS in 2004 and 2006, the ALCS in 2011 and the ALDS in 1995 and 2000. 
He was also the crew chief for the 2008 World Series. He umpired in the 
All-Star Game in 1990, 2005, and 2015.[1] Welke spent 2005 and 2008-2010 
on the same umpiring crew as his brother Bill.[1] On April 29, 1986, he 
was the first base umpire when Roger Clemens of the Boston Red Sox achieved 
a record 20 strikeouts against the Seattle Mariners.[2] Welke ejected Atlanta 
Braves manager Bobby Cox from game six of the 1996 World Series,[3] the 
most recent World Series ejection.[4] Welke was also the first base umpire 
for Roy Halladay's perfect game on May 29, 2010, coincidentally, his brother 
Bill worked at third base that same game. In a May 2, 2012 game between 
the Los Angeles Dodgers and Colorado Rockies at Coors Field, Welke made 
a controversial out call at first base against Jerry Hairston, Jr. though 
first baseman Todd Helton's foot came well off of the bag. Welke later 
admitted that he had missed the call. Hairston subsequently defended Welke 
and described him as "a really good umpire for a long time."[5] He served 
as crew chief for the 2014 Opening Series in Australia at the Sydney Cricket 
Ground.[6] In a September 16, 2014 game between the Washington Nationals 
and Atlanta Braves at Turner Field, after an Ian Desmond two-run homer, 
Bryce Harper came up to bat. On an 0-1 count, an unruly Braves fan shouted 
and insulted Harper. Upon hearing the fan, Welke ripped off his mask and 
shouted to the usher, "Hey, hey, hey! Get rid of that guy! Get rid of him 
now! Get rid of him!" as he pointed to the heckler, tossing him from the 
ballpark. Harper struck out during his at bat, but that didn't stop the 
Nationals from clinching the NL East with a 3-0 win over the Braves.[7] 
On March 18, 2016, Welke announced his retirement after undergoing knee 
replacement surgery on one knee and a planned second surgery on the other 
knee.[8] Welke lives in his native state of Michigan. He graduated from 
Coldwater High School and attended Glen Oaks Community College. He is married
