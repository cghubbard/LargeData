In Major League Baseball, the Manager of the Year Award is an honor given 
annually since 1983 to the best managers in the American League (AL) and 
the National League (NL). The winner is voted on by 28 members of the Baseball 
Writers Association of America (BBWAA). Each places a vote for first, second, 
and third place among the managers of each league.[a] The manager with 
the highest score in each league wins the award.[1] Several managers have 
won the award in a season when they led their team to 100 or more wins. 
Lou Piniella won 116 games with the Seattle Mariners in 2001,[2] the most 
by a winning manager, and Joe Torre won 114 with the New York Yankees in 
1998.[3] Sparky Anderson and Tony La Russa finished with identical 104–58 
records in 1984 and 1988, respectively.[4][5] Three National League managers, 
including Dusty Baker, Whitey Herzog, and Larry Dierker, have exceeded 
the century mark as well. Baker's San Francisco Giants won 103 games in 
1993;[6] Dierker's 1998 Houston Astros won 102 and Herzog led the Cardinals 
to 101 wins in the award's third season.[7][8] In 1991, Bobby Cox became 
the first manager to win the award in both leagues, winning with the Atlanta 
Braves and having previously won with the Toronto Blue Jays in 1985.[9] 
La Russa, Piniella, Jim Leyland, Bob Melvin, Davey Johnson, and Joe Maddon 
have since won the award in both leagues.[2][4][10] Cox and La Russa have 
won the most awards, with four.[4][9] Baker, Leyland, Piniella, and Maddon 
have won three times.[2][6][10] In 2005, Cox became the first manager to 
win the award in consecutive years.[9] Jeff Banister and Joe Maddon are 
the most recent winners. Because of the 1994–95 Major League Baseball strike 
cut the season short and cancelled the post-season, the BBWAA writers effectively 
created a de facto mythical national championship (similar to college football) 
by naming managers of the unofficial league champions (lead the leagues 
in winning percentage) (Buck Showalter and Felipe Alou) as Managers of 
the Year.[11][12] Two franchises, the New York Mets and the Milwaukee Brewers, 
have not had a manager win the award. Only six managers have won the award 
while leading a team that finished outside the top two spots in its division. 
Ted Williams was the first, after leading the "expansion" Washington Senators 
to a third-place finish (and, at 86-76, their only winning season) in the 
American League East, in 1969. Buck Rodgers won the award in 1987 with 
the third-place Expos.[13] Tony Peña and Showalter won the award with third-place 
teams in back-to-back years: Peña with the Royals in 2003, and Showalter 
with the Rangers in 2004.[14][15] Joe Girardi is the only manager to win 
the award with a fourth-place team (2006 Florida Marlins);[16] he is also 
the only manager to win the award after fielding a team with a losing record.
