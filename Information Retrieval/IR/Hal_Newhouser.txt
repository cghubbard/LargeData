Harold "Prince Hal" Newhouser (May 20, 1921 – November 10, 1998) was an 
American former professional baseball player. In Major League Baseball 
(MLB), he pitched 17 seasons on the Detroit Tigers and Cleveland Indians, 
from 1939 through 1955. Newhouser was an All-Star for six seasons,[a] and 
was considered to be the most dominating pitcher of the World War II era 
of baseball, winning a pitcher's triple crown for the Tigers in 1945. After 
his retirement from baseball, Newhouser was away from baseball for 20 years 
while he served as a bank vice president. He later worked as a scout for 
several MLB teams. While scouting for the Houston Astros, he was angered 
when the team did not listen to his recommendation to draft Derek Jeter 
and instead picked Phil Nevin. He quit shortly after. Newhouser was inducted 
into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1992. He died six years later 
in a Michigan hospital. Newhouser was a schoolboy star at Wilbur Wright 
High School in his hometown of Detroit, Michigan. Before he was approached 
by professional baseball teams, he had been saving money to attend a trade 
school by working several jobs. The young Newhouser sold newspapers, collected 
pop bottles and worked in a bowling alley before signing on in professional 
baseball.[1] He was signed by the Detroit Tigers in 1939 at the age of 
18. A Tigers scout offered a $500 signing bonus to Newhouser, who found 
the sum of money to be unimaginable. Ten minutes after he signed, someone 
arrived from the Cleveland Indians; that employee had been prepared to 
offer $15,000 to his parents in addition to a $4,000 car.[1] Newhouser 
made his debut for Detroit on September 29, 1939. In 1940, he earned a 
spot on the Tigers out of spring training. In his first two full big-league 
seasons, the young left-hander experienced control problems, walking more 
batters than he struck out while posting win-loss records of 9–9 and 9–11. 
He improved in 1942 and 1943, posting excellent earned run averages (ERAs), 
but he still lost more than he won on a team with a weak offense. As World 
War II got under way, the Tigers moved up in the standings because several 
of their top players, including Newhouser, were classified as 4-F (ineligible 
to be drafted). Newhouser was 4-F due to a leaky heart valve; he attempted 
to join the service anyway but was turned down several times.[2] He blossomed 
in 1944, becoming a dominant pitcher in wartime baseball. That season, 
Newhouser rang up a 29–9 record, leading the league in wins and strikeouts 
(187). His 2.22 ERA was second in the league, as were his 25 complete games 
and six shutouts. The Tigers jumped into contention, finishing second in 
the American League, with Newhouser named MVP. Newhouser won the first 
Sporting News Pitcher of the Year Award in 1944.[3] By the 1945 season, 
NewHouser had been selected for three consecutive AL All-Star teams. The 
1945 All-Star Game was cancelled on April 24 because of travel restrictions 
and seven out of eight scheduled interleague games were played in place 
of the All-Star Game on July 9 and 10 to support the American Red Cross 
and War Relief fund.[4][5] Newhouser became the first pitcher to repeat 
as MVP that season and helped the team win the World Series. He won the 
pitcher's Triple Crown, leading the AL in wins (25, against nine losses), 
ERA (1.81) and strikeouts (212). He also led the league in innings pitched, 
games started, complete games and shutouts. Newhouser pitched four innings 
of relief on the season's final day as Detroit rallied for the pennant. 
Newhouser won the second Sporting News Pitcher of the Year Award.[3] He 
became the youngest player (24) to win the award in two consecutive years. 
In that year's World Series, Newhouser won two games, including a complete-game 
victory in the deciding seventh game.[6] In 1946, he went 26–9 with a 1.94 
ERA, again leading the league in wins and ERA. His 275 strikeouts was second 
in the league. Newhouser was runner-up in the MVP race to Ted Williams. 
Newhouser continued to rate among the game's best pitchers for the next 
five years. He won 17 games in 1947, led the AL with 21 wins in 1948 and 
rang up an 18–11 mark in 1949. After a 15–13 season in 1950, he hurt his 
arm and his workload was cut significantly. After being released by the 
Tigers following the 1953 season, Newhouser signed on with the Cleveland 
Indians and was their top long reliever in 1954, when Cleveland won 111 
games and the pennant. In his final big-league hurrah, he posted a 7–2 
mark with a 2.54 ERA, and got to pitch in his second World Series. He ended 
his career with a record of 207–150 and a 3.06 ERA. He is the only pitcher 
ever to win consecutive MVP awards. After retirement, Newhouser worked 
as a scout for the Houston Astros, Baltimore Orioles, Cleveland Indians, 
and the Detroit Tigers. While with the Astros, Newhouser was credited with 
discovering Derek Jeter, whom the Astros passed over for Phil Nevin.[7] 
He quit his job with the Astros after they ignored his advice to draft 
Jeter,[8] though he had planned to retire after that season in any case.[9] 
As a scout with the Orioles, Newhouser discovered Milt Pappas. Pappas was 
a Detroit high schooler who went on to win 209 games in his career — two 
more than Newhouser did. He also signed Dean Chance to the Orioles. Chance 
later won a Cy Young Award after leaving the team.[10] In 1992, he was 
elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame. His induction class included 
Tom Seaver, Rollie Fingers and Bill McGowan. The ceremony was attended 
by a record-setting crowd of 20,000 people.[11] The Tigers retired Newhouser's 
number 16 in 1997. He died on November 10, 1998 in a hospital in Southfield, 
Michigan. He had been ill with emphysema and heart problems.[1] During 
his playing days, Newhouser's teammates nicknamed him "Prince Hal" because 
of the way he carried himself. His wife, Beryl Newhouser, said that she 
could not ever remember seeing him with his shirttail untucked. Newhouser 
left baseball for 20 years after his retirement, spending time as a bank
