Thomas S. "Tom" Ricketts (born May 23, 1963) is the chairman and owner 
of the Chicago Cubs, and the chief executive officer of Incapital LLC, 
a Chicago investment bank that packages corporate bonds for retail investors. 
He is also a director of TD Ameritrade Holding Corporation as well as the 
son of Ameritrade founder J. Joseph Ricketts.[1] Forbes estimate of the 
Ricketts's family wealth ($1 billion), consolidated under J. Joseph Ricketts 
name, placed the family at #371 on the Forbes 400 list.[2] In January 2009, 
a Ricketts family bid led by Thomas Ricketts was chosen as the winning 
bidder for the Chicago Cubs. The bid was estimated to total around $875 
million for the team and related assets.[3] The sale was approved unanimously 
by the owners of the other 29 Major League Baseball teams that October.[4] 
Ricketts was introduced as the chairman of the Cubs on October 31, 2009. 
The transaction closed in late October 2009. All four siblings (Pete, Tom, 
Laura, and Todd) and both parents share interest in the team through their 
family trust. Tom's father, J. Joseph Ricketts, founded Ameritrade when 
Tom was eight years old. Ricketts Senior let it be known that he wanted 
his children to establish themselves through their own hard work and would 
not be allowed to join TD Ameritrade until they reached the age of 30.[5] 
Tom Ricketts is the eldest of four children. His younger brother J. Peter 
Ricketts, who lives in Omaha, is the 40th and current Governor of Nebraska[6] 
and was the unsuccessful Republican nominee for the 2006 U.S. Senate race 
in Nebraska.[7] Younger sister Laura Ricketts, a lawyer, developed and 
runs Ecotravel.com and serves on the board of directors of Lambda Legal.[8] 
Laura, Todd Ricketts, Tom Ricketts and his wife Cecelia and their five 
children all live in Wilmette, Illinois. In 1984, Ricketts moved from Omaha 
to Chicago in order to attend the University of Chicago. Just out of high 
school, he moved in with his younger brother Peter, also a student at the 
University of Chicago.[9] Ricketts received a bachelor's degree from the 
university in 1988 and returned to receive his Master of Business Administration 
in 1993. Ricketts's relationship with the university continued after graduation 
with reception of the Distinguished Young Alumni award from the university's 
Graduate School of Business.[10] The award is presented for, among other 
things, recognition of extraordinary career success, outstanding leadership, 
and influence in the business community to support the school and current 
students. In addition, as an alumnus Ricketts has been generous with donations 
to the university. This has included both volunteering his time and establishing 
an endowment for the New Year Scholarship Fund. Named after his joy of 
celebrating the Chinese New Year, the scholarship not only funds promising 
students but also allows for those students to meet with Ricketts and the 
other members of the endowment.[11] In April 2007, Sam Zell announced his 
intention to acquire the Chicago-based Tribune Company. After acquiring 
the Tribune, Zell announced that he would sell the Cubs and related entities 
including Wrigley Field and a 25% share of SportsNet Chicago.[9][12] Under 
bankruptcy protection, the sale of the Cubs and the 25% interest in SportsNet 
Chicago would raise needed funds for the ailing Tribune company. The Ricketts 
family bid, headed by Thomas S. Ricketts, was selected as the winning bid 
on January 22, 2009.[3] The family bid included all four siblings (Peter, 
Tom, Laura, and Todd) and both parents. Forbes estimated that the ownership 
stake in the Chicago Cubs represents $642 million out of the total $900 
million bid made by Ricketts.[12] Tom Ricketts has said that his love for 
the Chicago Cubs started during the 1984 season when he was 18 years old 
and moved to Chicago to attend university. Later, Tom and his brother Pete 
lived in an apartment over the "Sports Corner" at Addison and Sheffield, 
across the street from Wrigley Field. He met his wife Cecelia in the Wrigley 
bleachers and simply states that "my family and I are Cubs fans".[9] The 
bid was reviewed by Major League Baseball and other stake holders. Although 
several close friends told the press about Ricketts's deep love for the 
Cubs, the Ricketts family decided not to court media attention until the 
bid was accepted by all parties.[9] On July 6, 2009, the Chicago Tribune 
reported that Tom Ricketts and family had reached an agreement with the 
Tribune Company to purchase the Cubs, Wrigley Field, and 25% of Comcast 
SportsNet Chicago for close to $900 million, as was originally reported. 
The contract was sent to commissioner Bud Selig for approval.[13] Final 
approval came by a unanimous vote of the other MLB owners in an October 
6, 2009 conference call.[4] On October 27, 2009, the Ricketts family, with 
Thomas S. Ricketts as board chairman, officially took over 95% ownership 
of the Chicago Cubs, Wrigley Field, and 25% ownership of Comcast SportsNet 
Chicago. The Tribune opted to retain a 5% ownership stake in the team.[14] 
With his father J. Joseph Ricketts and his brother J. Peter Ricketts, Thomas 
Ricketts currently serves as a director of TD Ameritrade Holding Corporation. 
In addition he serves as chairman and CEO of Incapital LLC.[1] Ricketts 
spent one summer early in life working at TD Ameritrade, giving customers 
stock quotes over the phone. This was his only work experience with the 
company before being invited to join as a director later in life.[15] When 
Ricketts finished undergraduate studies (1988), he joined the Chicago Board 
Options Exchange as a market maker. Ricketts held this position until 1994, 
shortly after finishing his MBA. From 1995 to 1996, he served as vice president 
with Mesirow Financial until moving to ABN AMRO as vice president in their 
brokerage division.[1] Ricketts is credited with pioneering the idea of 
using the Internet and other technologies to help companies sell their 
investment-grade bonds directly to retail investors, as opposed to limiting 
sales only to institutions.[15][16] He helped launch the first successful 
version of this system while at ABN AMRO. In 1999 he left ABN AMRO to found 
Incapital.[1] Thomas Ricketts co-founded Chicago-based Incapital LLC in 
1999.[1] The securities and investment banking firm has since expanded 
with two additional offices in Boca Raton, Florida and London, England.[17] 
Currently, Ricketts serves as Incapital chairman and chief executive officer. 
Forbes describes the company as a "technologically-oriented investment 
bank focused exclusively on the underwriting and distribution of fixed 
income products to individual investors. Incapital underwrites for several 
major U.S. corporations through its InterNotesSM product platform".[1]
