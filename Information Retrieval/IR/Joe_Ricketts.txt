John Joseph "Joe" Ricketts (born July 16, 1941) is an American businessman. 
He is the founder, former CEO and former chairman of TD Ameritrade, one 
of the largest online discount brokerages in the world, based in Omaha, 
Nebraska.[4] Since 2008, Ricketts has pursued a variety of entrepreneurial 
ventures including DNAinfo.com, High Plains Bison, The Lodge at Jackson 
Fork, and The American Film Company.[5][6] Ricketts also engages in philanthropy 
through Opportunity Education Foundation, The Cloisters on the Platte Foundation, 
The Ricketts Art Foundation, The Ricketts Conservation Foundation, and 
Ending Spending, Inc.[6][7][8][9][10] John Joseph Ricketts was born and 
raised in Nebraska City, Nebraska, the son of Florence M. (Erhart) and 
Donavon Platte Ricketts.[2][11] He obtained a bachelor's degree from Creighton 
University in Omaha, Nebraska in 1968.[12] Ricketts is married with four 
children, Thomas, Pete, Laura, and Todd, who were raised Roman Catholic.[13] 
In 2009, Ricketts ranked #371, according to Forbes magazine, of the 400 
wealthiest Americans, with a net worth of $1 billion. He currently resides 
in Little Jackson Hole, Wyoming.[1] In 1975, John Joseph Ricketts and a 
few partners formed First Omaha Securities, a retail securities brokerage 
firm that through mergers and acquisitions grew into TD Ameritrade.[14] 
Ricketts retired from the TD Ameritrade board in October 2011 to concentrate 
on entrepreneurship and philanthropy.[15] In 2004, John Joseph Ricketts 
founded High Plains Bison, a retailer of natural bison meat. In addition 
to online and offline sales channels, High Plains Bison is the official 
bison vendor at Chicago's Wrigley Field.[16] Some of the bison are raised 
on a Wyoming ranch owned by Ricketts. A four-bedroom lodge named The Lodge 
at Jackson Fort Ranch is located on the same property.[17][18] In 2008, 
John Joseph Ricketts founded The American Film Company, which produces 
feature films about true stories from American history.[19] The Conspirator 
is a 2010 historical drama film directed by Robert Redford. It served as 
the debut film of The American Film Company.[20][21] In 2009, John Joseph 
Ricketts founded DNAinfo.com, a digital news service that currently covers 
neighborhood news in New York City and Chicago.[22][23] In October 2009, 
the Ricketts family acquired a 95 percent controlling interest in Major 
League Baseball's Chicago Cubs and Wrigley Field, as well as 20% of Comcast 
Sportsnet Chicago. The Ricketts family represents the eighth ownership 
group in the 133-year history of the team. While Ricketts is not directly 
involved in the team's operations, his son, Tom Ricketts, is Cubs chairman 
and his three other children (Pete, Laura and Todd) are on the board of 
directors.[24] In November 2010, the Cubs announced a plan to seek $200 
million in state-backed bonds for renovations to Wrigley Field.[25] Ricketts 
co-founded the Campaign for Primary Accountability (CPA) with Eric O'Keefe, 
Leo Linbeck III, and Tim Dunn. It targets both Democratic and Republican 
incumbents in primary elections.[26] In 2010, Ricketts led a campaign against 
earmarks and what he perceived to be wasteful federal spending.[27][28] 
Ricketts founded an independent organization called Taxpayers Against Earmarks 
that classified every Member of Congress as either a spending "hero" or 
"hooligan."[29] Along with Taxpayers for Common Sense and WashingtonWatch.com, 
Taxpayers Against Earmarks developed a database of earmarks requested by 
members of Congress.[30] The group successfully pressed for a moratorium 
on earmarks in 2010.[31] Taxpayers Against Earmarks changed its name to 
Ending Spending in 2011, as part of a broadening of the group's focus.[32] 
Ricketts established and funded The Ending Spending Fund, a political action 
committee, in 2010.[33] The Ending Spending Fund spent over $1 million 
sponsoring independent advertisements in several Congressional races. The 
goal of the advertising expenditure was to highlight incumbents’ earmark-related 
policies.[33][34] The Ending Spending Fund spent the largest amount of 
its money on the United States Senate election in Nevada, 2010 in an unsuccessful 
effort to defeat Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid. Although not required 
by law, Ricketts willingly disclosed his identity due to his belief in 
transparency.[35] Ricketts served on the board of trustees of the American 
Enterprise Institute from 1999 to 2007.[36] His son, Pete Ricketts, is 
a member of the Republican National Committee.[37] His daughter, Laura 
Ricketts, is a gay rights activist and prominent bundler for Barack Obama.[38] 
Another son, Todd Ricketts, was named CEO of Ending Spending in 2013.[39] 
On May 17, 2012, The New York Times published a story by Jeff Zeleny and 
Jim Rutenberg reporting that The Ending Spending Action fund had been presented 
with a 54-page proposal entitled, "The Defeat of Barack Hussein Obama: 
the Ricketts Plan to End His Spending for Good." According to the Times, 
the proposal, written by a vendor seeking to be hired by Ending Spending, 
suggested a $10-million ad campaign to "attack President Obama in ways 
that Republicans have so far shied away" and called for "running commercials 
linking Mr. Obama to incendiary comments by his former spiritual adviser, 
the Reverend Jeremiah A. Wright."[40] The report came to light when an 
unidentified person, who was not connected to the proposal, leaked it to 
The New York Times.[41] The president of the Ending Spending Action Fund 
said that the pitch was a "nonstarter"[42] and issued the following statement 
repudiating the proposal: "Not only was this plan merely a proposal—one 
of several submitted to the Ending Spending Action Fund by third-party 
vendors—but it reflects an approach to politics that Mr. Ricketts rejects 
and it was never a plan to be accepted but only a suggestion for a direction 
to take."[43] As of mid-2014, the Ending Spending SuperPac had supported 
only Republicans.[44] In the 2016 presidential election, Ricketts donated 
at least one million dollars in support of Donald Trump.[45] Ricketts also 
raised funds for the Future45 Super Pac and the 45Committee, a pro-Trump 
501(c)4 organization that is not required to disclose its donors.[46] During 
the Republican primaries, Ricketts had contributed to Our Principles PAC, 
a Super PAC dedicated to opposing Trump.[45] Ricketts explained his changed 
position citing economic grounds, stating that Hillary Clinton "represents 
four more years of the Obama-Clinton economic policies that continue to 
cripple the middle class.”[47] John Joseph Ricketts established the Opportunity 
Education Foundation, which underwrites the costs of training teachers 
and students in the Third World. The foundation supports an educational 
initiative through Louisiana College in Pineville, Louisiana, which trains 
teachers in East and West Africa.[48] On September 26, 2013, Louisiana 
College president Joe W. Aguillard presented Ricketts and his brother, 
Jim, with two of three Trustees' Distinguished Service Awards at the annual 
Founder's Day chapel. "The little help that we give is really absorbed 
and used a great deal. ... Let me thank you, Louisiana College, for having 
such an impact on the educational system in the Third World," said Joe 
Ricketts.[48] Jim Ricketts, the president and CEO of the foundation and 
the former vice-president of TD Ameritrade, said, "We're serving the poor
