Samuel Pond "Sad Sam" Jones (July 26, 1892 – July 6, 1966) was a starting 
pitcher in Major League Baseball who played in the American League with 
the Cleveland Indians (1914–15), Boston Red Sox (1916–21), New York Yankees 
(1922–26), St. Louis Browns (1927), Washington Senators (1928–31) and Chicago 
White Sox (1932–35). A native of Woodsfield, Ohio, Jones batted and threw 
right-handed. His sharp-breaking curveball also earned him the nickname 
"Horsewhips Sam". In a 22-year career, Jones compiled a 229–217 record 
with 1223 strikeouts and a 3.84 ERA in 3,883 innings pitched. Jones signed 
his first professional contract in 1913, with a minor league team in Zanesville, 
Ohio. He made his major league debut with the Indians in 1914. Before the 
1916 season, he was sent to Boston in the same trade that brought Tris 
Speaker to Cleveland. In 1918, Jones joined the Red Sox starting rotation, 
ending with a 16–5 mark, a career-best 2.25 ERA, and a league-best .762 
winning percentage. His most productive season came in 1921, when he posted 
career-highs in wins (23), strikeouts (98) and innings (298.2), and led 
the league in shutouts (5). But his most remembered season may have been 
1923 as the ace of the Yankees' staff; he posted a 21–8 record with a 3.63 
ERA and led his team to their first World Series title. Jones also no-hit 
the Philadelphia Athletics 2-0 on September 4 at Shibe Park, in a game 
in which he did not record a strikeout the entire game. As of 2014, Ken 
Holtzman is the only other no-hit pitcher not to strike out a batter the 
entire game, doing so for the Chicago Cubs in 1969. Jones was 2–1 against 
the New York Giants in that World Series, and his crucial relief work in 
the final game of the Series clinched the championship for the Yankees. 
Like most pitchers of his time, Jones relieved as well as started, and 
his eight saves in 1922 led the league's relief pitchers. Jones lost a 
league-high 21 games in 1925. He pitched for the Browns a year later, and 
was waived to Washington in 1927. With the Senators, Jones regained his 
form, leading his team's staff with a 17–7 record. He enjoyed his last 
good season in 1930, ending with a 15–7 mark. After four years of service 
for the White Sox, Jones retired in 1935 as the oldest active player at 
the time (42). His 22 consecutive seasons pitching in one league is a major 
league record shared with Herb Pennock, Early Wynn, Red Ruffing and Steve
