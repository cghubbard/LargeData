Tyler Lee Clippard (born February 14, 1985) is an American professional 
baseball pitcher for the New York Yankees of Major League Baseball (MLB). 
He previously played for the Washington Nationals, Oakland Athletics, New 
York Mets, and Arizona Diamondbacks. After playing baseball at J. W. Mitchell 
High School in New Port Richey, Florida, the Yankees drafted Clippard in 
the ninth round of the 2003 MLB draft. He debuted with the Yankees as a 
starting pitcher in 2007. The Yankees traded him to the Nationals before 
the 2008 season, and the Nationals converted him into a relief pitcher 
in 2009. The Nationals traded Clippard to the Athletics before the 2015 
season, who traded him to the Mets during the 2015 season. He signed as 
a free agent with the Diamondbacks before the 2016 season. Clippard led 
the major leagues in holds in 2014. He was named to the MLB All-Star Game 
in 2011 and 2014, and won the MLB Delivery Man of the Month Award in June 
2012. Clippard was born in Lexington, Kentucky. His family moved to Florida 
when he was a toddler.[1] Clippard played baseball in Little League; in 
eleven years, he won seven district titles, but was never able to reach 
the Little League World Series.[2] He learned to pitch when he was eight 
years old.[3] In 2001, he was a member of the Palm Harbor team that won 
the Senior League World Series.[3] Clippard began his high school career 
at Palm Harbor University High School in Palm Harbor, Florida. After failing 
to make the varsity baseball team in his first two seasons, he transferred 
to J. W. Mitchell High School in New Port Richey, Florida,[3][4] where 
he played for the school's baseball team. As a junior, in 2002, he won 
six games. He was named to the All-Conference first team.[5] In 2003, his 
senior season, Clippard had a 1–1 record with an 0.81 ERA and 31 strikeouts 
in 17 1⁄3 innings pitched. However, he was dismissed from the school's 
baseball team after being charged with driving under the influence of alcohol.[6] 
Clippard transferred to Dunedin High School in Dunedin, Florida, which 
had a nationally ranked baseball team. Clippard attempted to play for their 
team, but the move was blocked by the Florida High School Athletic Association, 
as players are not allowed to transfer during the course of a season, nor 
are they allowed to transfer to avoid sanctions given for disciplinary 
reasons.[7] After taking classes at Dunedin for a month, Clippard transferred 
back to Mitchell in order to graduate from high school with his friends.[8] 
Clippard competed for the Central Florida Renegades in Connie Mack Baseball, 
an amateur 18-and-under competition organized by the American Amateur Baseball 
Congress. He earned pitcher of the week honors in the Florida State Elite 
Baseball League in June 2003.[9] Clippard also played golf at Mitchell. 
As a sophomore, in 2001, Clippard was named one of the ten best golfers 
in Pasco County.[10] He registered the best individual score in the Sunshine 
Athletic Conference tournament that year.[11] He was named to the All-Conference 
first team as a junior[12] and to the All-County as a senior,[13] and helped 
lead Mitchell to victory in the Sunshine Athletic Conference tournament 
during his senior year.[14] Without the benefit of a full senior season 
to show himself off to scouts, Clippard proactively sent scouts a schedule 
of when he was throwing and attended as many showcases as he could.[5] 
He trained with Roy Silver, a retired professional baseball player, who 
worked with Clippard on his mechanics and his maturity.[15] Clippard's 
father, Bob, teamed up with Tom Kotchman, father of Florida high school 
player Casey Kotchman, to form showcases with past teammates of Clippard.[3] 
Clippard was drafted in the ninth round of the 2003 Major League Baseball 
(MLB) draft, with the 274th overall selection, by the New York Yankees. 
Though he had signed a National Letter of Intent in the fall of 2002 to 
attend the University of South Florida on a baseball scholarship, allowing 
him to play college baseball for the South Florida Bulls,[16] he chose 
to turn professional due to his draft position and the opportunity to play 
for the Yankees.[17] Clippard made his professional debut that year in 
the Rookie-level Gulf Coast League (GCL) with the GCL Yankees, pitching 
to a 3–3 win–loss record with a 2.89 ERA. In 43 2⁄3 innings, he allowed 
33 hits and five walks while striking out 56. Moving up to the Battle Creek 
Yankees of the Class A Midwest League for the 2004 season,[18] Clippard 
had a 10–10 record with a 3.44 ERA and a strikeout-to-walk ratio of 4.53:1 
in 25 starts.[19] Clippard was 10–9 with a 3.18 ERA for the Tampa Yankees 
of the Class A-Advanced Florida State League (FSL) in 2005. He was named 
to the West team in the FSL All-Star Game.[20] However, he did not appear 
in the game, as the Charleston RiverDogs of the Class A South Atlantic 
League needed another pitcher that day.[20] Clippard was named FSL pitcher 
of the week for the week of July 10 through 17.[21] For the season, opponents 
batted .219 against him and he struck out 169 batters in 147 1⁄3 innings, 
while walking 34. He led Yankees farmhands in strikeouts and finished fifth 
in the affiliated minor leagues, behind Francisco Liriano, Joel Zumaya, 
Rich Hill and Chuck James.[5] He also led the FSL in strikeouts and was 
seventh in ERA. However, he did not make the FSL post-season All-Star team[22] 
and Baseball America did not rank him as one of the league's top prospects.[23] 
Baseball America ranked Clippard as the Yankees' tenth best prospect heading 
into the 2006 season.[24] Promoted to the Trenton Thunder of the Class 
AA Eastern League in 2006, Clippard again led Yankee farmhands in strikeouts 
(175). He allowed just a .200 batting average and had three times as many 
strikeouts as walks. Clippard was 12–10 with a 3.35 ERA for the Trenton 
Thunder. He threw the first no-hitter in franchise history on August 17, 
shutting down the Harrisburg Senators.[25] He was named the Eastern League's 
pitcher of the week for his accomplishment.[24] Earlier in the season, 
Clippard flirted with a perfect game, retiring the first 21 batters in 
a game against the Binghamton Mets.[26] Clippard also won nine straight 
games at one point, breaking the club record of eight shared by Tomo Ohka 
and Carl Pavano. He teamed with Phil Hughes to form one of the best pitching 
duos in minor league baseball.[27] Clippard again was fifth in the affiliated 
minors in strikeouts, trailing Yovani Gallardo, Francisco Cruceta, Matt 
Maloney and Franklin Morales. He led the Eastern League in strikeouts and 
was seventh in ERA. Baseball America ranked him as the tenth-best prospect 
in the Eastern League.[28] Clippard began 2007 with the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre 
Yankees of the Class AAA International League. He was 3–2 with a 2.72 ERA 
in his first eight starts, striking out 41 in 39 2/3 innings but allowing 
40 hits and 17 walks. Though the Yankees experienced injuries in the starting 
rotation, they called on Matt DeSalvo and Chase Wright before Clippard.[29] 
When Darrell Rasner broke his finger in May, Clippard was called up to 
New York. He became the seventh rookie to start a game for the 2007 New 
York Yankees, following Hughes, DeSalvo, Rasner, Wright, Kei Igawa and 
Jeff Karstens.[30] Making his MLB debut on May 20, 2007, in an interleague 
game against the New York Mets, Clippard recorded his first MLB win.[31] 
He pitched six innings, giving up one run off the bat of David Wright and 
three hits. He struck out his first major league batter, José Reyes, on 
three pitches. He recorded his first career hit in his second at-bat off 
Mets pitcher Scott Schoeneweis, a double to right center in the sixth inning.[31] 
Clippard was optioned back to the minor leagues in June.[32] He struggled 
in his return to the minor leagues for Scranton/Wilkes-Barre,[33] and was 
demoted to Trenton in July.[34] Though he was a member of the Trenton team 
as they won the Eastern League championship, Clippard struggled in the 
playoffs.[29] The Yankees recalled him in September.[35] Overall with, 
he had a 3–1 record and a 6.33 ERA with the Yankees.[36] Clippard was traded 
on December 4, 2007, to the Washington Nationals for relief pitcher Jonathan 
Albaladejo.[37] The Nationals viewed him as a contender for a spot in the 
starting rotation.[38][39] However, he began the season with the Columbus 
Clippers, Washington's Class AAA affiliate.[40] He pitched his first game 
for the Nationals on June 9, 2008, after Odalis Pérez was placed on the 
15-day disabled list. He was optioned to the minor leagues after this start,[41] 
but was given a second start a few days later, as Pérez was not yet ready 
to return.[42] The Nationals then optioned Clippard to Columbus after his 
second start, in which Clippard pitched to a 1–1 record and 4.35 ERA.[43] 
He was recalled later in June as Shawn Hill was placed on the disabled 
list.[44] He spent most of the season with Columbus, going 6–13 with a 
4.66 ERA. He tied Yorman Bazardo and Charlie Haeger for the most losses 
in the International League that season.[45] During spring training in 
2009, the Nationals optioned Clippard to the Syracuse Chiefs, Washington's 
new Class AAA affiliate.[46] Despite starting six games with the Yankees 
in 2007 and two for the Nationals in 2008, he was converted to a relief 
pitcher for the 2009 campaign.[47] Nationals' pitching coach Steve McCatty 
told Clippard that his future was pitching in relief, because his pitch 
count tended to get too high in starts, and opposing batters hit Clippard 
well by the third time the lineup turned over in a game.[15] Clippard at 
first resisted the transition to the bullpen, but conversations with his 
father and agent, Casey Close, reassured him to continue pursuing his dream.[48] 
Clippard appeared in 20 games for Syracuse in 2009, posting a 4–1 record, 
0.92 ERA, and 42 strikeouts in 39 innings.[49] Clippard pitched in 14 consecutive 
scoreless appearances before being promoted to the Nationals on June 21, 
2009, replacing Kip Wells in the Nationals' bullpen.[49] Used sparingly 
in the first weeks after his promotion,[50] he posted a 2.69 ERA through 
60 1⁄3 innings, with 67 strikeouts.[51] Since 2010, Clippard has pitched 
exclusively out of the bullpen; primarily in the eighth inning.[52] That 
season, Clippard and Drew Storen served as setup pitchers to Matt Capps.[53] 
After pitching effectively in the first half of the season, Clippard and 
Capps earned the nickname "Clip and Save".[54] Clippard finished eighth 
in the National League in appearances, with 78.[55] He won eleven games 
on the season,[56] which led the team.[57] In the first half of the 2011 
season, Clippard had a 1–0 record and 1.73 ERA.[56] He struck out 63 batters 
and allowed only 26 hits in 51 1⁄3 innings pitched, and allowed only six 
of 32 inherited runners to score.[15][56] For his achievements, Clippard 
was selected to appear in the All-Star Game.[15] He earned the victory 
for the National League as the game's winning pitcher, despite not retiring 
a batter.[56][58] Adrián Beltré, the only batter Clippard faced, singled, 
but Hunter Pence threw out José Bautista at home plate, and the NL took 
the lead in the next inning.[56] Clippard finished the season with a 3–0 
record, a 1.83 ERA, and 104 strikeouts in 88 1⁄3 innings pitched across 
72 appearances.[59] He led the National League in win probability added.[60] 
Before the 2012 season, Clippard and the Nationals agreed to a one-year 
contract worth $1.65 million, avoiding salary arbitration.[61] Clippard 
became the de facto closer for the Nationals in the first half of the 2012 
season. After injuries to Storen and Brad Lidge, Henry Rodríguez became 
the closer, but Rodriguez lost the job to Clippard due to his struggles.[62][63][64] 
The Nationals kept Clippard as their closer even after Storen returned 
to the team.[65] He was named the Major League Baseball Delivery Man of 
the Month for his performance in June 2012, recording ten saves in ten 
opportunities, and allowing zero runs in 11 2⁄3 innings pitched.[66] Clippard 
earned $4 million in 2013. He had a 6–3 record with a 2.41 ERA and 73 strikeouts 
in 71 innings pitched. Clippard and the Nationals agreed on a $5.875 million 
salary for the 2014 season.[67] He appeared in 20 of the Nationals' first 
40 games, and struggled with poor command of his pitches. His command improved 
as his workload decreased,[68] and he was named to the appear in the 2014 
All-Star Game.[69] He ended the season with a 2.18 ERA,[70] and led MLB 
with 40 holds.[71] The Nationals traded Clippard to the Oakland Athletics 
for Yunel Escobar on January 14, 2015.[72][73] Clippard and the Athletics 
agreed on an $8.3 million salary for the 2015 season.[74] With Athletics' 
closer Sean Doolittle beginning the season on the disabled list, Clippard 
served as the team's closer.[75] Clippard saved 17 games for the Athletics, 
pitching to a 2.79 ERA in 38 2⁄3 innings.[71] On July 27, 2015, the Athletics 
traded Clippard to the New York Mets for pitching prospect Casey Meisner.[76] 
Clippard returned to a setup role, with Jeurys Familia remaining the Mets' 
closer.[77] In 32 1⁄3 innings with the Mets, Clippard pitched to a 3.06 
ERA. In the 2015 MLB postseason, Clippard allowed five earned runs in 6 2⁄3 
innings.[78] After receiving fewer contract offers than he had expected,[79] 
Clippard signed a two-year, $12.25 million contract with the Arizona Diamondbacks 
on February 8, 2016.[80] Through July 31, 2016, Clippard pitched to a 4.30 
ERA in 37 1⁄3 innings with one save.[81] On July 31, 2016, the Diamondbacks 
traded Clippard to the Yankees for Vicente Campos.[81] Clippard is listed 
at 6 feet 4 inches (1.93 m) and 170 pounds (77 kg).[82] He has an unorthodox 
pitching delivery,[10] rocking forward while sticking his gloved hand high 
in the air,[83] which creates an unusual arm angle while pitching, making 
it difficult for hitters to pick up the ball in their line of vision.[15] 
Clippard's father taught him to pitch this way when Clippard was eight 
years old by having him throw his baseball glove.[15] McCatty nicknamed 
Clippard's delivery "The Funk".[15] Clippard primarily throws a fastball 
and a changeup. His hard, straight four-seam fastball averages about 92–93 
miles per hour (148–150 km/h), topping out at 96 miles per hour (154 km/h), 
and sets up a deceptive changeup in the high 70s to low 80s. Periodically, 
he throws a cutter early in the count to right-handed hitters and a curveball 
in the mid 70s.[84] Nardi Contreras, who worked with Clippard as the Yankees' 
minor league pitching coordinator, indicated that Clippard's greatest success 
comes from his curveball and changeup.[83] Clippard has compiled a strikeout 
rate of greater than 10 per 9 innings over his career. According to Clippard, 
"I don't try to strike out everyone that I face. Strikeouts just kind of 
happen with the way I pitch."[85] Clippard was raised by his parents, Bob 
and Debbie Clippard.[3] He has a brother named Colin, who played Little
