Raymond Leonard Culp (born August 6, 1941 in Elgin, Texas) is a retired 
baseball pitcher who pitched for Major League Baseball's Philadelphia Phillies 
(1963–66), Chicago Cubs (1967), and Boston Red Sox (1968–73). His first 
year was an impressive one. Culp had a 14–11 record for the Phillies and 
was eighth in the National League in strikeouts, although his control was 
somewhat shaky, leading the league in walks. As a rookie he pitched a scoreless 
inning in the 1963 All-Star Game, retiring Al Kaline, Frank Malzone and 
Carl Yastrzemski in the fifth inning of a 5–3 victory. Culp returned to 
the All-Star game in 1969, pitching a perfect ninth inning for the American 
League. He retired Pete Rose on a foul pop fly and struck out Randy Hundley 
and Tony Perez. He strung together four steady seasons for the Red Sox 
from 1968–71, winning between 14 and 17 games in each. None of his teams 
during Culp's career appeared in a postseason game. In 11 seasons he had 
a 122–101 win-loss record, 322 games, 268 games started, 80 complete games, 
22 shutouts, 21 games finished, 1 save, 1,898 1⁄3 innings pitched, 1,677 
hits allowed, 863 runs allowed, 755 earned runs allowed, 188 home runs 
allowed, 752 walks allowed, 1,411 strikeouts, 70 hit batsmen, 73 wild pitches,
