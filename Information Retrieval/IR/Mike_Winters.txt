Michael John Winters (born November 19, 1958) is an umpire in Major League 
Baseball who has worked in the National League from 1988 to 1999 and throughout 
both major leagues since 2000. For the 2011 season, Winters was named a 
crew chief following the retirements of Jerry Crawford, Mike Reilly, and 
Chuck Meriwether. He umpired in the minor leagues from 1982 to 1989 before 
joining the NL's regular staff in 1990. Winters has worn uniform number 
33 his entire career. He has officiated the All-Star Game in 1995, 2007, 
2010, and 2016, the Division Series in 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2006, 
2010, 2013, 2014, and 2015, the League Championship Series in 1997, 2004, 
2008, 2011, and 2012, and the 2002, 2006, 2010, and 2015 World Series. 
He was crew chief for the Division Series in 1998, 1999, and 2014. On September 
23, 2007, Winters was accused of "baiting" San Diego Padres outfielder 
Milton Bradley in a game against the Colorado Rockies. When Bradley came 
to the plate in the eighth inning, plate umpire Brian Runge asked him if 
he had thrown his bat toward Runge following a strikeout in the fifth inning. 
Bradley denied having done so and asked Runge if Winters had told him that. 
Runge said Winters had not. After reaching first base, Bradley asked Winters 
if he had told Runge that Bradley had thrown his bat toward Runge, and 
Winters told him that he had indeed thrown his bat.[1] Bradley began arguing 
about the allegation, and Winters replied that he should "shut the fuck 
up and play the game," whereupon Bradley continued to argue and complained 
that Winters was "treating him like a piece of shit."[2] Winters reportedly 
replied that Bradley was a "fucking piece of shit," after which Bradley 
lunged at Winters and tore an anterior cruciate ligament in his knee while 
being restrained by manager Bud Black. Bradley later called Winters' reaction 
"the most unprofessional and most ridiculous thing I've ever seen. It's 
terrible. And now, because of him, my knee's hurt." Three days later, Major 
League Baseball suspended Winters for the remainder of the 2007 season 
due to his aiming a profanity at Bradley. Former Giants player Charlie 
Hayes also accused Winters of telling him to "go fuck himself" after Hayes 
was ejected for arguing balls and strikes in a June 1998 game, after which 
Hayes had to be restrained by then manager Dusty Baker. Winters denied 
that he had said that.[3] On August 17, 1992, Winters was the home plate 
umpire for Kevin Gross' no-hitter.[4] On June 28, 2007, Winters was at 
second base when Toronto Blue Jay Frank Thomas hit his 500th career home 
run off Minnesota Twins pitcher Carlos Silva. Later in the game, Thomas 
was ejected by plate umpire Mark Wegner for arguing balls and strikes, 
with Toronto manager John Gibbons also getting thrown out.[5] He was chosen 
as one of the umpires for the one-game Wild Card playoff between the Atlanta 
Braves and the St. Louis Cardinals on October 5, 2012.[6] On July 13, 2013, 
Winters served as the third base umpire for Tim Lincecum's no-hitter vs 
San Diego, his first no-hitter as a crew chief.[7] Winters served as one 
of three MLB umpire representatives for the November 2014 MLB Japan All-Star 
Series.[8] Winters went to college at San Diego State University and he 
currently lives in Carlsbad, California. He completed the New York City 
Marathon in 2007.[9] List of Major League Baseball umpires Interim (*)
