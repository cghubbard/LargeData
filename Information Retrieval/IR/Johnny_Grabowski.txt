John Patrick Grabowski (January 7, 1900 – May 23, 1946), nicknamed "Nig",

and Benny Bengough in 1927. Grabowski had a .350 on-base percentage for 
the 1927 Yankees. He remained with the Yankees through the 1929 season

After spending 1930 with the St. Paul Saints, Grabowski returned to the 
major leagues in 1930 with the Detroit Tigers.[5] He appeared in 40 games

and .295 on-base percentage.[1] Grabowski concluded his playing career 
playing for the Montreal Royals of the International League in 1932 and 
1933.[2] After retiring as a player, Grabowski became an umpire in the
