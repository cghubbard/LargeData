Joshua Patrick Beckett (born May 15, 1980) is an American former professional 
baseball pitcher. A three-time Major League Baseball (MLB) All-Star, he 
played for the Florida Marlins, Boston Red Sox, and the Los Angeles Dodgers. 
After a stellar high school career, where he was regarded as one of the 
top prospects in the country, he was drafted by the Marlins with the second 
pick in the 1999 MLB draft. He won the 2003 World Series with the Marlins 
and the 2007 World Series with the Red Sox, and received the 2007 American 
League Championship Most Valuable Player (MVP) award and the 2003 World 
Series MVP award. He was traded from the Marlins to the Red Sox in 2006 
and from the Red Sox to the Dodgers in 2012, both as part of multi-player 
transactions. Beckett recovered from a serious injury that caused him to 
miss most of the 2013 season and pitched a no hitter against the Philadelphia 
Phillies on May 25, 2014 for the Dodgers, becoming the 19th man to do so 
in Dodgers history. However, his season was again cut short due to an injury 
and he announced his retirement on October 7, 2014. Beckett grew up idolizing 
fellow Texans Nolan Ryan and Roger Clemens.[1] As a youth, he starred on 
Little League All-Star teams.[2] He later attended Spring High School in 
Spring, Texas. He had trouble with grades and not paying attention to his 
coach during his freshman year. His coach was so frustrated with him he 
threw him off the team.[3] He went through a growth spurt before his sophomore 
year and added speed to his fastball.[1] He also raised his GPA and was 
able to get back on the team, where he had a 9–3 record with a 1.18 earned 
run average (ERA) as a sophomore, tossing three no-hitters.[3] As a high 
school junior, Beckett was ranked by Baseball America as the top high school 
prospect in the country and his team as the top high school baseball team. 
He went 13–2 and struck out 2.1 batters per inning while walking only 20 
batters all season.[3] His high school coach said "I’ve never seen a pitcher 
with his ability—ever."[3] In his senior season, Beckett, by this point 
nicknamed "Kid Heat,"[1] was named the High School player of the year by 
USA Today.[4] Beckett signed a letter of intent to pitch for Texas A&M 
University,[5] but he and Josh Hamilton were seen as the top two players 
available in the 1999 Major League Baseball draft.[6] Concerned about Beckett's 
perceived arrogance, the Tampa Bay Devil Rays picked Hamilton with the 
first pick.[7] Beckett was selected with the second pick by the Florida 
Marlins. Marlins scouting director Al Avila said at the time, "Beckett 
has good size and has an overpowering fastball. He's a bulldog on the mound."[8] 
Showing his confidence, Beckett predicted that he would make it to the 
major leagues within two years and play in an All-Star game by 2001.[8] 
Beckett engaged in protracted negotiations with the Marlins, during which 
he briefly enrolled at Blinn Junior College,[2] but he eventually signed 
on August 28, 1999 to a four-year $7 million contract that included a $3.625 
million signing bonus. His signing bonus was larger than what the Marlins 
were paying everyone on the Major League roster, except pitcher Alex Fernandez.[9] 
Beckett impressed the Marlins in his first spring training with the team 
in March 2000, with a fastball clocked at 94 to 96 miles per hour (151–154 km/h) 
and a good curveball.[10] He also showed his commitment to the team by 
donating $100,000 to the team's charitable foundation, more than any other 
player had donated.[11] He was assigned to the Kane County Cougars of the 
Class A Midwest League to make his professional debut. As the Opening Day 
starter for the Cougars, he pitched four innings and allowed only one run, 
on a double by Albert Pujols.[12] Beckett suffered from injuries that season, 
including shoulder tendinitis and a frayed rotator cuff, injuries which 
took longer to heal because he did too much weight lifting while on the 
disabled list. He would later say, "I tried to get too strong too quick 
and ended up making things worse."[13] He pitched in 13 games for the Cougars 
and finished with a record of 2–3 with a 2.12 ERA and 61 strikeouts.[14] 
He was selected by Baseball America as the Marlins best prospect and the 
19th best in the entire minor leagues as well as having the best fastball 
in the Midwest League.[15] He was also selected to play in the All-Star 
Futures Game, a showcase for the best prospects.[16] The Marlins assigned 
Beckett to the Brevard County Manatees of the Florida State League at the 
start of the 2001 season. He didn't allow an earned run in his first 38 
2⁄3 innings and went 6–0 with a 1.23 ERA and 101 strikeouts in 13 games.[13][17] 
Marlins General Manager Dave Dombrowski remarked on his progress, "He pitched 
as well in the Florida State League as any prospect I've ever been associated 
with", leading to a promotion to the Double A Portland Sea Dogs of the 
Eastern League.[13] Beckett struck out eight of the first nine batters 
he faced in his Sea Dogs debut on June 16, 2001.[18] On August 13, 2001 
he combined with two other Sea Dogs pitchers to throw a no-hitter against 
the Binghamton Mets.[18] In 13 starts for the team, he had an 8–1 record, 
a 1.82 ERA and struck out 102 batters.[19] He was selected by Baseball 
America, USA Today, and the Sporting News as the "Minor League Player of 
the Year".[18] Baseball America also ranked him as the Marlins best prospect 
and the third best in all of baseball and the Marlins awarded him as their 
organizational minor league player of the year.[15] Beckett's MLB debut 
was on September 4, 2001, against the Chicago Cubs, in which he gave up 
one hit over six shutout innings to pick up his first MLB win. He also 
doubled and scored in the game. Beckett was quoted afterwards as saying, 
"It was fun. I'm ready for my next one."[20] He did not allow a run in 
his first 10 innings before giving up a two-run homer to Vladimir Guerrero 
on September 19 against the Montreal Expos.[15] He finished 2001 with four 
games started, a 2–2 record, and an ERA of 1.50.[21] Hampered by blister 
problems in 2002, Beckett's highlight was on July 21, when he struck out 
12 Expos in one game, combining with a couple of relief pitchers on a Marlins 
record 17 strikeouts in a nine-inning game.[22] In 23 appearances for the 
Marlins in 2002, which included two relief appearances, he was 6–7 with 
a 4.10 ERA and 113 strikeouts.[21] Beckett was named the Marlins opening 
day starting pitcher in 2003, and at 23 years old was the youngest opening 
day starter in the team's history. However, he lasted just 2 2⁄3 innings 
in the game as the Philadelphia Phillies scored five unearned runs in the 
third as a result of two errors and a passed ball.[23] He subsequently 
went on the disabled list (DL) with a sprained right elbow in mid-May, 
part of a string of team injuries that contributed to the firing of Manager 
Jeff Torborg.[24] He returned from his injury on July 1 and finished the 
season with a 9–8 record, a 3.04 ERA and 152 strikeouts.[25] Beckett made 
his postseason debut in the opening game of the 2003 National League (NL) 
Division Series, where he allowed only one run in seven innings against 
the San Francisco Giants but picked up the loss as Jason Schmidt pitched 
a complete game shutout.[26] However, the Marlins came back to win the 
series in four games.[27] His next start, in game one of the 2003 NL Championship 
Series against the Chicago Cubs, did not go well as he allowed four runs 
in the first inning, two of them on a home run by Moisés Alou, and six 
runs in his 6 1⁄3 innings. The Marlins battled back and won the game in 
extra innings.[28] The Cubs took the next three games and only needed one 
more win to take the series when Beckett returned to the mound in game 
five. He allowed only three Cubs to reach base in the game, on two singles 
and a walk, in the complete game shutout to keep his team alive.[29] The 
Marlins took game six also, thanks partly to the infamous Steve Bartman 
incident.[30] In game seven, on two days rest, Beckett came in out of the 
bullpen to pitch four innings and the Marlins won 9–6 to clinch the National 
League championship.[31] Beckett won the 2003 World Series MVP Award with 
two strong performances on three days' rest as the Marlins defeated the 
New York Yankees. In game three, he struck out 10 and allowed only two 
runs in 7 1⁄3 innings[32] and then in game six at Yankee Stadium, he shut 
out the Yankees in a complete game, striking out nine batters and clinching 
the series by making the tag for the final out.[33] Beckett made the opening 
day start for the Marlins again in 2004, allowing one run in seven innings 
against the Expos.[34] He made three trips to the DL during the season, 
but still pitched a career high 26 starts and 156 2⁄3 innings.[15] He was 
9–9 with a 3.79 ERA and had 152 strikeouts for the second year in a row 
but the Marlins faltered down the stretch and did not make the postseason.[21] 
In 2005, he was 15–8 with a 3.38 ERA and 166 strikeouts in 29 games.[21] 
In his five seasons with the Marlins, Beckett had a 41–34 record, a 3.46 
ERA and struck out a total of 607 batters in 106 games.[21] In his final 
start as a Marlin, on September 23, 2005, against the Atlanta Braves, he 
struck out six in seven shutout innings but earned a no decision in a game 
the Marlins eventually lost.[35] In a deal that was made official on Thanksgiving 
Day 2005, Beckett was traded to the Boston Red Sox along with third baseman 
Mike Lowell and relief pitcher Guillermo Mota for minor league shortstop 
Hanley Ramírez (the top prospect in the Red Sox system at the time) and 
pitchers Aníbal Sánchez, Jesús Delgado and Harvey García.[36] Beckett and 
Lowell were among a prominent list of veterans the Marlins traded in an 
effort to shed salary. This was organizationally termed a market correction.[37] 
In his first start with the Red Sox, Beckett allowed only one run in seven 
innings to pick up the win against the Texas Rangers on April 5, 2006.[38] 
Beckett was the first Red Sox pitcher to hit a home run in 35 years — since 
the advent of the designated hitter rule — when he took Phillies' pitcher 
Brett Myers deep during an interleague game on May 20, 2006.[39] On July 
18, he signed a three-year, $30 million contract extension with a $10 million 
club option for 2010.[40] Beckett completed his first season with the Red 
Sox with a record of 16–11 and a 5.01 ERA. In 204 2⁄3 innings, he gave 
up 191 hits and struck out 158 batters while walking 74. He also allowed 
36 home runs, tied for second most in the majors.[21] At the start of the 
2007 season, Beckett adjusted to throwing more breaking pitches and fewer 
fastballs. At the same time, he learned to locate his pitches rather than 
simply get strikes by power.[41] He reduced his walks and home runs allowed 
by nearly half, contributing to his success in 2007.[21] Beckett became 
one of six Red Sox pitchers in history to win their first seven starts. 
George Winter and Mickey Harris both won their first seven starts in a 
season, and Babe Ruth, Dave Ferriss and Roger Moret all won their first 
eight starts in a season.[15] After a strong first half, posting a 12–2 
record with a 3.44 ERA, he was selected to the American League team in 
the 2007 MLB All-Star Game.[15] Beckett earned the victory in the game 
after pitching two innings, giving up only one hit, and striking out two.[42] 
Beckett became the first pitcher to win 20 games in a season since 2005, 
finishing the season with a record of 20–7, a 3.27 ERA, 194 strikeouts, 
a 1.14 WHIP, and only 40 walks and 17 home runs allowed.[15] Beckett started 
the first game of the 2007 American League Championship Series (ALCS) and 
pitched six innings for the win and in game five he struck out 11 in eight 
innings. Beckett's 2–0 record and 1.93 ERA against the Cleveland Indians 
earned him the 2007 ALCS MVP Award.[43] He then started and won the first 
game of the 2007 World Series against the Colorado Rockies, pitching seven 
innings, allowing one run on six hits, and striking out nine batters. Boston 
would go on to sweep the Rockies in the series.[44] On May 8, 2008, Beckett 
recorded his 1,000th career strikeout, when Brandon Inge of the Detroit 
Tigers struck out swinging in the seventh inning.[45] He was 12–10 with 
a 4.03 ERA in 27 starts.[21] In game three of the 2008 American League 
Division Series against the Anaheim Angels he allowed four runs in five 
innings[46] He then made two starts in the 2008 ALCS against the Tampa 
Bay Rays and was 1–0 but had a high 9.64 ERA.[47] In 2009, during his first 
Opening Day start with the Red Sox, Beckett struck out 10 through seven 
innings allowing only one run and two hits in a 5–3 victory over the Rays.[48] 
On April 14, 2009, MLB fined and suspended him six games for intentionally 
throwing over the head of Angels outfielder Bobby Abreu.[49] Beckett later 
appealed the suspension and got it reduced to five games.[50] On June 20, 
2009, he recorded his first complete game shutout in three years against 
the Atlanta Braves in a duel against former Red Sox pitcher Derek Lowe. 
The shutout was his first in a Red Sox uniform.[51] On July 5, 2009, he 
was selected to represent Boston in the 2009 MLB All Star Game.[52] Beckett 
recorded his 100th career win on July 12, 2009, pitching a complete game 
shutout against the Kansas City Royals at Fenway Park.[53] On August 7, 
2009, against the New York Yankees, he engaged in a pitching duel with 
former Marlins teammate A. J. Burnett that turned into a fifteen-inning, 
five-hour-and-thirty-three-minute game. He threw seven shutout innings, 
Burnett threw seven and two thirds. The Red Sox eventually lost the game 
in the bottom of the 15th, when Alex Rodriguez hit a walk-off two run home 
run.[54] He was 17–6 on the season, with a 3.86 ERA in 32 starts.[21] He 
lost his one start in the postseason, to the Angels in game two of the 
2009 ALDS.[55] On April 5, 2010, the Red Sox and Beckett agreed to a four-year, 
$68 million contract extension, through 2014.[56] On May 7, he allowed 
nine runs, struck out eight and also hit two batters. This was the first 
time a Major League pitcher had that combination of stats in a single game 
since Jack Coombs of the Philadelphia Athletics during the 1911 season.[15] 
He was placed on the disabled list on May 19 with a lower back strain and 
returned from the injury on July 23.[57] On September 16, he recorded his 
1,000th strikeout as a member of the Red Sox against Tampa Bay's Ben Zobrist 
in the sixth inning.[58] In 21 starts in 2010, he was 6–6 with a 5.78 ERA.[21] 
In 2011 he posted career highs in ERA (2.89), opponent batting average 
(.211) and WHIP (1.03).[15] He was 13–7 in 30 games[21] and was selected 
to his third All-Star Game.[59] At the end of the 2011 season, the Red 
Sox stumbled and failed to make the playoffs. Beckett and two more starting 
pitchers (John Lackey and Jon Lester) were in the center of a controversy 
where the three drank alcohol during games, where they weren't pitching, 
and also ate fried chicken and played video games. Beckett was noted as 
the leader of this and some cited this behavior as part of the reason for 
the team's poor play down the stretch.[60] Beckett struggled in the 2012 
season, he went 5–11 with a 5.23 ERA as a Red Sox.[21] He was also the 
center of yet another controversy when it was reported that he played several 
rounds of golf despite having been scratched from his start due to a lat 
muscle injury.[61] In what would turn out to be his final start with the 
Red Sox, he allowed four runs in six innings on August 19, 2012 against 
the Yankees.[62] Over seven seasons, he started 194 regular season games 
for the Red Sox with a 89–58 record, a 4.17 ERA and 1,108 strikeouts.[21] 
On August 25, 2012, he was traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers (along with 
Adrian Gonzalez, Carl Crawford and Nick Punto and $11 million in cash) 
for James Loney, Iván DeJesús, Jr., Allen Webster, and two players to be 
named later (Jerry Sands and Rubby De La Rosa).[63] He started seven games 
for the Dodgers after the trade and was 2–3 with a 2.93 ERA.[21] Beckett 
struggled in the early part of the 2013 season with an 0–5 record and 5.19 
ERA in eight starts. He was placed on the disabled list with a groin strain 
on May 15.[64] While on the disabled list he began to experience numbness 
and tingling in his hand so he went to see a nerve specialist and expressed 
doubt as to whether he would be able to pitch again. The Dodgers shut him 
down from pitching for a month while he underwent a rigorous rehabilitation 
program in an effort to avoid season-ending surgery.[65] However, the tingling 
sensation returned when he attempted to resume his throwing program in 
late June. He was diagnosed with thoracic outlet syndrome, which required 
him to undergo surgery on July 10, 2013 that ended his 2013 season.[66] 
Beckett's surgery, which included his having a rib removed, made him a 
question mark for the Dodgers heading into 2014.[67] He returned to the 
Dodgers on April 9 and made his first start since the previous May, allowing 
four runs in four innings.[68] On May 13, he picked up his first win since 
2012.[69] On May 25, 2014, Beckett pitched a no-hitter against the Philadelphia 
Phillies at Citizens Bank Park, the 21st no-hitter in Dodgers history, 
and the first since Hideo Nomo did so in the 1996 season. He threw 128 
pitches, struck out six, and walked three en route to the victory.[70][71] 
Beckett also became the oldest pitcher (34) to throw a no hitter since 
Randy Johnson (40) threw a perfect game in 2004.[72] He was honored as 
the National League Player of the Week as a result of that game.[73] On 
July 8, 2014, Beckett landed on the disabled list with a left hip impingement, 
an injury he said had gotten worse as the season went on.[74] He returned 
to the rotation on July 22,[75] but struggled when he returned.[76] In 
a start on August 3, he was only able to pitch four innings against the 
Cubs.[77] Afterward, Beckett told the team that he had experienced renewed 
discomfort in his injured hip.[78] An MRI revealed that his hip impingement 
had resulted in a torn labrum and two cysts, possibly requiring season 
ending surgery. He was placed back on the 15-day disabled list on August 
8.[79] On September 3, 2014, Dodgers manager Don Mattingly told reporters 
that Beckett's season was likely over due to his injury.[80] A couple of 
days later, Beckett confirmed that he would not pitch again in 2014 and 
added that he was also considering retirement.[81] Beckett officially announced 
his retirement on October 7, 2014.[82] Beckett threw five pitches regularly: 
a four-seam fastball (91 to 94 miles per hour (146–151 km/h)), a two-seam 
fastball (91 to 94 miles per hour (146–151 km/h)), a cutter (89 to 91 miles 
per hour (143–146 km/h)), a curveball (73 to 79 miles per hour (117–127 km/h)), 
and a changeup (86 to 88 miles per hour (138–142 km/h)). Beckett uses all 
five of his pitches against left-handed hitters but drops the changeup 
against righties. He tends to use his curveball when ahead in the count, 
bolstered by its 34% whiff rate. Beckett also began to experiment with 
a slider and splitter in 2012.[83] Beckett has been linked to such celebrities 
as model/sportcaster Leeann Tweeden and country singer Danielle Peck.[84] 
On October 18, 2007, Peck was invited by the Cleveland Indians to sing 
the National Anthem prior to Game 5 of the American League Championship 
Series between the Red Sox and Indians. Beckett was the starting pitcher 
in that game, and some Red Sox fans theorized that her invitation was an 
attempt by the Indians organization to distract Beckett. The Indians denied 
this claim.[85] It did not seem to affect Beckett, as he beat the Indians 
with eight innings pitched, five hits, one walk, one earned run, and eleven 
strikeouts. In a postgame interview with Beckett, when asked if he was 
affected by Peck's presence, Beckett replied, "I don't get paid to make 
those decisions. She's a friend of mine. It doesn't bother me at all. Thanks 
for flyin' one of my friends to the game so she could watch it for free."[86] 
On January 22, 2011, he married Holly Fisher, an aeronautics engineer and 
former high school classmate.[87] Josh and Holly have two daughters, Ryann 
and Sage.[15] Beckett is an avid deer hunter and has been since childhood. 
He was the 2002 winner of the Muy Grande Deer Contest for bringing down 
the largest buck during the Texas deer hunting season.[2] He owns Herradura 
Ranch, a 7,000 acres (28 km2) deer-hunting ranch outside of Cotulla, Texas.[88] 
He was featured in a Kevin Fowler music video alongside his teammates John
