Philip George Bartelme (August 16, 1876 – May 3, 1954), also known as P.G. 
Bartelme and sometimes spelled "Barthelme", was the second athletic director 
of the University of Michigan, holding the position from 1909-1921. Bartelme 
is credited with bringing the sports of basketball, hockey and swimming 
to varsity status at Michigan and with leading Michigan back into the Big 
Ten Conference after its withdrawal in 1907. The only athletic directors 
to serve a longer tenure at Michigan are Fielding H. Yost (1921-1940), 
Fritz Crisler (1941-1968), and Don Canham (1968-1988). After leaving Michigan 
in 1921, Bartelme spent the rest of his career in the world of professional 
baseball, serving as the president of the Syracuse Stars (1922-1925), the 
head of the St. Louis Cardinals' farm system in the 1930s, president of 
the Sacramento Solons (1936-1944), and a scout for the Brooklyn Dodgers. 
Bartelme's baseball career was closely tied to that of Branch Rickey, who 
Bartelme had hired as Michigan's baseball coach in 1910. A native of Chicago, 
Illinois, Bartelme was a student manager for the 1902 Michigan Wolverines 
football team. On November 1, 1902, Michigan played Wisconsin at Marshall 
Field in Chicago before a crowd of 23,000 persons. The stadium became so 
densely packed that one of the temporary grandstands hastily erected to 
support 400 persons collapsed, injuring several persons. The game was stopped 
for ten minutes while order was restored, and Bartelme immediately gave 
the order that no more tickets were to be sold. Thousands were turned away.[1] 
Bartelme became Michigan's second athletic director in 1909 following the 
resignation of Charles A. Baird. He was appointed to the position on March 
24, 1909 by the university's Board of Regents at a salary of $2,700 per 
year.[2] He took over the position on July 1, 1909.[3][4] 1909.[3][4] When 
Bartelme took over as athletic director, Michigan had withdrawn from the 
Western Conference. One of his principle accomplishments was the return 
of Michigan to the conference. In September 1909, Barthelme made his views 
known: "I always have thought that Michigan's place is in the conference, 
and moreover, I have thought that when conditions were so we could return, 
it would be the only thing for us to do. However, I am not so sure that 
that time has come."[5] He noted that the "training table" was the biggest 
obstacle to Michigan's rejoining the conference. Bartelme noted that the 
training table was "a great factor in getting the men into the condition 
necessary for hard football" and avoiding serious injuries.[5] Bartelme 
is credited with bringing the sports of basketball, hockey and swimming 
to varsity status at Michigan[6] He also oversaw the construction of the 
Athletic Administration Building and hired the university's first full-time 
director of intramural sports.[6] In 1921, Bartelme led an investigation 
to determine whether Vernon Parks, the captain of Michigan's baseball team 
and leading pitcher in the Big Ten Conference, had played baseball for 
Portland in the Pacific Coast League under the assumed name, Harold Brooks. 
Barthelme noted, "This Brooks won 90 percent of his games I am told. I 
have seen his picture and I am certain he is really Vernon Parks, our star 
pitcher. If the charges are true, there is no doubt that the University 
of Michigan will take drastic action."[7] Parks admitted to Bartelme that 
he had played for Portland and at the same time resigned from the Michigan 
team.[8] While serving as athletic director, Bartelme was responsible for 
giving Branch Rickey his start in baseball administration. Michigan's baseball 
coach quit in 1910, and Rickey, who was then a law student at Michigan, 
applied for the job. Rickey asked every alumnus he had ever met to write 
letters to Bartelme on his behalf. Bartelme recalled, "Day after day those 
letters came in."[9] Bartelme was reportedly impressed with Rickey's passion 
for baseball and his idealism about the proper role of athletics on a college 
campus.[10] Bartelme convinced the dean of the law school that Rickey could 
handle his law studies and serving as the school's baseball coach.[11] 
Bartelme reportedly called Rickey into his office to tell him he had the 
job if only "to put a stop to those damn letters that come in every day."[12] 
The hiring also marked the beginning of a lifelong friendship and business 
relationship between Rickey and Bartelme. Bartelme and Rickey worked together 
for most of the next 35 years, and in 1944 a California newspaper noted: 
"He and Rickey have had a close association in baseball ever since Bartelme 
was head of the athletic department of the University of Michigan where 
Rickey took to baseball just as a means to build up his failing health."[13] 
In 1922, Bartelme purchased a one-half interest in the Syracuse Stars baseball 
club of the International League.[14] John Conway Toole, president of the 
league, said at the time, "Mr. Bartelme was a high type sportsman and would 
be a valuable addition to the league."[15] Bartelme joined his friend Branch 
Rickey as a partner in ownership of the Stars.[14] In late 1923, Bartelme 
and Rickey proposed moving the Syracuse team to Montreal.[16][17] However, 
the Stars remained in Syracuse with Bartelme acting as the club's president 
from 1922-1925.[18] Bartelme sold his interest in the Stars in January 
1926.[19][20] At the time of the sale, the Syracuse Herald praised Bartelme 
for his contributions to Syracuse baseball: "Bartelme worked hand in hand 
with the Cardinals club during his three years and a half here and gave 
Syracuse the best baseball it has ever enjoyed."[20] Among Bartelme's most 
profitable moves was his sale of slugger Jim Bottomley to the St. Louis 
Cardinals for $30,000. The Stars had acquired Bottomley for $1,000, and 
he quickly became a sensation while playing for the Stars.[20] Upon selling 
his interest in the Syracuse Stars, Bartleme went into business with a 
manufacturing concern in St. Augustine, Florida.[19] Bartelme invested 
considerable money in a firm constructing hollow brick tile for the building 
business in Florida. With Florida experiencing a building boom in 1926, 
Bartelme reported that he felt that his entire time must be devoted to 
his new business.[20] In March 1928, Bartelme and Branch Rickey purchased 
the Dayton baseball franchise in the new Central League, and Bartelme became 
the club's president.[21] According to a biography of Rickey, Bartelme 
was set back by "business losses in Florida" and was brought to St. Louis 
by Rickey as an office administrator.[22] By 1929, press accounts identified 
Bartelme as assistant to Rickey for minor league relations.[23][24] Bartelme 
continued to serve as vice president in charge of the Cardinals' minor 
league operations during Rickey's time in St. Louis.[25] In December 1935, 
press accounts referred to him as the head of the Cardinals' chain of baseball 
farm teams.[26] During Bartelme's tenure, the Cardinals' farm system produced 
the stars who would form the core of the Gashouse Gang teams of the 1930s, 
including Pepper Martin, Dizzy Dean and Joe Medwick—players who were integral 
parts of the 1934 Cardinals team that won the World Series. The farm system 
operated by Rickey and Bartelme was so successful that Commissioner of 
Baseball Kenesaw Mountain Landis twice released over 70 of the Cardinals' 
minor leaguer players. Nevertheless, Rickey and Bartelme's farm system 
remained, and similar systems were adopted by every major league team within 
a few years. When the Cardinals purchased the Sacramento Solons of the 
Pacific Coast League in December 1935, Bartelme was sent to California 
to take over as the club president. Bartelme was president of the Solons 
from January 1936 until February 1944, when the Cardinals pulled out of 
their interest in the Sacramento club.[25] The Oakland Tribune noted that 
Bartelme was "one of the finest men in baseball and is well liked in Sacramento."[27] 
The Tribune's sports editor, Lee Dunbar, referred to Bartelme as "one of 
my favorite people."[28] After the Cardinals sold the Solons, Bartelme 
was again hired by his old friend, Branch Rickey, who had then taken over 
as president of the Brooklyn Dodgers. Bartelme remained in Sacramento and 
became a scout for the Dodgers in California.[28] Bartelme died on May 
3, 1954 in Carmel, California at age 75.[25] He was survived by his wife 
Mina Chase Bartelme.[25] Pound sign (#) denotes interim athletic director.
