Thomas F. La Stella (born January 31, 1989) is an American third baseman 
in the Chicago Cubs organization of Major League Baseball (MLB). He made 
his MLB debut with the Atlanta Braves in 2014, and was traded to the Cubs 
before the 2015 season. Born in Westwood, New Jersey to Phil and Jane La 
Stella on January 31, 1989, Tommy and his two siblings grew up in nearby 
Closter.[1][2] La Stella attended Saint Joseph Regional High School in 
Montvale, New Jersey, St. John's University and Coastal Carolina University. 
He played college baseball for both the St. John's Red Storm and Coastal 
Carolina Chanticleers.[3] La Stella appeared in 125 games (all starts) 
for the Chanticleers in 2010/2011 and hit .388 with 28 home runs and 136 
RBI. He committed only 12 errors in 509 chances for Coastal Carolina, resulting 
in a .976 fielding percentage. The Braves selected La Stella in the eighth 
round of the 2011 MLB Draft, and he spent the rest of the season with the 
Rome Braves of the Class A South Atlantic League. In 2012, he played for 
the Lynchburg Hillcats of the Class A-Advanced Carolina League. In 2013, 
he played for the Mississippi Braves of the Class AA Southern League.[4] 
With the Mississippi Braves, La Stella had a .343 batting average in 81 
games.[5] The Braves invited La Stella to spring training in 2014.[6][7] 
He began the 2014 season with the Gwinnett Braves of the Class AAA International 
League, and debuted at the major league level on May 28, hitting two singles 
in his first game.[8] La Stella hit his first major league home run on 
August 8, 2014, against Stephen Strasburg of the Washington Nationals.[9] 
He finished the year with a .251 batting average in 93 games.[10] On November 
16, 2014, the Braves traded La Stella, along with an international signing 
bonus slot, to the Chicago Cubs for Arodys Vizca√≠no and three international 
signing bonus slots.[11][12] La Stella made the Cubs' Opening Day roster, 
but only played in two games before straining his right oblique on April 
10, 2015. While rehabilitating at the minor league level with the Tennessee 
Smokies, La Stella suffered another oblique strain.[13] He came off the 
disabled list in August, and was sent to the Iowa Cubs of the Class AAA 
Pacific Coast League.[14] On August 24 he was recalled from Iowa and rejoined 
the major league club.[15] In limited time with Chicago, La Stella was 
used mainly as a pinch hitter, a role in which he excelled.[16] To increase 
his versatility, La Stella began playing third base during the regular 
season.[17] In 33 games,[18] La Stella hit .269,[19] and started at third 
base during the National League Wild Card Game against the Pittsburgh Pirates.[20] 
After batting .295 for the Cubs in 2016, the Cubs optioned La Stella to 
Iowa on July 29, but he did not immediately report.[21] The Cubs put La 
Stella on the temporarily inactive list. He agreed to report to Tennessee 
on August 17.[22] Upon being recalled on August 31, La Stella stated that 
his refusal to report to the minors stemmed mainly from a lack of enjoyment 
for the game at the time of his demotion.[23][24] In 74 games of 2016, 
La Stella finished by batting .270 with two home runs and 11 RBI. The Cubs 
would eventually win the World Series, effectively ending their 108-year 
long drought. La Stella had one at bat in the postseason and won his first 
world championship.[25] La Stella was on the roster for the 2016 National 
League Division Series, but was replaced by left-handed pitcher Rob Zastryzny 
for the 2016 National League Championship Series.[26] Kyle Schwarber was
