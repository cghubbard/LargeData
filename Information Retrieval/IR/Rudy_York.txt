Preston Rudolph York (August 17, 1913 – February 5, 1970) was a professional 
baseball player and manager. He played all or part of thirteen seasons 
in Major League Baseball for the Detroit Tigers (1934, 1937–45), Boston 
Red Sox (1946–47), Chicago White Sox (1947) and Philadelphia Athletics 
(1948), primarily as a first baseman. York was born in Ragland, Alabama. 
He batted and threw right-handed. With one-eighth Cherokee ancestry and 
less-than-perfect fielding abilities, York prompted one sportswriter to 
declare: "He is part Indian and part first baseman".[citation needed] York's 
family moved from Ragland, Alabama, to Aragon, Georgia, when Rudy was a 
small boy. Rudy's mother moved the family to the Cartersville, Georgia, 
area sometime in the late 1920s. They lived in the American Textile Company 
(ATCO) mill town on the outskirts of Cartersville, where Rudy began working 
in his early teens. In his mid-teens, York was playing baseball with older 
men on the ATCO mill team and receiving local attention for his prowess 
at the plate. York became the team's star player from 1930 to 1933.[citation 
needed] York received a tryout and was signed as a second baseman by the 
Knoxville club of the Southern League in April 1933 but was released after 
appearing in just three games. Rudy returned to the Atco community and 
briefly resumed play with the mill team. He spent most of June of that 
year playing for a semi-pro team in Albany, Georgia, before returning to 
Atco for another brief stint with the mill team. In early July, Detroit 
scout Eddie Goosetree signed him for the Tigers. Assigned briefly to Shreveport 
of the Dixie League, he finished the 1933 season with Beaumont of the Texas 
League. After playing most of the 1934 season with the Fort Worth Cats 
of the Texas League ("on loan" from Beaumont), York had a brief stay with 
the Tigers at the end of the 1934 season. He played three games, two as 
a catcher, and batted just six times and tallied one hit – a single. Although 
he was on the Tigers' roster for the 1934 World Series,[citation needed] 
he saw no action in the Fall Classic. At the end of the year, he was shipped 
back to Beaumont. As a first baseman, York was selected the MVP of the 
Texas League in 1935 while with Beaumont, and he won the same award in 
the American Association in 1936 when he played for Milwaukee. York went 
back to Detroit to stay in 1937. Since there was no room for a rookie first 
baseman on a team that already had Hank Greenberg, York started the season 
at third base but his defensive liabilities were just too much to overlook.[citation 
needed] After a brief try in left field, he was benched in favor of more 
experienced outfielders. After being inactive for much of the month of 
June, Rudy was reinstalled at third base in the hopes that his big bat 
would come alive and help keep Detroit in the pennant race. While Rudy's 
bat did start to come around in July, by the end of the month he was back 
on the bench when regular third baseman Marv Owen returned from a broken 
wrist. In early August, Tigers manager Mickey Cochrane decided to put Rudy 
behind the plate in the place of Birdie Tebbetts, a good defensive catcher 
who was barely hitting. Cochrane had himself been the Tigers' regular catcher 
until his playing career was ended that May when he was hit in the head 
by a pitch from the Yankees' Bump Hadley. As a rookie catcher, Rudy startled 
the baseball world. On the last day of August 1937, York belted two home 
runs, giving him 18 for the month and surpassing the record of 17 set by 
Babe Ruth in September 1927.[citation needed] York also collected 49 RBI 
that month breaking by one the mark set by Lou Gehrig,[citation needed] 
and finished his rookie season with a .307 batting average, 35 home runs, 
and 101 RBI in only 375 at bats. Later in the season, Cochrane insisted 
that the rookie try to become the team's regular catcher. York was the 
Tigers' starting catcher in 1938, although he also played 14 games in left 
field. A year later, he shared duties with Birdie Tebbetts. Then, in 1940 
the Tigers persuaded Greenberg to switch from first base to left field,[citation 
needed] moved York to first, and replaced him behind the plate with Tebbetts. 
The experiment was successful. In that season Greenberg hit .340 with 41 
home runs and 150 RBI, and York compiled .316, 33 and 134, for an American 
League champion team that lost to the Cincinnati Reds in the 1940 World 
Series in seven games. In the series, York batted .231 (6-for-26) with 
one home run and two RBI. In addition, York was nominated for the AL MVP 
Award. With Greenberg out in the military service, York was the only offensive 
support for the Tigers in 1941. He hit 27 home runs (including a three-home-run 
game) with 111 RBI. In 1942, York slipped to 21 HR and 90 RBI, but in 1943 
he enjoyed a career season when he led the league in home runs (34), RBI 
(118), total bases (301), extra base hits (67), slugging percentage (.527) 
and games played (155), and also he got his second MVP consideration. York 
fell below 20 homers in 1944 and 1945 (18 each), and had a poor performance 
in the 1945 World Series, when Detroit defeated the Cubs in seven games. 
York was traded to Boston in January 1946 for infielder Eddie Lake. It 
turned out to be a good deal for the Red Sox. York crashed two grand slams 
in a game against the Browns on July 27 as part of a 10 RBI day, and helped 
lead Boston to the American League pennant. In that season, York hit .276 
with 17 home runs and 119 RBI. He added two decisive homers in the 1946 
World Series against the Cardinals: a 10th-inning game-winner in Game One, 
and a three-run winner in the Game Three. Finally, St. Louis took the series 
four games to three. In 1947, York nearly died when a fire, believed to 
have been started by a cigarette, swept his hotel room.[1] A rare highlight 
that season came on April 23, when Yankees Allie Reynolds pitched a two-hit 
shutout against Boston. The only hits were delivered by York. After a slow 
start, however, he was traded to the Chicago White Sox in the mid-season. 
He was given his unconditional release in February 1948, and was picked 
up by the Philadelphia Athletics, for what would be his final season as 
a major leaguer. He played in just 31 games, batting just .157. After his 
major league baseball career ended, York continued to play when and where 
he could. It is believed that his playing career finally ended in 1952 
when he batted .258 with two home runs for Benson-DeGraff in Minnesota's 
Class AA amateur Western Minny league.[2] Regarded as a "wood" man rather 
than a "glove" man, York responded in his own terms slugging his way to 
major league fame, while his managers tried to figure out the position 
where he could do the least damage as a fielder. Nevertheless, York tried 
at a variety of positions. He was too awkward at third, too heavy footed 
for the outfield, extremely wild as a pitcher, and an immobile target as 
a catcher.[citation needed] From the beginning, though, he was a menacing 
figure with a bat and amazingly dangerous with the bases loaded—he hit 
12 career grand slams, including two in a game. York was a career .275 
hitter with 277 home runs and 1152 RBI in 1603 games. In three World Series 
he hit .221 with three homers and 10 RBI. He was selected for the All-Star 
Game seven times. York's .503 slugging percentage as a Detroit Tiger ranks 
#4 in franchise history behind Hank Greenberg, Harry Heilmann, and Ty Cobb 
among players with at least 5,000 plate appearances with the team.[3] His 
239 home runs as a Tiger ranks #7 in franchise history.[3] York's post-playing 
baseball career included stints as a manager in the low minor leagues, 
scouting posts with the New York Yankees and Houston Colt .45s/Astros, 
hitting coach for the Red Sox' Memphis Chickasaws Double-A affiliate (1958), 
and four seasons (1959–62) as the first-base coach for the MLB Red Sox. 
On July 3, 1959, he served as acting manager of the Red Sox for one game 
during the interim period between Pinky Higgins' firing and the hiring 
of Washington Senators coach Billy Jurges as Higgins' permanent successor. 
Boston lost to the Baltimore Orioles, 6–1, that day. Rudy York died from 
cancer in Rome, Georgia, at the age of 56. He was buried in Cartersville's 
cemetery, Sunset Memory Gardens. The main Little League baseball field
