Kevin Michael Costner (born January 18, 1955) is an American actor, film 
director, producer, musician, and singer. He has won two Academy Awards, 
three Golden Globe Awards, and one Emmy Award, among others. Costner's 
notable roles include Eliot Ness in The Untouchables, Crash Davis in Bull 
Durham, Ray Kinsella in Field of Dreams, Lt. John J. Dunbar in Dances with 
Wolves, Jim Garrison in JFK, Robin Hood in Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, 
Frank Farmer in The Bodyguard, Roy McAvoy in Tin Cup, Jonathan Kent in 
the DC Extended Universe and the Mariner in Waterworld (1995). Costner 
directed, produced and starred in The Postman. In television, he won the 
Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Miniseries or a Movie, 
the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Miniseries or Television Film, 
and the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male 
Actor in a Miniseries or Television Movie for his role as Devil Anse Hatfield 
in Hatfields & McCoys (2012). Costner was born January 18, 1955 in Lynwood, 
California, and grew up in Compton, California. He is the youngest of three 
boys (the middle of whom died at birth). His mother, Sharon Rae (née Tedrick), 
was a welfare worker, and his father, William Costner, was an electrician 
and later utilities executive at Southern California Edison.[1][2] Costner's 
patrilineal heritage originates with German immigrants to North Carolina 
in the 1700s;[3] he also has English, Irish, Scottish, Welsh, and other 
German, ancestry.[4][5] Costner was raised Baptist.[6][7] Costner was not 
academically inclined. Rather, he enjoyed sports, took piano lessons, wrote 
poetry, and sang in the First Baptist Choir.[1][8] He has stated that a 
viewing of the 1962 film How the West Was Won at the age of seven had "formed" 
his childhood.[3] Spending his teenage years in various parts of California 
as his father's career progressed,[3] Costner has described this as a period 
when he "lost a lot of confidence", having to make new friends often.[3] 
Costner lived in Ventura, then in Visalia (Tulare County), attending Mt. 
Whitney High School, and then Orange County, graduating from Villa Park 
High School (California) in 1973. He went on to earn a BA in marketing 
and finance from California State University, Fullerton (CSUF) in 1978.[3] 
While at CSUF, he was a fraternity brother in Delta Chi. Costner became 
interested in acting while in his last year of college,[3] and on graduation 
married Cindy Silva. The couple honeymooned in Puerto Vallarta and on the 
return plane journey had a chance encounter with actor and fellow passenger 
Richard Burton, who had purchased all the seats around him for solitude. 
Burton agreed to speak to Costner after he finished his book. Costner, 
who had been taking acting classes, but had not told his wife about his 
desire to be an actor, watched Burton closely and approached when Burton 
gestured. Costner told Burton that he would prefer that his life was not 
filled with the type of drama that had followed Burton and asked if he 
would have to tolerate that if he became an actor. Burton replied, "You 
have green eyes. I have green eyes. I think you'll be fine." After landing, 
Burton's limousine pulled up to the curb where Costner and Cindy were waiting 
for a taxi, where Burton wished Costner luck. Costner would never see Burton 
again, but credits Burton with partially contributing to his career.[1][9] 
Having agreed to undertake a job as a marketing executive on return, Costner 
began taking acting lessons five nights a week, with the support of his 
wife.[3] His marketing job lasted 30 days. He took work which allowed him 
to develop his acting skills via tuition, including working on fishing 
boats, as a truck driver, and giving tours of stars' Hollywood homes to 
support the couple while he also made the audition rounds.[1] Costner allegedly 
made his film debut in the film Sizzle Beach, U.S.A.. Although a biography 
claims it was actually filmed in the winter of 1978–79, the film was not 
released until 1986. Costner made a very brief appearance in the Ron Howard 
film Night Shift (1982). He is listed in the credits as 'Frat Boy No. 1' 
and appears at the climax of a frat-style, blow-out party in the New York 
City morgue, when the music is suddenly stopped by a frantic Henry Winkler. 
Costner can be seen holding a beer and looking surprised at the sudden 
halt of celebration. Costner appeared in a commercial for the Apple Lisa 
and Table for Five in 1983, and, the same year, had a small role in the 
nuclear holocaust film Testament. Later, he was cast in The Big Chill and 
filmed several scenes that were planned as flashbacks, but they were removed 
from the final cut.[3] His role was that of Alex, the friend who committed 
suicide, the event that brings the rest of the cast together. All that 
is seen of him are his hair and his slashed wrists as the mortician dresses 
his corpse in the movie's opening scenes.[citation needed] Costner was 
a friend of director Lawrence Kasdan, who promised the actor a role in 
a future project.[3] That became Silverado (1985) and a breakout role for 
Costner.[3] He also starred that year in the smaller films Fandango and 
American Flyers and appeared alongside Kiefer Sutherland in an hour-long 
special episode of Steven Spielberg's Amazing Stories. Full-blown movie 
star status for Costner arrived in 1987, when he starred as federal agent 
Eliot Ness in The Untouchables and in the leading role of the thriller 
No Way Out.[3] He solidified his A-list status in the baseball-themed films 
Bull Durham (1988) and Field of Dreams (1989).[3] Costner's next success 
came with the epic Dances with Wolves (1990).[3] He directed and starred 
in the film and served as one of its producers.[3] The film was nominated 
for 12 Academy Awards and won seven, including two for him personally (Best 
Picture and Best Director).[3] The same year saw the release of Revenge, 
in which he starred along with Anthony Quinn and Madeleine Stowe, directed 
by Tony Scott (Costner had wanted to direct it himself). Costner followed 
this with Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves (1991), the Oliver Stone-directed 
JFK (1991), The Bodyguard (1992), and Clint Eastwood's A Perfect World 
(1993), all of which provided box office or critical acclaim.[3] He then 
took the title role in the biopic Wyatt Earp (1994), directed by Kasdan. 
The War, also made in 1994, seemed to gain little attention. The science 
fiction-post-apocalyptic epics Waterworld (1995) and The Postman (1997), 
the latter of which Costner also directed, were both commercial disappointments 
and both largely regarded by critics as artistic failures.[3] However, 
The Postman results were worse than Waterworld and ended up "winning" five 
Golden Raspberry Awards, including Worst Picture, Worst Actor and Worst 
Director for Costner.[10] Costner then starred in the golf comedy Tin Cup 
(1996) for Ron Shelton, who had previously directed him in Bull Durham.[3] 
He developed the film Air Force One and was set to play the lead role of 
the President, but ultimately decided to concentrate on finishing The Postman 
instead. He personally offered the project to Harrison Ford. In 1999, he 
starred in Message in a Bottle with Robin Wright. This was based on a novel 
of the same name By Nicholas Sparks. His career revived somewhat in 2000 
with Thirteen Days, in which he portrayed Kenneth O'Donnell, a top adviser 
to John F. Kennedy. The western Open Range, which he directed and starred 
in, received critical acclaim in 2003, and was a surprise success commercially. 
He received some of his best reviews for his supporting role as retired 
professional baseball player Denny Davies in The Upside of Anger, for which 
he received a nomination from the Broadcast Film Critics Association and 
won the San Francisco Film Critics Circle Award for Best Supporting Actor. 
After that, Costner starred in The Guardian and in Mr. Brooks, in which 
he portrayed a serial killer. In 2008, Costner starred in Swing Vote. Costner 
was honored on September 6, 2006 when his hand and foot prints were set 
in concrete in front of Grauman's Chinese Theatre alongside those of other 
celebrated actors and entertainers. In 2010, he appeared in The Company 
Men alongside Ben Affleck, Tommy Lee Jones and Chris Cooper. It debuted 
at the Sundance Film Festival, and received good reviews. It was released 
in cinemas worldwide in January 2011. The film was considered to be an 
Oscar contender, but did not get a nomination. Costner announced that he 
would be returning to the director's chair for the first time in seven 
years in 2011 with A Little War of Our Own. The film is about a local sheriff 
who must keep his town from erupting into violence during World War II. 
The other lead role is that of a German U-boat captain. The screenplay 
is by Dan Gordon, who co-wrote another sheriff movie for Costner, Wyatt 
Earp (1994). In January 2012, Costner had to admit funding did not come 
through, and that he still hopes to make it in 2013. He was also about 
to team up again with director Kevin Reynolds in Learning Italian. Costner 
would play a CIA agent stationed in a coastal Italian town in order to 
keep an eye on a KGB operative. However, the movie did not get past pre-production 
phase because Costner and Reynolds could not raise the money required. 
He also appears, as a special cameo, in Funny or Die's "Field of Dreams 
2: Lockout". Costner portrayed Jonathan Kent in the rebooted Superman film, 
Man of Steel, directed by Zack Snyder.[11] Costner was going to have a 
role in Quentin Tarantino's Django Unchained,[12] but had to drop out due 
to scheduling conflicts. Costner starred in the three-part miniseries Hatfields 
and McCoys, which premiered on May 28, 2012 on the History Channel. It 
immediately broke a record by pulling 13.9 million viewers. The miniseries 
tells the true American story of a legendary family feud – one that spanned 
decades and nearly launched a war between Kentucky and West Virginia. The 
role earned Costner a 2012 Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Miniseries 
or a Movie.[13] He also won the Golden Globe for Outstanding Lead Actor 
in a Miniseries or a Movie. In 2014, Costner appeared in the spy movie 
Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit, as Thomas Harper, a mentor for the series' title 
character. The same year, he starred in the thriller 3 Days to Kill and 
the drama Draft Day and produced and starred in Black or White.[14] Black 
or White premiered at the 2014 Toronto International Film Festival and 
opened in the United States in 2015. In 2015, Costner played coach Jim 
White in the drama film McFarland, USA, about cross country running. Costner 
is the singer in Kevin Costner & Modern West, a country rock band which 
he founded with the encouragement of his wife Christine. They began a worldwide 
tour in October 2007, which included shows in Istanbul and Rome. The group 
also performed at NASCAR Sprint Cup Series races at Daytona International 
Speedway and Charlotte Motor Speedway in Concord, NC. The band released 
a country album, Untold Truths, on November 11, 2008 on Universal South 
Records. The album peaked at No. 61 on the Billboard Top Country Albums 
and No. 35 on the Top Heatseekers chart. Three singles ("Superman 14", 
"Long Hot Night" and "Backyard") have been released to radio, although 
none have charted. The single "Superman 14" has been made into a live music 
video. In 2009, they went on tour with opening act The Alternate Routes. 
In August, at the Big Valley Jamboree in Camrose, Alberta, Costner and 
the band were scheduled next on stage when a severe thunderstorm struck, 
collapsing the stage and stands on the main stage. One person was reported 
dead and forty injured.[15] Later, an auction was held to raise money for 
the two young sons of the woman killed. A dinner with Costner was auctioned 
off for $41,000. Two guitars, one autographed by Costner, helped raise 
another $10,000 each.[16] A second Kevin Costner and Modern West album, 
Turn It On, was released in February 2010 in Europe[17] and was supported 
by a European tour.[18] In July 2012, the band performed in Halifax, Nova 
Scotia at the 20th annual Telus World Skins Game in support of the IWK 
Health Centre Foundation, donating a guitar personally autographed by Costner.[19] 
Several of Costner's films have included a baseball theme. They include 
Chasing Dreams, Bull Durham, Field of Dreams, For Love of the Game and 
The Upside of Anger, of which in the majority of those films his character 
is a former pro baseball player. He has a home in Austin and sometimes 
appears at Texas Longhorns baseball practices and games. Costner is a close 
friend of Longhorns baseball coach Augie Garrido from Garrido's days coaching 
at Cal State Fullerton, the actor's alma mater. He cast Garrido to play 
the role of the Yankee manager in For Love of the Game. He tries to attend 
every College World Series game that CSUF Titans plays in Omaha, Nebraska. 
Costner walked-on for a try-out, but did not make the team early in his 
time at the university. Costner was a partial owner of the Zion, Illinois-based 
Lake County Fielders independent baseball team in the North American League. 
The Fielders name was an homage to Field of Dreams, with the logo showing 
a ballplayer standing amid a field of corn.[20][21] In July 2004, Costner 
fired Francis and Carla Caneva, who managed the Midnight Star casino in 
Deadwood, South Dakota. A judge subsequently ordered Costner to pay a percentage 
of $6.1 million to buy out the Canevas as his business partners. In October 
2006, Costner asked the South Dakota Supreme Court to re-examine the ruling, 
as an accountant hired by the actor had determined the market value of 
the casino to be $3.1 million.[22] On June 6, 2004 Costner opened "Tatanka: 
The Story of the Bison" one mile south of Deadwood, South Dakota on U.S. 
Route 85, for what Kevin Costner hopes will be an educational and emotional 
place for people to learn about America's westward expansion. Promoters 
stated in a news release that the $5 million attraction has a new, 3,800-square-foot 
interactive interpretive center featuring exhibit, retail, and food and 
beverage areas, as well as offices and a small orientation theater. The 
visitor center features graphics, photographs and text describing how bison 
came to North America and how American Indian tribes used the animals for 
food, clothing, shelter and many other needs. Other displays show how the 
American westward expansion threatened the buffalo populations and how 
the bison herds have since recovered under managed care to number about 
400,000. The centerpiece is a bronze sculpture depicting a buffalo jump 
commonly used by Plains Indians to kill and process large numbers of animals 
on which they depended for survival. Hill City artist Peggy Detmers created 
14 bronze bison in the act of running from their pursuers and three bronze 
Lakota riders on horseback. Three of the massive bison are posed in midair, 
cascading over the face of a cliff. Costner commissioned the work in 1994 
from Detmers. The five-fourths-scale bronzes, each weighing between 2,500 
and 8,000 pounds, were cast at Eagle Bronze Foundry in Lander, Wyo. Another 
aspect is an 1845 Lakota encampment. The encampment will feature living 
Lakota interpreters of history, dressed in period attire and settled among 
their teepees.[23] In 1995, Costner began developing oil separation machines 
based on a patent he purchased from the US government. The machines developed 
by the company were of little commercial interest until the Deepwater Horizon 
oil spill, when BP took six of the machines from a company in which Costner 
owned an interest, Ocean Therapy Solutions, for testing in late May 2010.[24] 
On June 16, 2010 BP entered into a lease with Ocean Therapy Solutions for 
32 of the oil-water separation devices.[25] Although Spyron Contoguris 
and Stephen Baldwin previously sold their interests in Ocean Therapy Solutions 
in mid-June to another investor in the company, they filed a lawsuit in 
Louisiana District Court claiming $10.64 million for securities fraud and 
misrepresentation. The suit claimed that Costner kept a meeting with BP 
secret from them, and the secret meeting resulted in an $18 million down 
payment on a $52 million purchase and that after the down payment but before 
any announcement another investor used part of the downpayment to buy out 
their shares, thus excluding them from their share of the profits from 
the total sale.[26] The suit claimed that, despite public statements by 
Costner, Ocean Therapy Solutions, BP and others to the contrary, Baldwin 
and Contogouris were told that BP was still testing the machines and had 
not yet committed to lease the machines from Ocean Therapy Solutions and 
that the other investor in Ocean Therapy Solutions purchased their shares 
for $1.4 million to Baldwin and $500,000, to Contogouris.[27] In June 2012, 
a federal jury in Louisiana deliberated for less than 2 hours before completely 
rejecting Baldwin's and Contogouris' claims in the multimillion-dollar 
oil clean-up case, and the court ordered Baldwin and Contogouris to reimburse 
Costner and the other defendants in the case for their costs. Costner serves 
on an honorary board for The National World War I Museum in Kansas City. 
In spring 2011, he recorded two radio spots for the museum that were aired 
on Kansas City Royals Radio Network.[28] Costner was named ceremonial Grand 
Marshal of the NASCAR Nextel Cup Series' Auto Club 500 which took place 
on February 25, 2007, at the California Speedway.[29] In 2008, he worked 
with the NASCAR Media Group and CMT Films to help produce the NASCAR Documentary, 
The Ride of Their Lives which would be released in 2009[needs update]. 
Costner would be the narrator for that documentary. Also in 2009, he was 
named the spokesman for NASCAR Day which took place on 15 May. The next 
day, 16 May, he and his country music band would perform in the infield 
of Lowe's Motor Speedway as well as participate as a judge in the 2nd annual 
Pennzoil Victory Challenge before the 25th Running of the NASCAR Sprint 
All-Star Race. While in college, Costner was a member of Delta Chi fraternity 
at the Cal State Fullerton (CSUF).[1] He started dating fellow student 
Cindy Silva in March 1975, and their subsequent marriage three years later 
produced three children: Anne "Annie" Clayton (born April 15, 1984), Lily 
McCall (born August 4, 1986) and Joseph "Joe" Tedrick (born January 31, 
1988). The couple divorced in 1994 after 16 years of marriage. He has a 
son, Liam Timothy Costner (born November 15, 1996), with Bridget Rooney, 
with whom he had a brief relationship following his divorce.[30] In 1996, 
he lived with supermodel Elle Macpherson.[31] On September 25, 2004, Costner 
married his girlfriend of four years, German-American model and handbag 
designer Christine Baumgartner,[32] at his ranch in Aspen, Colorado. Their 
first child, Cayden, was born on 6 May 2007 at a Los Angeles hospital.[33] 
Their second son, Hayes, was born on 12 February 2009[34] and their third 
child, a daughter named Grace, was born on 2 June 2010.[35] Early in his 
life, Costner was a Republican. He was a supporter and good friend of Ronald 
Reagan, frequently playing golf with the former President. He later grew 
disillusioned with the direction of the party, eventually switching his 
affiliation in the early 90s. Since 1992, Costner has financially supported 
a variety of Democratic Party politicians, including Al Gore and Tom Daschle, 
but also made contributions to the Republican Party's Phil Gramm as late 
as 1995.[36] He said publicly in 2008 that he has no ambition to run for 
political office, adding "I've lived quite a colorful life."[37] In the 
final days before the 2008 election, Costner campaigned for Barack Obama, 
visiting various places in Colorado—a state in which he has a home. In 
his speech, Costner stated the need for young voters to get to the polls, 
early and with enthusiasm. "We were going to change the world and we haven't," 
Costner said at a Colorado State University rally. "My generation didn't 
get it done, and we need you to help us."[38] In October 2014, Costner 
sent a tribute to British troops serving around the world thanking them
