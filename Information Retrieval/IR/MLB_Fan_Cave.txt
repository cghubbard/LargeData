The MLB Fan Cave was a building on 4th Street and Broadway in New York, 
designed by Paul DiMeo, where baseball fans, selected by Major League Baseball 
as part of its Dreamjob program, are tasked with watching every baseball 
game in the entire year. According to Major League Baseball, The MLB Fan 
Cave grew out of our desire to address three specific areas in which we 
saw opportunity for growth: engaging with fans via social media, both at 
the league level and through players; reaching younger fans and converting 
casual baseball fans into more avid followers; and raising the profile 
of our players by showcasing their off-field personalities The "cave dwellers" 
(fans selected to live in the Fan Cave) are responsible for recording their 
experiences through social media, blogs, and videos (all online), as well 
as hosting concerts, fan events, and celebrity guests.[2] It was located 
in the space formerly occupied by Tower Records’ famed Greenwich Village 
location. The MLB Fan Cave first opened at the beginning of the 2011 season 
with two cave dwellers, Mike O'Hara, a 37-year-old Yankee fan and Ryan 
Wagner, a 25-year-old Orioles fan, selected to live in the Fan Cave from 
a pool of 10,000 applicants. The application process included a video submission, 
writing samples, and interviews with MLB Network and MLB executives. [3] 
In 2013, nine more Cave Dwellers joined the MLB Fan Cave. Also joining 
them in the Cave was a nine-armed octopus nicknamed, Nonopus. Throughout 
the season, a number of Major League Baseball players came to visit, including 
Josh Donaldson, Jose Bautista, David Ortiz, Andrew McCutchen and Cliff 
Lee, to name a few. The season ended with three finalists watching the 
Boston Red Sox win the World Series with Los Angeles Angels fan Danny Farris 
being named the winner of the season. On February 9, 2015, it was reported 
that the Fan Cave would cease existence, and the building would be used 
for other promotional events. [4] Coordinates: 40°43′42″N 73°59′40″W﻿ /
