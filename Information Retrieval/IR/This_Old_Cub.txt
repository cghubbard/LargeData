This Old Cub is a documentary film which was released in 2004. The film 
is centered on former Chicago Cubs third baseman Ron Santo and both his 
playing days and his battle against diabetes. The film was written, co-produced, 
and directed by Santo's son Jeff. It is often mentioned during Cub game 
broadcasts by Pat Hughes, who was Santo's partner in the WGN Radio booth. 
The film was a gift from Jeff to his father as a part of the "Ron Santo 
Day" celebration that season after Santo had both his legs amputated and 
had just missed induction into the MLB Hall of Fame a few months earlier. 
A portion of all proceeds from the release of This Old Cub are donated 
to the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation. The film has raised over 
a half-million dollars for the JDRF. Cub shortstop Ernie Banks, Gary Sinise, 
Bill Murray, former Chicago Bears linebacker Doug Buffone, and many others 
are interviewed in the film, which is narrated by actor Joe Mantegna. The 
documentary inspired an Arizona teacher and lifelong Cub fan named Bill 
Holden to engage a 2100-mile walk from Arizona to Wrigley Field to raise 
funds for the JDRF. Holden covered at least 12 miles each day, crossed 
six states, and battled his arthritis during the nearly seven-month trek. 
Followed by the media, Holden arrived at Wrigley on July 1, 2005 where 
he threw out the first pitch and joined Santo in singing "Take Me Out to 
the Ball Game". The venture raised over $250,000 for the charity, and caused 
a dramatic spike in sales of the DVD. Derek Schaul, the leader of Chicago 
Cubs Bleacher Bums, wears a shirt to every game stating, "I walk for the 
cure because Ronnie can't! Go Cubbies!" This Old Cub was co-produced by 
Walgreens Drug Stores and the Chicago Tribune, both heavy sponsors of the
