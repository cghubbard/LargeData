Juan Osvaldo Lagares (born March 17, 1989) is a Dominican professional 
baseball center fielder for the New York Mets of Major League Baseball 
(MLB). He made his MLB debut during the 2013 season. Known for his defensive 
prowess, he won the National League Gold Glove Award in 2014. Lagares grew 
up in a cool, mountainous area in Constanza, Dominican Republic. There 
were few baseball facilities or teams in the area so Lagares grew up playing 
softball.[1] He has credited his arm strength to his background in throwing 
the larger, heavier softball.[2] Lagares did not transition to playing 
baseball until he was already a teenager. After only seven or eight months 
practicing at a baseball academy, he was signed as a shortstop by the New 
York Mets. Lagares was signed by the New York Mets as a non-drafted free 
agent on May 5, 2006.[3] Lagares was moved from shortstop to the outfield 
in 2009. He was assigned to the DSL Mets in 2006, where in 57 games, he 
hit .255/.339/.412 with 18 XBH, 33 RBI and 12 SB. Lagares was promoted 
to Single-A Savannah for 2007, where in 83 games, he hit .210/.262/.317 
with 20 XBH, 16 RBI and 11 SB. After an arm issue occurred, his 2008 debut, 
with Savannah, happened in late June.[4] After 46 games with Savannah, 
Lagares was demoted to Low-A Brooklyn in the middle of August. In 65 total 
games, he hit .253/.284/.352 with 3 HR and 24 RBI. Lagares began 2009 with 
Savannah, but a wrist injury suffered in late May ended most of his season. 
He came back in September after a rehab stint with the GCL Mets. In 53 
total games, he hit .266/.297/.323 with 14 RBI and 10 SB. Lagares began 
2010 with Savannah, and after hitting .300/.318/.459 with 5 HR, 39 RBI 
and 18 SB in 67 games, he was promoted to High-A St. Lucie, but was limited 
to 33 games there after a fractured ankle ended his season on July 28. 
2011 was a breakout season for Lagares. He began with St. Lucie, where 
he tore it up before being promoted to Double-A Binghamton. In 120 games 
total, he hit .349/.383/.500 with 9 HR, 71 RBI and 15 SB. Lagares was added 
to the Mets 40 man roster on November 18, 2011.[5] He played 2012 with 
Binghamton, where in 130 games, he hit .283/.334/.389 with 4 HR, 48 RBI 
and 21 SB. Lagares began 2013 with Triple-A Las Vegas as their center fielder, 
where he played in 17 games before getting called to New York. On April 
23, Lagares was called up by the Mets with Kirk Nieuwenhuis being sent 
down to the 51s.[6] Lagares made his debut on the same day against the 
Los Angeles Dodgers coming in as a part of a double switch in the fifth 
inning. In his first at-bat in the bottom half of the same inning, he hit 
a fly out off Clayton Kershaw. In the bottom of the seventh inning he recorded 
his first hit, a single, off Paco Rodriguez. The Mets would go on to lose 
7-2 to the dodgers. Lagares hit his first major league home run on May 
19, against Travis Wood of the Chicago Cubs at Wrigley Field. The home 
run, a two run home run, tied the game at three in the top of the seventh 
inning and would help the Mets win 4-3. At this point on June 25, in the 
last eight games, Lagares was hitting .320 with 4 doubles.[7] For the week 
of July 15–21, 2013, Lagares won the NL Player of the Week Award. In that 
week, Lagares hit .700 with a home run and 5 RBI. In 121 games for the 
Mets, he hit .242/.281/.352 with 4 HR and 34 RBI. A superlative defender, 
Lagares had a .983 fielding percentage, as well as leading the MLB in assists 
at center field (14), defensive runs saved (26) and the NL in Range Factor/9 
innings at center field (2.98).[8] On August 20, Lagares ranked second 
among center fielders in Defensive Runs Saved with 20 behind Carlos Gómez 
with 27.[9] In September, he was named MLB's best defender for the month 
of August. He led the majors with 12 defensive runs saved and led the National 
League, and ranks second in the majors, in outfield assists with 12.[10] 
Things got even more impressive with his defense as he set the Mets franchise 
rookie record with 15 outfield assists. His 3.5 dWAR was second only to 
Brewers outfielder Carlos Gomez (4.6) among National League center fielders. 
He was named as the Mets best defensive player during Wilson's Defensive 
Player of the Year Awards.[11] Lagares finished the 2013 season appearing 
in 121 games with a batting average of .242 in 392 at-bats in 421 plate 
appearances while compiling 95 hits, 34 RBIs, 4 home runs, 20 walks, 35 
runs scored and striking out 96 times. In December, he played in the Dominican 
Professional Baseball League for the Águilas Cibaeñas ultimately winning 
the Rookie of the Year award. He hit .342 with one HR, 16 RBI, five stolen 
bases and seven walks in 114 at-bats.[12] Lagares made the Mets' roster 
for Opening Day in 2014. On April 14, both him and Curtis Granderson left 
due to injuries during a game against the Arizona Diamondbacks. Lagares 
grabbed his hamstring after beating out a double play in the seventh inning. 
He stayed in for a pitch before being removed. Lagares had a right hamstring 
strain.[13] The next day he was placed on the 15-day disabled list with 
a pulled right hamstring and was replaced on the roster by Kirk Nieuwenhuis.[14] 
He was batting .314 with a .345 OBP, five extra base hits and seven RBIs 
in the 13 games. He was recalled from rehabbing with the 51s on May 1 with 
Nieuwenhuis being sent down to make room for Lagares.[15] In Mid-May, Mets 
fans on social media sites such as Twitter and Facebook became frustrated 
with manager Terry Collins sitting Lagares on the bench since coming off 
the disabled list. As of May 16, he was benched for the fourth time in 
five games. Mets fans soon started a campaign called #FreeLagares to express 
their anger over him being benched. Although Lagares had been struggling 
since coming back from the disabled list, however his defensive capability 
and clutch hitting was touted as being reason enough for him to be put 
in the lineup.[16] On June 2, he was placed again on the disabled list 
with a right intercostal strain. His spot on the roster was replaced by 
Matt den Dekker.[17] On June 26, Wilmer Flores was sent down to the 51s 
to make room for Lagares coming of the disabled list.[18] On July 7, during 
a game between the Atlanta Braves and New York Mets at Citi Field, in the 
bottom of the 9th inning and the game tied at three, Lagares bunted towards 
third base to advance base runner Eric Campbell to second base. Braves 
third baseman Chris Johnson fielded the ball and threw to shortstop Andrelton 
Simmons, who was covering second base. Simmons was in no danger of being 
hit by the runner, yet the umpires ruled the runner out, calling it was 
a neighborhood play. Mets manager Terry Collins argued that it could not 
have been a neighborhood play, since it was a bunt play and recording a 
double play would be almost impossible. Simmons was moving away from 2nd 
base, and didn't record an out at 1st, either. Therefore, Collins claimed 
the only reason Simmons had to come off the base was an errant throw. The 
umpires accepted the claim and reviewed the play, and after review the 
out call was overturned. This led to an argument and ejection of Braves 
manager Fredi González, who later said about the call that it was one of 
the worst calls he'd seen in his life.[19][20] The Mets would go on to 
win the game 4-3 in 11 innings. On September 23, he was shut down for the 
rest of the season with a sprained elbow.[21] At the end of the season 
he improved his hitting tremendously over the past season, increasing his 
average by nearly 40 points, from .242 to .281.[22] Lagares finished the 
2014 season appearing in 116 games with a batting average of .281 in 416 
at-bats in 452 plate appearances while compiling 117 hits, 47 RBIs, 4 home 
runs, 20 walks, 46 runs scored and striking out 87 times. On November 4, 
it was announced that Juan had won his first Gold Glove Award. He was the 
third outfielder in franchise history to win a Gold Glove award, the others 
being Tommie Agee (1970) and Carlos Beltrán (2006-08).[23] He also won 
the Fielding Bible Award as the statistically best defensive center fielder 
in the National League.[24] On April 2, Lagares and the Mets agreed to 
a four-year extension worth $23 million which will run from 2016 through 
2019. The Mets have a $9.5 million option for 2020, with a $500,000 buyout.[25] 
Lagares made the team out of spring training as the starting center fielder. 
On July 31, the Mets traded for Yoenis Céspedes, who would play center 
regularly throughout the season. Lagares moved to backup outfield role, 
regularly coming in as defensive substitution late in the game. Lagares 
finished the 2015 season appearing in 143 games with a batting average 
of .259 in 441 at-bats in 465 plate appearances while compiling 114 hits, 
41 RBIs, 6 home runs, 16 walks, 47 runs scored and striking out 87 times. 
In the NLDS against the Los Angeles Dodgers, he hit .429 in 4 games while 
compiling 3 hits, 2 doubles, 1 walk and scoring 3 runs. In the NLCS against 
the Chicago Cubs, he hit .333 in 4 games with 2 hits, 2 runs scored, 1 
stolen base and striking out 2 times. In the World Series against the Kansas 
City Royals, he hit .300 in all 5 games with 3 hits, 2 runs scored, 1 stolen 
base and striking out 1 time. Lagares made the Mets' Opening Day Roster 
in 2016, serving as a backup outfielder, pinch hitter and defensive substitution. 
On June 16 the Mets placed Lagares on the disabled list due to a sprained 
thumb he suffered while making a diving catch in a game on June 4.[26] 
Lagares and his wife had their first child, a son, Juan, Jr., in September
