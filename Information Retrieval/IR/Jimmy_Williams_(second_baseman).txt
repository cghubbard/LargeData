James Thomas Williams (December 20, 1876 – January 16, 1965) was a second 
baseman in Major League Baseball from 1899 to 1909. He played for the Pittsburgh 
Pirates, Baltimore Orioles, New York Highlanders, and St. Louis Browns. 
The power-hitting Williams set several records during his rookie season 
and led a major league in triples three times. He stood at 5' 9" and weighed 
175 lbs.[1] Williams was born in St. Louis, Missouri.[1] He first played 
semi-pro baseball in 1892[2] and started his professional baseball career 
in 1896. In 1897, he established himself as a premiere power hitter, slugging 
31 home runs for the Western Association's St. Joseph Saints. He hit more 
homers than any two other players in the league combined, and he also paced 
the circuit in slugging percentage and total bases.[3] In 1898, Williams' 
power dropped off when he moved up to the class A Western League. However, 
he did raise his batting average to .343 (third in the league) and still 
led the WL in slugging percentage at .494.[4] Williams was then purchased 
by the Pittsburgh Pirates. He was the team's starting third baseman in 
1899 and made an immediate impact. In May and June of that year, he ran 
off a 26-game hitting streak.[5] He continued to rip extra-base hits throughout 
the entire season and eventually ranked sixth in the National League in 
doubles (28), first in triples (27), and third in home runs (9).[1] In 
August and September, Williams had another long hitting streak, this time 
reaching 27 games before being stopped. The streak set an MLB rookie record 
that was not broken until 1987;[5] it is still a Pittsburgh Pirates team 
record.[6] The 27 triples are also an MLB rookie record.[6] Williams ended 
the season with a .354 batting average.[1] In 1900, Williams slumped badly, 
and his statistics all declined from the previous season. He hit just .264, 
while his slugging percentage fell by .141 points.[1] After the season, 
Williams jumped to the new American League with the Baltimore Orioles. 
He converted to second base and would remain at that position for the rest 
of his career. In 1901, Williams returned to his rookie form at the plate, 
batting .317 with a league-leading 21 triples. His production was similar 
the following year, as well, and he led his league in triples for the third 
time.[1] In 1903, the Baltimore franchise was transferred to New York. 
Williams played decently in the new city, but his hitting never approached 
his Pittsburgh and Baltimore levels again. After five years with the Highlanders, 
he was traded to the St. Louis Browns, where he finished out his major 
league career.[1] He hit just .195 in 1909 and played his final MLB game 
on October 3.[1] Williams played for the American Association's Minneapolis 
Millers from 1910 to 1915.[7] No longer facing major league quality pitching, 
he batted over .310 in both 1910 and 1911 and was one of the league's best 
sluggers. He helped the Millers win four AA pennants during his time there[2] 
before retiring after the 1915 season, by which time he was 38 years old.[7] 
After his baseball career ended, Williams held various jobs, including 
one as an area scout and coach for the Cincinnati Reds.[2] He was married 
to Nannie May Smith in 1900, and the marriage lasted until her death in 
1949. They had two sons.[6] Jimmy Williams died in 1965 in St. Petersburg,
