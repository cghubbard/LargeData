Pittsburgh Railways operated 68 streetcar routes. The table below lists 
their dates of operation. A notable, unnumbered, tripper (unscheduled extra) 
service was signed Stadium-Forbes Field, for Pitt Panthers and Pittsburgh 
Steelers football games and Pirates baseball games. Pitt Stadium and Forbes 
Field were convenient to the lines on Fifth Avenue and Forbes Avenue, both 
two-way streets during the trolley era. This service, which probably last 
ran in fall 1966, was no longer possible after the East End lines closed 
in January 1967. The Interurban lines did not use route numbers. Outbound 
interurban cars were signed for their outbound destination, namely Charleroi, 
Roscoe or Washington; some PCC rollsigns instead prefixed Shannon- to the 
destination, e.g. Shannon-Washington. Inbound cars were signed simply Pittsburgh.
