As player As manager Hugh Duffy (November 26, 1866 – October 19, 1954) 
was an outfielder and manager in Major League Baseball. He was a player 
or player-manager for the Chicago White Stockings, Chicago Pirates, Boston 
Reds, Boston Beaneaters, Milwaukee Brewers and Philadelphia Phillies between 
1888 and 1906. He had his best years with the Beaneaters, including the 
1894 season, when he set the MLB single-season record for batting average 
(.440). He also managed the Chicago White Sox and Boston Red Sox and spent 
several seasons coaching in collegiate baseball and in the minor leagues. 
Later in life, he spent many years as a scout for the Red Sox. He was elected 
to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1945. He worked for Boston until 1953. 
He died of heart problems the next year. Duffy, born in Cranston, Rhode 
Island, was a textile mill worker who had taken up baseball as a semipro 
for weekend diversion.[1] He played a couple years of minor league ball 
in the New England League before jumping to the majors, starting up in 
the league's initial season of 1886, and playing on clubs in Hartford, 
Springfield and Salem, as well as the Lowell, Massachusetts team in 1887.[2] 
Duffy entered the National League with Cap Anson's Chicago White Stockings 
in 1888 after receiving an offer of $2,000 from the club. Anson initially 
was unimpressed with the 5 ft 7 in (1.70 m), 150 pound Duffy, telling him, 
"We already have a batboy."[3] He shortly thereafter earned the reputation 
of an outstanding outfielder and powerful hitter. Duffy ended up replacing 
Billy Sunday as the team's regular right fielder. He switched leagues, 
joining the American Association's Boston Reds in 1891; he then returned 
to the NL with the Boston Beaneaters in 1892, where he enjoyed his best 
seasons. From 1891 through 1900, Duffy knocked in 100 runs or more eight 
times. In 1894 Duffy had one of the greatest seasons in baseball history, 
leading the league with 18 home runs, with 145 RBI and a .440 batting average 
(see Major League Baseball Triple Crown). Duffy's .440 average is the major 
league single-season batting average record.[4] At one point during the 
season, Duffy had a 26-game hitting streak.[5] He was player-manager for 
the Milwaukee Brewers in 1901. During the 1902 and 1903 seasons, Duffy 
was player-manager for the Western League's Milwaukee franchise.[6] Duffy 
was a player-manager for the Phillies from 1904 to 1906. He finished his 
career in 1906 with 106 home runs which was, at the time, one of the highest 
career totals. Duffy spent three years (1907–1909) as manager of the Providence 
Grays. He made $2,000 in his last season as the Providence manager and 
The Evening News in Providence wrote that Duffy was paid hundreds of dollars 
less than any other manager in the Eastern League. During Duffy's three 
seasons, Providence finished in third place, second place and third place, 
respectively.[7] Duffy agreed to manage the Chicago White Sox in 1910.[7] 
He stayed with the team in 1911. He moved to the Milwaukee Brewers of the 
American Association in 1912, but he was fired after a season in which 
the team struggled.[8] He turned down an offer to manage the 1913 St. Paul 
Saints, saying that he was hoping to work in the east.[9] He coached the 
Harvard varsity and freshman baseball squads from 1917 through 1919.[10] 
He also managed the 1920 Toronto Maple Leafs of the International League 
to a .701 winning percentage — the best in the team's 83-year history, 
but only good enough for second place in the league. In 1921, Duffy was 
hired as full-time manager of the Red Sox, guiding them for two seasons. 
Duffy became a scout for the Boston Red Sox in 1924. Duffy remained on 
the scouting staff of the Red Sox nearly to the end of his life, retiring 
in 1953. He died in Boston on October 19, 1954.[5] He had been suffering 
from heart problems.[11] Duffy's wife Nora died the previous year; they
