Northwest League of Professional Baseball (or simply the Northwest League 
or NWL) is a Class A Short Season minor league in the northwest United 
States and western Canada. The NWL's short season starts in mid-June, after 
major league teams have signed their amateur draft picks to professional 
contracts, and ends in early September. All eight teams are affiliated 
with a major league team. The Northwest League (or the Northwestern League) 
has existed in various forms since 1890, and has been in its current incarnation 
since 1955.[1] It switched to the short season schedule in 1966,[2] with 
only four teams.[3][4] Its immediate predecessor, the Western International 
League (WIL), had ten teams in its final year in 1954, with four in Canada. 
The six U.S. cities plus Eugene were the seven charter teams of the Northwest 
League in 1955: Salem Senators, Eugene Emeralds, Yakima Bears, Spokane 
Indians, Tri-City Braves, Wenatchee Chiefs, and Lewiston Broncs.[5][6] 
During its fiftieth season in 2004, five of the seven original cities were 
in the league. Source:[7] Eugene is the most-tenured city in the NWL, having 
fielded a team in all but five of the NWL's seasons (from 1969â€“73, they 
had a Triple-A PCL franchise) Spokane had a Triple-A PCL team for 24 seasons
