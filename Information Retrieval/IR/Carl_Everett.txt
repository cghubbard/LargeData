Carl Edward Everett III (born June 3, 1971) is a former Major League Baseball 
outfielder. A switch hitter, he played with the Chicago White Sox on their 
2005 World Series winning team over the Houston Astros. He throws right-handed 
and plays all outfield positions, and occasionally designated hitter. Everett 
attended Hillsborough High School in Tampa, Florida and was a letterman 
in football, baseball, and track. In football, he garnered 948 rushing 
yards as a senior. Everett graduated from Hillsborough High School in 1990.[citation 
needed] He was the 10th overall pick in the 1990 Major League Baseball 
Draft, selected by the New York Yankees. He was selected by the Florida 
Marlins in the 1992 MLB expansion draft, and made his major league debut 
with the Marlins on July 1, 1993. Everett was traded to the Mets after 
the 1994 season for Quilvio Veras. He had his first full season in 1997 
with 443 at-bats. He hit .248 that season, with a .420 slugging percentage. 
After the 1997 season, Everett was traded to the Houston Astros for John 
Hudek. He hit .325 with 27 stolen bases in 1999. That year, his .571 slugging 
percentage was in the top 10 in the league. After being traded on December 
14, 1999, to the Boston Red Sox for minor leaguers Adam Everett and Greg 
Miller, he had a career high 34 home runs in 2000. The Boston fans welcomed 
him at first, but their enthusiasm cooled somewhat after he was suspended 
for 10 days for bumping into umpire Ron Kulpa. The following year, Everett 
was fined for grabbing his crotch while yelling at Seattle Mariners pitcher 
Jamie Moyer after hitting a home run. He struggled in 2001, with a shoulder 
injury hampering his performance, and ongoing controversy with the Boston 
media serving as a distraction to the team. One of the few bright spots 
for Everett that season came on September 2, 2001, when Everett came into 
the game as a pinch hitter and broke up a potential perfect game by Mike 
Mussina of the New York Yankees. Mussina had retired the first 26 Boston 
Red Sox and gotten two strikes on Everett before he hit a soft single to 
left center. On December 12, 2001, Everett was traded to the Texas Rangers 
for Darren Oliver. His nine home runs in April 2003 matched a team record 
that was shared (through 2008) with Iván Rodríguez (2000), Alex Rodriguez 
(2002), and Ian Kinsler (2007). Everett was traded to the Chicago White 
Sox during the 2003 season for Frank Francisco, Josh Rupe and Anthony Webster. 
He signed as a free agent with the Montreal Expos for the 2004 season, 
but was traded back to the White Sox on July 18, 2004 for Gary Majewski 
and Jon Rauch. In October 2005, Everett won his first and only World Series 
championship with the White Sox. Everett stepped in as the starting DH 
for most of that season for the White Sox after an early season injury 
to Frank Thomas. On December 14, 2005, Everett was signed by the Mariners 
off the free agent market to a one-year contract for the 2006 season, with 
a vesting option for 2007. On Mother's Day, May 14, 2006, Everett was one 
of more than 50 hitters who brandished a pink bat to benefit the Breast 
Cancer Foundation. The majority of the time, he was a designated hitter 
and very rarely played the field, backing up the corner outfield positions. 
He played in 92 games before the Mariners designated Everett for assignment 
on July 26, 2006, effectively ending his tenure with the Mariners organization. 
At the time of his release, Larry Stone pointed out in the Seattle Times, 
he was 85th out of 86 AL players with qualifying at bats in batting average, 
at .227.[1] In 2007, Everett played for the Long Island Ducks of the Atlantic 
League of Professional Baseball. In 2007, he hit .312 with 25 home runs 
and 97 RBI. In 2008, he hit .327 with 29 home runs and 100 RBI in 115 games. 
He remained with the Ducks for the 2008 season. On May 11, 2009, Everett 
agreed to a contract with the Newark Bears of the Atlantic League of Professional 
Baseball to be their designated hitter.[2] Everett is quite outspoken with 
his beliefs, and his remarks have proven controversial on several occasions. 
Perhaps the best-known of these was his denial of the existence of dinosaurs. 
He was quoted as saying, "God created the sun, the stars, the heavens and 
the earth, and then made Adam and Eve. The Bible never says anything about 
dinosaurs. You can't say there were dinosaurs when you never saw them. 
Somebody actually saw Adam and Eve eating apples. No one ever saw a Tyrannosaurus 
rex." He also derided fossils of dinosaur bones as man-made fakes.[3] In 
reference to these comments, Boston Globe columnist Dan Shaughnessy dubbed 
Everett "Jurassic Carl." Everett, in turn, referred to Shaughnessy as the 
"curly-haired boyfriend" of Globe beat writer Gordon Edes.[4] Everett in 
an interview with Shaughnessy, questioned the validity of the Apollo Moon 
Landing.[5] Each season in the MLB, Everett tended to get into altercations 
with umpires. Some of these tirades have resulted in suspensions and fines. 
Everett's longest suspension came during the 2000 season after an incident 
in which he bumped heads with umpire Ron Kulpa while arguing Kulpa's ruling 
that Everett's batting stance was illegal. Everett was suspended for 10 
games and fined $5,000. Everett has stated that he thrives on being hated, 
and that it keeps him on top of his game. Opposing players, umpires, and 
even his own teammates are not immune, as evidenced by his postgame shouting 
match with Seattle manager Mike Hargrove after a 14-6 loss to the Los Angeles 
Angels on July 5, 2006.[6] Everett has also made controversial remarks 
about homosexuality. He once said that if he had an openly gay teammate 
that he would consider retiring, or, at the very least, "set him straight." 
In the 2005 season, he told Maxim that he has had gay teammates and accepted 
them, but, "Gays being gay is wrong. Two women can't produce a baby, two 
men can't produce a baby, so it's not how it's supposed to be. … I don't 
believe in gay marriages. I don't believe in being gay."[7] In 2011, Everett 
was arrested at his home in Tampa on charges of aggravated assault with 
a deadly weapon and tampering with a witness. Everett reportedly held a
