James Robert "Bob" Horner (born August 6, 1957) is a former Major League 
Baseball third baseman/first baseman and right-handed batter who played 
for the Atlanta Braves (1978–86) and St. Louis Cardinals (1988). Horner 
was hampered by injuries for most of his major league career, and his career 
was cut short by collusion by team owners to drive down salaries by agreeing 
to not make offers to veteran stars like Horner. Horner was born in Junction 
City, Kansas, but grew up in Glendale, Arizona, attending Apollo High School 
in Glendale where he set school records. His college career at Arizona 
State University culminated with being named the first winner of the Golden 
Spikes Award. With his nine home runs in 1976 he is tied with Ike Davis 
(2006) for third all-time by a Sun Devil freshman, two behind Barry Bonds 
(in 1983). A second baseman for TSN's College All-America team in 1977 
and 1978, Horner set a then-NCAA record of 58 career home runs for Arizona 
State, set a 25-homer single-season record, and was selected the MVP of 
1977 College World Series. Horner was drafted by Atlanta with the first 
overall pick in the 1978 amateur draft, and he made his Major League Baseball 
debut the same year. He is one of a handful of players to go directly to 
the starting lineup in the majors without spending a day in the minor leagues. 
In his first game he belted a home run off future Hall of Fame pitcher 
Bert Blyleven of the Pirates. In 89 games Horner batted .266 with 23 home 
runs and 63 runs batted in in 323 at-bats, with an on-base percentage of 
.313 and a slugging percentage of .539. His 23 home runs led all National 
League third basemen in 1978. He won the National League Rookie of the 
Year honor over Ozzie Smith. In 1979 Horner batted .314 with 33 homers 
and 98 RBI; In 1980, Horner batted .268, 35 HR, 89 RBI despite being sidelined 
for 79 games in both seasons after recurring shoulder and leg injuries. 
In the strike-shortened 1981 season he hit .277, 15 HR, 42 RBI in 79 games. 
Horner enjoyed his best statistical season in 1982, finishing with 32 home 
runs, 97 RBI, and an OBP of .350 while slugging .501. In August 1983 Horner 
was hitting .303 with 20 homers and a career-high OBP of .383 when he fractured 
his right wrist while sliding, missing the last 43 games of that season. 
In May 1984, Horner broke the same wrist while diving after a ball and 
he was sidelined for the rest of the season. In 1985 Horner played 130 
games and finished with a .267 BA, 27 HR and 89 RBI. In 1986, Horner set 
personal highlights. On July 6, 1986 in a game against the Expos, he became 
the eleventh player in Major League Baseball history to hit four home runs 
in a single game, and only the second one to do so in a game that his team 
lost (the first one being Ed Delahanty). Later in the season, after hitting 
a record 210 career home runs without a grand slam, Horner finally belted 
a homer with the bases loaded to give the Braves a 4–2 victory over the 
Pirates. Horner's record for homers without a grand slam stood until 1998 
when Sammy Sosa surpassed the mark by hitting his first grand slam on the 
248th home run of his career. Horner became a free agent in 1987, after 
his first season of over 500 at bats. Although Horner was still near his 
peak, the Major League clubs were then colluding to drive down salaries, 
so no offers were made to Horner, who consequently signed a one-year contract 
with the Yakult Swallows of the Japanese League. He hit 31 homers and had 
73 RBIs for the team. He was given number 50 by the organization because 
that was the number of home runs they expected him to hit. Horner returned 
to the majors in 1988 with the St. Louis Cardinals, but after 60 games 
he injured his left shoulder. After being invited to spring training by 
the Baltimore Orioles in 1989, Horner announced his retirement. In his 
ten-year Major League career Horner batted .277 with 218 home runs, 685 
RBIs, 560 runs, 1047 hits, 169 doubles, 8 triples, 14 stolen bases, a .340 
on-base percentage, and a .499 slugging average in 1020 games. On July 
4, 2006, Horner was inducted into the College Baseball Hall of Fame as
