Carlos Enrique "Ricky" Nolasco (born December 13, 1982) is an American 
professional baseball pitcher for the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim of 
Major League Baseball (MLB). He is listed as 6'2" and 220, and made his 
major league debut on April 5, 2006. He has also played for the Florida/Miami 
Marlins, Los Angeles Dodgers and Minnesota Twins. He is of Mexican descent. 
Nolasco attended Rialto High School in Rialto, California. He graduated 
in 2001 and was drafted out of high school in the fourth round of the 2001 
Major League Baseball draft by the Chicago Cubs.[1] Nolasco began his professional 
career in the Rookie-level Arizona League with the Arizona League Cubs. 
In five games with the team, including four starts, he recorded a 1-0 win-loss 
record with an earned-run average (ERA) of 1.50. He spent the 2002 season 
with the Boise Hawks of the Class A-Short Season Northwest League, earning 
a record of 7-2 with an ERA of 2.48 in 15 starts. The next season, Nolasco 
was assigned to the Daytona Cubs of the Class A-Advanced Florida State 
League, where he went 11-5 with a 2.96 ERA in 26 starts. Nolasco started 
the 2004 season in the Double-A (AA) Southern League with the West Tenn 
Diamond Jaxx. A month into the season, on May 16, he was called up to the 
Triple-A Iowa Cubs of the Pacific Coast League. He made nine starts for 
Iowa, accumulating a record of 2-3 with an ERA of 9.30 before being sent 
back down to AA on June 28. Nolasco spent the rest of the season there; 
he finished the season with a record of 6-4 and an ERA of 3.70 in 19 starts 
throughout both stints with the Diamond Jaxx during the 2004 season. Nolasco 
then spent the entire 2005 season in AA as he achieved an impressive 14-3 
record with an ERA of 2.89 in 27 starts. The Florida Marlins acquired him, 
Sergio Mitre, and Renyel Pinto from the Cubs for Juan Pierre on December 
7, 2005. He made the opening day roster in 2006 and made his debut with 
3 scoreless innings of relief on April 5 against the Houston Astros. He 
recorded his first win with 2 innings of relief against the Cubs on April 
26. He made his first start on May 22, also against the Cubs, and allowed 
1 run in 7 innings to get the win. Nolasco missed most of the 2007 season 
with an injury and then started the 2008 season as a middle reliever, but 
quickly found his way to the top of the rotation as Florida's top starting 
pitcher. On August 19, 2008, he pitched a two-hitter against the San Francisco 
Giants. With one out in the 9th inning, he gave up a double; the only other 
hit given up by him was a ball deflected off the glove of first baseman 
Mike Jacobs. Nolasco also had a two-run double in the game. Nolasco won 
15 games in 2008, putting him in the top 5 in wins in the National League.[2] 
Nolasco was named the 2009 Opening Day starter, throwing in six innings 
and win against the Washington Nationals. On September 30, 2009, Nolasco 
struck out 16 batters, breaking A. J. Burnett's record for 14 strikeouts 
in a single game for the Florida Marlins.[3] In December 2010, Nolasco 
agreed to a contract extension with the Marlins to remain with the team 
through 2013. On August 23, 2011, Nolasco became the Marlins franchise 
leader in strikeouts, overtaking Dontrelle Willis. A year later on May 
22, 2012 he won his 69th game, overtaking Willis' club record of 68 wins 
with the Marlins. He finished the season with a 4.48 ERA in 191 innings 
pitched, with 47 walks, 125 strikeouts, a 1.37 WHIP, and a 12-13 record. 
On July 6, 2013, he was traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers for minor league 
pitchers Josh Wall, Steven Ames, and Ángel Sánchez. He made 15 starts for 
the Dodgers and was 8-3 with a 3.52 ERA. On November 27, 2013, Nolasco 
agreed to terms with the Minnesota Twins on a 4-year, $49 million deal, 
pending completion of a physical examination. The deal became official 
on December 3, 2013. In his first season as a Twin, Nolasco posted a disappointing 
5.38 ERA in 27 starts. Nolasco's 2015 season was cut short due to injury, 
recording a 6.75 ERA in 8 starts while also appearing in one game out of 
the bullpen. For the 2016 season, Nolasco was competing for a rotation 
spot with Tyler Duffey. Duffey ended up being sent down to AAA before the 
season began, anointing Nolasco the 5th starter. He continued his regression 
from his previous two seasons, registering an ERA of 5.13 in 21 starts 
for the Twins. The deal was largely seen as a massive overpay for a National 
League pitcher.[4] Nolasco ended his three seasons with the Twins with 
a 15-22 record. On August 1, 2016, the Minnesota Twins traded Nolasco with 
Alex Meyer plus cash in exchange for Angels pitcher Hector Santiago.[5][6]
