The 1959 Philadelphia Phillies season was the 77th season in the history 
of the franchise. During spring training, manager Eddie Sawyer told the 
press, "We're definitely not a last place club... I think the biggest thing 
we've accomplished is getting rid of the losing complex. That alone makes 
us not a last place club."[1] The Phillies finished in last place in 1959, 
seven games behind seventh-place St. Louis and 23-games behind the pennant 
and World Series winning Dodgers. In early 1959, Phillies owner Bob Carpenter 
proposed building a new ballpark for the Phillies on 72 acres (290,000Â m2) 
adjacent to the Garden State Park Racetrack in Cherry Hill, New Jersey. 
Connie Mack Stadium was 50 years old, did not have sufficient parking, 
and the sale of alcohol was banned at sports venues in Pennsylvania. Beer 
sales were legal in New Jersey. The proposed ballpark would have seated 
45,000 fans, been expandable to 60,000, and would have had 15,000 parking 
spaces.[2] The Phillies would eventually move to the South Philadelphia 
Sports Complex in 1971. On April 11, coach Benny Bengough was removed from 
the coaching staff and reassigned to the front office where he worked in 
team public relations.[9] Infielders Other batters Coaches Note: Pos =
