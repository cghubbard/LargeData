The 1999 Major League Baseball All-Star Game was the 70th playing of the 
midsummer classic between the all-stars of the American League (AL) and 
National League (NL), the two leagues comprising Major League Baseball. 
The game was held on July 13, 1999 at Fenway Park in Boston, Massachusetts, 
the home of the Boston Red Sox of the American League. Fenway Park was 
chosen as host because the owners at the time were planning to build a 
New Fenway Park in a few years but were unable to get the project off the 
ground in time for the game.[1] This All-Star Game is particularly notable 
as it featured the nominees for the All-Century Team as well as Ted Williams.[2] 
In two innings, AL starting pitcher Pedro Mart√≠nez struck out the first 
four batters of the National League, becoming the first pitcher in history 
to begin the All-Star Game striking out the side. In all he struck out 
five of the six batters he faced, earning him Game MVP honors, becoming 
the second player in All-Star Game history to be named MVP as a member 
of the host team. The game resulted in a win for the American League by 
the final score of 4-1. Players in italics have since been inducted into
