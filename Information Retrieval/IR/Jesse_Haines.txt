Jesse Joseph Haines (July 22, 1893 – August 5, 1978), nicknamed "Pop", 
was a right-handed pitcher in for the Cincinnati Reds and St. Louis Cardinals 
of Major League Baseball (MLB). After a lengthy stint in minor league baseball, 
he played briefly in 1918, then from 1920 to 1937. He spent nearly his 
entire major league career with the Cardinals. Haines pitched on three 
World Series championship teams. Though he had a kind personality off the 
field, Haines was known as a fiery competitor during games. After retiring 
in 1937 with a 210–158 win-loss record, Haines was a coach with the Brooklyn 
Dodgers in 1938. He left baseball after that season and returned to his 
native Ohio. He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1970. In 2014, 
he was inducted into the St. Louis Cardinals Hall of Fame Museum. He ranks 
second in franchise history in shutouts. Haines was born in Clayton, Ohio, 
but he grew up nearby in Phillipsburg, Ohio, where he attended local schools. 
His father Elias worked as an auctioneer.[1] Haines wanted to play baseball 
for the local team in Phillipsburg. His parents did not approve of him 
playing baseball on Sundays, so Haines used to sneak away, hiding his uniform 
in a corn crib and changing clothes in a cornfield. He left town to play 
semipro baseball in Dayton in 1912. Soon thereafter, he was signed to play 
for a minor league team in Dayton.[2] Spending several seasons in minor 
league baseball, Haines also pitched for teams in Saginaw, Fort Wayne, 
Springfield, Topeka and Tulsa. He had played briefly in the major leagues 
with the Cincinnati Reds in 1918, but he returned to the minor leagues.[1] 
Across his minor league career, he compiled a 107–61 record and 1.93 ERA 
over 187 games.[3] Branch Rickey of the St. Louis Cardinals noticed Haines 
while he was pitching in Kansas City, but the team was struggling with 
money. He convinced a group of the team's stockholders to take out a $10,000 
loan for the purchase of Haines's contract.[1] During his minor league 
days, Haines married Carrie M. Weidner. They had one child.[1] Haines became 
a fixture in the Cardinals starting rotation in 1920. Despite a 13–20 record, 
he pitched 301 2⁄3 innings, the highest output of his career, and recorded 
a 2.98 ERA. Author Paul Doutrich writes that while Haines was a mild-mannered 
individual, he had no patience for losing games and "became a raging bull 
when on the mound."[2] Haines threw a no-hitter on July 17, 1924 against 
the Boston Braves; more than 50 years passed before a St. Louis pitcher 
threw another no-hitter.[4] Haines pitched on three World Series championship 
teams, winning two games in the 1926 World Series.[5] In game seven of 
that series, Haines developed a bleeding blister and had to be removed 
from the game with the bases loaded in the seventh inning. Grover Cleveland 
Alexander was inserted into the game and struck out Tony Lazzeri.[6] As 
his career went on, Haines became known as "Pop" because of the influence 
he exerted on younger teammates. His use of the knuckleball allowed him 
to extend his career after his other pitches became ineffective. Unlike 
other knuckleball pitchers who gripped the pitch with their fingertips, 
Haines actually held the ball with his knuckles, throwing it as hard as 
he could.[7] Haines began to pitch fewer games in 1932. By 1936, manager 
Frankie Frisch thought that Haines had become too old and held him out 
of any games until May. However, he got more opportunities that year as 
the St. Louis pitching staff struggled with injuries. By June, he made 
relief pitching appearances three days in a row.[8] He retired in 1937, 
having pitched to the age of 43. He won 20 games or more three times for 
the Cardinals and won three World Series championships (in 1926, 1931, 
and 1934), though he did not pitch in the 1931 series. In the 1926 World 
Series against the Yankees, he went 2–0 with a 1.08 ERA. He retired with 
a 210–158 record, 981 strikeouts, 3.64 ERA, and 3208 2⁄3 innings pitched. 
Haines worked on the coaching staff of the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1938. After 
that, he was an auditor for almost thirty years in Montgomery County, Ohio.[1] 
After failing to gain more than 8.3% of the votes for induction into the 
Baseball Hall of Fame over a 12-year period, Haines was voted in by the 
Veterans Committee (VC) in 1970. Frankie Frisch, a member of the VC, also 
shepherded the selections of his teammates Dave Bancroft and Chick Hafey 
in 1971, Ross Youngs in 1972, George Kelly in 1973, Jim Bottomley in 1974, 
and Freddie Lindstrom in 1976.[9] After the committee selected Haines, 
Frisch commented that Haines was "a worthy, worthy man... a great competitor, 
a fine fellow off and on the field."[5] He died in 1978 in Dayton, Ohio 
after 28-year career as Montgomery County (Ohio) Assessor.[10] His grave 
in Clayton, Ohio which incorporates the sundial that the Cardinals gave 
Haines upon his retirement has become a local attraction.[11] Alex Remington 
of Yahoo! Sports has postulated that Haines may be "the worst player in 
the Hall of Fame."[12] In January 2014, the Cardinals announced Haines 
among 22 former players and personnel to be inducted into the St. Louis
