In 1649, Ousamequin (Massasoit) sold the surrounding land, then known as 
Saughtucket, to Myles Standish as an addition to Duxbury. Brockton was 
part of this area, which the English renamed Bridgewater, until 1821, when 
it became the town of North Bridgewater. Its name changed in 1874, after 
a contentious process finally decided on naming it after Isaac Brock, after 
a local merchant heard of Brockville, Ontario, on a trip to Niagara Falls. 
Brockton became a city on April 9, 1881. During the American Civil War, 
Brockton was America's largest producer of shoes, and until the latter 
parts of the 20th century Brockton had a large shoe and leather products
