Darren Arthur Daulton (born January 3, 1962), nicknamed Dutch, is a former 
catcher in Major League Baseball best remembered for his years with the 
Philadelphia Phillies. He has been called the "Greatest Clubhouse Leader 
the Phillies ever had." Daulton earned a World Series ring with the Florida 
Marlins in 1997. Daulton was drafted by the Phillies in the 25th round 
of the 1980 MLB draft. He was an all-star with the AA Reading Phillies 
in 1983. On September 25, 1983, Daulton made his major league debut for 
the Phillies. From 1983 to 1988 Daulton played sparingly, due chiefly to 
the presence of all-star catchers Ozzie Virgil and Lance Parrish. Daulton 
became the Phillies' full-time catcher in 1989. Daulton caught Terry Mulholland's 
no-hitter on August 15, 1990.[1] Daulton's finest season came in 1992. 
That season, Daulton led the National League in runs batted in with 109. 
Daulton also finished in the top 10 in on-base percentage, slugging percentage, 
OPS, home runs, walks, runs created, and extra base hits. Daulton's impressive 
season earned him his first all-star appearance, the National League Silver 
Slugger Award, and sixth place in National League MVP voting. Daulton was 
one of the catalysts of the NL pennant winning 1993 Phillies. Although 
the Phillies lost the World Series, Daulton was again named an all-star, 
drove in more than 100 runs for the second consecutive season, and finished 
seventh in National League MVP voting. Daulton once again finished in the 
top 10 in on-base percentage, runs batted in, walks, and extra base hits. 
Daulton also finished in the top 10 in times on base and intentional walks. 
Knee injuries caught up with Daulton. In 1994, Daulton was on pace for 
his best season yet when he went down for the season. Through 67 games, 
Daulton was hitting .300 with 15 home runs and 56 RBI. Both his batting 
average and slugging percentage (.549) were career highs at the time of 
his injury. By 1995, injuries had clearly taken a toll on Daulton's playing 
ability, and although he was named to his third all-star team, he played 
in only 98 games, and finished the year with just nine home runs. Daulton 
missed nearly the entire 1996 season due to injury, playing in five games. 
In 1997, after 17 years with the organization, the Phillies traded Daulton 
to the Florida Marlins. By this time, Daulton's knee injuries had forced 
him to change positions. After playing half of the season in Philadelphia 
as a left fielder, the Marlins used Daulton as a first baseman and pinch 
hitter. Daulton put up respectable numbers in his final season, hitting 
.263 with 14 home runs, 63 RBI and 68 runs scored in just 395 at bats. 
After the Marlins won the 1997 World Series, Daulton announced his retirement. 
In 14 seasons, Daulton hit .245 with 137 home runs, 588 RBI and 511 runs 
scored in 1161 games. Daulton was ranked as the 25th greatest catcher of 
all-time by Bill James in the 2001 edition of his Historical Baseball Abstract. 
On August 6, 2010 Daulton was inducted into the Philadelphia Baseball Wall 
of Fame. Since 2010, during the Philadelphia Phillies season, Daulton has 
hosted a radio show "Talking Baseball with Dutch" from 6 pm to 7 pm on 
97.5 The Fanatic in Philadelphia. He often makes appearances at the Greenhouse 
in Margate, New Jersey and at Miracle Field in the Somerton section of 
Philadelphia. On July 1, 2013, Daulton underwent surgery for resection 
of two brain tumors related to glioblastoma[2] at Thomas Jefferson University 
Hospital.[3] On February 23, 2015, Daulton announced that he was cancer-free. 
Daulton has been arrested several times on vehicle-related charges. He 
was arrested for DUI in Pinellas County, Florida, in 1988, and his driver's 
license was suspended for a year after he refused to take a breathalyzer 
test. His license was also suspended in the late 1990s due to unpaid speeding 
tickets; he received at least five during that time period, including one 
for traveling over 100 miles-per-hour in a 65 zone. While under his license 
suspension, he was involved in a single-vehicle accident on January 3, 
2001, causing $20,000 worth of damage to his BMW sedan. He again refused 
to be tested, and was charged with DUI, driving with a suspended license, 
and failing to appear in court.[4] Exactly two years later, he was arrested 
again for driving with a suspended license and DUI, after again refusing 
to be tested for alcohol.[5] At approximately 1AM on May 7, 1991, Daulton 
was riding in the red Mercedes-Benz SL500 driven by teammate Lenny Dykstra. 
Traveling at high speed, they crashed into a tree in Radnor Township, Pennsylvania 
after attending a bachelor party for teammate John Kruk. Dykstra suffered 
broken ribs, collarbone, and a broken facial bone while Daulton injured 
his eye and had a broken facial bone. According to Radnor Township police, 
Dykstra's blood alcohol content was 0.179 at the time of the crash. Daulton 
has authored a book on occultism and numerology, titled If They Only Knew, 
published in 2007.[6] In the book he discusses numerous aspects of occultism,
