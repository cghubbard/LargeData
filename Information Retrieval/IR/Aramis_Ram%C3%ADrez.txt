Aramis Nin Ramírez (/əˈrɑːmᵻs/; born June 25, 1978) is a Dominican former 
professional baseball third baseman, who played 18 seasons in Major League 
Baseball (MLB) for the Pittsburgh Pirates, Chicago Cubs, and Milwaukee 
Brewers. He was named an All-Star three times during his career. He started 
his professional career with the Pirates in 1998, before being traded to 
the Chicago Cubs in 2003. On November 12, 2006, Ramírez signed a five-year 
deal with the Cubs. On December 12, 2011, he signed a three-year contract 
with the Milwaukee Brewers. On July 23, 2015, he was traded back to Pittsburgh 
exactly 12 years after they first traded him, where he would finish the 
remainder of his final season. On November 7, 1994, Ramírez signed a contract 
with the Pittsburgh Pirates.[1] On May 26, 1998, he made his major league 
debut with the Pirates, becoming the youngest player in MLB at that time.[2] 
Ramírez struggled in his first three seasons, splitting playing time between 
the Pirates and Triple-A Nashville Sounds. Playing with the Pirates for 
an entire season for the first time in 2001, Ramírez hit .300 with 34 home 
runs. In 2002, his batting performance dipped to .234 with 18 home runs. 
Ramírez was traded to the Chicago Cubs with outfielder Kenny Lofton on 
July 23, 2003.[3] Ramírez finished the 2003 season strong in Chicago, though 
he led the majors with 33 errors at third base. He had the lowest fielding 
percentage of all Major League third basemen with .929. The Cubs made the 
playoffs and defeated the Atlanta Braves before being beaten by the eventual 
World Series champions Florida Marlins in the seven-game 2003 National 
League Championship Series. During the first inning of Game 4 of the NLCS, 
Ramírez hit the first playoff grand slam in Cubs history off Marlins starter 
Dontrelle Willis. Ramírez finished the series with three home runs, seven 
RBIs, and one triple. On September 16, 2004, Ramírez became the 14th player 
in Major League history to have two different games with three home runs 
in a season.[4] On defense, his range factor of 2.26 was the lowest among 
all Major League third basemen.[5] In 2005, he was elected to play in his 
first All-Star Game. Ramírez finished the season on the disabled list, 
after straining his quadriceps femoral muscle on August 24. He finished 
the season with 31 home runs and 92 RBIs. In 2006, Ramírez hit 38 home 
runs and 119 RBIs. He collected his 1,000th hit on July 15 versus the New 
York Mets.[6] On defense, his range factor of 2.41 was the lowest among 
Major League third basemen for the third straight year.[5] After the season, 
he was listed as being potentially the biggest free agent in the market. 
Ramírez elected to stay with the Cubs, agreeing to a five-year, $73 million 
contract on November 12, 2006. Ramírez hit his 200th career home run, off 
Claudio Vargas, on April 23, 2007. On June 29, 2007, Ramírez had one of 
the best games of his career, in which he went 3-for-5, highlighted by 
ending a crucial game against the Milwaukee Brewers with a two-out, two-run 
home run in the bottom of the ninth inning off pitcher, Francisco Cordero 
to cap a five-run comeback win. Many Cubs fans saw this game as the best 
comeback win of the season, which also sparked a new rivalry with the Brewers.[citation 
needed] The Cubs won the 2007 National League Central division. Ramírez 
finished the season with 101 RBIs, which led the team. He finished second 
on the Cubs in home runs (26) and batting average (.310). The divisional 
title came only after battling it out with Milwaukee for the final month 
of September. Ramírez made strides to improve his defensive game in 2007, 
as he lowered his error total and improved his range factor for the third 
consecutive year. Aramis Ramírez hit the longest home run of the season 
on 9/21/07, at 495 feet. On June 20, in the bottom of the ninth inning, 
during the first game of the 2008 Crosstown Classic against the Chicago 
White Sox, Ramírez hit his 2nd home run of the day for a walk off. He went 
on to homer in each of the next two games in that series. On July 7, Ramírez 
was selected to play in the All-Star Game as a reserve. Prior to Game 4 
of the World Series, Ramírez was awarded the Hank Aaron Award as the most 
outstanding offensive performer in the National League. Ramírez finished 
the season with the lowest range factor (2.16) of all major league third 
basemen.[7] Ramírez got off to a quick start in 2009 with five RBIs during 
the Cubs' opening series against the Houston Astros. His first-inning homer 
in the season opener off Roy Oswalt was the 250th of his career. On April 
18 against the St. Louis Cardinals, he hit a walk-off home run in the 11th 
inning. On May 8, Ramírez dislocated his left shoulder while fielding a 
ground ball in a game against the Milwaukee Brewers.[8] Ramirez began the 
season fairly slowly, batting .168 with five home runs and 22 RBIs through 
his first 47 games before landing on the 15-day disabled list on June 9 
with a bruised thumb. Infielder Chad Tracy was recalled from the Iowa Cubs 
to replace Ramirez. Ramirez returned to the starting lineup on June 25 
in Chicago against the White Sox. On defense, in 2010 he had the lowest 
fielding percentage among major league third baseman, at .939.[9] Ramirez 
activated his $14 million option on November 3, 2010 to stay with the Cubs 
for the 2011 season. On June 27, 2011, Ramirez and teammate Carlos Peña 
homered twice in a 7–3 win over the Colorado Rockies. Ramirez and Pena 
both hit a two-run home run and a solo home run each.[10] On July 1, 2011, 
Ramírez hit his 300th career home run against the Chicago White Sox.[11] 
On July 10, 2011, Aramis Ramírez was asked by National League manager Bruce 
Bochy to replace Plácido Polanco in the All-Star Game, but Ramirez declined 
the invitation due to previous plans to be with his family during the break.[12] 
On October 30, 2011, Ramirez declined his portion of the $16 million option 
on his contract and chose to become a free agent.[13] On November 2, 2011, 
Ramirez was awarded the Louisville Slugger Silver Slugger Award for best 
offensive NL third baseman. In his ninth season as a Cub, Ramirez batted 
.306 with 35 doubles, 26 home runs and a team-high 93 RBIs. He also led 
the team in slugging percentage and on-base percentage. On December 12, 
2011, Ramirez signed a three-year deal worth $36 million with the Milwaukee 
Brewers.[14] Ramirez continued his success in Milwaukee. He had a slow 
start to 2012, batting as low as .218 in mid-May. However, Ramirez was 
able to rebound to have a very solid offensive season with the Brewers, 
finishing the season with a .300 batting average, with 27 home runs, 105 
RBIs, as well as a league-leading 50 doubles. Ramirez was a top-five finalist 
for the NL Gold Glove Award in his first season as a Brewer, dramatically 
improving his fielding abilities and becoming one of the best infield defenders 
in baseball. He also finished ninth overall in MVP voting, the highest 
of his career. Ramirez's 2013 campaign was constantly interrupted by injury. 
During the preseason, Ramirez sprained his left knee sliding into second 
base during an exhibition game at Maryvale Baseball Park in Phoenix where 
the Milwaukee Brewers play their spring training games. He recovered in 
time to play on Opening Day, but re-aggravated the injury on a similar 
slide into second base during the fourth game of the season and was forced 
to miss 30 days on the Disabled List. Ramirez returned to play in May and 
June, but was hampered by the knee injury causing him to lack lateral movement 
at 3rd base and diminished his signature power. The injury developed into 
patella tendinitis forcing Ramirez into another 30-day stint on the Disabled 
List by the end of July. Aramis Ramírez returned from the DL, finishing 
the season with a .283 batting average, 12 home runs and 49 runs batted 
in over 92 games. This was his fewest amount of games played in a season 
since 2009 when Ramirez played in only 82 games. Ramirez focused on lower 
body workouts in the off season to prevent a re-occurrence of the knee 
injury from the previous season. His workouts proved successful as he was 
a starter for the 2014 National League All-Star Team.[15] He alternated 
strong batting seasons with weak ones, but ended the season with a .285 
batting average, 15 home runs, and 66 RBI over 131 games.[16] In advance 
of 2015 spring training, Ramirez announced that the season would likely 
be his last.[17] On July 23, 2015, Ramirez was traded back to the Pirates 
in exchange for minor league pitcher Yhonathan Barrios.[18][19] Upon his 
return to the Pirates, he was unable to wear his familiar #16 as that was 
being currently worn by first base coach Nick Leyva, so Ramirez chose to 
wear #17 instead, with Pedro Florimón making the switch to #23 to accommodate 
Ramirez. On September 9, 2015, Ramirez played a position other than third 
base for the first time in his Major League career, starting at first base. 
Ramírez formally announced his retirement from MLB on November 5 but added 
that he hoped to play one final season in the Dominican Winter League with 
los Tigres del Licey. He also expressed an interest in remaining involved
