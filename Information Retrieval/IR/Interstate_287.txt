New Jersey State Highway Routes Interstate 287 (I-287) is an auxiliary 
Interstate Highway in the US states of New Jersey and New York. It is a 
partial beltway around New York City, serving the northern half of New 
Jersey and the counties of Rockland and Westchester in New York. I-287, 
which is signed north–south in New Jersey and east–west in New York, follows 
a roughly horseshoe-shaped route from the New Jersey Turnpike (I-95) in 
Edison Township, New Jersey, clockwise to the New England Thruway (I-95) 
in Rye, New York, for 98.72 miles (158.87 km). Through New Jersey, I-287 
runs west from its southern terminus in Edison through suburban areas. 
In Bridgewater Township, the freeway takes a more northeasterly course, 
paralleled by U.S. Route 202 (US 202). The northernmost part of I-287 in 
New Jersey passes through mountainous surroundings. After crossing into 
New York at Suffern, I-287 turns east on the New York State Thruway (I-87) 
and runs though Rockland County. After crossing the Hudson River on the 
Tappan Zee Bridge, I-287 splits from I-87 near Tarrytown and continues 
east through Westchester County on the Cross-Westchester Expressway until 
it reaches the New England Thruway. A bypass around New York City had been 
planned since the 1950s and would become a part of the Interstate Highway 
System and receive the I-287 designation. The Cross-Westchester Expressway, 
which was originally designated as Interstate 187, opened in 1960 as Interstate 487 
before later becoming part of I-287. The New York State Thruway portion 
of I-287, which included a crossing of the Hudson River, opened in 1955. 
In New Jersey, the proposed I-287 had originally been designated as FAI 
Corridor 104 and incorporated what was planned as the Middlesex Freeway. 
The New Jersey section of I-287 between the New Jersey Turnpike in Edison 
and US 202 in Montville opened in stages between the 1960s and 1973; the 
remainder opened in 1994. The aging Tappan Zee Bridge is due to be replaced 
with a new span — construction started in 2013, with opening scheduled 
for 2017. In addition, a proposed tunnel across the Long Island Sound between 
Rye and Oyster Bay on Long Island would link the eastern terminus of I-287 
to New York State Route 25 (NY 25) and NY 135 in Syosset. I-287 begins 
at an interchange with the New Jersey Turnpike (I-95) in Edison in Middlesex 
County, New Jersey, where the freeway continues east as Route 440 towards 
Perth Amboy and Staten Island.[2][3] Within Middlesex County, I-287 is 
called the Lt. Col. (Ret) Richard F. Lauer, US Army Highway.[2] From this 
point, it heads west as an eight-lane freeway through suburban areas, soon 
reaching an interchange with US 1 that also has access to County Route 531 
(CR 531) in the southbound direction. Past this point, the road turns more 
to the northwest as it comes to the junction with Route 27 (Lincoln Highway).[2][3] 
Following Route 27, I-287 narrows to six lanes and passes over Amtrak's 
Northeast Corridor as it continues to a southbound exit and northbound 
entrance with CR 501.[2] As the freeway continues into South Plainfield, 
it passes near several business parks and comes to a partial interchange 
with Durham Avenue which only has a northbound exit and southbound entrance[2][3] 
At this point, the road starts to turn more west before it comes to a full 
junction with CR 529. Here, the road enters Piscataway Township and reaches 
an interchange with CR 665 (Washington Avenue).[2] Continuing near more 
business parks, I-287 comes to the exit for South Randolphville Road.[2][3] 
Following this interchange, the road heads west more before it turns to 
the southwest and comes to an interchange with the northern terminus of 
Route 18.[2] After Route 18, the freeway comes to the CR 622 (River Road) 
exit.[2][3] After crossing over the Raritan River, I-287 enters Franklin 
Township, Somerset County and becomes the Captain (Ret) Joseph Azzolina, 
US Navy Highway. Soon after the river, there is an interchange with CR 527.[2] 
After CR 527, the freeway makes a turn to the northwest and passes a mix 
of residential areas and business parks.[3] The road has an interchange 
with CR 623 (Weston Canal Road) before crossing the Raritan River again 
and continuing into Bridgewater Township.[2] Within Bridgewater Township, 
I-287 curves north-northwest and passes over both New Jersey Transit's 
Raritan Valley Line and CR 533 near TD Bank Ballpark, which is home to 
the Somerset Patriots baseball team. Past this area, the road encounters 
Route 28 at an interchange.[2][3] Past Route 28, the freeway turns northwest 
and intersects US 22 at a partial interchange with a northbound exit and 
entrance and southbound entrance. From this point, I-287 makes a turn to 
the west and runs to the north of US 22 as it has a wide median.[2] The 
freeway turns northwest as it passes near the Bridgewater Commons shopping 
mall and reaches a partial interchange with US 202/US 206.[2][3] Through 
the remainder of New Jersey, US 202 will parallel the course of I-287.[3] 
At this point, I-287 gains a local-express lane configuration, with 3 local 
and 2 express lanes southbound and 3 express and 3 local lanes northbound. 
Both the southbound local and express lanes have access to southbound US 202/US 206 
at this interchange, whereas northbound US 202/US 206 only has access to 
the local lanes of northbound I-287.[2] From here, the road continues north 
past suburban residential areas, with the northbound direction narrowing 
to 2 local lanes, before entering Bedminster Township.[2][3] Here, I-287 
intersects I-78 at the Vincent R. Kramer Interchange, where the local-express 
lane configuration ends. Access from eastbound I-78 to southbound I-287 
is only to the local lanes. Meanwhile, the express lanes of northbound 
I-287 provides access to westbound I-78 while the local lanes provide access 
to eastbound I-78.[2] Following I-78, I-287 heads north with four northbound 
lanes and three southbound lanes into more wooded surroundings, reaching 
another interchange with US 202/US 206.[2][3] At this point, the freeway 
median widens again as it turns northeast before continuing more to the 
east and entering Far Hills. Within Far Hills, the road passes under CR 512 
before the northbound direction narrows to three lanes and the wide median 
ends. Entering Bernards Township, I-287 runs east-northeast to an interchange 
with CR 525.[2] After the CR 525 interchange, the road gains a wide median 
that narrows again before the road runs under New Jersey Transit's Gladstone 
Branch, heading more to the northeast.[2][3] Before leaving Bernards Township, 
there is an exit for North Maple Avenue.[2] A short distance after this 
interchange, I-287 enters Harding Township, Morris County at the crossing 
of the Passaic River, where it becomes the Marine Hector Cafferata Jr. 
Cong. Medal of Honor Highway.[2] It continues northeast, with US 202 running 
a short distance to the west.[2][3] The freeway makes a turn more to the 
east as it comes to a truck-only rest area in the northbound direction.[3] 
The road crosses into Morris Township, where it reaches an exit-only interchange 
with Harter Road; there are no entrances present. Shortly after Harter 
Road, there is a junction with CR 663 (James Street) that only has entrances 
to I-287. After this, I-287 turns north and enters Morristown, where the 
northbound direction gains a fourth lane as the median narrows.[2] The 
freeway enters more developed areas as it comes to the Route 124 interchange. 
From this point, the road becomes eight lanes total, with four in each 
direction, as it passes west of Morristown Memorial Hospital.[2][3] After 
crossing under New Jersey Transit's Morristown Line, it reaches the exit 
for CR 510. From CR 510, I-287 makes a turn to the northeast, crossing 
back into Morris Township before continuing into Hanover Township. Here, 
the route comes to the western terminus of the Route 24 freeway.[2] Following 
Route 24, the freeway intersects Route 10. I-287 passes near several business 
parks as it enters Parsippany-Troy Hills. In this area, there is an interchange 
with CR 511 east of Lake Parsippany that also has access to Entin Road 
in the southbound direction. After this, I-287 widens to ten lanes with 
five northbound lanes, two express southbound lanes, and three local southbound 
lanes as it comes to the I-80 junction.[2][3] Following this interchange, 
the freeway becomes six lanes, with three in each direction as it continues 
into more wooded areas and reaching an exit with access to US 46 and US 202/CR 511. 
In this area, the highway runs to the west of the Jersey City Reservoir 
and immediately to the east of US 202/CR 511.[2][3] I-287 comes to the 
Intervale Road exit, which carries US 202 and CR 511. The freeway enters 
Boonton, where it turns northeast, with New Jersey Transit's Montclair-Boonton 
Line located a short distance to the northwest.[2] In Boonton, there is 
another interchange with US 202/CR 511. From here, I-287 curves more to 
the east, with US 202 running immediately to the north of the road.[2][3] 
Along this stretch, there is an exit for US 202 and Vreeland Avenue.[2] 
Upon entering Montville, the freeway draws away from US 202 as it passes 
near wooded residential areas before coming to another interchange with 
US 202. I-287 continues northeast from this point, crossing under New Jersey 
Transit's Montclair-Boonton Line before running north-northeast through 
more woodland as the terrain starts to get more mountainous.[2][3] The 
freeway runs through Kinnelon, where the northbound direction has four 
lanes, and Pequannock Township before entering Riverdale. In Riverdale, 
there is an interchange with Route 23. A short distance later, I-287 reaches 
the CR 694 interchange which provides access to CR 511 Alternate.[2] Immediately 
after this, I-287 crosses the Pequannock River into Bloomingdale, Passaic 
County, where the highway becomes US Air Force Gunner Clarence "Red" Mosley 
Highway.[2] The road continues northeast and turns north as it briefly 
passes through Pompton Lakes before crossing into Wanaque.[2][3] Here, 
the road makes a turn northeast again as it comes to the CR 511 Alternate 
interchange.[2] After this, I-287 passes through rock cuts in the Ramapo 
Mountains before making a sharp turn east as it crosses high above the 
Wanaque River valley on a bridge. The freeway continues into Oakland, Bergen 
County, where the name becomes Army Staff Sergeant Walter Bray Highway.[2][3] 
Here, there are a couple of businesses near the road before the interchange 
with Skyline Drive. Following this, the road crosses the Ramapo River before 
passing near neighborhoods and reaching a junction with US 202.[2][3] After 
US 202, I-287 turns southeast and closely parallels the New York, Susquehanna 
and Western Railway line to the southwest before entering Franklin Lakes 
and coming to an interchange with the northern terminus of Route 208.[2] 
Past this interchange, I-287 narrows to four lanes and turns northeast 
as the railroad line draws away. The freeway passes wooded residential 
neighborhoods prior to turning north and entering Mahwah Township, where 
it continues near more wooded suburban areas as well as the Campgaw Mountain 
Reservation to the west of the road. After passing to the east of the Ramapo 
College of New Jersey campus, I-287 passes over US 202.[2][3] The freeway 
crosses the Ramapo River again before reaching an interchange with Route 17.[2] 
At this point, Route 17 forms a concurrency with I-287 and the road widens 
to six lanes as it passes between the Ramapo Valley County Reservation 
to the west and business parks to the east.[2][3] Upon entering New York 
in the Village of Suffern in the Town of Ramapo in Rockland County, New 
York, New Jersey's Route 17 ends and NY 17 follows I-287 as the road comes 
to an interchange with the New York State Thruway (I-87).[4][5] At this 
point, I-287 joins I-87 on the eight-lane New York State Thruway, passing 
over Metro-North Railroad's Port Jervis Line as it heads east out of the 
mountains into suburban residential and commercial surroundings as it narrows 
to six lanes.[3][4] After passing through the Village of Montebello, the 
freeway reaches an interchange with Airmont Road where it becomes the border 
between Montebello to the north and the Village of Airmont to the south.[4][5] 
Continuing to the east, the New York State Thruway becomes the border between 
Monsey and Airmont before separating Monsey from the Village of Chestnut 
Ridge to the south as it turns slightly to the east-southeast.[5] After 
briefly running along the south edge of the Village of Spring Valley, where 
there is a westbound toll plaza for trucks, the highway fully enters Chestnut 
Ridge.[3][5] In this area, it comes to the New York extension of the Garden 
State Parkway.[4] Following this junction, I-87/I-287 continues east into 
the Town of Clarkstown, coming to an exit for NY 59.[4][5] After this, 
the road passes to the north of Nanuet, crossing under New Jersey Transit/Metro-North 
Railroad's Pascack Valley Line.[3][5] The freeway crosses under NY 304 
before the cloverleaf interchange with the Palisades Interstate Parkway. 
As the Thruway continues into West Nyack, it comes to the exit for NY 303 
that provides access to the Palisades Center shopping mall to the south 
of the road.[3][4] Past NY 303, I-87/I-287 turns to the east-southeast 
and passes near wooded areas as well as suburban neighborhoods of Central 
Nyack.[3][5] It comes to another interchange with NY 59 that also provides 
access to US 9W.[4][5] At this point, the New York State Thruway widens 
to eight lanes and turns to the south-southeast into the Village of Nyack 
in the Town of Orangetown, crossing over US 9W prior to passing near residential 
areas in the Village of South Nyack as it runs to the east of US 9W, descending 
The Palisades.[3][5] The last interchange in Rockland County is with US 9W 
and has no southbound exit.[3][4] From here, the New York State Thruway 
crosses the Hudson River on the Tappan Zee Bridge east into the Village 
of Tarrytown in the Town of Greenburgh in Westchester County.[3][5] After 
passing over the river, the road crosses over Metro-North Railroad's Hudson 
Line before coming to an eastbound toll plaza.[3] After this, the freeway 
comes to the exit for US 9 that also serves the western terminus of NY 119.[4][5] 
I-87/I-287 continue east past woodland and business parks, leaving Tarrytown 
before coming to an interchange where the two routes split, with I-87 continuing 
south on the New York State Thruway and I-287 heading east on the Cross-Westchester 
Expressway.[3][4][5] This interchange also has access to and from the northbound 
Saw Mill River Parkway and NY 119.[3] The Cross-Westchester Expressway, 
which is maintained by the New York State Thruway Authority, is six lanes 
wide and carries I-287 east to a westbound exit for NY 119 that is intertwined 
with the ramps between the New York State Thruway and NY 119/Saw Mill River 
Parkway.[3][4][6] After passing over the Saw Mill River Parkway and the 
Saw Mill River, the road enters the Village of Elmsford and runs through 
developed areas as it has a partial diamond interchange with NY 9A that 
does not have an eastbound exit.[3][4][5] The Cross-Westchester Expressway 
turns southeast from this point and intersects the Sprain Brook Parkway.[4][5] 
I-287 widens to eight lanes at this junction and continues to the exit 
for NY 100A.[3][4] After the NY 100A interchange, the freeway leaves Elmsford 
and turns to the east near residential areas, narrowing to six lanes before 
coming to an exit for NY 100 and NY 119 that also has access to the Bronx 
River Parkway.[3][4][5] Following this exit, the road becomes eight lanes 
again and crosses over the Bronx River Parkway, the Bronx River, and Metro-North 
Railroad's Harlem Line.[3][5] Here, the road crosses into White Plains 
and reaches an interchange with NY 22.[4][5] Past NY 22, I-287 makes a 
sharp curve to the south as it narrows to six lanes and runs near inhabited 
neighborhoods.[3] The road has a westbound exit and eastbound entrance 
with the Central Westchester Parkway, a road that provides access to the 
Taconic State Parkway by way of NY 22. The freeway runs past commercial 
areas to the east of downtown White Plains as it encounters Westchester 
Avenue, which connects to NY 119, NY 127, and Anderson Hill Road as well 
as The Westchester shopping mall in the downtown area.[3][4] Within this 
interchange, the Cross-Westchester Expressway turns east along the border 
between Harrison to the north and White Plains to the south.[5] Westchester 
Avenue becomes a frontage road for I-287 as the road passes corporate parks 
to the north and populated neighborhoods to the south.[3] The road begins 
to turn southeast as it comes to a directional interchange with the southern 
terminus of I-684.[3][4] The I-287 freeway heads south along the White 
Plains/Harrison border before turning east and fully entering Harrison, 
where there is a cloverleaf interchange with the Hutchinson River Parkway.[3][4][5] 
At this interchange, the Westchester Avenue frontage road serves as a collector/distributor 
road. The Cross-Westchester Expressway turns southeast again past wooded 
areas of development, with NY 120 coming onto the Westchester Avenue frontage 
road.[3] I-287 reaches an interchange where the frontage road ends as Westchester 
Avenue heads east as NY 120A and NY 120 continues to the south.[3][4] Here, 
the freeway enters the Village of Rye Brook in the Town of Rye as it continues 
southeast.[5] The Cross-Westchester Expressway comes into the Village of 
Port Chester, where the road runs near more dense suburban development 
as it intersects US 1.[3][4][5] At this point, the road has ramp access 
to and from the southbound direction of the New England Thruway (I-95).[3] 
From here, the mainline I-287 narrows to four lanes and enters the City 
of Rye, where it passes over the Northeast Corridor before merging into 
northbound I-95 about a half-mile (800 meters) west of the Connecticut 
state line.[3][4][5] In the 1950s, a limited-access highway was proposed 
to bypass New York City.[7] This planned beltway would be incorporated 
into the new Interstate Highway System.[8] The proposed beltway in New 
Jersey was designated as FAI Corridor 104 and later received the I-287 
designation in 1958.[9] The southern segment of I-287 was planned in the 
1950s as the Middlesex Freeway, which was to run from the Outerbridge Crossing 
to Staten Island and follow the Route 440 corridor to Edison, where it 
would connect to the New Jersey Turnpike before continuing west to I-78. 
From here, the freeway would parallel US 202 north to the New York border. 
The anticipated cost of building I-287 in New Jersey was $235 million.[10] 
The southernmost part of I-287 in Middlesex County was to be cosigned with 
I-95; this never happened due to the cancellation of the Somerset Freeway.[11][12] 
By the mid-1960s, I-287 had been completed between the New Jersey Turnpike 
and Bedminster Township and from US 46 in Parsippany to US 202 in Montville.[13] 
More of I-287 in New Jersey had been finished by 1969, with the sections 
from US 46 south to Route 10 in Hanover Township and from Bedminster Township 
north to Maple Avenue in Bernards Township opened.[11] The segment of the 
highway between Maple Avenue and Route 10 opened in 1973, making I-287 
a continuous road between the New Jersey Turnpike in Edison and US 202 
in Montville.[14] I-287's missing section between US 202 in Montville and 
the New York State Thruway in Suffern, NY was controversial dating back 
to 1965 and continuing until its opening in 1993. Property owners along 
the proposed route fought its completion as part of the freeway revolts 
of the 1960s and 1970s.[7] Originally, I-287 was proposed to take a more 
eastern route through the Lincoln Park and Wayne areas; this routing gained 
opposition as it passed through populated areas.[11][15] A more western 
alignment was planned through mountainous areas in 1973, but this was rejected 
as the cost of building the road through the mountains was too high.[15] 
In 1977, the current alignment of I-287 was proposed between Montville 
and Suffern; this was approved by the federal government in 1982 as it 
was less costly than the western alignment and went through less developed 
areas than the eastern alignment.[16][17] Permits allowing construction 
to begin on this segment were issued in 1988 by the Army Corps of Engineers. 
Officials in Rockland County, New York filed a lawsuit on November 19, 
1993, hours before the highway's official ribbon-cutting, seeking to block 
its opening. They claimed the incomplete interchange with the New York 
State Thruway was inadequate to handle the additional traffic.[7] That 
interchange was not complete until 1994, but the highway opened as planned 
on November 19 in a ceremony held on the Wanaque River bridge, where New 
Jersey Governor Jim Florio cut the ribbon.[7][18] This moment marked the 
completion of a bypass around New York City that had been planned for decades.[7] 
The portion of I-287 between the US 202 interchange in Oakland and the 
Route 208 interchange in Franklin Lakes overtook the westernmost portion 
of Route 208, truncating that route to its current location.[11][19] The 
completion of I-287 in New Jersey had significant effects on traffic and 
development patterns in the area. Several towns along the highway, such 
as Wanaque and Montville, saw increases in development. In addition, as 
the road was a bypass, it saw a significant increase in truck traffic wishing 
to bypass congested roads closer to New York City.[18] The road also increased 
truck traffic on other north–south corridors, such as Route 31, from truckers 
wanting to bypass the New Jersey Turnpike by using these surface roads 
to get between the I-287 bypass of New York City and I-95 south to Pennsylvania.[18][20] 
On July 16, 1999, Governor Christine Todd Whitman banned oversize trucks 
from using roads that are not part of the National Highway System, such 
as Route 31. Trucks were therefore forced to use I-287 and the New Jersey 
Turnpike to travel across the state.[21] In the 1990s, high-occupancy vehicle 
lanes were built along I-287 between Bedminster and Parsippany. These HOV 
lanes, along with the ones that had been built on I-80, were opened to 
all traffic in 1998 due to lack of HOV usage, and the state did not have 
to repay the federal government the $240 million to build the lanes.[22] 
In 2011, a small section of the northbound side of the highway in Boonton 
collapsed into the Rockaway River due to Hurricane Irene.[23] Near the 
end of that year, five people and a dog were killed when a small SOCATA 
TBM 700 airplane en route to Georgia crashed on the highway near exit 33 
in Morris Township.[24] The New York State Thruway portion of I-287 was 
planned around 1950 as part of a tolled limited-access highway that was 
to connect the major cities of New York.[25][26] A bridge across the Hudson 
River was planned between Nyack and Tarrytown at a site that was close 
enough to New York City but far enough from the Port Authority of New York 
and New Jersey's jurisdiction area, as they opposed the crossing.[27] The 
portion of the thruway currently followed by I-287, including the Tappan 
Zee Bridge over the Hudson River, opened on December 15, 1955.[28][29] 
In the 1960s, I-287 was designated along the New York State Thruway between 
Suffern and Tarrytown, while I-87 ran farther to the east on present-day 
I-684.[13] On January 1, 1970, the I-87 designation was shifted onto this 
portion of the New York State Thruway to run concurrent with I-287.[30] 
The E-ZPass electronic toll collection system was first introduced on this 
segment of the Thruway at the Spring Valley and Tappan Zee Bridge toll 
plazas in 1993.[31] The same year, an interchange in Suffern opened providing 
access to the newly opened New Jersey portion of I-287.[32] In 1997, tolls 
for cars were eliminated at the Spring Valley toll plaza, with tolls remaining 
for trucks and other commercial vehicles.[33] The I-87/I-287 interchange 
split near Tarrytown began a $187 million reconstruction in 2001 in order 
to add additional lanes and rebuild overpasses and underpasses.[34] Reconstruction 
in this area was completed in May 2004.[35] Plans for a limited-access 
road to cross Westchester County east to west date back to the 1920s and 
became more needed after post-World War II traffic increases. When the 
Tappan Zee Bridge was proposed around 1950, the Cross-Westchester Expressway 
was becoming a more realistic idea.[26] Construction of the freeway began 
in 1956, and was given the NY 119 designation. The design of the highway 
met Interstate highway standards after opening, and was supposed to have 
the I-187 designation. However, by the time the highway opened, it was 
officially designated as I-487 instead. At a cost of $50 million, the Cross 
Westchester Expressway was opened December 1960.[36] Later in the 1960s, 
this segment of road was redesignated I-287 to make it a part of the beltway 
around New York City.[13] I-287 was to continue past I-95 in Port Chester 
and was to cross Long Island Sound via the unbuilt Oyster Bay–Rye Bridge.[37][38] 
On Long Island, the route would run along the Seaford–Oyster Bay Expressway 
(NY 135). Then, I-287 was again to be extended into Jones Beach by merging 
with the Wantagh State Parkway in Merrick. The plans for the bridge, and 
the I-287 extension onto Long Island, were dropped in 1973 by Governor 
Nelson Rockefeller as a result of community opposition and environmental 
concerns.[39] Ownership of the Cross-Westchester Expressway was transferred 
from the New York State Department of Transportation to the New York State 
Thruway Authority in 1990 to help relieve the state's budget issues.[40] 
On July 27, 1994, a propane truck crashed into an overpass on the Cross-Westchester 
Expressway in White Plains and exploded, killing the driver. The fire from 
the explosion spread into adjacent neighborhoods and injured 23 people.[41] 
In the mid-1990s, a reversible high-occupancy vehicle lane was proposed 
for the Cross-Westchester Expressway in order to alleviate congestion at 
a planned cost of $365 million. In addition, a Metro-North Railroad line 
and a guided busway were considered to serve the I-287 corridor in Westchester 
County as alternatives to the HOV lane.[42] The proposed HOV lane was cancelled 
in 1997 by Governor George Pataki out of the fear it would have negative 
effects on the area in trying to solve traffic.[43] Since 1999, the Cross-Westchester 
Expressway has been under construction in order to reduce congestion and 
improve safety for the motorists who use the highway.[44] The final phase 
of the project, a reconstruction in the area of exit 8 in White Plains, 
was completed in December 2012, nine months ahead of schedule.[45] Due 
to the congestion along I-87/I-287 and the aging and decay of the over 
fifty-year-old Tappan Zee Bridge, talks have begun regarding the possibility 
of replacing the bridge.[46] A variety of transportation improvements are 
currently being considered, including a Metro-North Railroad commuter rail 
system or a bus rapid transit system that would link the western shore 
of the Hudson River with Westchester County and New York City. In addition, 
several alternatives are being considered for traffic management on the 
bridge, including high-occupancy toll lanes, park and ride lots, ramp meters, 
and congestion tolling at peak times.[47] Several designs for the new bridge, 
which is to be north of the existing structure, included suspension, cantilever, 
and cable-stayed spans.[48] Construction on the new bridge began in 2013, 
with opening targeted for 2017. NJDOT started the I-287 (Middlesex Freeway) 
Rehabilitation Project in August 2007 to resurface the pavement between 
exit 5 in South Plainfield and I-95/New Jersey Turnpike in Edison Township, 
which is used by about 150,000 vehicles daily. Some of the bridges and 
overpasses had deteriorated to such a state that they needed to be replaced.[49] 
On September 16, 2009, NJDOT announced the start of another rehabilitation 
and repaving project from exit 5 in Piscataway to the area of exit 10 in 
Franklin Township. This project, which is being funded by the American
