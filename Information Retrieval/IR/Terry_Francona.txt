Terrence Jon "Terry" Francona (born April 22, 1959), nicknamed "Tito", 
is the manager of the Cleveland Indians of Major League Baseball (MLB). 
Previously, he was the manager of the Boston Red Sox, whom he led to two 
World Series titles, and ended the franchise's 86-year-old championship 
drought. After an unsuccessful stint as the manager of the Philadelphia 
Phillies for four seasons, Francona was hired to manage the Red Sox in 
2004, and led the team to their first championship since 1918. He won another 
World Series with Boston in 2007 and continued to manage the team until 
the end of the 2011 season, where his contract wasn't renewed following 
a September collapse and its aftermath. In 2013, Francona was hired to 
manage the Cleveland Indians and by his fourth season with the team, led 
them to an appearance in the 2016 World Series. Francona grew up in New 
Brighton, Pennsylvania, about 30 miles (48 km) northwest of Pittsburgh, 
where he got his start in baseball at New Brighton Area High School.[1][2] 
His father is Tito Francona, who played outfield for several Major League 
clubs from 1956 to 1970, including Cleveland from 1959 through 1964.[3] 
Francona is of Italian ancestry. Francona attended the University of Arizona, 
where he played college baseball for the Arizona Wildcats baseball team. 
Francona and the Arizona Wildcats won the 1980 College World Series[4] 
and Francona was named the tournament's Most Outstanding Player.[5] Francona 
won the 1980 Golden Spikes Award.[6] Francona was drafted in the first 
round of the 1980 amateur draft by the Montreal Expos, using the 22nd overall 
selection. After briefly playing in the minor leagues, Francona made his 
major league debut with Montreal on August 19, 1981, a week after the end 
of that summer's player strike. He appeared mainly as an outfielder that 
first year, and he went 4-for-12 in the National League Division Series 
against the Philadelphia Phillies, an extra playoff round utilized that 
year because the season was conducted in two halves as the result of the 
strike. The Expos won that series, three games to two. As the seasons went 
on, Francona shifted to first base, where he ultimately played one hundred 
games more than he had in the outfield. He also developed a reputation 
as a contact hitter, with very few home runs, walks, or strikeouts. The 
Expos released Francona after the 1985 season, during which his batting 
average had slipped to .267 after posting a .346 average in limited action 
in 1984. He went on to sign one-year contracts with the Chicago Cubs, Cincinnati 
Reds, Cleveland Indians, and Milwaukee Brewers. The Brewers re-signed Francona 
for 1990, but he only played in three games for the Brewers that year, 
the last on April 19. In 10 seasons and 708 games, he posted a .274 career 
average, with 16 home runs and 143 RBIs. He also made an appearance as 
a pitcher with Milwaukee on May 15, 1989, throwing 12 pitches and striking 
out one batter (Stan Javier) on three pitches.[7] After retiring as a player, 
Francona began coaching, spending several years in the Chicago White Sox 
organization. In 1991, he managed the rookie league Sarasota White Sox 
of the Gulf Coast League. In 1992, he ran the South Bend White Sox of the 
mid-level Class A Midwest League. As manager of the AA franchise Birmingham 
Barons in 1993–95, he posted a 223-203 record and won two distinctions: 
Southern League Manager of the Year in 1993, Baseball America's Minor League 
Manager of the Year in 1993, and top managerial candidate by Baseball America 
in 1994, the same year Michael Jordan played for Birmingham. Birmingham 
won the Southern League championship in 1993. He managed in the Dominican 
Winter League with the Águilas Cibaeñas, and he also won the championship 
and the Serie del Caribe in 1995–96. That team included Miguel Tejada, 
Manny Ramirez, and Tony Batista. Francona became third-base coach for the 
Detroit Tigers in 1996, working under their new skipper, Buddy Bell, a 
former teammate of Francona on the Reds. After the season ended, he was 
hired as manager of the Phillies, who had won the NL pennant in 1993 but 
then had three consecutive losing seasons. In Francona's four seasons (1997 
through 2000) as the Phils' skipper, the club never rose above third place 
in the National League East. His best finish with the Phillies was 77–85 
in 1999. In 1998 and 1999, the Phillies finished in third place, behind 
the Atlanta Braves and their division-rival New York Mets. He was fired 
following the 2000 campaign. He finished with a 285–363 record.[8] He spent 
the following season as a special assistant to the general manager with 
the Cleveland Indians in (2001), which was followed by two one-year terms 
as a bench coach for the Texas Rangers (2002) and Oakland Athletics (2003). 
The Red Sox hired Francona to manage their club in 2004, after Grady Little's 
contract was not renewed following the Red Sox loss in the 2003 American 
League Championship Series. Francona led the Red Sox to a 98–64 record 
in 2004, the second-best record in the American League behind their biggest 
rival, the New York Yankees. The club gelled in the second half and won 
more games than any other team in the American League after the All-Star 
break. As the American League wild card, the Red Sox swept the AL West 
champion Anaheim Angels, three games to none, in the Division Series. In 
the 2004 American League Championship Series, the Red Sox fell behind the 
Yankees, three games to none, including a 19–8 loss in Game 3 at home in 
Fenway Park. However, the club regained its composure and won the last 
four games of the series, the first time in Major League Baseball history 
that a team rallied from an 0–3 deficit to win a playoff series (only the 
third team to even make it as far as Game 6, and the only team to even 
force a Game 7 after trailing a series three games to zero). The Red Sox 
swept the St. Louis Cardinals 4–0 in the 2004 World Series. The long-awaited 
victory ended 86 years of frustration for Red Sox fans. It was the sixth 
title in franchise history. During the 2005 season, Francona was hospitalized 
after complaining of severe chest pains. Tests revealed significantly clogged 
arteries, but it was concluded that Francona had not suffered a heart attack. 
This incident, as well as a life-threatening pulmonary embolism suffered 
in 2002, painful knees, and ongoing treatment for blood clots, has led 
to circulation issues which necessitate wearing extra clothes, including 
two pairs of tights. This is also why his regular uniform top is usually 
hidden by a pullover.[9][10] Two years later, the Sox won the AL East Division, 
finishing two games ahead of the Yankees. Under Francona's leadership, 
the Sox swept the Angels in the Division Series before dropping three of 
the first four games to the Cleveland Indians in the ALCS. The Sox, facing 
elimination, went on to win their next three games, defeating Cleveland 
to advance to the 2007 World Series, where they swept the Colorado Rockies 
in four games. Terry Francona is the only manager in Major League history 
to win his first eight consecutive World Series games and just the second 
manager to guide two Red Sox clubs to World Series titles, the other being 
Bill "Rough" Carrigan who led Boston to back-to-back championships in 1915 
and 1916. As of October 1, 2008, Francona's career regular-season managerial 
record was 755–703 (.518), while his post-season record was 22–9 (.710). 
Among managers who have managed at least 20 post-season games, he has the 
highest winning percentage. Francona won his first seven playoff elimination 
games (not losing until being swept by the Chicago White Sox in the 2005 
ALDS) and first nine ALCS elimination games (not losing until Game 7 of 
the 2008 ALCS at the Tampa Bay Rays). On February 24, 2008, the Red Sox 
announced that they had extended Francona's contract. Instead of expiring 
at the end of the 2008 season, it would expire after the 2011 season. The 
team also held club options for 2012 and 2013.[11] Francona was guaranteed 
a total of $12 million over the first three years of the contract, plus 
a $750,000 buyout to be received if his 2012 and 2013 options were not 
exercised.[12] On June 2, 2009, Francona recorded his 500th win as manager 
of the Red Sox, making him the third manager in club history to have 500 
wins. The only other two to win at least 500 games as manager of the Red 
Sox are Joe Cronin (1,071), and Mike Higgins (560).[13] On May 6, 2010, 
Francona became the fourth person to manage 1,000 games for the Red Sox. 
On July 23, 2011, Francona got his 1,000th win as a manager, but his team 
collapsed historically in September, finishing 7-20 and squandering a nine-game 
lead over the Rays for the AL Wild Card spot. Following the season, the 
Red Sox declined to exercise Francona's 2012 option.[14][15] He finished 
his Red Sox career with a 744-552 record in the regular season—second to 
Cronin in victories, but tops in winning percentage (.574) among those 
of manage at least 750 games—and 28–17 (.622) in the postseason with those 
two World Series championships.[8] Francona was hired as manager of the 
Cleveland Indians on October 6, 2012, and officially introduced on October 
8. The Indians chose Francona over Sandy Alomar Jr., who had served as 
the club's interim manager for the final six games of the 2012 season after 
Manny Acta was fired on September 27. Francona and Alomar, who had spent 
the past three seasons as a coach in Cleveland, were the only candidates 
interviewed for the Indians' opening.[16][17][18] Alomar stayed in Cleveland 
in Francona's staff as the bench coach. Under Francona, the Cleveland Indians 
finished the 2013 regular season with a record of 92-70, which was a 24-game 
improvement over the previous year. The Indians were eliminated from the 
2013 MLB playoffs by losing 4-0 to the Tampa Bay Rays in the American League 
Wild Card Game. On November 12, 2013, Terry Francona was named as the American 
League Manager of the Year. Francona agreed to a two-year extension on 
November 4, 2014. He has led the team to a 177-147 record since 2013.[19] 
Francona managed the Indians to the American League Central Division title 
in 2016.[20] His team swept his former club, the Boston Red Sox, in three 
games in the divisional series -- clinching a berth in the ALCS with a 
win in Boston's Fenway Park on October 10, 2016.[21] On October 19, 2016, 
Terry Francona's Indians beat the Toronto Blue Jays to move on to the 2016 
World Series, where the Indians won game 1 against the Chicago Cubs 6-0 
to extend his World Series record to 9-0. Francona lost his first World 
Series game when the Indians were defeated by the Cubs in game 2 by a score 
of 5-1. The Indians won game 3 against the Chicago Cubs 1-0. The Indians 
won game 4 against the Chicago Cubs 7-2 to give Cleveland a 3-1 lead. The 
Indians would fall to the Cubs 3-2 in game 5. Cleveland went on to lose 
Game 6 by a score of 9-3, then lose 8-7 in 10 innings in Game 7 handing 
Francona his first World Series loss.[citation needed] Following his departure 
from the Red Sox in 2011, Francona was employed by the Fox network as a 
substitute color analyst for the first two games of the American League 
Championship Series. Francona, who teamed with play-by-play announcer Joe 
Buck, filled in for regular Fox analyst Tim McCarver, who was recuperating 
from minor heart surgery.[22] On December 5, 2011, Francona signed with 
ESPN joining their Sunday Night Baseball telecast, replacing Bobby Valentine, 
who himself replaced Francona as manager of the Red Sox. During the 2012 
season, he worked as an analyst on Sunday Night Baseball, contributed to 
ESPN.com, and contributed to ESPN's Little League World Series coverage. 
Francona dearly thanked ESPN as he left for the job as Cleveland Indians 
manager.[23] Since becoming the manager of the Indians, Francona's former 
ESPN Sunday Night Baseball colleagues have referred to the Indians as the 
"Fighting Franconas." Francona married Jacque Lang on January 9, 1982,[24] 
and they have four children: son Nicholas, and daughters Alyssa, Leah, 
and Jamie. Nick played collegiate baseball for the University of Pennsylvania[25] 
and for a time in the Cape Cod Baseball League. He was a lieutenant in 
the United States Marine Corps.[26] Alyssa and Leah played on the University 
of North Carolina softball team.[27][28] In 2009, Alyssa was a senior and 
Leah was a freshman on the team. Jamie currently attends the United States 
Naval Academy. It was revealed in October 2011 that Francona and Lang had 
recently separated and that Francona had been living in a hotel room during 
the baseball season.[29] Francona later admitted that he and Lang were 
in the final stages of divorcing.[30] He is known for his ever-present 
wad of chew.[31] Francona and Indians' bench coach Brad Mills have been 
best friends since their college playing days and have coached together
