The St. Louis Cardinals 1998 season was the team's 117th season in St. 
Louis, Missouri and the 107th season in the National League. The Cardinals 
went 83-79 during the season and finished 3rd in the National League Central 
division, 18 games behind the Houston Astros. First baseman Mark McGwire 
broke Roger Maris' single-season home run record this season by hitting 
70 home runs, battling with the Chicago Cubs' Sammy Sosa, who finished 
runner-up in the National League with 66. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8]

against the Montreal Expos, McGwire had 68 Home Runs. In the third inning, 
McGwire hit a home run off of Mike Thurman, and in the seventh, he got 
number 70 off of Carl Pavano. The ball was caught by Philip Ozersky.[7] 
In January 1999, Todd McFarlane purchased Mark McGwire's 70th home run 
ball from the 1998 season for a record $3 million.[8] September 27, Busch 
Stadium, St. Louis, Missouri A section of Interstate 70 running through 
downtown St. Louis was renamed "The Mark McGwire Highway." His record stood 
until Barry Bonds hit 73 in 2001. In years following, revelations of the 
anabolic steroids scandals have possibly tainted these records, but at 
the time it was great theater and was largely responsible for drawing many 
fans back to the game after the 1994 players' strike, which had angered 
and alienated many of them. Infielders Coaches Note: Pos = position; G
