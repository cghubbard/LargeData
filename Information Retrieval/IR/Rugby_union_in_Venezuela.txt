Rugby union is a team sport that is played in Venezuela. Rugby in Venezuela 
is still an amateur sport.[1] The history of rugby in Venezuela goes back 
to the fifties of the last century, when a group of English oil workers 
played the first match in Zulia State.[2] In 1974, some Frenchmen, Argentines 
and Uruguayans created two rugby teams in Caracas: Martell and Renault.[3] 
Martell and Renault played the first organized match on 14 July 1974.[3][4] 
Later the two teams mixed together to form a new one: Rugby Club Caracas 
(RCC).[3][4] Another rugby team, Anaucos Rugby Club, was founded by a group 
of Argentines and Uruguayans.[3][4] In 1974, the first international rugby 
match of a Venezuelan team was held against the players from a French frigate.[2] 
In 1978, the first rugby club formed exclusively with native players was 
founded at Simón Bolívar University: the Club de Rugby de la Universidad 
Simón Bolívar (CRUSB).[3] In the course of time, more rugby teams were 
created in Caracas and other Venezuelan cities.[3] The governing body is 
the Venezuelan Rugby Federation, which was founded in 1992. It is affiliated 
to World Rugby and Sudamérica Rugby. The most important tournament is the 
Campeonato Nacional de Clubes (National Championship of Clubs) contested 
by Venezuelan men's clubs.[4] Another notable tournament is the Torneo 
Internacional de Rugby Los Andes (Los Andes Rugby International Tournament) 
played at Mérida.[4] Santa Teresa seven-a-side, the Circuito Nacional de 
Sevens (National Sevens Series) and the Seven de las Flores (Sevens of 
Flowers) are important club competitions in rugby sevens.[4] The matches 
of these competitions are played at weekends. In Venzuela, rugby is not 
as popular as sports such as baseball, football or basketball. The coverage 
of rugby competitions by Venezuelan mass media is sporadic.[1] Years ago, 
rugby players had to fund themselves in the terms of uniforms, equipment, 
travel costs, etc. Recently, some financial support has come from the Venezuelan 
Ministry of Sport and private companies which offer sponsorship to the 
clubs.[1] Rugby in Venezuela is an amateur sport and rugby players receive
