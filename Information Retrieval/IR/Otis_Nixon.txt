Otis Junior Nixon, Jr. (born January 9, 1959) is a former Major League 
Baseball player. He was a center fielder and switch-hitter who played from 
1983 to 1999. He has stolen the most bases for a player that has never 
appeared in an MLB All-Star game since the All-Star Game was inaugurated 
in 1933. In the minor leagues, Nixon led the league twice in stolen bases 
(1980 in the South Atlantic League with 67 & 1983 in the International 
League with 94), runs scored (1980 in the South Atlantic League with 124 
& 1983 in the International League with 129), hits (162 in 1983 in the 
International League), at bats (557 in 1983 in the International League) 
and walks (57 in 1979 in the Appalachian League, 113 in 1980 in the South 
Atlantic League and 110 in 1981 in the Southern League). He started out 
as an infielder but was switched to outfield in 1983 due to his superior 
speed and frequency of errors (56 in 127 games in 1981 at shortstop for 
the Nashville Sounds). Nixon shares the single game stolen base Major League 
record with 6 on June 16, 1991. He also holds the Atlanta Braves single 
season record for stolen bases with 72 in 1991. In 1982, Nixon stole 107 
bases in a combined season between the AA level Nashville Sounds and the 
AAA level Columbus Clippers. In 17 seasons Nixon played with the New York 
Yankees (1983), Cleveland Indians (1984–87), Montreal Expos (1988–90), 
Atlanta Braves (1991–93, 1999), Boston Red Sox (1994), Texas Rangers (1995), 
Toronto Blue Jays (1996–97), Los Angeles Dodgers (1997) and Minnesota Twins 
(1998). Nixon battled a cocaine habit for much of his career. He was arrested 
on drug charges in 1987 while a member of the Cleveland Indians organization. 
Nixon failed a drug test in September 1991 and was suspended for 60 days, 
which caused Nixon to miss the 1991 World Series. On July 25, 1992, Nixon 
made a catch over the wall to rob Andy Van Slyke of a home run that was 
replayed constantly on the sports news television shows. Nixon made the 
final out of the 1992 World Series attempting to bunt for a base hit with 
a runner on 3rd and 2 out in extra innings of Game 6. Nixon had successfully 
bunted for base hits many times for the Braves in 1991–1992, but this time 
it didn't work. It was the only World Series in history to end on a bunt.[citation 
needed] On his previous at-bat, Nixon had singled home the tying run (swinging, 
not bunting) with 2 out in the bottom of the 9th to send Game 6 to extra 
innings. In the 1999 National League Championship Series, 40-year-old Nixon 
made one of the key plays to save the series for the Braves. After the 
Braves had blown 5-0 and 7-3 leads in Game 6 and trailed 8-7 in the 8th 
inning, Nixon pinch ran at 1st base with 1 out and changed the momentum 
of the game and the series by stealing second and going to third when the 
throw went into center field. Nixon went on to score the tying run, and 
the Braves eventually won the game in extra innings. Nixon was a career 
.270 hitter with 11 home runs, 318 RBI, 878 runs, 1379 hits, 142 doubles, 
27 triples, and 620 stolen bases in 1709 games. In 2000 he married former 
R&B singer Perri Reid.[1] They divorced in 2004. In an interview on February 
11, 2010, on Hardcore Sports Radio on Sirius, Nixon discussed how he overcame 
his demons and conquered his drug and alcohol addiction.[2] Nixon married 
gospel artist Candi Staton in 2010. Candi divorced Otis in 2012. Their 
divorce was finalized on December 12, 2012. [3] Nixon was arrested May 
4, 2013, in Cherokee County, Georgia, after a crack rock and pipe were 
found in his vehicle during a traffic stop.[4] At approximately 2:30 AM 
on Jun 9, 2013, an arson took place at one of Nixon's homes in nearby Cobb 
County, Georgia, after a dispute erupted between an individual that lives
