Trevor Andrew Bauer (born January 17, 1991) is an American professional 
baseball player with the Cleveland Indians of Major League Baseball (MLB). 
He also pitched in MLB for the Arizona Diamondbacks. Bauer starred in college 
for the UCLA Bruins, winning the Golden Spikes Award in 2011. That year, 
he was the third overall selection of the 2011 Major League Baseball draft 
by the Diamondbacks, and considered a top pitching prospect before making 
his MLB debut in 2012.[1] The Diamondbacks traded him to the Indians during 
the 2012–13 offseason. Bauer attended Hart High School in Santa Clarita, 
California, and the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), where 
he played for the UCLA Bruins baseball team. In his freshman year at UCLA, 
Bauer recorded a 9–3 record with a 2.99 ERA, collecting 92 strikeouts in 
105.1 innings. Bauer was a member of the USA 2009 Baseball Collegiate National 
Team. He was 1–1 with a 4.67 ERA in five games (three starts), 24 strikeouts, 
and seven walks in 17 1⁄3 innings. In 2009, he was named to the freshman 
All-America team by Baseball America.[2] During the 2010 season, the Bruins 
had the best record (51–17) in school history and were the second best 
team in the country. The Bruins played in the 2010 College World Series 
and were defeated by South Carolina in the NCAA Championship Series.[3] 
Bauer went 12–3 with a 3.02 ERA, collecting 165 strikeouts in 131 1⁄3 innings. 
The 165 strikeouts were the best in the nation.[citation needed] In 2010, 
he was a finalist for the Golden Spikes Award, presented annually to the 
top amateur baseball player in the country by USA Baseball.[4] In 2011, 
Bauer was named the Pac-12 Pitcher of the Year and to the All-Pac-12 First 
Team. He was also the Collegiate Baseball Newspaper's National Player of 
the Year. He was named the District IX Player of the Year by the National 
Collegiate Baseball Writers Association (NCBWA) and College Player of the 
Year by Baseball America.[5] In his junior year, Bauer went 13–2 with a 
1.25 ERA in 16 starts. He set a nation-leading and Pac-12 single-season 
record of 203 strikeouts. He finished the season with nine consecutive 
complete games and established new records at UCLA, including 460 career 
strikeouts, 34 wins, 373 1⁄3 pitched innings. Bauer was the recipient of 
the Golden Spikes Award,[6] and the National Pitcher of the Year Award.[7] 
"He came right after guys. After a couple of guys got on in the second 
inning, he had that adrenaline going, and he pitched out of it. He used 
all his pitches which is what everyone wanted to see, and he threw them 
all very well." Bauer was selected third overall in the 2011 Major League 
Baseball Draft by the Arizona Diamondbacks.[9] On July 25, he signed a 
major league contract with the Diamondbacks, being added to the 40-man 
roster.[10] He made his professional debut with the Class-A Advanced Visalia 
Rawhide.[11] In the game, Bauer pitched two innings, allowing one hit, 
striking out three batters and walked one.[8] He made three starts in total 
in Visalia, pitching in nine innings and allowing three runs on seven hits. 
However, he struck out 17 of the 39 batters he faced,[12] earning himself 
a promotion to the Double-A Mobile BayBears on August 13.[13] In four starts 
at AA Mobile, Bauer pitched 16 2⁄3 innings, striking out 26, but walked 
eight batters and had a 7.56 ERA.[14] Bauer received his first win as a 
professional August 20, 2011 in a 13–6 victory over the Jacksonville Suns. 
He was named to appear in the 2012 All-Star Futures Game.[15] Bauer made 
his major league debut for the Diamondbacks on June 28, 2012, against the 
Atlanta Braves. He went 4 innings, struck out 3 batters, and gave up 5 
hits in a no-decision. He got his first major league win on July 8, against 
the Los Angeles Dodgers. On July 18, 2012, Bauer was optioned back to Triple-A 
Reno after posting a 1–2 record and 6.06 ERA. The organization rested Bauer 
for two weeks to keep his arm lively, and he responded by posting six shutout 
innings in his first start back on August 6.[16] On December 11, 2012 he 
was traded to the Cleveland Indians in a three team deal. Bauer went to 
Cleveland with Matt Albers and Bryan Shaw in exchange for Didi Gregorius, 
Tony Sipp and Lars Anderson. The Indians also acquired Drew Stubbs in a 
deal that sent Shin-Soo Choo and Jason Donald to Cincinnati to complete 
the deal.[17] On June 16, 2015, Bauer got his first hit as a batter against 
the Chicago Cubs' pitcher Jake Arrieta in the top of the 5th inning at 
Wrigley Field.[18][19] During the July 3, 2015, game against the Pittsburgh 
Pirates' pitcher Antonio Bastardo, Bauer imitated his teammates batting 
stances (Jason Kipnis, Mike Avilés, and Ryan Raburn) in the top of the 
7th inning and drew a walk.[20][21] Bauer said he has patterned his overhand 
delivery after his role model two-time Cy Young Award winner Tim Lincecum.[22] 
Bauer said he has studied so much video of Lincecum that he can by memory 
play back frame by frame Lincecum striking out 18 UCLA batters while he 
was a junior at the University of Washington. "He's been a huge influence 
on my career and my delivery," Bauer said. Bauer features an eclectic and 
large variety of pitches. According to an article in Sports Illustrated, 
Bauer has experimented with up to 19 different pitches.[1] He explained 
in an interview why he features so many pitches: I'm very passionate about 
my craft and I've always been into science and discovery and all that stuff, 
so I'm always trying to find a way to get better from season to season. 
And throwing more pitches is a way that I've found to.... The more pitches 
that I have, that have different speeds and move differently, the more 
confusion it creates for the hitter. And if I throw all of them out of 
the same tunnel and make them look the same though 20 feet of flight ... 
obviously, I'm going to be a lot tougher to hit.[23] According to Bauer, 
he throws the following pitches:[23] Bauer has gained notoriety for his 
unusual workout and warmup regimen,[26][27] which includes long toss at 
distances of up to 400 feet. Bauer is also known to study his pitching 
mechanics using high-speed cameras.[1] He has posted a series of videos 
on YouTube showing his pitching mechanics and repertoire in slow motion.[28]
