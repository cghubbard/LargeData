Joseph Aloysius Connolly (February 1, 1884 – September 1, 1943) was a left 
fielder in Major League Baseball who played his entire career for the Boston 
Braves from 1913 through 1916. Listed at 5 ft 7.5 in (1.71 m), 165 lb., 
Connolly batted left-handed and threw right-handed. A native of North Smithfield, 
Rhode Island, Connolly was a prominent member of the 1914 Boston Braves 
World Champions. As for his defense at left field, the Boston Sunday Post 
wrote "he is fairly fast, the possessor of a strong wing (arm) and he covers 
a good extent of territory." Connolly made his professional debut as a 
pitcher in 1906 with the Putnam, Connecticut team of the New England League. 
From 1908 to 1912, he divided his playing time with Class-A Little Rock 
and Class-B Zanesville teams, playing some outfield when he was not pitching. 
In 1909, while in Zanesville, he posted a 23–8 record and hit .308 during 
the season. The following year, despite he pitched for a sixth-place team 
that ended 16 games below .500, he went 16–17, including a no-hitter, a 
one-hitter, a two-hitter, and four three-hitters, but he was beginning 
to experience arm trouble. In 1911 he played exclusively at left field, 
but financial problems forced Zanesville to send him to Terre Haute of 
the Central League, as he led the league hitters with a .355 batting average, 
adding 27 stolen bases. The Chicago Cubs signed Connolly and then traded 
him to the Montreal Royals of the International League, where he hit .316 
in 1912. Drafted by the Washington Senators of Clark Griffith in 1913, 
he was sold immediately to the Boston Braves, to become the team's regular 
left fielder. Thought his rookie Major League season ended prematurely 
when he broke his ankle, Connolly led the Braves in average (.281), runs 
(79), RBI (57), triples (11), and slugging percentage (.410), in 126 games 
played. In 1914, Connolly was a member of the Braves team that went from 
last place to first place in two months, becoming the first team to win 
a pennant after being in last place on the Fourth of July.[1] He was the 
offensive star of the 1914 Braves, playing predominantly against right-handed 
pitching and usually batting third in the order at bat. He led his team 
with a .306 average (the only regular to hit .300), 28 doubles (fourth 
in the National League), nine home runs (fifth in the league), and a .494 
slugging percentage (third in the league). He hit 1-for-9 with a run and 
one RBI during the 1914 World Series, as the Braves defeated Connie Mack's 
heavily favored Philadelphia Athletics in four games. The 1915 Braves challenged 
for the National League and Connolly hit .298, but the following year his 
production and playing time decreased even more significantly, ending with 
a .227 average (25-for-110) in just 62 games. Boston's contract offer to 
Connolly for 1917 slashed his salary in half, and when he refused to sign, 
the Braves sold him to the Indianapolis Indians of the American Association. 
Realizing that his combined income from farming and playing semipro ball 
locally would exceed his salary under his professional contract, he decided 
to retire. In a four-season career, Connolly was a .288 hitter (358-for-1241) 
with 14 home runs and 157 RBI in 412 games, including 202 runs, 65 doubles, 
31 triples, and 48 stolen bases. Following his baseball career, Connelly 
served in the Rhode Island State Legislature. He died in his home town
