The 2015 San Diego Padres season was their 47th season in MLB, and their 
12th at Petco Park. General Manager A. J. Preller had a busy offseason, 
acquiring a new starting outfield in Matt Kemp, Justin Upton, and Wil Myers, 
while adding to an already strong bullpen with All-Star closer Craig Kimbrel. 
The Padres also signed free agent starting pitcher James Shields.[1][2] 
San Diego traded away seven of its top 11 prospects, as rated by Baseball 
America entering the offseason.[2] After starting the season 32–33 and 
six games behind in the National League West, the Padres fired manager 
Bud Black, who had managed the team for eight-plus seasons. Bench coach 
Dave Roberts filled in as manager for one game until Pat Murphy was named 
the interim manager.[3][4] October 30: Tim Stauffer and Josh Johnson become
