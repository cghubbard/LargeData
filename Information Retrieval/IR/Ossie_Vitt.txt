Oscar Joseph "Ossie" Vitt (January 4, 1890 – January 31, 1963) was a Major 
League Baseball third baseman and manager in the American League for the 
Detroit Tigers (1912–1918) and Boston Red Sox (1919–1921). Vitt later became 
manager of the Cleveland Indians (1938–1940), where he sometimes clashed 
with his players. Ossie Vitt was a product of the sandlots of San Francisco. 
He broke into the Pacific Coast League as third baseman for the San Francisco 
Seals in 1911. He later advanced to the majors as a utility infielder for 
the Detroit Tigers. Through his major league career, Vitt played 833 games 
at 3rd base and 161 games at 2nd base. As the Tigers' regular third baseman 
from 1915 through 1917, he never batted higher than .254. But he was described 
as a smart, scrappy baseball man. Vitt had a career batting average of 
.238, and was a talented third baseman with range and a good throwing arm. 
His .960 fielding average in 10 years at 3rd base was 20 points higher 
than the Major League average for 3rd basemen of his era. He led all American 
League third basemen in consecutive years (1915 and 1916) in putouts, assists 
and fielding percentage. He had career highs at third base of 208 putouts 
(team record at 3B), 385 assists, and 32 double plays in 1916. His range 
factor of 3.93 in 1916 was 70 points higher than the league average for 
third basemen. While not a good hitter for average, Vitt was a good contact 
hitter and one of the best bunters of the era—a valuable talent on a Detroit 
squad that included Ty Cobb, Sam Crawford, and Bobby Veach. His career 
total of 259 sacrifice hits (in a relatively short career) ranks 32nd best 
in major league history. Vitt was also one of the toughest players to strike 
out in MLB history. For his career, he struck out an average of once every 
26.6 at bats, 35th best in MLB history. In 1918, his at bat per strikeout 
ratio was 44.5, 2nd best in the AL. On August 10, 1915, Vitt was hit in 
the head by a Walter Johnson fastball. After being knocked unconscious 
for five minutes‚ Vitt left the game with a concussion. Ty Cobb‚ observing 
Johnson's fear of hitting a batter‚ crowded the plate on Johnson from that 
point forward. Cobb hit .435 against Johnson after the Vitt incident.[1] 
On July 30, 1917, Cobb‚ Veach‚ and Vitt followed each other in the lineup‚ 
with each going 5-for-5.[1] On January 17, 1919, Vitt was traded by the 
Tigers to the Boston Red Sox for Eddie Ainsmith, Chick Shorten, and Slim 
Love. After playing in the majors for 10 years, Vitt was recommended to 
Oakland Oaks' owner Victor Devincinzi by the Yankees' management to manage 
the Oaks in 1935. His style was described as both abrasive and motivational, 
pushing the Oaks to a third-place finish. Vitt moved on in the Yankees' 
organization the next year, managing their farm team in Newark. He was 
then hired by the Cleveland Indians in 1938 to replace Steve O'Neil as 
manager and instill new life into their team. Vitt's role in the 1940 Cleveland 
Indians team known as the "Cleveland Crybabies" has become a baseball legend. 
"I don't want any lazy players on my club," said Vitt when he was hired. 
"If the boys won't hustle, out they go." Vitt's players felt they were 
being accused. In Vitt's first two seasons in Cleveland, the Indians finished 
third. Yet, there were frequent clashes between Vitt and his players, and 
the discontent festered. On June 11, 1940, matters came to a head when 
he went to the mound to remove Mel Harder. "When are you going to start 
earning your salary?" asked Vitt of Harder, who had won at least 15 games 
for eight consecutive seasons, including two 20-win seasons. The team revolted, 
and many players signed a petition to have Vitt removed. After the incident 
with Harder, a dozen Indians met with owner Alva Bradley to state their 
grievances against Vitt, whom they described as a "wild man." They made 
it clear they hoped he would be fired. In the closed-door meeting between 
Indians players and owner, Harder told Bradley: "We think we have a good 
chance to win the pennant, but we'll never win it with Vitt as manager. 
If we can get rid of him, we can win. We feel sure about that." Bradley 
sought to keep the controversy quiet, but the story quickly got out, and 
newspaper headlines all over the nation referred gleefully to the Indians 
as the "Cleveland Crybabies." Despite the hullabaloo and ridicule, the 
Indians, with Vitt hanging on to his job, battled the Detroit Tigers for 
the pennant to the last day of the 1940 season. Through June, the Indians 
were 42–25. After June, with the "Crybabies" harangue clanging in the papers 
and from the stands, they went 47–40, not a collapse, but not good enough 
to stay ahead of the Tigers who won the pennant by a single game over the 
Tribe. Bob Feller, a 27-game winner that year, lost the decisive game 2–0. 
Vitt was among those in the first class of inductees in 1943 in the Pacific
