Dalton is a town in Berkshire County, Massachusetts. Dalton is a transition 
town between the urban and rural portions of Berkshire County. It is part 
of the Pittsfield, Massachusetts Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population 
was 6,756 at the 2010 census.[2] Dalton was first settled in 1755 and officially 
incorporated in 1784.[1] The town was named after Tristram Dalton,[3] the 
Speaker of the Massachusetts House of Representatives at the time of the 
town's incorporation. Dalton was settled as a rural-industrial community, 
with mills set up along the East Branch of the Housatonic River and small 
patches of farmland in other areas. In 1801, Zenas Crane, Henry Wiswall 
and John Willard set up a paper mill along the river which, by 1844, had 
begun producing banknote paper, which was purchased by banks all the way 
to Boston. The company, Crane & Co., still is the largest employer in town, 
making paper products, stationery, and, since 1873, has been the only supplier 
of paper for the Federal Reserve Note, the United States' paper money. 
The town now has a mix of small town and suburban qualities, and was served 
by trolleys to Pittsfield for many years.[4] In 1973, Dalton was the host 
of the International Six Days Enduro (ISDE or ISDT). Also referred to as 
"The Olympics of Motorcycling". The ISDE is an annual event held in a different 
country each year since 1913 (minus WW-I & WW-II), and draws competitors 
from all around the world. According to the United States Census Bureau, 
the town has a total area of 21.9 square miles (56.7 km2), of which 21.8 
square miles (56.4 km2) is land and 0.12 square miles (0.3 km2), or 0.45%, 
is water.[2] Dalton is bordered by Cheshire to the northwest and north, 
Windsor to the northeast, Hinsdale to the east, Washington to the south,

(8 km) northeast of downtown Pittsfield, 45 miles (72 km) northwest of

population, due to its milling history, is around the valley of the East 
Branch of the Housatonic River. Several brooks run into the river, including 
Wahconah Falls Brook, whose eponymous waterfalls are a small state park. 
Much of the rest of town is dominated by the Berkshires, with the north

by Tully Mountain, whose peak is just over the Hinsdale line. The Appalachian 
Trail winds through town, passing between Tully and North Mountains through 
the downtown area. Dalton lies at the junction of Massachusetts Route 8,
