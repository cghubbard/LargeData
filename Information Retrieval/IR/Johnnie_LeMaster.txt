Johnnie Lee LeMaster (born June 19, 1954) is a former Major League Baseball 
infielder. He played for 12 seasons (1975–1985 and 1987) for four teams, 
including 10 seasons for the San Francisco Giants. He batted and threw 
right-handed. On September 2, 1975 LeMaster became the second player in 
major league history to hit an inside-the-park home run in his first at 
bat, during a 7–3 win over the Dodgers. Luke Stuart, who only had three 
major-league bats, also hit an inside-the-park home run in his first at-bat; 
it was his only home run. LeMaster hit only 21 home runs during the rest 
of his career (3,191 at bats). Many will long remember LeMaster for one 
game in 1979. The shortstop took the field wearing the phrase on his back 
that Giants fans often welcomed him with; in place of his last name was 
the word "BOO".[1] In 1983, LeMaster amassed over 100 hits for the only 
time in his career, batting .240 and finishing seventh in the National 
League with 39 stolen bases. During the 1985 season, he played for three 
teams: the San Francisco Giants, the Cleveland Indians, and the Pittsburgh 
Pirates; all three teams ended up in last place in their respective divisions.[2] 
LeMaster was a career .222 hitter with 22 home runs and 229 runs batted
