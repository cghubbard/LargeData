The 1946 New York Giants season was the franchise's 64th season. The team 
finished in eighth place in the National League with an 61-93 record, 36 
games behind the St. Louis Cardinals. The 1946 Giants are the original 
subject of the phrase "nice guys finish last", a condensation of a reference 
to them by Leo Durocher of the Brooklyn Dodgers. The original quote by 
Durocher was "The nice guys are all over there, in seventh place." (July 
6, 1946),[1][2][3] seventh place being last place in the National League.
