Charles Henry "Charlie" Pabor (September 24, 1846 – April 23, 1913), also 
spelled Charley, nicknamed "The Old Woman in the Red Cap", was an American 
Major League Baseball left fielder and manager throughout the existence 
of the National Association, 1871–1875.[1][2] Born in Brooklyn, New York,[1] 
he played his early baseball in and around the New York City area until 
he joined the Cleveland Forest Citys of the National Association as a left 
fielder and manager.[2] On May 4, 1871, Pabor managed and played while 
batting 0-4 for in the first game of the season, which is considered the 
first all professional game ever played, a game between his Forest Citys 
and the Fort Wayne Kekiongas.[3] Cleveland finished 8th that season,[4] 
and Pabor was replaced as manager in 1872. He had also batted well in 1871, 
with a .296 batting average, but it dropped to .207 in 1872.[1] The Cleveland 
team folded after the season, and Pabor got a fresh start with the Brooklyn 
Atlantics. He had his best season that year, hitting .360 and driving in 
42 runs batted in.[1] After a short season in 1874 with the Philadelphia 
White Stockings in which he only played in 17 games, he returned to the 
Atlantics for the 1875 season as the player-manager. The season was a disaster, 
the Atlantics only won two games for the season. Pabor did not finish the 
year in Brooklyn, as he signed with the New Haven Elm Citys toward the 
end of the 1875 season, playing and managing six games and winning only 
one.[1] Although his record of 13-64 as manager is not prolific, he is 
credited as starting the careers of both King Kelly and Fred Goldsmith.[2] 
After the end of the 1875 season and the demise of the National Association, 
Pabor quit baseball altogether, staying in New Haven, Connecticut. He joined 
the New Haven Police Department, where he enjoyed a long career.[2] Pabor 
died in New Haven of pneumonia at the age of 66,[2] and he is interred
