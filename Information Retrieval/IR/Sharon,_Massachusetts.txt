Sharon is a town in Norfolk County, Massachusetts, United States. The population 
was 17,612 at the 2010 census. Sharon is part of Greater Boston, about 
17 miles (27 km) southwest of downtown Boston. Sharon, first settled as 
part of the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1637, was deemed the 2nd precinct 
of Stoughton in 1740. It was established as the district of Stoughtonham 
on June 21, 1765, incorporated as the Town of Stoughtonham on August 23, 
1775 and was named Sharon on February 25, 1783 after Israel's Sharon plain, 
due to its high level of forestation. Several towns in New England were 
given this name. Part of Stoughtonham went to the new town of Foxborough 
on June 10, 1776. During the American Revolution, the townspeople of Sharon 
made cannonballs and cannons for the Continental Army at a local foundry. 
In front of the Sharon Public Library stands a statue of Deborah Sampson, 
Sharon's town heroine. Sampson disguised herself as a man to fight in the 
Revolutionary War. She married Benjamin Gannett, a farmer, after she fought 
in the war and lived in Sharon until the end of her life. She is buried 
in the local Rockridge Cemetery. A street in Sharon is named Deborah Sampson 
Street in her honor. The Unitarian and Congregational churches in the center 
of Sharon both have church bells manufactured by Paul Revere. The recipient 
of letters from across the United States in Stanley Milgram's small-world 
experiment lived in Sharon. According to the United States Census Bureau,

This includes Lake Massapoag, which is one of the town's most prominent 
features and a popular recreational site for swimming and boating. It was 
largely responsible for the town's early development as a summer resort 
location. Sharon is drained by the Canoe River to the south, and Massapoag 
Brook to the north. Sharon is located in a continental climate, like most 
of New England and most of the Northeastern and Midwestern United States. 
It is cooler than coastal New England locations because it is inland. The 
town has warm to hot summers and cold winters. It is often humid in the 
summer. Sharon receives about 50 inches of precipitation every year on 
average. Sharon is located in eastern Massachusetts, bordered by the following 
towns: Sharon has a large number of scenic trails due to the high percentage 
of conservation land within the town's borders. Trails found in Sharon

known as the Beaver Brook Trail), and the King Philip's Rock Trail. There 
are a number of trails at Borderland State Park and at Moose Hill Wildlife

with three Selectmen. In 2008, a commission was elected to prepare a charter 
document specifying the executive, legislative, and administrative structure 
of town government. It considered whether the town should retain its current 
government form or change to a representative form. There was a debate, 
whether the town has outgrown Open Town Meeting, where decisions are made 
only by those attending (they must be present to vote) or whether direct-vote 
government works well because residents who choose to attend are particularly 
interested in and informed on the issues. In November 2009, the charter 
commission recommended a "hybrid" legislative branch consisting of a Legislative 
Committee (Representative Town Meeting of 17 members) and an Open Town 
Meeting (which could be called to review the Legislative Committee's decisions 
if 3% of voters signed a "review petition"). At a town election on May 
18, 2010, the charter proposal was rejected by a vote of 1123 yes, 2305 
no. As of February 2016, there are 12,383 registered voters in Sharon.
