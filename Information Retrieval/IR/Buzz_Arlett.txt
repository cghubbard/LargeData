Russell Loris Arlett (January 3, 1899 – May 16, 1964), also known as Buzz 
Arlett, was an American baseball player of German descent, sometimes called 
"the Babe Ruth of the minor leagues."[1] Like Ruth, Arlett was a large 
man (6'4" and 230 pounds (104 kg)) who began his career as a pitcher before 
becoming his league's dominant home run hitter. He was for many decades 
the all-time minor league home run king in the United States, until being 
surpassed by Mike Hessman on August 3, 2015.[2] He spent one season with 
the Philadelphia Phillies of Major League Baseball (MLB). Arlett was the 
youngest of four sons (Alexander, Harry, Leslie "Dick", and Russell) born 
to German immigrant Beny and his English wife Lillian. He also had a sister 
Evelyn. During their youth, the Arlett brothers would often play baseball 
from sunrise till sundown. In 1918, Arlett began his professional career 
by joining his brother (Alexander "Pop" Arlett) on the staff of the Pacific 
Coast League's Oakland Oaks as a right-handed spitball pitcher. He received 
his nickname "Buzz" because he was known to cut through opposing batters 
like a buzz saw. He won 108 games as a pitcher.[3] In 1923, Buzz became 
a full-time outfielder. As a batter, Arlett was the best slugger of the 
Pacific Coast League, often leading the league in batting statistics and 
setting several records. In his 13 years in the PCL, Arlett set league 
records with 251 home runs and 1135 runs batted in. In 1929 (considered 
to be his best season as a batter), Arlett hit 39 home runs, earned a .374 
batting average and drove in 189 runs. He played only for the Oakland Oaks 
until the 1930 season. On January 26, 1931, the Philadelphia Phillies bought 
Arlett's contract from Oakland. Arlett played the entire 1931 season for 
Philadelphia and it was his only MLB season. Already 32 years old, Arlett 
had an impressive season as a hitter but was regarded as a poor fielder. 
Although Arlett began his career at about 185 pounds, he had gained approximately 
50 pounds during his career and had become a sluggish fielder. He was used 
in 94 games as an outfielder and only 13 as first baseman. Although he 
earned a .313 batting average and hit 18 home runs - fourth in the National 
League - his lackluster fielding led the Phillies to use him as a pinch-hitter 
for much of the season. In 1932, Philadelphia sold Arlett's contract to 
the Baltimore Orioles of the International League. Playing for the Orioles 
in 1932, Arlett twice hit four home runs in a single game. On June 2, 1932, 
he hit home runs in consecutive at bats against the team from Reading, 
Pennsylvania. He repeated the feat on July 4, 1932, again against Reading, 
hitting a grand slam batting right-handed and three more home runs batting 
left-handed. He led the league that year with 54 home runs and 144 runs 
batted in. Arlett's record of 54 home runs in 1932 is the second-highest 
annual total in International League history, and through the 2003 season 
no International League batter has equalled or surpassed Arlett's 54 home 
runs. In 1933, Buzz led the league again with 39 home runs for the Orioles. 
In 1934, Arlett briefly started the season with the Birmingham Barons and 
then moved to the Minneapolis Millers of the American Association. During 
his season with the Millers, he hit 41 home runs that year with 132 runs 
batted in and earned a .319 batting average. In 1935, He raised his batting 
average to .360 hitting 25 home runs and driving in 101 runs. In 1936, 
Buzz hit .316, but was limited to 193 at bats. In 1937, Arlett played briefly 
for the Syracuse Chiefs, but then retired. He returned to Minneapolis to 
settle with his family. Arlett finished his career as the all-time minor 
league home run and RBI king with career totals of 432 home runs and 1786 
runs batted in. He now ranks second in both categories among all minor-league 
players. (He was surpassed by Héctor Espino for home runs and Nick Cullop 
for RBIs [1].) In his career as a minor-league player, Arlett earned a 
.341 batting average and a .604 slugging percentage. Arlett retired with 
a 108-93 record and a 3.42 earned-run average as a minor-league pitcher. 
In 1927, Arlett married his first wife Frances, but they separated in 1932 
and divorced in 1936. Buzz and Frances never had any children. In court 
papers, Arlett listed "desertion" as the cause for divorce. In 1936, Arlett 
married Vivian Johnson, who was secretary to Minneapolis Millers owner 
Mike Kelly. They had a son and a daughter. After retiring from baseball, 
Arlett owned and operated a successful restaurant and bar in Minneapolis 
called Arlett's Place. Arlett's Place sponsored its own baseball team where 
Arlett participated as a player until the early 1940s. In 1945, Buzz was 
inducted into the Pacific Coast League Hall of Fame. In 1964, Buzz Arlett 
died of a heart attack in Minneapolis and was interred at Lakewood Cemetery. 
He was survived by his wife, son, daughter, and his older brothers Harry 
and Dick. In 1984, the Society for American Baseball Research voted Arlett
