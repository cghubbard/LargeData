Hanley Ramírez (born December 23, 1983) is a Dominican professional baseball 
first baseman for the Boston Red Sox of Major League Baseball (MLB) Ramírez 
is a three-time MLB All-Star, and received the 2006 National League Rookie 
of the Year Award. He has also played for the Florida / Miami Marlins and 
Los Angeles Dodgers. Ramírez has established himself as an elite threat 
at the plate over the years.[1][2] with a high batting average (.300), 
high isolated power (.200) and a roughly average walk rate (9.6%).[1][3][4] 
However, he is rated a poor defensive shortstop, which is why when he returned 
to the Red Sox the team played him in left field for the first time in 
his career, with even poorer results.[5][6][7][8] For the 2016 season, 
he was switched to the first base position, a move that yielded good results 
both offensively and defensively.[9] Hanley Ramírez was born in Samaná, 
Dominican Republic, to Toribio and Isabela Ramírez. Ramirez's father was 
an auto mechanic, and at an early age Ramírez was an avid baseball fan, 
and showed great potential in the sport to make it as an MLB prospect.[10][11] 
He was also known as a basketball player.[12] He attended Adventista High 
School in Samaná, and was a great player attracting the attention of MLB 
scouts. Boston Red Sox scout Levy Ochoa recognized Ramírez's talent and 
signed him to the Red Sox in 2000.[10][11] Ramírez signed with the Boston 
Red Sox as an International Free Agent in July 2000. In 2002, with the 
Gulf Coast Red Sox he hit .340 and was selected as a Gulf Coast League 
and Rookie League All-Star. He was rated by Baseball America as the #10 
prospect in baseball prior to the 2005 season, and with the Portland Sea 
Dogs he was selected as an Eastern League All-Star while hitting .271.[13] 
Ramírez made his MLB debut on September 20, 2005 against the Tampa Bay 
Devil Rays, entering the game as a defensive replacement in the bottom 
of the seventh inning and then striking out in his first at-bat in the 
top of the eighth inning against Tim Corcoran.[14] He appeared in only 
one other game that season and struck out again in his one at-bat in that 
game.[15] In 2005, he was traded to the Florida Marlins, together with 
Aníbal Sánchez for Josh Beckett, Mike Lowell and Guillermo Mota. During 
spring training, Ramírez was impressive enough to earn the starting shortstop 
job for the Marlins over another candidate, shortstop Robert Andino. He 
recorded his first Major League hit in his first at-bat of the season, 
a single to center field off of Houston Astros pitcher Roy Oswalt on April 
3.[16] He hit his first home run, leading off the game, on April 18 against 
Eric Milton of the Cincinnati Reds and hit his second in the seventh inning 
of the same game against reliever Mike Burns.[17] Ramírez led all MLB rookies 
with 185 hits, 119 runs, 11 triples and 51 stolen bases. He hit seven leadoff 
home runs, the most in team history for a season and career. Ramírez's 
46 doubles in the 2006 season is the all-time NL record for a shortstop 
age 22 or younger.[18] He is the first NL rookie to post 110-plus runs 
and 50-plus stolen bases. He became the fifth big-league player since 1900 
to hit 45-plus doubles and have 50-plus stolen bases, joining Ty Cobb, 
Tris Speaker and Lou Brock. He finished the season as the NL Rookie of 
the Year Award named by the Baseball Writers' Association of America.[19] 
Ramírez picked up where he left off during his sophomore season. The ever 
improving young star, who referred to Ryan Howard when asked about the 
sophomore jinx in baseball, was hitting .331 with 14 home runs and 35 RBIs 
to go along with 27 steals at the All-Star break. Despite his numbers, 
he did not make the All-Star roster. Marlins manager Fredi González experimented 
with Ramírez a bit in the number three slot in the lineup, batting him 
ahead of Mike Jacobs when injuries hit the Marlins position players. Gonzalez 
believed Ramírez could be a middle-of-the-lineup player despite his speed, 
because he hit for power.[20] In a game versus the Cincinnati Reds on July 
22, 2007 Ramírez overextended his shoulder when he tried to hit a pitch 
on the lower outside corner off right-hander Bronson Arroyo. He was helped 
off the field and was determined to have suffered a partial dislocation 
of his left shoulder. In 154 games Ramírez batted .332 with 29 home runs, 
81 RBIs, 125 runs and 51 steals. He fell one home run shy of becoming only 
the third player in baseball history to hit 30 or more home runs and steal 
50 or more bases in the same season. Ramírez led the National League in 
VORP. After the end of the season, Ramírez underwent arthroscopic surgery 
to repair his injured left shoulder.[21] Entering the 2008 season, Ramírez 
was now looked at as the face of the franchise after the Marlins traded 
All-Stars Miguel Cabrera and Dontrelle Willis to the Detroit Tigers. Ramírez 
contributed well in the Marlins fast start, earning a spot as the starting 
shortstop for the National League All-Star team for the first time in his 
career. He was 2-for-3 with two singles and a run in the 2008 All-Star 
Game. In addition, Ramírez agreed to a six-year, $70 million extension, 
by far making it the richest contract in Marlins history.[22] Ramírez was 
named NL Player of the Month in June. He had been batting .298 with six 
doubles, a triple and ten home runs. He led the NL in three categories: 
home runs, runs scored and total bases.[23] Ramírez hit his 30th home run 
of the season on September 13 and joined Preston Wilson in 2000 as the 
only Marlins to become members of the 30–30 club. He ended the season with 
33 home runs and 35 stolen bases. Ramírez played in the World Baseball 
Classic for his native Dominican Republic prior to the 2009 season. During 
the April 6, 2009 regular season opener against the Washington Nationals, 
Ramírez hit his first career grand-slam off of Washington reliever Steven 
Shell.[24] On July 5, 2009, Ramírez was the NL starting shortstop for the 
2009 All-Star Game. On September 6, against the Nationals, Ramírez hit 
his 100th home run of his MLB career, becoming the fourth quickest shortstop 
in terms of games played to reach that milestone (Alex Rodriguez, Nomar 
Garciaparra, and Ernie Banks). With a batting average of .342, Ramírez 
won his first batting title. He recorded 106 RBIs (sixth in NL), stole 
27 bases (fifth in NL), and scored 101 times (eighth in NL). He won the 
Silver Slugger Award at shortstop, and came in second to Albert Pujols 
for NL MVP. On May 17 in a home game versus the Arizona Diamondbacks, Ramírez 
fouled a ball off his ankle in his first at-bat. He looked as if he was 
in some pain but remained in the game. He then grounded into a double play 
to end the inning as he slowly ran to first base. The next inning, with 
runners on first and second, a bloop shot was sent into shallow left field. 
Ramírez ran to catch it. He did not, and when it hit the ground, Ramírez 
inadvertently kicked it into the left-field corner. Ramírez then jogged 
all the way to the corner as Diamondbacks rounded the bases. Two of the 
three runners would end up scoring with the other ending up on third. Then-manager 
of the Marlins Fredi González removed Ramírez from the game, and a war 
of words led to Ramírez being benched for the next game. In his first game 
back against the St. Louis Cardinals, Ramírez went 3–for-5 with a RBI. 
About a month later, Gonzalez was fired. Ramírez was voted in as a starter 
for the 2010 All Star game for the third year in a row. He was also chosen 
to participate in the State Farm Home Run Derby for the first time in his 
career. In the Derby, he came in second place to Boston's David Ortiz. 
Ramírez hit his 25th career leadoff home run and his first career walk-off 
hit on August 7 against the St. Louis Cardinals. He came up to bat in the 
bottom of the 10th inning with a man on first base hit a walk-off double 
to right-center field to end the Marlins' five-game losing streak. On September 
15 in a game against the Philadelphia Phillies, Ramírez aggravated an injury 
in his elbow he sustained earlier in the season while swinging. He attempted 
to come back and play a week later, but after one game, he was still in 
pain and shut down for the rest of the season. He finished 2010 with a 
.300 batting average, 21 home runs, 76 RBIs, 32 steals and 92 runs scored. 
During the 2011 season, Ramírez performed below levels seen in recent seasons. 
By June 20, Ramirez was hitting just .200 with only 4 home runs and 17 
RBIs. However, he raised his stats up to .243 with 8 home runs and 37 RBIs 
by July 9. For the first time in his career, Ramírez hit cleanup. He injured 
himself after trying to make a diving catch in a game against the New York 
Mets on August 2, aggravating a shoulder injury that plagued him in 2010. 
He missed the rest of 2011, playing only 92 games, and needed surgery in 
the off-season. He finished the season batting .243, 10 HR, and 45 RBIs. 
The Marlins, who were 55–55 at the time of the injury, finished 72–90. 
During the 2011–2012 off-season the Marlins, during their rebuilding stage, 
acquired reigning the National League batting champ shortstop José Reyes. 
Prior to that signing, Ramírez was the shortstop. After the signing, reports 
circulated claiming that Ramírez was unhappy with being forced to change 
positions to third base.[25] After a slow start, Ramírez finished strong 
in May with 11 home runs and 37 RBIs.[26] On July 13, 2012, Ramírez dropped 
in the batting order from second to fifth to start the second half of the 
baseball season. On July 25, 2012, Ramírez was traded to the Los Angeles 
Dodgers together with Randy Choate for Nathan Eovaldi and minor league 
pitching prospect Scott McGough.[27] At the time of his trade, Ramirez 
was batting .246 with 14 home runs and 48 RBIs and had recorded 14 stolen 
bases.[28] In his debut with the Dodgers, Ramirez hit a triple in his first 
at-bat. He went 2-for-4 with a RBI, and a run in a losing effort against 
the St. Louis Cardinals. He hit his first home run for the Dodgers on July 
27, winning the game in extra innings in Game 1 of a series with the San 
Francisco Giants. In 64 games, he hit .271 with 10 homers and 44 RBIs. 
He played with the Dominican team during the 2013 World Baseball Classic. 
In the championship game against Puerto Rico he injured his hand while 
diving for a ball. An MRI the next day revealed a torn thumb ligament which 
would require surgery. The Dodgers announced that he would miss the first 
two months of the season while recovering,[29] however, he rejoined the 
Dodgers on April 29, earlier than expected.[30] In just his third start 
after returning, Ramírez suffered a hamstring injury while running the 
bases on May 3 and returned to the disabled list.[31] He eventually rejoined 
the Dodgers on June 4.[32] His return from the disabled list reignited 
the Dodgers offense and they started to get hot, which included a 46-10 
record from mid-June to mid-August and they went from last place to winning 
the National League West. Ramírez, in just 86 games, hit .345 with 20 home 
runs and 57 RBI and reached the playoffs for the first time in his career.[33] 
In the 2013 National League Division Series against the Atlanta Braves, 
Ramirez went 8 for 16 with six extra-base hits, tying a franchise postseason 
record.[33][34] In Game 1 of the 2013 National League Championship Series, 
Ramirez was hit by a fastball on a 1-2 count in the first inning, fracturing 
two ribs and taking him out of the series, which the Dodgers lost in six 
games.[33] In the last year of his contract, Ramirez dealt with several 
injuries throughout the season. He finished the regular season hitting 
.283, with 13 home runs and 71 RBIs in 128 games. On August 2, Ramirez 
hit his first career walk-off home run off of the Cubs' Blake Parker in 
the 12th inning. He became a free agent after the season, even though the 
Dodgers did extend a qualifying offer to him. On November 25, 2014, Ramirez 
signed a four-year, $88 million deal with a fifth year vesting option worth 
$22 million, to return to the Boston Red Sox. They announced plans to play 
him in left field, even though he had only previously played shortstop 
and third base in his career.[35] On Opening Day 2015 on April 6, in his 
first game with Boston in almost 10 years, Ramírez played left field for 
the first time in his career and hit two home runs (one being a broken-bat 
grand slam[24]) for a total of 5 RBI as the Red Sox routed the Philadelphia 
Phillies 8–0.[36] On April 29, Ramírez hit his 10th home run of the season, 
joining teammate David Ortiz as the only players in Red Sox history to 
hit 10 home runs in the month of April.[37] However, a few days later on 
May 4, Ramírez left the game against the Tampa Bay Rays in the top of the 
first inning after crashing into the left field wall at Fenway Park. The 
team announced shortly after that he had suffered a left shoulder sprain.[38] 
Ramírez ended the 2015 season with a .249 batting average and 19 home runs 
in 401 at-bats,[39] as his defensive rating in left field was rated as 
the worst in the American League. As a result, on September 1 the Red Sox 
announced Ramírez would not play left field for the remainder of the season.[40] 
The Red Sox also announced then that Ramírez would again change positions 
in 2016, as its starting first baseman, a new position that he never played 
before. Ramirez reported early to 2016 spring training with the Red Sox 
and dismissed his impending positional switch to first base as nothing 
hard, according his own words. He then made a smoother transition to his 
new position than the organization and Boston fans ever imagined. Playing 
extremely hard every day, Ramírez returned to the infield which was a comfort 
zone for him. Again, he was in the midst of every play, so that is, in 
its own way, naturally engaging versus playing left field, which was a 
foreign and hard place to him.[41] On July 20, 2016, Ramírez belted three 
two-run home runs in Boston's 11–7 interleague play victory against the 
San Francisco Giants at Fenway Park.[42] Then on August 12, he hit a pair 
of three-run home runs as the Red Sox beat the visiting Arizona Diamondbacks, 
9–4, in an interleague game. It was his 20th career multihomer game, while 
his six runs batted in matched a career-high.[43] On October 2, 2016, Ramirez 
hit his 30th home run of the season. Ramírez, Mookie Betts and David Ortiz 
became the first trio in Red Sox history with 30 home runs and more than 
100 RBIs in the same season.[44] Ramírez would finish the season with a 
.286 batting average and 111 RBI, a new career high.[45] Ramírez and his 
wife, Sanoe (Elisabeth), have three sons: Hanley, Jr., born November 2004; 
Hansel, born September 2007; and Ricardo, born June 2008.[46] Ramírez enjoys 
reggae music and DJing, as well as listening to merengue and bachata music.[47]
