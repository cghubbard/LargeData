The Philadelphia Athletics were a professional baseball team, one of six 
charter members of the American Association, a 19th-century major league, 
which began play in 1882 as a rival to the National League. The other teams 
were the Baltimore Orioles, Cincinnati Red Stockings, Eclipse of Louisville, 
Pittsburgh Alleghenys, and St. Louis Brown Stockings. The team took its 
name from a previous team, which played in the National Association from 
1871 through 1875 and in the National League in 1876. Over the nine years 
of their existence, the Athletics were a successful club on the field, 
winning 633 games and losing 564, for a winning percentage of .529. The 
team won the AA pennant in 1883, finishing one game ahead of the St. Louis 
team. That same year, however, the National League set up its own team 
in Philadelphia, the Philadelphia Quakers (later Phillies). The Quakers 
finished last in 1883, but soon improved on the field and at the gate. 
Their home games were played at Oakdale Park in 1882, and at the Jefferson 
Street Grounds from 1883 to 1890. In addition, games were also occasionally 
played at Gloucester Point Grounds. They had eight different managers, 
with co-owner Bill Sharsig having the longest tenure. Notable players for 
the Athletics included future Baseball Hall of Fame member Wilbert Robinson 
and Al Atkinson. Atkinson is one of the few pitchers to throw more than 
one no-hitter, and he threw them both for the Athletics, on May 24, 1884 
and May 1, 1886. In the first no-hitter Atkinson beaned leadoff hitter 
Ed Swartwood and then retired 27 batters in a row. In 1888 the Athletics 
had two no-hitters within a week, with Ed Seward throwing one on July 26 
and Gus Weyhing on July 31. The Athletics were founded by businessman Bill 
Sharsig in September 1880. In 1881, the team went on a barnstorming tour, 
and Sharsig took on two partners: player Charlie Mason and manager Horace 
Phillips.[1] After the tour, Phillips jumped ship to the competing Quakers 
and was replaced on the management team by minstrel show performer Lew 
Simmons.[1] The Athletics were successful both on and off the field during 
the early part of their existence. After winning the AA in 1883, in 1884 
it was said that Sharsig, Simmons and Mason had cleared between $200,000 
and $300,000 in just three years, then the greatest financial success scored 
in baseball.[2] After the 1887 season, Sharsig bought out Mason and Simmons, 
selling their shares of the club to H. C. Pennypacker and William Whittaker.[3] 
The last straw for the AA Athletics, and several other American Association 
teams, was the creation of the Players' League in 1890. The established 
leagues lost players to the upstart league, player salaries soared (by 
the standards of the day), and there simply were not enough fans to support 
three baseball leagues. The Athletics also had problems with their own 
payroll, with the salaries of Pennypacker and Whittaker causing additional 
financial trouble.[3] Though the Players' League folded after a single 
season, it had taken its toll. In September 1890, the Athletics released 
or sold their players and finished the season with a pick-up team, losing 
the final 21 games. The Athletics were expelled by the league at the end 
of the season and was replaced by a new Philadelphia Athletics team, which 
previously played in the Players' League as the Quakers. The new team hired
