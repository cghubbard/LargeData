After winning the American League Central Division in 2002, the 2003 Minnesota 
Twins were looking to repeat division titles for the first time since 1969 
and 1970. A spark for the team was the July trade of Bobby Kielty for Shannon 
Stewart. Stewart provided a veteran presence at the top of the lineup that 
the team had previously lacked. The team met its goal of reaching the playoffs, 
but once again fell short in the postseason. The Twins lost in four games 
to the New York Yankees during the AL Division Series. 2003 would be the 
last year several key players played with the team. Under second year manager 
Ron Gardenhire, The Twins did not look so good coming out of the gates 
going 12-14 in March and April. However, they picked it up by going 19-9 
in May, improving their record to 31-23 (.574). After having another tough 
string of games during the middle of the season, the Twins were looking 
for a jump start. They got it when on July 16 they traded RF Bobby Kielty 
to Toronto for LF Shannon Stewart. Going into the final month of the season 
with a record of 71-65 it looked as though the Twins may not win the division, 
but they finished with a stellar September going 19-7; including an 11-game 
winning streak. They ended up with a 90-72 (.556) record which was good 
enough to win the mediocre AL Central. On April 21, Rick Reed set a Twins 
individual pitching record by giving up eleven runs (ten were earned) in 
a 15-1 loss to the New York Yankees.[7] On June 7 at Qualcomm Stadium, 
outfielder Jacque Jones hit his 20th lead-off home run as a Minnesota Twin 
and the total remains the Twins record. Jones' first two career homers 
in 1999 were lead-off home runs. Chuck Knoblauch is next in line with 14. 
June 17: In a 14-7 loss to the Kansas City Royals, the Twins gave up 12 
runs in the sixth inning, a club high. Kenny Rogers blew a 3-1 lead allowing 
four runs. The final six were allowed by Michael Nakamura.[8] The lone 
representative of the Twins in the All-Star Game was closer Eddie Guardado; 
he gave up two hits and a run on eight pitches. The highest paid Twin in 
2003 was Brad Radke at $8,750,000; followed by Rick Reed at $8,000,000. 
Bob Allison and Bob Casey were inducted into the Twins Hall of Fame. Catcher 
A. J. Pierzynski enjoyed his highest career batting average (.312) in his 
final year with the Twins. First baseman Doug Mientkiewicz rebounded from 
a poor 2002 season by hitting .300—although his power numbers (11 home 
runs) were low for his position. Luis Rivas cemented his reputation as 
a mediocre hitter, batting .259 with a .308 on-base percentage. Corey Koskie 
saw his average go up to .292 after a dip in 2002. For the third time in 
four years, shortstop Cristian Guzmán led the majors in triples, this year 
with 14. Jacque Jones and Torii Hunter were capable hitters in the outfield, 
with Jones batting .304 and Hunter driving in a career high 102 runs. Stewart 
hit .322 in 270 at bats for the team. Brad Radke, Kenny Rogers, and Kyle 
Lohse filled the first three spots in the starting rotation throughout 
the year. All three had winning records and ERAs in the mid-fours. Joe 
Mays and Rick Reed each made 21 mediocre starts. The leftover starts were 
mostly left to Johan Santana, who made 18, establishing a foundation that 
would enable him to win a Cy Young Award the following year. Eric Milton 
was injured most of the year, and appeared in only three games. In the 
bullpen, Eddie Guardado was once again a reliable closer, with LaTroy Hawkins 
as his primary set-up man. Juan Rincón was also able to establish himself 
as a reliable set-up man, but the other bullpen spots were uncertain. J. 
C. Romero regressed in quality, with a 5.00 ERA. As one might expect, experiments 
with veterans such as James Baldwin, Carlos Pulido, and the ancient Jesse 
Orosco did not pan out. The infield of Pierzynski, Mientkiewicz, Rivas, 
Guzman, and Koskie was reliable. Jacque Jones was solid in left, although 
Shannon Stewart saw time there when he was acquired for Bobby Kielty. Torii 
Hunter had a Gold Glove year in center field. Right field was manned by 
the platoon of Dustan Mohr and Bobby Kielty (the duo was dubbed "Dusty 
Kielmohr") until the arrival of Stewart. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8]

Division Series, the Twins faced a team which fared well against them in 
the regular season: The New York Yankees. The Yankees won the 5-game series 
in four games, outscoring the Twins 16-6. Minnesota defeated the Yankees 
in game 1, earning a 3-1 victory at Yankee Stadium. However, the Yankees 
would go on to win the series; winning the next three games 4-1, 3-1, and 
8-1. The Yankees eventually lost to the Florida Marlins in the World Series.
