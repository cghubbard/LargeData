The 1981 Chicago Cubs season was the 110th season of the Chicago Cubs franchise, 
the 106th in the National League and the 66th at Wrigley Field. The Cubs 
finished the first-half in last place at 15-37, 17Â½ games behind the Philadelphia 
Phillies, and the second-half in fifth place at 23-28, six games behind 
the eventual NL East Champion Montreal Expos in the National League East. 
It was also the final season for the Cubs under the Wrigley family ownership, 
as the Tribune Company took over the club late in the year. Infielders
