Joseph Christopher Carter (born March 7, 1960) is an American former professional 
baseball player. He played in Major League Baseball as an outfielder and 
first baseman from 1983 to 1998. Carter is best known for hitting a walk-off 
home run to win the 1993 World Series for the Toronto Blue Jays. Joe Carter 
attended Wichita State University,[1] leaving after his junior year. He 
was named The Sporting News magazine's College Player of the Year in 1981.[2] 
In the 1981 MLB draft, the Chicago Cubs chose him with the second overall 
pick.[3] Carter first reached the majors in 1983 with the Cubs,[4] but 
was traded to the Cleveland Indians the following year, where he blossomed 
into a star. Carter emerged as a prolific power hitter, hitting as many 
as 35 home runs in a season and regularly driving in 100 or more runs. 
He usually hit nearly as many doubles as he did homers, and would get respectable 
numbers of triples in many years too. He was also a very good baserunner, 
stealing 20-30 bases a year with a high rate of success; in 1987, Carter 
became a rare member of the single-season 30–30 club for home runs/stolen 
bases. After a strong 1989 season, Carter was traded by Cleveland to the 
San Diego Padres for prospects Sandy Alomar, Jr., Carlos Baerga, and Chris 
James. Although he continued to drive in runs, he also continued to have 
defensive problems. The Padres subsequently dealt him to the Toronto Blue 
Jays along with Roberto Alomar in exchange for star players Fred McGriff 
and Tony Fernández. Carter's overall game improved dramatically in 1991, 
as he helped the Toronto Blue Jays win the division title and hit the game-winning 
single that clinched the AL East championship; he also emerged for the 
first time as a team leader. In 1992, he helped the Jays win their first 
World Series championship, the first ever won by a Canadian-based team. 
Carter hit two home runs and recorded the final out of the Series, taking 
a throw to first base from reliever Mike Timlin to nab Otis Nixon of the 
Atlanta Braves, who bunted. This was the first time a World Series ended 
on a bunt. Carter, along with Edwin Encarnación, are the only two Blue 
Jays to hit two home runs in one inning, with Carter's coming against the 
Baltimore Orioles in 1993 and Encarnacion's against the Houston Astros 
in 2013. In 1993, the Blue Jays reached the World Series again, facing 
the Philadelphia Phillies. In Game 6, with the Blue Jays leading three 
games to two, Carter came to bat with one out in the bottom of the ninth 
inning with the Blue Jays trailing 6–5 and Rickey Henderson and Paul Molitor 
on base. On a 2–2 count, Carter hit a three-run walk-off home run off Phillies 
pitcher Mitch Williams (against whom he had previously been 0–4 in his 
career) to win the World Series, only the second time a Series has ended 
with a home run (the other being in 1960, when Bill Mazeroski did it for 
the Pittsburgh Pirates against the New York Yankees), and the only time 
the home run has been hit by a player whose team was trailing in the bottom 
of the 9th inning in a potential championship clinching game. Upon hitting 
the home run, Carter jumped up and down many times, most notably while 
rounding first base, where his helmet came off. Tom Cheek, the Blue Jays' 
radio broadcaster, called the play: "Touch 'em all, Joe! You'll never hit 
a bigger home run in your life!"[5] Carter continued to play for the Blue 
Jays until 1997, and led the Blue Jays in home runs and RBIs in 1994 and 
1995. When he represented the Blue Jays at the 1996 All-Star Game, he received 
boos for his home run that won the Blue Jays the 1993 World Series, as 
the game took place at Veterans Stadium, then the home of the Philadelphia 
Phillies.[6][7][8] He became a free agent in 1998 and briefly played for 
the Baltimore Orioles and San Francisco Giants before retiring. Carter 
ended his career by popping out to end the game in a one-game playoff against 
the Chicago Cubs.[9] Carter was named to five All-Star teams. In his career 
he hit 396 home runs and drove in 1445 runs. He drove in 100 runs in a 
season ten times, including the 1994 year, which was cut short due to the 
strike that occurred 115 games into the year. He was the first player to 
record 100 RBI for three different teams in three consecutive seasons.[10] 
In 1993, while a Toronto Blue Jay, Carter set an American League record 
when he hit 3 home runs in a game for the fifth time in his career. (The 
record was tied 10 years later by another Blue Jay – Carlos Delgado.) Carter 
was also involved in the final plays of four games in which the Blue Jays 
clinched a championship: 1) The game-winning single to drive home Roberto 
Alomar and clinch the 1991 American League East division championship, 
2) catching the final out at first base in the 1992 World Series, 3) catching 
the final out on a fly ball to right field in the 1993 American League 
Championship Series, and 4) the walk-off home run in Game 6 of the 1993 
World Series. From 1999–2000, Carter served as a color commentator for 
the Toronto Blue Jays on CTV Sportsnet, leaving to work for the Chicago 
Cubs. From 2001–2002, Carter served as the color commentator, alongside 
play-by-play man Chip Caray, for the Chicago Cubs on WGN-TV. Carter was 
replaced by the man whom Carter himself replaced, Steve Stone. Carter became 
eligible for the Baseball Hall of Fame in 2003, however, he only received 
19 votes, representing 3.8% of the vote and was dropped from future ballots. 
Carter was inducted into the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame in 2003. In 
September 2006, Carter was awarded the Major League Baseball Hometown Heroes 
Award, as the former or current player who best represents the legacy of 
his franchise's history, as voted by fans. In 2008, Carter appeared on 
an episode of Pros vs. Joes. On August 7, 2009, Carter, along with many 
of his 1992 and 1993 Toronto Blue Jay World Series alumni teammates, attended 
a reunion/pre-game ceremony at the Sky Dome. The event was organized by 
Carter himself and included three dozen players, coaches and athletic trainers 
from the Blue Jays' 1992 and 1993 World Series rosters.[11] On May 19, 
2012, the Cleveland Indians honored Carter with a bobblehead giveaway bearing 
his likeness during their game against the Miami Marlins. Carter attended 
and signed autographs, as well as throwing out the ceremonial first pitch. 
On July 14, 2015, in a pregame ceremony before the 2015 All-Star Game, 
it was announced that Carter was elected by fans as a Franchise Four member 
of the Toronto Blue Jays, as one of the four most valuable players in franchise 
history. Carter co-chairs the annual "Joe Carter Classic", a celebrity 
golf tournament in the Toronto area founded in 2010 to benefit the Children's 
Aid Foundation. The tournament has raised over $225,000 for the foundation. 
Previous events have featured celebrities including Charles Barkley, Ray 
Bourque, and Gordie Howe. In July 2015, Carter's walk-off home run celebration 
was used as the track artwork for the song "Back to Back" released by Toronto
