Burgess Urquhart "Whitey" Whitehead (June 29, 1910 â€“ November 25, 1993) 
was a Major League Baseball second baseman from 1933 to 1946. He played 
for the St. Louis Cardinals, New York Giants, and Pittsburgh Pirates. Whitehead 
was born in Tarboro, North Carolina. He attended the University of North 
Carolina and started his professional baseball career with the Class AAA 
Columbus Red Birds in 1931. He batted over .300 in each of the next three 
seasons,[1] helping to lead the 1933 team to the American Association pennant.[2] 
In 1934 and 1935, Whitehead was a utility infielder for the National League 
Cardinals. He was a member of the 1934 World Series champion team and was 
friends with future Hall of Famer Dizzy Dean.[3] Whitehead was selected 
to the All-Star team in 1935. Whitehead was traded to the Giants in December. 
With a weak bat but a good glove at second base, he helped the Giants win 
two consecutive pennants in 1936 and 1937. In 1937, he led all second basemen 
in fielding percentage and putouts,[4] and he was named to the All-Star 
team for the second time. Before the 1938 season, Whitehead suffered a 
nervous breakdown following an appendectomy. He sat out the entire season.[5] 
He came back in 1939 but hit poorly, and his behavior was erratic; he was 
suspended twice during the season[6] and reportedly assaulted a woman in 
North Carolina.[7] Nonetheless, Whitehead rejoined the Giants in 1940 and 
had a good season. His hitting numbers declined again in 1941, however, 
and he was sold to the International League's Toronto Maple Leafs. In December 
1942, Whitehead was inducted into the Army Air Force.[5] He spent three 
years out of professional baseball and returned for one more major league 
season in 1946, with the Pirates. He hit a career-low .220 and went back 
to the minors with the Jersey City Giants.[1] After two seasons in Jersey 
City, Whitehead retired. Whitehead was married to the former Ruth Madre 
Lyon, and they had two children. He was the last surviving member of the 
St. Louis Cardinals' Gashouse Gang team that won the 1934 World Series. 
In 1981, he was inducted into the North Carolina Sports Hall of Fame.[8]
