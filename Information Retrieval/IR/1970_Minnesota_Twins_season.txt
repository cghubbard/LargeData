Led by new manager Bill Rigney, the 1970 Minnesota Twins won the American 
League West with a 98-64 record, nine games ahead of the Oakland Athletics. 
The Twins were swept by the Baltimore Orioles in the American League Championship 
Series. After the ALCS, Metropolitan Stadium would never see another post-season 
game, and the Twins would not return to the postseason stage until 1987 
when they won the World Series. On April 7, newly acquired Twin Brant Alyea 
homered twice in going 4 for 4 and driving in 7 RBI. The RBI total set 
a record for major league baseball's Opening Day. On May 20, in a 10-5 
win over the Kansas City Royals, Rod Carew became the very first Twin to 
hit for the cycle—going single, homer, double, triple. Over time, his feat 
will be matched by nine other Twins (César Tovar, 1972; Larry Hisle, 1976; 
Lyman Bostock, 1976; Mike Cubbage, 1978; Gary Ward, 1980; Kirby Puckett, 
1986; Carlos Gómez, 2008; Jason Kubel, 2009; and Michael Cuddyer, 2009). 
On June 5, pitcher Bert Blyleven debuted, allowing a home run off the very 
first batter he faced. Four Twins made the All-Star Game: first baseman 
Harmon Killebrew, second baseman Rod Carew, outfielder Tony Oliva, and 
pitcher Jim Perry. On September 16, Blyleven struck out the first six batters 
he faced to tie a major league record. However, the Twins lost the game 
to the California Angels, 5-1.[6] The Twins are no-hit for the second time 
in their history, losing 6-0 to Oakland's Vida Blue.[7] The Twins won the 
American League West, led by leadoff batter César Tovar (120 runs), Oliva 
(.325, 23 HR, 107 RBI) and Killebrew (41 HR, 113 RBI). Carew was batting 
.366 (after 51 games) when his knee was injured turning a double play. 
Perry won 24 games and became the first Twins pitcher to win the AL Cy 
Young Award. Jim Kaat added 14 wins and rookie Bert Blyleven won 10. Kaat 
also won his 9th Gold Glove Award. Reliever Ron Perranoski led the AL with 
34 saves. 1,261,887 fans attended Twins games, the third highest total 
in the American League. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12]
