Montgomery Marcellus "Monte" Pearson (September 2, 1908 – January 27, 1978) 
was an American baseball pitcher who played ten seasons in Major League 
Baseball (MLB). Nicknamed "Hoot",[1] he played for the Cleveland Indians, 
New York Yankees and Cincinnati Reds from 1932 to 1941. He batted and threw 
right-handed and served primarily as a starting pitcher. Pearson played 
minor league baseball for three different teams until 1932, when he signed 
with the Cleveland Indians. After spending four seasons with the organization, 
Pearson was traded to the New York Yankees, where he spent the next five 
years. At the conclusion of the 1940 season, he was traded to the Cincinnati 
Reds, with whom he played his last game on August 5, 1941. A four-time 
World Series champion, Pearson holds the MLB record for lowest walks plus 
hits per inning pitched (WHIP) in the postseason. He is most famous for 
pitching the first no-hitter at the original Yankee Stadium. Pearson was 
born on September 2, 1908 in Oakland, California.[1] He was raised as a 
member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints[2] and was one 
of the first Mormons to find success in the major leagues.[3] He later 
moved to Fresno, California[4] and studied at Fresno High School, where 
he started playing baseball at catcher and third base and was a letterman 
in four sports.[5] After graduating, he attended college at the University 
of California, Berkeley, where he played two seasons of baseball for the 
California Golden Bears from 1928–29.[6] He worked as a mechanic as one 
of his first jobs, and his ability to sing and play the guitar helped develop 
his reputation as a positive influence on the clubhouse throughout his 
major league career.[7] Pearson began his professional baseball career 
in 1929 with the Bakersfield Bees, a Minor League Baseball team that were 
members of the California State League.[8] He was signed by the Oakland 
Oaks of the Pacific Coast League the following year, and was optioned to 
the Arizona State League's Phoenix Senators after recording a 5.77 earned 
run average (ERA) in 24 games pitched. However, he established himself 
in the Oaks' pitching rotation in 1931 and compiled a 17–16 win–loss record 
and a 4.46 ERA in 234 innings pitched.[5][8] His performance that year, 
coupled with his heavy-breaking curveball, caught the attention of the 
Cleveland Indians, who promptly bought his contract after the season ended.[5] 
Pearson made his major league debut for the Indians on April 22, 1932, 
at the age of 23,[1] relieving Pete Appleton in the eighth inning and giving 
up 6 earned runs in 1 1⁄2 innings in a 16–3 loss against the Detroit Tigers.[9] 
His subsequent games were disappointing and, after compiling a 10.13 ERA 
in 8 innings from 8 games pitched,[1] he was demoted back to the minor 
leagues. He played the rest of the season for the Toledo Mud Hens of the 
American Association (AA),[5] where continued his dismal performance with 
a 3–9 record and 3.99 ERA.[8] However, he improved significantly the following 
year,[5] posting an 11–5 record and 3.41 ERA in 148 innings with the Mud 
Hens,[8] as well as leading the AA in strikeouts at the time he was called 
back up to the majors.[10] His pitching during the first half of the season 
prompted the Indians to bring him back up to the first team in early July.[5] 
He continued to pitch well in the majors and finished the season with a 
10–5 record; his 2.33 ERA was the lowest in the American League (AL) that 
year and although he pitched only 135 1⁄3 innings,[1] he is recognized 
as the AL ERA champion by Baseball-Reference.com.[11] Pearson followed 
up his impressive 1933 season with another strong showing in 1934. That 
year, he finished second in the AL in games started (33), fifth in strikeouts 
(140) and complete games (19) and sixth in wins (18).[1] In spite of 13 
losses, a 4.52 ERA,[5] 130 walks (the second-highest in the AL) and 15 
wild pitches (the most in MLB),[1][12] this was considered one of his best 
seasons.[13] However, his poor performance in 1935—where he went 8–13 with 
a 4.90 ERA[1]—convinced the Indians to cut their losses with their once-promising 
prospect.[5] Pearson was traded at the end of the season to the New York 
Yankees with Steve Sundra in exchange for Johnny Allen.[1][14] Pearson's 
trade to the New York Yankees was initially unpopular among fans,[15] with 
Joe McCarthy receiving heavy criticism for dealing Allen—who had a 13–6 
record in 1935[16]—for Pearson.[17] However, Pearson repaid his manager's 
faith in him[18] by churning out the best statistical year in his career. 
His .731 winning percentage (19–7 record) was third best in the AL; he 
finished fifth in ERA (3.71) and strikeouts (118) and sixth in wins, though 
he also recorded the third-highest number of walks in the AL with 135.[1] 
His performance during the first half of the season resulted in him being 
selected for the 1936 All-Star Game, though he did not pitch in it.[19] 
In the postseason, the Yankees advanced to the World Series, where they 
defeated the New York Giants 4–2.[20] In Game 4, Pearson—who insisted on 
being included in the rotation[21] even after falling ill with pleurisy 
just before the Series[22]—limited the Giants to just two runs while striking 
out seven in a complete game win. Offensively, he managed to get two hits, 
including a double.[23] The 5–2 victory ended Carl Hubbell's streak of 
17 consecutive regular and postseason wins.[5][a] During spring training 
of 1937, Pearson injured his right ankle after accidentally stepping onto 
a rolling ball.[25] He was still able recover in time for the start the 
season and pitched solidly. In arguably his best start of the year, he 
threw a one-hit shutout against the Chicago White Sox on May 10; he also 
recorded three hits and drove in two runs in the 7–0 win.[26][27] However, 
other health problems[7] and injuries—most notably a sore arm[28]—began 
to affect him, limiting his season to just 144 2⁄3 innings pitched in 20 
games started and 2 games finished in relief.[1] Despite his many ailments, 
he still came up clutch[21] in Game 3 of the 1937 World Series. Facing 
a familiar foe in the New York Giants, Pearson stymied them to a solitary 
run in 8 2⁄3 innings pitched and received the win as the Yankees cruised 
to a 5–1 victory,[29] taking a commanding 3–0 lead in the Series. The Yankees 
eventually triumphed in 5 games,[30] giving Pearson his second World Series 
ring in as many years with the team.[1] The 1938 season saw Pearson rebound 
in his regular season numbers. He had the fifth-highest winning percentage 
(.696), the sixth most wins (16) and the seventh most complete games (17) 
in the AL, but he struggled with his control, ending the season with 9 
wild pitches (second-highest in the AL) and 113 walks (fifth most).[1] 
During a June 26 road game at Briggs Stadium, he held the Detroit Tigers 
to three runs in a complete game, 10–3 Yankees win.[31] By not giving up 
any home runs in the game, he halted the Tigers' quest of breaking the 
MLB record for most consecutive games with a home run for a team.[32] The 
highlight of his season came on August 27, when he pitched a no-hitter 
against the Cleveland Indians in the second game of a doubleheader.[33] 
Facing his former team on only two days of rest,[34] Pearson struck out 
seven, allowed just two baserunners through walks and retired the last 
18 consecutive batters in a 13–0 victory, marking his 13th win of the season[35] 
and 10th consecutive win. This was the first Yankee no-hitter in fifteen 
years (pitched by Sad Sam Jones), as well as first no-hitter at Yankee 
Stadium.[34] "Where does that guy get all that stuff? I've seen some pretty 
good curveball pitchers, but that fellow can certainly make the ball duck 
over the corners." In October, Pearson suffered from a dead arm. Doctors 
advised him to undergo surgery after X-rays revealed a spur on his elbow.[21] 
However, he was able to overcome injury once again and pitched in Game 
3 of the 1938 World Series.[37] Up against the Chicago Cubs, he kept them 
to two runs (one earned) while striking out nine in a complete game, 5–2 
win.[38] The Yankees completed their Series sweep over the Cubs in the 
next game,[39] giving them their third straight championship. During the 
1938–39 offseason, Pearson became a contract holdout after he rejected 
the Yankees' initial offer.[40] Reportedly the same amount he had earned 
the season before ($10,000),[1] he described the contract offer as "not 
up to [his] expectations."[40] The two sides eventually agreed to a contract 
worth $13,500. He kept up his good pitching, garnering the seventh-highest 
winning percentage (.706) in the AL that year, though his ERA ballooned 
to 4.49.[1] Throughout the season, problems in his pitching arm flared 
up again,[21] restricting him to just 146 1⁄3 innings pitched and 20 games 
started.[1] As a result, his inclusion on the postseason roster was not 
guaranteed; in late September, McCarthy appeared resigned to the fact that 
Pearson would not "be able to help [him] in this series."[21] However, 
he managed to shrug off his injury woes and was penciled into the starting 
rotation for Game 2 of the 1939 World Series. Facing the Cincinnati Reds, 
he held them hitless through 7 1⁄3 innings pitched—eventually giving up 
just two singles—while striking out eight and walking one in a complete 
game, 4–0 victory.[41] Pearson's sublime pitching performance is considered 
one of the greatest in World Series history;[42] with a game score of 90, 
it is one of only eight Fall Classic starts to record a game score of 90 
or above.[43] The Yankees proceeded to sweep the Reds two games later,[44] 
resulting in their fourth consecutive championship and giving Pearson the 
distinction of winning a World Series ring in every season of his Yankees 
tenure.[1] In 1940, Pearson's pitching during the first half of the season 
earned him his second All-Star Game selection, but he was not called upon 
to pitch in it.[45] About a week after the game, on July 17,[b] he tore 
his shoulder ligament which prematurely shortened his playing career.[5] 
After pitching 13 innings against Bob Feller and his former team, Pearson 
eventually won the game[47] but the injury—discovered after a full physical 
examination on his sore arm a few weeks after the game[48]—ended his season; 
he finished with a 7–5 record and 3.69 ERA in only 109 2⁄3 innings pitched 
and 16 games started.[1] He received treatment at the Union Memorial Hospital 
in Baltimore,[49][50] and at the end of the season, he was placed on waivers[5] 
and traded to the Cincinnati Reds in exchange for Don Lang and $20,000.[1][50] 
Pearson's final major league team was ironically the one he pitched his 
World Series two-hitter against. Due to his history of injuries, the Yankees 
refused to offer a guarantee and thus, no other team was willing sign him.[51] 
However, Reds manager Bill McKechnie made the gamble, remarking how Pearson 
"showed [the Reds] more that day than any National League right-hander 
showed [them] that season"[51] when he threw the two-hitter against them. 
Pearson expressed his delight at the trade and looked forward to working 
with McKechnie.[52] However, he was unable to rediscover his pre-injury 
form; in his first start for the Reds,[53] Pearson was battered by the 
opposing team, giving up six earned runs and five walks to the Chicago 
Cubs before being pulled out of the game after only 1 1⁄3 innings.[54] 
In a total of 7 games pitched–4 starts and 3 games finished—for the Reds, 
he pitched poorly, posting a 1–3 record with a 5.18 ERA in just 24 1⁄3 
innings pitched.[1] This dismal showing convinced the Reds to cut ties 
with Pearson, and he was sold to the Hollywood Stars of the Pacific Coast 
League on August 21.[1][55] Pearson's sojourn in the minor leagues was 
brief, lasting just one game. In his only start for the Stars, he pitched 
a complete game, giving up six hits and three walks in five innings.[8] 
He announced his retirement from baseball the following year on August 
27.[56] Pearson married Cleo Wimer in January 1931. They had a son and 
a daughter.[5] He remained with Cleo for thirty-two years, before she filed 
for divorce in 1962.[57] He remarried to Nellie, with whom he had one son, 
Larry.[5] Larry was signed by the Washington Senators in 1959.[58] During 
the 1939 offseason, Pearson was nearly killed while hunting with William 
Rudolph, a 15-year-old high school baseball player from Fresno. Rudolph 
accidentally fired his shotgun at the same time as Pearson. The shot penetrated 
Pearson's cap and knocked it from his head.[59] Pearson, who escaped uninjured, 
described the incident as "the thrill of [his] life."[60] In 1942, during 
a leave of absence away from baseball to recover from injury, Pearson worked 
at the Fresno Air National Guard Base as a firefighter.[56] After his Major 
League career ended, he planned on switching to a career in boxing,[61] 
but returned to Fresno State College and graduated with a degree in chemistry.[62] 
He became the chief sanitarian of Madera County.[63] He unsuccessfully 
ran for a seat on the Fresno County Board of Supervisors in 1952.[64] On 
May 15, 1962, Pearson was arrested and charged with accepting bribes in 
exchange for approving shoddy septic tanks.[62] In November of that year, 
he was found guilty of one count of bribery involving $200.[63] The court 
sentenced him to eight months imprisonment and placed him on probation 
for three years.[13] After a long battle with cancer,[65] Pearson died 
on January 27, 1978 in Fresno, California at the age of 69 and was cremated.[1] 
Despite having mediocre statistics in the regular season,[1] Pearson excelled 
in the postseason.[36][66] He won all four of his World Series starts, 
finishing with a 4–0 win–loss record.[1] His 0.729 walks plus hits per 
inning pitched (WHIP) is the lowest of all time in the postseason, while 
he also has the second-lowest hits per nine innings (4.794) and seventh-lowest 
ERA (1.01).[67] Together with teammate Red Ruffing, they held a combined 
8–1 record and a 1.79 ERA spanning from the 1936–39 World Series, and the 
two are viewed as one of the most dominant postseason pitching duos of 
all time.[68] Pearson appeared on the Baseball Hall of Fame ballot in 1958. 
He received just one vote—0.4% of the vote—and was not included on any 
subsequent ballots.[1][69] He was inducted into the Fresno Athletic Hall
