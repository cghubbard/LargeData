The Rawlings Gold Glove Award, usually referred to as the Gold Glove, is 
the award given annually to the Major League Baseball players judged to 
have exhibited superior individual fielding performances at each fielding 
position in both the National League (NL) and the American League (AL), 
as voted by the managers and coaches in each league.[1] Managers are not 
permitted to vote for their own players.[1] Eighteen Gold Gloves are awarded 
each year (with the exception of 1957, 1985 and 2007), one at each of the 
nine positions in each league. In 1957, the baseball glove manufacturer 
Rawlings created the Gold Glove Award to commemorate the best fielding 
performance at each position.[2] The award was created from a glove made 
from gold lamé-tanned leather and affixed to a walnut base.[3] Initially, 
only one Gold Glove per position was awarded to the top fielder at each 
position in the entire league;[2] however, separate awards were given for 
the National and American Leagues beginning in 1958.[4][5] Ozzie Smith, 
known as "the Wizard of Oz", has won the most Gold Glove Awards at shortstop; 
he captured 13 awards in his 19 seasons with the St. Louis Cardinals.[6] 
Omar Vizquel is second among shortstops with 11 wins; he won two with the 
San Francisco Giants in the National League after winning nine with the 
Seattle Mariners and the Cleveland Indians in the American League.[7] Luis 
Aparicio won nine times at shortstop for the third-highest total,[8] followed 
by Mark Belanger with eight wins.[9] Dave Concepción and Derek Jeter have 
won five awards;[10] four-time winners at shortstop include Tony Fernández 
and Alan Trammell.[11][12] Hall of Famers who have won Gold Glove Awards 
at shortstop include Smith, Aparicio, Ernie Banks, Robin Yount, Barry Larkin 
and Cal Ripken, Jr., whose 2,632 consecutive games played earned him his 
"Iron Man" nickname.[6][8][13][14][15] Vizquel made the fewest errors during 
a shortstop's winning season, with three in 2000;[7] his .995 fielding 
percentage that season leads American League and major league shortstops, 
and his 2006 total of four errors is tied for the National League lead 
with Rey Ordóñez (1999).[7][16] Ordóñez' .994 fielding percentage in 1999 
leads National Leaguers in that category.[16] Aparicio leads winners in 
putouts, with 305 in 1960;[8] Concepción (1976) and Smith (1983) are tied 
for the National League lead with 304.[6][10] Smith's 621 assists are best 
among all shortstops,[6] and Belanger (552 assists in 1974) is the American 
League leader.[9] Gene Alley turned 128 double plays in 1966 to lead winners 
in that category;[17] Ripken leads American Leaguers, with 119 turned in
