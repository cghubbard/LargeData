National Park, Genkai, Kitakyūshū, and Yaba-Hita-Hikosan Quasi-National 
Parks, and Chikugogawa, Chikuhō, Dazaifu, Sefuri Raizan, and Yabegawa Prefectural

of small islands near the north coast of Kyūshū. Twenty-eight cities are 
located in Fukuoka Prefecture: Fukuoka City Kitakyushu Kurume Omuta These
