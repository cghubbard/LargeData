Hanlan's Point Stadium was a baseball stadium and lacrosse grounds in Toronto, 
Canada. It was erected in 1897 at Hanlan's Point on the Toronto Islands 
for the minor league Toronto Maple Leafs baseball club. It was destroyed 
by fire twice, in 1903, and again in 1909. Adjacent to the Hanlan's Point 
Amusement Park, the site was in use for various sports until the late 1930s. 
Initially, a grandstand and bleachers were built on the site. When the 
Toronto Ferry Company acquired the Leafs, it moved the team from Sunlight 
Park near the mouth of the Don River on the mainland to the Hanlan's Point 
field on the islands. The Toronto Ferry Company built a new semi-circular 
grandstand, with the old grandstand converted to bleachers. The Maple Leafs 
played at the stadium until 1901, when they moved to Diamond Park on the 
mainland. The Hanlan's stadium and the adjacent bar, both managed by Lol 
Solman, were destroyed by a fire on September 10, 1903. The stadium was 
rebuilt. In 1908, the stadium was replaced with Maple Leaf Park, a new 
baseball stand and grounds at Hanlan's Point and the Maple Leafs returned. 
When it was built, Maple Leaf Park had 3,000 seats, covered bleachers that 
could accommodate another 4,500, and uncovered bleachers with room for 
about another 1,800. On opening day, May 12, 1908, the Leafs came from 
behind to defeat the Jersey City Skeeters in extra innings with paid attendance 
of 6,192. The stadium was destroyed by a fire on August 10, 1909 that also 
wiped out the amusement park at Hanlan's Point. For the rest of the season, 
the Maple Leafs had to return to the smaller Diamond Park. A new stadium 
was built on the site, opening in 1910 and described at the time as the 
largest in all of the minor leagues with over 17,000 seats.[1] It was designed 
by Toronto-based architect Charles F. Wagner. Initial advertising referred 
to the site as Hanlan's Point Stadium. It was also sometimes called Island 
Stadium. The first baseball game at the stadium—but not the first event 
in the building—took place on May 9, 1910 with the Leafs rallying to defeat 
the Baltimore Orioles in the bottom of the ninth inning in front of a paid 
crowd of 12,867. The stadium is notable for being the location of Babe 
Ruth's first professional home run on September 5, 1914. Ruth was playing 
for the visiting Providence Grays and pitched a one-hitter against the 
Leafs to go along with his three-run home run over the right-field wall 
in a 9-0 win for Providence.[2] A historic plaque commemorates the occasion 
near the Hanlan's Point dock. The Maple Leafs left the Toronto Islands 
for Maple Leaf Stadium after the 1925 season. In March 1927, the parks 
commissioner of the City of Toronto requested tenders for the demolition 
of the bleachers. The city architect had deemed them to be unsafe. The 
field remained in use until the construction of the Toronto Island Airport 
in 1937, when the area surrounding the airfield (where the old terminal 
building is now located) was converted to parkland. Two markers were placed 
near the site along Lakeshore Avenue. Coordinates: 43°37′37″N 79°23′30″W﻿
