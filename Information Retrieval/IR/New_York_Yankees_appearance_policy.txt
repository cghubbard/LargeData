Since 1973, the New York Yankees have had an appearance policy regulating 
how their players must be presented. It states that players must have their 
hair cut above the collar of their baseball jersey and no beards are permitted. 
The policy has raised some controversy and there have been calls for its 
abolition. The policy was brought in in 1973 by George Steinbrenner, reportedly 
after seeing several players' hair covering their numbers during performance 
of the "Star Spangled Banner" and noting down their numbers (as he did 
not know their names) to instruct them to cut their hair. As a result, 
he introduced an appearance policy for the Yankees.[1] The official policy 
states "All players, coaches and male executives are forbidden to display 
any facial hair other than mustaches (except for religious reasons), and 
scalp hair may not be grown below the collar. Long sideburns and 'mutton 
chops' are not specifically banned."[2] This was because Steinbrenner wanted 
the Yankees to adopt a corporate attitude.[3] The policy raised some objections 
from the team. Don Mattingly openly defied the Yankees' management's requests 
for him to cut his hair. In response they removed him from the starting 
lineup and fined him repeatedly until he promised to trim it.[4] An incident 
that had mirrored a story in The Simpsons episode "Homer at the Bat" where 
Mattingly was a guest star and was benched in the episode for having long 
sideburns (that only Mr. Burns, the team manager, could see) was written 
months before the Yankees incident.[5] Lou Piniella challenged the rule 
during spring training in Fort Lauderdale, citing that Jesus had long hair. 
Steinbrenner responded to this request for exemption by pointing at the 
nearby swimming pool and saying "If you can walk on water, you can wear 
your hair any way you want."[6] The policy has become a prominent symbol 
of the New York Yankees.[7] An example of the symbolic clean-shaven look 
came when Johnny Damon cut his "caveman" hair and beard when joining the 
Yankees from the Boston Red Sox with Steinbrenner commenting "he looks 
like a Yankee, sounds like a Yankee, he is a Yankee".[7] This policy has 
led to media speculation that when a player cuts his hair, he is going 
to sign with the Yankees. One example of this was San Francisco Giants' 
Tim Lincecum.[8] Some players, such as David Price, have openly stated 
that they would never join the Yankees as long as the policy was in place.[3] 
There have been several calls for the New York Yankees to drop the policy.[citation 
needed] The New York Yankees players themselves skirted around the policy 
in 2015 by adopting the practice of growing moustaches in line with the 
wording of the policy.[9] Manager Joe Girardi stated that he would join 
the players if they won 10 in a row.[10] This was despite Girardi stating 
that he would continue Steinbrenner's policy after Steinbrenner had died.[3] 
Other baseball clubs also had an appearance policy. Until 1971, there were 
no MLB players that had facial hair due to fashion dictates at the time.[11] 
The Cincinnati Reds had a policy against beards as an unwritten rule until 
1999.[12] In 2016 when Mattingly became the field manager of the Miami 
Marlins, he introduced a complete ban on any facial hair on any players.[13]
