Donnie Ray Moore (February 13, 1954 – July 18, 1989) was an American relief 
pitcher in Major League Baseball (MLB) who played for the Chicago Cubs 
(1975, 1977–79), St. Louis Cardinals (1980), Milwaukee Brewers (1981), 
Atlanta Braves (1982–84) and California Angels (1985–88). He is best known 
for giving up an important home run to Red Sox outfielder Dave Henderson 
in the 1986 American League Championship Series. He committed suicide shortly 
after his professional career ended. Moore was born on February 13, 1954, 
in Lubbock, Texas, and was the cousin of MLB player Hubie Brooks.[1] Moore 
attended Paris Junior College and Ranger College before he was selected 
by the Chicago Cubs in the first round of the January secondary phase of 
the 1973 Major League Baseball draft.[2] In a 13-season career, Moore posted 
a 43–40 record with 89 saves, 416 strikeouts, and a 3.67 ERA in 655 innings. 
Moore also compiled a .281 batting average with 11 RBIs. He was selected 
as an All-Star in 1985 after developing a splitter with a slider and a 
breaking ball. Moore is most remembered for the home run he gave up to 
Dave Henderson while pitching for the California Angels in Game 5 of the 
1986 American League Championship Series. With only one more strike needed 
to clinch the team's first-ever pennant, he allowed the Boston Red Sox 
to come back and eventually win the game and series. The game took place 
on October 12, 1986 in Anaheim. The Angels held a 3–1 series lead against 
the Boston Red Sox. In the game, the Angels held a 5–2 lead going into 
the ninth inning. A home run by Boston's Don Baylor made it a 5–4 game. 
When Moore came in to pitch, there were two outs and a runner on first 
(Rich Gedman, who had been hit by a pitch). The Angels were one strike 
away from advancing to the World Series for the first time in franchise 
history. Dave Henderson hit a 2–2 pitch off Moore for a home run to give 
the Red Sox a 6–5 lead. The Angels were able to score a run in the bottom 
of the ninth, pushing the game into extra innings. Moore remained in the 
game for the Angels; he was able to stifle a tenth inning Red Sox rally 
by getting Jim Rice to ground into a double play. Nonetheless, the Red 
Sox were able to score off Moore in the 11th inning via a sacrifice fly 
by Henderson. The Angels did not score in the bottom of the 11th, and lost 
the game 7–6. The defeat left the Angels with a 3–2 series advantage with 
two more games to play at Fenway Park. However, the Angels lost both games, 
by scores of 10–4 and 8–1. Moore was battling injury at the time of the 
1986 ALCS and was never able to remain injury-free following it. After 
saving nine more games in 41 appearances over the next two seasons, Moore 
was released by the Angels. He signed with the Kansas City Royals for the 
1989 season, but played only in the minor leagues before being released 
in June of that year, ending his 14-year career in baseball. On July 18, 
1989, Moore had an argument with his wife Tonya and shot her three times.[3] 
The incident occurred at their Anaheim Hills home, with their three children 
in the house at the time.[3] Tonya Moore and daughter Demetria, then 17 
years of age, fled from the house and Demetria drove her mother to the 
hospital – Tonya survived the shooting.[3] Back inside the house, still 
in the presence of at least one of his two sons, Moore then committed suicide.[3]
