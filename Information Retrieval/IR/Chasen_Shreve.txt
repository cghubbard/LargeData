Chasen Dean Shreve (born July 12, 1990) is an American professional baseball 
pitcher for the New York Yankees of Major League Baseball (MLB). He made 
his MLB debut in 2014 with the Atlanta Braves, and was traded to the Yankees 
before the 2015 season. Shreve attended Bonanza High School in Las Vegas, 
Nevada. In his senior year, Shreve was named to the Nevada All-State Second 
team for baseball.[1] He enrolled at the College of Southern Nevada, where 
he played college baseball.[2] The Atlanta Braves selected Shreve in the 
11th round of the 2010 Major League Baseball Draft.[3] He made his professional 
debut with the Danville Braves of the Rookie-level Appalachian League that 
year, pitching to a 2–0 win-loss record and a 2.25 earned run average (ERA). 
In 2011, Shreve pitched for the Rome Braves of the Class A South Atlantic 
League, finishing the season with a 5–6 win-loss record and a 3.86 ERA. 
Shreve began the 2012 season with the Lynchburg Hillcats of the Class A-Advanced 
Carolina League, where he had a 4–4 win-loss record and a 2.15 ERA, before 
receiving a promotion to the Mississippi Braves of the Class AA Southern 
League, where he had a 2–1 record and a 3.93 ERA. Shreve split the 2013 
season with Mississippi and Lynchburg, pitching to a 3–1 record and a 4.43 
ERA in Mississippi and a 0–1 record and a 2.75 ERA with Lynchburg.[4] During 
spring training in 2014, Shreve altered his approach to increase his pitching 
velocity.[5] He had a 3–2 with seven saves and a 2.48 ERA. The Braves promoted 
Shreve to the major leagues for the first time on July 19, 2014 to replace 
Luis Avilán.[4][6] The Braves demoted Shreve to the Gwinnett Braves of 
the Class AAA International League on August 1.[7] He made 15 appearances 
for the Braves in 2014 accumulating a 0.73 ERA. The Braves traded Shreve 
and David Carpenter to the New York Yankees for Manny Banuelos on January 
1, 2015.[8] Shreve pitched to a 1.89 ERA in his first 52 1⁄3 innings of 
the 2015 season, but had a 13.50 ERA in his final six innings, during which 
he allowed four home runs. Yankees catcher Brian McCann speculated that 
Shreve was tipping his pitches to opposing hitters, though Larry Rothschild, 
the Yankees pitching coach, believed Shreve was simply tired at the end 
of the season.[9] Overall in 2015, Shreve ended the season 6-2 with a 3.09 
ERA in 59 game appearances. Shreve struggled to a 5.21 ERA in his first 
19 appearances to begin 2016. On May 26, 2016, he was placed on the 15-day 
disabled list due to a left shoulder strain.[10] On August 30, Shreve earned 
his first Major League save in 5-4 10 inning win over the Kansas City Royals.
