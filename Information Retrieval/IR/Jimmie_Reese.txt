Jimmie Reese (October 1, 1901 â€“ July 13, 1994) was a professional baseball 
player. He played second base, third base, and then coached in Major League 
Baseball. Reese was born James Herman Solomon to a Jewish family in New 
York City and was brought up in Los Angeles.[1][2] In order to avoid the 
brunt of prejudice against Jewish baseball players, he adopted the name 
of Jimmie Reese, which he used throughout his baseball career.[2] Much 
of his career was spent in the Pacific Coast League, beginning as a batboy 
with the Los Angeles Angels from 1919 (at least one source claims 1917[1]) 
to 1923.[3][4] In 1924 he signed a contract to play second base with the 
Oakland Oaks.[4] The Oaks won the PCL pennant in 1927, with Reese batting 
.295 in 191 games. He had a league-leading fielding percentage of .984 
that year.[3] In September 1927 he was traded by Oakland to the New York 
Yankees with Lyn Lary and $100,000 ($1,364,559 today).[4] He was called 
up to the American League in 1930. Reese played for the Yankees in 1930 
and 1931, and was most noted for being the roommate of Babe Ruth (or, as 
Reese explained, he "roomed with Ruth's suitcase").[5] In 1930 he batted 
.346 in 188 at bats, striking out only 8 times. Only Lou Gehrig and Babe 
Ruth hit for higher averages on the team. He was the primary back-up at 
second base (48 games) behind Tony Lazzeri (77 games). In November 1931 
he was sent by the Yankees to the St. Paul Saints (American Association), 
to complete an earlier deal made in June 1931 for Johnny Murphy, Jack Saltzgaver, 
cash, and 2 players to be named. Reese played the 1932 season with the 
St. Louis Cardinals, who had selected him off of waivers in June. The Los 
Angeles Angels (PCL) purchased Reese's contract from the Cardinals in February 
1933. He missed most of the season due to injuries and illness, but hit 
.330 in 104 games.[3] The following year he batted .311 with 12 triples, 
and had a fielding percentage of .972 (the best among second basemen that 
season). He continued to play for the Angels in 1935 and 1936.[3] In 1937 
he was traded to the San Diego Padres (PCL), where he hit .314. The Padres 
won the Governor's Cup that year. He retired as a player after the 1938 
season.[3] Reese served in the Army from November 1942 to July 1943 with 
the 12th Armored Division at Fort Campbell, Kentucky, where he managed 
the baseball team.[3] After the war, he worked as a scout for the Boston 
Braves for two years, and coached in San Diego from 1948 until 1960, when 
he was appointed manager. But he preferred to coach, so he resigned partway 
through the 1961 season. "I'm best suited as a liaison man, as a coach", 
he said. "I just am not suited to give a guy hell."[3] From 1963 until 
1970 he coached at Hawaii, Seattle, and Portland, Oregon; then he scouted 
for the Montreal Expos. He threw out the ceremonial first pitch at the 
1989 Major League Baseball All-Star Game, played at Anaheim Stadium. Reese 
never married, had no children, and was mostly estranged from his extended 
family. In 1972, at age 71, he asked the Angels for a job, and was hired 
as conditioning coach, whose job was to get the players into shape. Reese's 
main specialty, however, was hitting fungos in practice, using a fungo 
bat he made himself. Numerous Angels players remarked on his seemingly 
uncanny ability to place fungos where he wanted. He even occasionally "pitched" 
batting practice with his fungo bat, standing at the pitcher's rubber and 
consistently hitting line drives over the middle of the plate. He was regularly 
called "the nicest man in baseball", and had a friendship with Nolan Ryan 
when he was with the team; Ryan would name one of his sons Reese in his 
honor.[1] He was listed as an Angels coach for 22 years, until his death 
on July 13, 1994, in Santa Ana, California. He died peacefully of aspiration 
pneumonia and respiratory failure. His uniform #50 was retired by the club 
in his memory. At his death, Reese was believed to be the oldest person 
ever to regularly wear a uniform in an official capacity in the history 
of organized professional baseball in North America.[1] His record was 
surpassed in 2016 by Red Schoendienst, who currently serves as a special 
assistant coach for the St. Louis Cardinals at age 93 and wears a Cardinals 
uniform in that role. Ted Radcliffe and Buck O'Neil made appearances in 
professional games at older ages, but those were one-off ceremonial events. 
He was inducted into the Pacific Coast League Hall of Fame in 2003.[6] 
In the film Jack Reacher, Tom Cruise in the title role uses the name Jimmie 
Reese when trying to conceal his identity from a suspiciously, sexually 
overt local girl, Sandy (Alexia Fast). Later on, he confirms that whenever 
he uses an alias, he always uses the name of someone who played second
