Aaron hit his 715th home run, breaking the record held by Babe Ruth.[2] 
Sager can be easily recognized in the fracas at home plate after the home 
run because of the long white overcoat that he was wearing. Prior to working 
for Turner Sports, Sager joined CNN in 1981 after handling the network's 
first live remote report from the 1980 baseball playoffs. At CNN, Sager 
was co-anchor of the network's CNN Sports Tonight shows and was honored

was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia and missed the entire 2014 NBA 
Playoffs.[7][8] On April 20, 2014, Sager's son Craig Jr. did the sideline 
interview with San Antonio Spurs coach Gregg Popovich between the 3rd and 
4th quarters of the 2014 NBA playoffs 1st round against the Dallas Mavericks 
to air a special get well message to Sager. The NBA on TNT crew did a special 
tribute to Sager as well, wearing suits similar to Sager from the past. 
On the same day during the between quarters interview segments all coaches 
gave get well messages to Sager.[9] Craig Jr. later helped save Sager's 
life as he was a match for the bone marrow transplant needed to push Sager 
into remission.[10] In late March 2016 Sager announced his leukemia had 
returned.[11] It was also announced that doctors had told him that he had 
3–6 months to live without treatment. On July 29, 2016, Craig Sager underwent 
bone marrow surgery.[12] On July 13, 2016, Craig Sager was awarded the
