Jerome Adams "Jerry" Utley (January 7, 1881 – April 24, 1959[1]) was an 
American baseball player and coach, contracting engineer, hotelier and 
boxing promoter. He played and coached college baseball for the Michigan 
Wolverines baseball team in the early 1900s. He also briefly coached and 
played minor league baseball from 1905 to 1906. After retiring from baseball, 
Utley had a successful career as a contracting engineer on building projects 
in Detroit, Michigan. From 1931 to approximately 1948, he had an ownership 
interest in the Hotel Playa Ensenada, later renamed the Hotel Riviera del 
Pacífico, a luxury hotel in Baja California, Mexico. He also briefly had 
a partnership with Jack Dempsey as a boxing promoter which included promoting 
the 1933 heavyweight championship match between Max Schmeling and Max Baer. 
Utley was born in Stanton, Michigan, the son of Rev. Wells H. Utley and 
Emma (Adams) Utley. He attended Central High School in Detroit, Michigan 
in approximately 1899.[2] After graduating from high school, Utley entered 
the University of Michigan as an engineering student. He received a bachelor 
of science degree in mechanical engineering in 1903. While attending Michigan, 
he was a pitcher for the Michigan Wolverines baseball team from 1900 to 
1903.[3][4][5] After receiving his degree in 1903, Utley returned to Michigan 
as the head coach of the Michigan Wolverines baseball team in 1904.[6] 
The Wolverines had a 10–5 record in Utley's only season as the head coach.[7] 
In August 1903, Utley moved to Michigan's Upper Peninsula to play for the 
Calumet baseball team and work as an engineer in one of the area's mines.[8] 
In 1905, he was the manager of the Hancock Infants of the Copper Country 
Soo League. In 1906, he played minor league baseball for the Houghton Giants 
of the Northern-Copper Country League.[9] In 1907, Utley was hired as the 
baseball coach at Detroit College.[10] From 1908 to 1910, Utley was the 
star pitcher, and in 1909 the team captain, for the Detroit Athletic Club 
baseball team.[11][12][13][14][15][16] He also returned to the mound in 
1913 as a pitcher for the Euclids, a semi-pro baseball team in Detroit.[17][18][19] 
Utley became a contracting engineer in Detroit, Michigan. As of September 
1918, he was self-employed as an engineer with an office at the Penobscot 
Building in downtown Detroit.[20] In his 1922 history of Detroit, Clarence 
Burton included a profile of Utley, noting: "Jerome A. Utley, a contracting 
engineer of Detroit who has executed many important contracts, has had 
broad experience in this line of work and his standing in engineering circles 
of the city is an enviable one. ... Industry is the key which has unlocked 
for Mr. Utley the portals of success and thoroughness and diligence have 
characterized all of his work. His professional standing is of the highest 
and through his labors he has contributed in substantial measure to the 
development and improvement of Detroit, being recognized as a most progressive 
and public-spirited citizen, whose influence is at all times on the side 
of advancement and improvement."[2] Census records indicate he was unmarried 
and living in Detroit with his brother Stuart and sister Beatrice in 1910 
and with his sister Beatrice Utley in 1920 and 1930.[21][22][23] Utley 
was a member of the First Congregational Church, a Mason, and a member 
of the Detroit Athletic Club.[2] In his later years, Utley was best known 
for his role as the owner of the Hotel Playa Ensenada, later renamed the 
Hotel Riviera del Pacífico. The hotel was a luxury resort built in the 
late 1920s during Prohibition, included a casino, and was located approximately 
75 miles south of Tijuana. Jack Dempsey, the world heavyweight boxing champion, 
was one of the original owners, and guests included Marion Davies, William 
Randoph Hearst, Johnny Weismuller and Myrna Loy. By 1931, the hotel's debt 
burden had become a problem, and Utley made a substantial investment in 
the hotel.[24][25] Following Utley's investment, the hotel's business dropped 
off, as Prohibition was repealed in the United States and gambling was 
outlawed in Mexico. Utley became the hotel's principal owner in the 1930s, 
and the hotel was closed in 1938.[24][26][27] Utley also formed a brief 
partnership with Dempsey to promote boxing matches. Dempsey and Utley were 
the promoters of the June 1933 heavyweight championship match between Max 
Schmeling and Max Baer.[28][29][30] During World War II, the hotel as used 
as a military headquarters to guard against a Japanese attack on the United 
States through Baja California. After the war, Utley re-opened the hotel. 
Described as "a seventy-year-old bachelor," Utley fell in love with Marjorie 
King Plant, described as "an attractive blond woman in her early forties."[24] 
Utley gave the hotel to Plant in approximately 1948, but later learned 
that she had married a Mexican lawyer. Utley filed a lawsuit against Plant, 
and she sold her interest in the hotel and returned to California.[24]
