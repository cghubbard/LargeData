Emmett Eugene Dale (June 16, 1889 – March 20, 1958), sometimes referred 
to as Jean Dale,[1] was an American professional baseball player. Dale 
was a pitcher, and played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the St. Louis 
Cardinals (1911–1912) and Cincinnati Reds (1915–1916). He also played in 
minor league baseball. He was expelled from organized baseball in 1921 
for match fixing. Dale was born to Thomas J. Dale, a bricklayer, and Sylvia 
Dale (née Kahlert) in St. Louis, Missouri, on June 16, 1889. He was the 
oldest of five children.[2] Dale began playing baseball in the semi-professional 
Trolley League in St. Louis in 1908.[2][3] In 1910, he debuted in minor 
league baseball as a pitcher for the Dallas Giants of the Class C Texas 
League, which became league co-champions that season. He pitched to a 10–7 
win–loss record in 204 innings pitched.[2] Though the Boston Red Sox of 
the American League gave Dale a tryout before the 1911 season, he did not 
make their roster, and Dale returned to Dallas. After pitching to a 12–8 
win–loss record with 179 strikeouts for Dallas in 1911, the St. Louis Cardinals 
of the National League (NL) purchased Dale from the Giants towards the 
end of the season. He made his Major League Baseball debut with the Cardinals 
on September 19, and pitched to a 0–2 record with a 6.75 earned run average 
(ERA) in 14 2⁄3 innings.[2] The Cardinals returned Dale to Dallas at the 
end of the season, but reacquired him during the offseason. After Dale 
pitched to a 0–5 record and a 6.57 ERA for the Cardinals in the 1912 season, 
they sold Dale to the Montreal Royals of the Class AA International League 
(IL) that August. Dale pitched to a 4–6 in 10 games started for the remainder 
of the 1912 season, a 13–10 record during the 1913 season, and a 10–17 
record in the 1914 season.[2] Seeking more pitchers, the Cincinnati Reds 
of the NL drafted Dale from the Royals before the 1915 season. Despite 
reports that he would be returned to Montreal,[4] catcher Red Dooin convinced 
the Reds to keep Dale, and he made the Reds' Opening Day roster. Dale proceeded 
to win 18 games with the Reds during the 1915 season, recording a 2.46 
ERA. Dale struggled in 1916, and was removed from the starting rotation 
and demoted to the bullpen. After traveling to St. Louis without permission 
of the team, the Reds suspended Dale and sold him to the Indianapolis Indians 
of the Class AA American Association.[2][5] With the Indians, Dale was 
a member of the 1917 Junior World Series champions. Dale led the American 
Association with a 1.50 ERA in the 1918 season, tying with John Merritt.[1] 
Dale pitched for the Indians through the 1919 season, when they released 
him after he started the year with two losing outings.[2] He then signed 
with the Salt Lake City Bees in the Class AA Pacific Coast League (PCL). 
The Bees were locked in a late season pennant race with the Vernon Tigers 
that season. The Tigers won the pennant after they defeated the Bees in 
nine out of 11 games played late in the season, which included three poor 
performances from Dale. He was suspected of match fixing.[2] The Bees traded 
Dale to the Dallas Submarines of the Class B Texas League for Eddie Matheson 
in 1920, as the president of the PCL began to investigate the match fixing 
allegations. Salt Lake City's Harl Maggert and Vernon's Babe Borton, who 
were implicated in the investigation, were suspended in August 1920. Borton 
then implicated other players, including Dale. Dale refused to testify 
in front of a California grand jury, but appeared at a meeting with minor 
league executives in Kansas City, Missouri, where he claimed he was innocent. 
Following the dismissal of criminal charges against Maggert and Borton, 
the National Association of Professional Baseball Leagues, which governed 
minor league baseball, expelled Dale, Borton, Maggert and Bill Rumler on 
January 12, 1921. This expulsion provided Kenesaw Mountain Landis with 
the precedent needed to ban the conspirators involved in the Black Sox 
Scandal.[2] Dale continued to pitch in semi-professional baseball for the 
Cape Giradeau Capahas in 1921. He was honored after the season at a banquet 
held by the St. Louis Chamber of Commerce.[6] Dale appeared in one game 
for the Newark Bears of the IL that year, but was removed from the roster 
once word reached the league's offices.[2] After the end of his baseball 
career, Dale worked for the Steel Products Corporation as a plater. He 
married a woman named Glen in 1929. The couple had no children.[2] Dale
