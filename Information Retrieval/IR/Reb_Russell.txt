Ewell Albert "Reb" Russell (March 12, 1889 – September 30, 1973) was a 
Major League Baseball player for the Chicago White Sox and the Pittsburgh 
Pirates. Russell was drafted by the White Sox as a pitcher in 1912. In 
his rookie season, his won-loss record was 22–16 and he led the league 
in games pitched, with 52. The lefty had a sterling 1.90 ERA while leading 
the team in innings pitched (317) and wins. Only Washington's ace Walter 
Johnson topped Reb’s eight shutouts, and Russell tied a record that still 
stands with five 1–0 victories in a season. In 1916, he was Chicago's opening 
day starter; that year he led the team in wins (18), innings (264), and 
shutouts (5), and led the league in fewest walks allowed per inning. Russell 
helped the White Sox win the 1917 American League pennant, with a won-loss 
record of 15–5 and an ERA of 1.95. He was the starting pitcher of Game 
5 of the 1917 World Series, but was unable to retire a batter and was replaced 
in the first inning by Eddie Cicotte. Russell developed arm trouble in 
1918 and, after a poor start, he was released by Chicago. However, in the 
minor leagues the decent-hitting Russell converted to playing the outfield 
and returned to the majors in 1922, playing for Pittsburgh. That year, 
he batted .367 with 75 RBI in 60 games. He was released by the Pirates 
at the end of the 1923 season, after which he returned to the minor league 
American Association (the highest level of minor league play in his era). 
Russell remained a highly paid star in the AA through age 40, and won the
