The 2006 San Francisco Giants season was the Giants' 124th year in Major 
League Baseball, their 49th year in San Francisco since their move from 
New York following the 1957 season, and their sixth at AT&T Park. The team 
finished in third place in the National League West with a 76-85 record, 
11½ games behind the San Diego Padres. Barry Bonds of the Giants pursued 
his quest toward Hank Aaron's all-time mark of 755 home runs. Bonds finished 
the season with 734 career home runs, 21 short of tying Aaron's mark. On 
June 3, 2006, Eliezer Alfonzo made his big league debut. In his debut, 
his name was misspelled on his jersey (it should have ended in "zo", not 
"so"). Alfonzo hit a two-run shot in the sixth inning that ultimately won 
the game against the Mets. The following day, the jersey was still misspelled.[1] 
The Giants finished 76-85, 11½ games behind the division winner, the San 
Diego Padres, and also 11½ games behind the Los Angeles Dodgers. The Giants 
finished in third place in their division, just ½ game ahead of both the 
Arizona Diamondbacks and Colorado Rockies, who both finished their season 
with a record of 76-86. Infielders Coaches All-Star Game LEAGUE CHAMPIONS:
