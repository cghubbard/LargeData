Roberto Estalella Ventoza [es-tah-LAY-yah] (April 25, 1911 – January 6, 
1991) was a Major League Baseball outfielder and third baseman. He played 
for nine seasons with the Washington Senators (1935–36, 1939, 1942), St. 
Louis Browns (1941) and Philadelphia Athletics (1943–45, 1949). Estalella 
was an All-Star in 1945. Born in Cárdenas, Matanzas, Cuba, Estalella earned 
the nickname "Tarzan" by his medium-frame, stocky and compact body. After 
a brief two-season stint with the Senators, Estalella led the Piedmont 
League in batting average two years in row in 1937 and 1938. After that, 
he spent his time with the Senators and Browns between 1939 and 1942. He 
was sent to the Athletics in 1943 in the same trade that brought All-Star 
Indian Bob Johnson to Washington. With Philadelphia, Estalella hit .298 
in 1944 and .299 in 1945 (fourth in the league). He would have played many 
more years, but he was one of the players suspended by Commissioner Happy 
Chandler in 1946 for jumping to the outlaw Mexican League. Chandler mentioned 
a lifetime suspension for them, but when the penalty was reduced in 1949, 
Estalella came back to the majors. Estalella was a career .282 hitter with 
44 home runs and 308 RBI in 680 games. He also compiled a respectable 1.423 
walk-to-strikeout ratio (350-to-246) and a .383 on-base percentage. His 
grandson, also named Bobby Estalella, was a catcher who also played in 
Major League Baseball. Bobby Estalella died in Hialeah, Florida at age
