Union is a township in Union County, New Jersey, United States. In the 
18th century, the area that is now Union was then called Connecticut Farms. 
As of the 2010 United States Census, the township population was 56,642,[10][11][12] 
the highest recorded in any decennial census, reflecting an increase of 
2,237 (+4.1%) from the 54,405 counted in the 2000 Census, which had in 
turn increased by 4,381 (+8.8%) from the 50,024 counted in the 1990 Census.[19] 
Settled in 1667, Union was the third English speaking settlement in New 
Jersey after Elizabeth and Newark, with the area that is now Union then 
called Connecticut Farms.[20] Union Township was the site of the Battle 
of Connecticut Farms, one of the last battles between British and American 
forces during the American Revolutionary War. On June 6, 1780, British 
troops, led by Hessian General Wilhelm von Knyphausen, boarded boats on 
Staten Island bound for Elizabeth, New Jersey. At midnight, 5,000 troops 
started to land. They expected the Continental Army to give little resistance, 
believing that they were tired of the war and were poorly fed and paid. 
They also expected the citizens of New Jersey to welcome them. They were 
wrong on both counts and were unable to make their way to and through the 
Hobart Gap.[21] Union Township was incorporated as a township by an act 
of the New Jersey Legislature on November 23, 1808, from portions of Elizabeth 
Township, while the area was still part of Essex County. It became part 
of the newly formed Union County on March 19, 1857. Portions of the township 
have been taken to form Linden Township (March 4, 1861), Roselle Park, 
(March 22, 1901), Kenilworth (May 13, 1907) and Hillside (April 3, 1913).[22][23] 
In 1946, a group of residents pushed for the township's name to be changed 
to "Connecticut Farms", citing the potential benefits to area residents 
and businesses from the broad awareness of the historical significance 
of the name.[24] The Township of Union is located on the northern-central 
edge of Union County and is bordered by eight municipalities: Hillside 
to the east, Elizabeth to the southeast, Roselle Park and Kenilworth to 
the south and Springfield Township to the west. Northwest of the township 
lies Millburn, to the north lies Maplewood and to the northeast lies Irvington, 
all in Essex County.[25][26] According to the United States Census Bureau, 
Union township had a total area of 9.092 square miles (23.548 km2), including 
9.071 square miles (23.494 km2) of land and 0.021 square miles (0.055 km2) 
of water (0.23%).[1][2] Unincorporated communities, localities and place 
names located partially or completely within the township include Battle 
Hill, Connecticut Farms, Galloping Hill, Headlentown, Putnam Manor, Salem, 
Townley and Vauxhall.[27] At the 2010 United States Census, there were

Union Township is governed under the Township form of government. The five-member 
Township Committee is elected directly by the voters at-large in partisan 
elections to serve three-year terms of office on a staggered basis, with 
either one or two seats coming up for election each year as part of the 
November general election in a three-year cycle.[7][41] At an annual reorganization 
meeting, the Township Committee selects one of its members to serve as 
Mayor. The Mayor, in addition to voting as a member of the Township Committee, 
presides over the meetings of the committee and carries out ceremonial 
duties. As of 2016[update], members of the Union Township Committee are 
Mayor Manuel T. Figueiredo (D, term on committee ends December 31, 2018; 
term as mayor ends 2016), Deputy Mayor Suzette Cavadas (D, term on committee

Union Township is split between the 7th and 10th Congressional Districts[48] 
and is part of New Jersey's 20th state legislative district.[11][49][50] 
Prior to the 2010 Census, Union Township had also been split between the 
7th and 10th Congressional Districts with different boundaries, a change 
made by the New Jersey Redistricting Commission that took effect in January 
2013, based on the results of the November 2012 general elections.[51] 
The redistricting plan that took effect in 2013 placed 31,611 residents 
living in the central and western portions of the township into the 7th 
District, while 25,031 residents in a semicircle that runs along the northern, 
eastern and southern borders of the township were placed into the 10th 
District.[48][52] New Jersey's Seventh Congressional District is represented 
by Leonard Lance (R, Clinton Township).[53] New Jersey's Tenth Congressional 
District is represented by Donald Payne Jr. (D, Newark).[54] New Jersey 
is represented in the United States Senate by Cory Booker (D, Newark, term 
ends 2021)[55] and Bob Menendez (D, Paramus, 2019).[56][57] For the 2016–2017 
session (Senate, General Assembly), the 20th Legislative District of the 
New Jersey Legislature is represented in the State Senate by Raymond Lesniak 
(D, Elizabeth) and in the General Assembly by Jamel Holley (D, Roselle) 
and Annette Quijano (D, Elizabeth).[58] The Governor of New Jersey is Chris 
Christie (R, Mendham Township).[59] The Lieutenant Governor of New Jersey

Board of Chosen Freeholders, whose nine members are elected at-large to 
three-year terms of office on a staggered basis with three seats coming 
up for election each year, with an appointed County Manager overseeing 
the day-to-day operations of the county. At an annual reorganization meeting 
held in the beginning of January, the board selects a Chairman and Vice 
Chairman from among its members.[61] As of 2014[update], Union County's

year, the district's 10 schools had an enrollment of 7,466 students and 
572.0 classroom teachers (on an FTE basis), for a student–teacher ratio 
of 13.05:1.[87] The schools in the district (with 2011-12 enrollment data 
from the National Center for Education Statistics[88]) are six PreK-4 elementary 
schools — Battle Hill Elementary School[89] (427 students), Hannah Caldwell 
Elementary School[90] (701), Connecticut Farms Elementary School[91] (500),

through twelve (2,317).[99] Union was threatened with being the first municipality 
north of the Mason–Dixon line to suffer from penalties as a result of school 
segregation. The area of Vauxhall was primarily black and Jefferson Elementary 
School was disproportionately black compared to the rest of the town. Union 
avoided problems by converting Jefferson Elementary into a sixth-grade 
only school called Central 6 and bused the Jefferson students to all the 
other elementary schools. It was later renamed Central 5 and is now Hamilton 
School, which is used as a one-year school for fifth-grade students.[100] 
Union is also home to several private nursery schools and the Deron School, 
a private school for learning disabled students ages 5–13.[101] St. Michael's 
Parish School[102] and Holy Spirit School (founded in 1965[103]) operate 
under the supervision of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Newark.[104] 
Kean University, dating back to 1855, serves a total student population 
of almost 16,000.[105] Called New Jersey State Teachers College when it 
was located in Newark, the school moved to Union in 1958, was renamed Kean 
College in 1973 and was granted university status in 1997.[106] As of May 
2010[update], the township had a total of 145.85 miles (234.72 km) of roadways,

11.43 miles (18.39 km) by Union County and 12.46 miles (20.05 km) by the 
New Jersey Department of Transportation and 1.85 miles (2.98 km) by the 
New Jersey Turnpike Authority.[107] Union is traversed by the Garden State

Transit offers rail service at the Union train station[110] providing service 
on the Raritan Valley Line (formerly the mainline of the Lehigh Valley 
Railroad) to Newark Penn Station.[111] The station opened in 2003 and includes 
a parking lot with over 450 spaces.[112] NJ Transit also provides bus service 
to New York City and New Jersey points on the 113, 114 and 117 routes to 
the Port Authority Bus Terminal in Midtown Manhattan, on the 65, 66 70 
and 94 routes to Newark and local service on the 26 and 52.[113] Former

process of revitalization after which it will link to NJ Transit's Morris 
and Essex Lines at Summit and connect to Staten Island.[115] Newark Liberty 
International Airport is approximately 6 miles (9.7 km) east of Union.
