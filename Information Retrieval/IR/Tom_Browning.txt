Thomas Leo Browning (born April 28, 1960)[1] is a former Major League Baseball 
left-handed pitcher. During a 12-year baseball career, he pitched for the 
Cincinnati Reds (1984–1994) and the Kansas City Royals (1995). He is also 
co-author of Tom Browning's Tales from the Reds Dugout.[2] Browning pitched 
the twelfth perfect game in baseball history on September 16, 1988 against 
the Los Angeles Dodgers.[1] He also won the World Series with the Reds 
in 1990. Browning played college baseball at LeMoyne College in Syracuse 
from 1979 to 1981. Browning was drafted by the Cincinnati Reds in the ninth 
round of the 1982 June draft out of Tennessee Wesleyan College in Athens.[1] 
That year he led the Pioneer League in strikeouts and innings pitched, 
and after learning a screwball during the Fall Instruction League, went 
8–1 with 101 strikeouts in 78 2⁄3 innings pitched for Class-A Tampa in 
1983. He eventually earned a midseason promotion to Class-AA Waterbury 
and struck out 101 batters in 117 1⁄3 innings pitched. Browning began the 
1984 season with Class-AAA Wichita, where he went 12–10 with a league-high 
160 strikeouts. On July 31 of that year, he threw a seven-inning no-hitter 
against Iowa and later earned a September call-up to play for Pete Rose's 
Cincinnati Reds. In his major-league debut, Browning beat Orel Hershiser 
and the Los Angeles Dodgers while pitching 8 1⁄3 innings and giving up 
just one run. He finished the year 1–0 with a 1.54 ERA to retain his spot 
on the major-league club the following season. As a rookie, Browning went 
20–9 with a 3.55 ERA for the Reds, becoming the first rookie to win 20 
games since the Yankees' Bob Grim in 1954. Browning finished the season 
with 11 consecutive wins, the longest streak by a Cincinnati pitcher in 
30 years, and was named The Sporting News' NL Rookie Pitcher of the Year. 
He also finished second (behind Vince Coleman) in NL Rookie of the Year 
voting. Browning was superstitious and did not shave between starts. As 
a result, he was often photographed with a four-day stubble. He also wore 
red underwear on the days he pitched. Browning would go on to post double-digit 
win totals for seven straight seasons and consistently ranked among the 
league leaders in starts, innings pitched and shutouts. One of his best 
seasons came in 1988, when he went 18–5 with a 3.41 ERA and teamed with 
23-game-winner Danny Jackson. On September 16, 1988, Browning pitched the 
twelfth perfect game in baseball history. In a 1–0 victory over the Los 
Angeles Dodgers at Riverfront Stadium, Browning threw 72 of 100 pitches 
for strikes and did not run the count to three balls on a single batter. 
The first left-hander to pitch a perfect game since Sandy Koufax in 1965 
(see Sandy Koufax's perfect game), Browning remains the only Red to pitch 
a perfect game.[3] Browning had had a previous no-hitter broken up by a 
Tony Gwynn single with one out in the ninth in June of that year.[4] Browning 
just missed becoming the first pitcher to hurl two perfect games, taking 
another bid into the ninth on July 4, 1989, against the Philadelphia Phillies 
at Veterans Stadium; a lead-off single by Dickie Thon broke up this attempt. 
After his 1988 perfect game, Reds owner Marge Schott put a clause in his 
contract that stated his wife, Debbie, would receive a $300,000 bonus if 
he pitched another perfect game in 1989. The National League Office eventually 
nixed the clause. In 1990, the Reds went to the postseason for the first 
and only time in Browning's career. He won 15 games that season and picked 
up a key win over the Pittsburgh Pirates in Game 2 of the National League 
Championship Series. The Reds would meet the heavily favored Oakland A's 
in the World Series that year, but thanks in part to Browning's victory 
in Game 3, the Reds pulled off an unlikely sweep to become world champions. 
"That 1990 season was, without a doubt, the most enjoyable season of baseball 
I has ever been a part of," he would say. Browning's wife went into labor 
late in Game 2 of the World Series. Browning left the stadium to be with 
his wife at the hospital. However, as the game entered extra innings and 
Piniella realized his pitcher was absent, the Reds called the announcers 
and had them issue a statement on radio and TV asking Browning to return 
to the ballpark in case he had to pitch. While Browning did hear the message, 
he stayed with his wife. The Reds won in the 10th inning. Browning battled 
injuries from 1991 to 1993, going 27–26, but earned a spot on the 1991 
All-Star team after a 10–4 start to the season. Two years later, in one 
of baseball's most legendary pranks, he snuck out of Wrigley Field during 
a Reds-Cubs game and appeared on a Wrigley Field rooftop, 3643 N. Sheffield 
Ave., - in uniform - during a July 7 game. The gag earned Browning a $500 
fine from Reds manager Davey Johnson. Browning entered the 1994 season 
healthy. However, during a start in San Diego on May 9, 1994, Browning's 
arm broke while delivering a pitch to Archi Cianfrocco. The injury was 
gruesome, with spectators and television viewers able to see Browning's 
arm separate from his shoulder, and hearing a "pop!" sound simultaneously. 
The injury was extreme, and he was done for the season. He attempted a 
comeback with the Kansas City Royals in 1995, pitching in two games at 
the major-league level, but he decided to take the season off and to continue 
rehabbing his arm. He entered camp with the Royals again in 1996 but retired 
before the season began. Browning retired with a 123–90 record, a 3.94 
ERA and 31 complete games. His 123 wins as a Red rank 12th on Cincinnati's 
all-time leaders list, and in December 2005, he led fan balloting wire-to-wire 
to become a 2006 Reds Hall of Famer. In February 2006, new Reds CEO Bob 
Castellini invited Browning to spring training as a special instructor. 
He broadcast Dayton Dragons games during the 2006 season, and has been 
announced as the pitching coach for the Dragons' upcoming 2012 season.[5] 
The Dragons are a Class-A affiliate of the Reds. In 2007, he was named 
the pitching coach for the Reds Rookie Advanced level Billings Mustangs 
farm club. Browning's book, Tom Browning's Tales from the Reds Dugout,[2] 
debuted in March 2006 and was co-authored by Reds employee Dann Stupp. 
On March 30, 2009, Browning was arrested for non-payment of child support 
and was held on $99,008.36 bail.[6] Italics denotes post-season perfect game
