Yankee Global Enterprises is an American company which owns the New York 
Yankees baseball team, along with 20% stakes in YES Network and the New 
York City FC soccer team. It was formed in 1999 and is controlled by the 
family of George Steinbrenner. Other investors including Lester Crown, 
Donald Keogh, Donald Marron and Jerry Speyer own minority stakes. The company 
was originally created as YankeeNets, through a merger between the Yankees 
and the Brooklyn Nets. In 1998, the Yankees had their most successful season 
in modern history, winning a combined total of 125 regular season and playoff 
games, culminating in a World Series championship. The team was in discussions 
to be sold to Cablevision, who at the time owned the broadcast rights to 
every MLB, NBA and NHL team in the New York City Metropolitan area. The 
proposed deal fell through because the two sides could not come to an agreement 
that would include George Steinbrenner continuing to run the team for the 
new owners.[citation needed] After the proposed sale fell through, the 
Yankees and Nets agreed to merge business operations, creating a combined 
holding company. This was done to increase the negotiating power of both 
teams for future television contracts and stadium and arena construction 
deals. The pre-merger owners would continue to control their teams, with 
a minority interest in the other team. This arrangement was approved by 
both Major League Baseball and the NBA. YankeeNets engaged in marketing 
agreements with the New York Giants football team and the British football 
powerhouse Manchester United, which resulted in exclusive Giants and Manchester 
United programming on the YES Network for a period of time. The company 
also created an affiliate, Puck Holdings, which purchased the New Jersey 
Devils ice hockey team, to have relationships in all major league professional 
sports, and to give better leverage to the Nets in constructing a new arena 
– the Prudential Center, which was ultimately built as the home of the 
Devils without the Nets involvement – in Newark. The Devils were later 
sold in 2004 to Jeffrey Vanderbeek, a minority share holder of Puck Holdings. 
With the Yankees' television contract with Cablevision expiring in 2001 
and the Nets' contract expiring after the 2001-2002 season, the teams negotiated 
together with potential cable partners for the next contract. They spoke 
to Cablevision about remaining on their networks, or creating a new network 
with them. Cablevision offered to pair both teams on their Fox Sports Net 
New York affiliate. YankeesNets also spoke to other cable companies, including 
Time Warner, about launching a new network with them. In the end, YankeeNets 
decided to pair with Goldman Sachs to launch their own regional sports 
network, the YES Network, which launched in March 2002, in preparation 
of the upcoming baseball season. Cablevision, after losing out on the broadcast 
rights, did not reach an agreement with YES for carriage on its system 
during the network's first year. The two sides did reach a temporary agreement 
in 2003, and a long-term deal about a year later. In 2003, reports leaked 
out about serious disagreements between the Yankees and Nets sides of the 
organization. The Yankee ownership in Tampa did not want any part in paying 
for an arena for the Nets and Devils, as the teams were money-losers. This 
led to the Nets being sold to Bruce Ratner, who intended to move the team 
to an arena in Brooklyn, New York, and the Devils being sold to businessman 
Jeffrey Vanderbeek, who moved the franchise to the Prudential Center in 
Newark, New Jersey as was originally proposed by the previous Nets ownership. 
The Nets sale did not include the team's stake in the YES Network, which 
remained with the pre-merger owners. Since the breakup, the Devils extended 
their television contract with Cablevision, ending the speculation that 
they would move to YES once their initial contract expired after the 2006-07 
hockey season. In 2004, with the exodus of the Nets and Devils complete, 
the company changed its name to Yankee Global Enterprises LLC, keeping 
the Yankees and the YES Network as separate entities owned by the same 
company. The legacy of YankeeNets is the YES Network, which allowed both 
the Yankees and Nets to dramatically increase their revenues. This allowed 
the Yankees to front the $800 million to construct their new Yankee Stadium.
