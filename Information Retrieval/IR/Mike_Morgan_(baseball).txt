Michael Thomas Morgan (born October 8, 1959) is a former right-handed pitcher 
in Major League Baseball. He played for twelve different teams over 25 
years, and is one of 29 players in baseball history to appear in Major 
League baseball games in four decades (1978–2002).[1] Upon his retirement, 
Morgan held the major league record for most major league teams played 
for (12), but this record was surpassed by Octavio Dotel in 2012.[2] Because 
of this, Morgan was nicknamed "The Nomad" by his teammates due to his constant 
travel from team to team.[3][4] After attending Valley High School in Las 
Vegas, Nevada and pitching for the baseball team, Morgan was selected by 
the Oakland Athletics on June 6, 1978 in the 1st Round (fourth overall) 
of the Major League Draft. Morgan made his major league debut on June 11, 
throwing a complete game in a 3-0 loss to Scott McGregor and the Baltimore 
Orioles.[5] After losing his first three starts in Oakland, Morgan was 
sent down to AAA Vancouver for the rest of the season, going 5-6 with a 
5.58 earned run average (ERA) in 92 innings pitched. Although he had put 
up less than spectacular numbers as an 18-year-old, including an alarming 
strikeout-to-walk ratio of 0.5:1 (31 strikeouts and 62 walks), he was clearly 
on the fast track. After starting the 1979 season with the AAA Ogden A's, 
Morgan was called up again to the big club after posting a 5-5 record with 
a 3.48 ERA in 101 innings. However, he again appeared overmatched, finishing 
the season 2-10 for the A's. Morgan then spent the next two seasons in 
the minor leagues. After finishing another unspectacular season in 1980, 
going 6-9 back at Ogden, Oakland traded Morgan on November 3 to the New 
York Yankees for 33-year-old infielder, Fred Stanley.[6] Thus was the start 
of Morgan's vagabond career. The Yankees then demoted Morgan and assigned 
him to AA Nashville where he posted an 8-7 record with a 4.42 ERA in 169 
innings.[7] In 1982, Morgan pitched the entire season for the Yankees, 
pitching in 30 games with 23 starts. On December 9, Morgan was traded again, 
this time to the Toronto Blue Jays (along with outfielder/first baseman 
Dave Collins and future all star first baseman Fred McGriff) for minor 
league third baseman Tom Dodd and reliever Dale Murray. Morgan then split 
time between Toronto and AAA Syracuse in 1983 before spending the entire 
1984 season at Syracuse. In December 1984, Morgan was taken off the Blue 
Jays' 40-man roster and was subsequently chosen by the Seattle Mariners 
in the Rule 5 draft. After losing much of 1985 to arm trouble, Morgan spent 
most of the next three seasons pitching for Seattle and compiling similar 
numbers to his career average, going 24-35 with a 4.53 over 429 innings 
with 216 strikeouts and 144 walks. In a hint of later career success, Morgan 
collected his first career save in 1986. Although showing himself to be 
a solidly average starting pitcher, he would continue to struggle with 
his control, annually putting up dismal strikeouts-to-walk ratios, and 
failing to show the promise that made him a first round selection. On December 
9, Morgan was traded to the Baltimore Orioles for righty starter Ken Dixon 
and split 1988 season between Baltimore and AAA Rochester. That year he 
was recognized for his humanitarian work by winning the Little League's 
Junior Cy Young Award. Morgan was traded to his sixth franchise in March, 
in a trade with the Los Angeles Dodgers for center fielder Mike Devereaux, 
and remained with the team from 1989–91. He had his first winning season 
as a pro in 1991 and earned his lone All-Star selection while finishing 
a 14–10 record. Morgan also led the National League with four shutouts 
in 1990, tied with the San Diego Padres' Bruce Hurst. On July 28, he was 
at the losing end of Montreal Expos pitcher Dennis Martínez's perfect game, 
even though Morgan himself was perfect through the first five innings. 
After leaving Los Angeles as a free agent, Morgan signed with the Chicago 
Cubs from 1992–95. In 1992, Morgan finishing the season 16–8 with a 2.55 
ERA over 240 innings – easily the best season of his career. However, he 
could not repeat his efforts and went 12-25 over the next two seasons after 
again experiencing arm trouble. After seeming to bounce back in the beginning 
of 1995, starting the season 2-1 with a 2.19 ERA for the Cubs, he was traded 
to the St. Louis Cardinals (along with minor leaguer catcher Francisco 
Morales and first baseman/third baseman Paul Torres) for third baseman 
Todd Zeile and cash, and went 5-6 in 17 starts the rest of the way. In 
1996, Morgan would return to his previous form, posting a 4-8 record with 
a 5.24 ERA, and was released by the Cardinals on August 28. He would not 
be unemployed long as he signed with the Cincinnati Reds on September 4 
and spent the remainder of the 1996 and all of 1997 with the Reds. After 
leaving the Reds as a free Agent, Morgan signed in December 1997 with the 
Minnesota Twins. After putting up good numbers with the Twins through August 
(4-2 with a 3.49 ERA and only 24 walks in 98 innings), Morgan was traded 
on August 25 back to the Cubs for pitcher Scott Downs and cash. While with 
the Cubs, he was on the mound when Mark McGwire hit his record-tying 61st 
home run. He also went to the post-season for the first time, relieving 
in two games without giving up a run, but the Cubs lost to the Atlanta 
Braves in the National League Division Series. On January 29, 1999, Morgan 
joined his 11th team, signing with the Texas Rangers as a free agent. Although 
he pitched to a 13-10 record, he had an ERA of 6.24 and was demoted to 
the bullpen late in the season. Prior to spring training in 2000, the 40-year-old 
signed with his 12th team, the Arizona Diamondbacks, who successfully converted 
Morgan to a full-time reliever. Morgan excelled in this new role and appeared 
in 60 games, pitched 100 innings, and compiled an ERA that was only slightly 
above career average. After pitching in 31 games in 2001, including his 
last career start, Morgan was again in the post-season with the D-backs, 
appeared in all three rounds, and threw 4 2/3 innings of scoreless relief 
helping Arizona defeat the New York Yankees in seven games to win the 2001 
World Series. He was back with Arizona again in 2002 and pitched 28 games 
over the first three months before being sidelined by an injury. He came 
back to make the final appearance of his career on September 2, pitching 
1 1/3 innings and giving up an unearned run in a 19-1 loss to the Dodgers.[8] 
Morgan finished the season 1-1 with a 5.29 ERA and was not included on 
the D-Backs' post-season roster. Following the season, Morgan retired from 
baseball after 21 seasons. Morgan was the last active player to have competed 
during the 1978 season and one of the last four (the others being Jesse 
Orosco, Rickey Henderson and Tim Raines) to have debuted in the 1970s. 
In the 597 games Morgan pitched, 411 were starts. His career record was 
141-186 with a 4.23 ERA with 1403 strikeouts and eight saves in 2772 1/3 
innings. Morgan was tied with National Hockey League player Mike Sillinger 
and MLB pitcher Matt Skrmetta for the most teams played for in any North 
American professional sport through June 2006, when Skrmetta signed with 
the Chicago White Sox, his 24th professional team and 13th organization.[9] 
Morgan currently resides in Ogden, Utah and owns "World Championship Outfitters", 
a company which takes people on private hunts with Morgan as the guide. 
In 2010, he created the "Robinson's Transport Wounded Warrior Hunt", a 
hunting trip for military members who have received a Purple Heart.[3] 
He also instructs youth baseball players one-on-one through the company 
"Ultimate Sports". From 2009 to 2010, he was a volunteer coach on the Pleasant 
Grove High School baseball team in Pleasant Grove, Utah. From 2011 to 2012,
