As player As manager George Albert Wood (November 9, 1858 – April 4, 1924), 
also known as "Dandy" Wood, was a Canadian-born professional baseball player 
and manager whose career spanned from 1878 to 1896. He played 13 seasons 
of Major League Baseball, primarily as an outfielder, for the Worcester 
Ruby Legs (1880), Detroit Wolverines (1881–85), Philadelphia Quakers (1886–89), 
Philadelphia Athletics (1890–91), Baltimore Orioles (1889, 1892), and Cincinnati 
Reds (1892). In 1891, he served as both a player and the manager of the 
Athletics. Wood was born in Pownal, Prince Edward Island, Canada, in 1858.[1] 
He was the son of Joseph A. Wood and Mary Ann Jenkins and is believed to 
be the first major league player from Prince Edward Island, and one of 
only three in major history, along with Henry Oxley and Vern Handrahan. 
Wood moved with his family to East Boston as a child in 1867.[2][3] Wood 
began his professional baseball career in 1878 and 1879 playing for teams 
in Worcester, Massachusetts, and Manchester, New Hampshire. His batting 
average in 1879 was .368.[4] In December 1879, he travelled to Havana as 
the left fielder of the first American team to play a Cuban all-star team.[3] 
In 1880, the Worcester baseball club became known as the Worcester Ruby 
Legs and was admitted to the National League. Wood made his major league 
debut with Worcester on May 1, 1880. On May 7, 1880, he initiated a triple 
play.[3] Wood appeared in 81 of 83 games in Worcester's inaugural major 
league season, with 80 of those games being as an outfielder. Playing against 
National League competition, Wood's batting average dropped from .368 in 
1879 to .245 in 1880. Wood played well defensively, however, and his .887 
fielding percentage was the fifth highest among all of the league's outfielders.[1] 
Wood also participated in an early integrated baseball game. The Chicago 
Tribune reported on the game as follows: "A very singular contest took 
place at New Orleans‚ La.‚ on April 4‚ 1880‚ when five Northern professionals 
succeeded in defeating the colored professional nine of that city by a 
score of 17 to 3." According to the account reported 14 months later in 
the Chicago Tribune of July 1881‚ Tim Keefe pitched‚ Charlie Bennett caught‚ 
John Sullivan played first base‚ while Wood and George Creamer "were entrusted 
with the onerous task of filling the other six positions."[5] In 1881, 
the National League admitted a new club in Detroit, Michigan, which became 
known as the Detroit Wolverines. Frank Bancroft, who had been Wood's manager 
in Worcester, was hired as the manager of the new club, and Wood quickly 
agreed to join Bancroft in Detroit.[6] Wood joined the Wolverines for their 
inaugural season in 1881 and remained a starter for the club through the 
1885 season.[1] On May 2, 1881, Wood hit a triple, scored a run, and turned 
a double play in the first major league baseball game ever played in Detroit.[7] 
By the end of the 1881 season, Wood ranked among the National League leaders 
with nine triples (3rd), 29 extra base hits (8th), 142 total bases (9th), 
100 hits (10th), and a .421 slugging percentage (10th). The following year, 
in 1882, Wood was the National League's home run champion with seven home 
runs and ranked second in the league with 12 triples. He also led the league's 
outfielders with eight double plays turned from the outfield and ranked 
fifth among the league's outfielders with an .884 fielding percentage.[1] 
Wood's eight double plays in 1882 tied Ned Hanlon for the major league 
record.[8] Wood had the best season of his career in 1883. That year, he 
compiled a .302 batting average with 26 doubles, 11 triples, five home 
runs, and 47 RBIs. He also showed range in the outfield and led the league's 
outfielders with 226 outfield putouts. Applying the sabermetric measure 
of Wins Above Replacement (WAR), Wood's performance in 1883 rated a 3.3, 
the highest of his career. He continued to have strong seasons in 1884 
and 1885 with WAR ratings of 2.1 and 2.4. He would rate above a 2.0 WAR 
rating only one other time in his career—a 2.8 rating in 1891.[1] On June 
12, 1885, Wood became the third player in National League history (and 
the eighth in any major league) to hit for the cycle. In November 1885, 
Wood was returned to the control of the National League and was claimed 
in January 1886 by the Philadelphia Quakers. Wood played four seasons for 
the Quakers from 1886 to 1889, compiling a .262 batting average with 80 
doubles, 44 triples, 29 home runs, 220 RBIs and 65 stolen bases. Wood was 
released by the Quakers on September 24, 1889, and appeared in three games 
for the Baltimore Orioles in the final week of the season.[1] On opening 
day in 1887, he hit the first home run at the new Philadelphia ball park 
dubbed the Baker Bowl.[3] During the winter after the 1888 season, Wood 
was part of the All-America baseball team that travelled around the world 
playing a series of games against the Chicago White Stockings. The teams 
played games in Hawaii, New Zealand, Australia, Ceylon, Egypt, Italy, France, 
England, and Ireland and met with President Benjamin Harrison at the White 
House when they returned to the United States in April 1889.[3][9] In 1890, 
Wood jumped to the Players' League, playing for the Philadelphia Athletics. 
Wood compiled a .289 batting average with 20 doubles, 14 triples, nine 
home runs, 102 RBIs and 20 stolen bases in the Players' League. He also 
led the league with 35 outfield assists.[1] The Players' League disbanded 
after the 1890 season, but the Philadelphia club was admitted to the American 
Association. Wood stayed with the club and also served as the team's manager 
in 1891. He led the team to 67-55 record and batted for a career high .309 
average, eighth best in the league. He was also among the league's leaders 
with 14 triples, (8th), 242 times on base (8th), and a .399 on-base percentage 
(9th).[1] The 1892 season was Wood's last in the major leagues. He played 
parts of the season for both the Baltimore Orioles (21 games) and the Cincinnati 
Reds (30 games).[1] After his playing career was over, Wood served as an 
umpire for a time.[2] He died in 1924 at Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, at age 
65.[1] He has been posthumously inducted into the Prince Edward Island 
Hall of Fame (2009) and the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame (2011).[2][10]
