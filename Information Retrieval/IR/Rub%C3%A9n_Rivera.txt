Rubén Rivera Moreno (born November 14, 1973) is a Panamanian professional 
baseball player for the Pericos de Puebla of the Mexican Baseball League. 
He played Major League Baseball for five different teams, from 1995 to 
2003. His cousin, Mariano Rivera, was the former long-time closer for the 
New York Yankees. With the Yankees, he won the 1996 World Series over the 
world champion Atlanta Braves. Rivera was signed by the New York Yankees 
in 1990. He made his professional debut with the Gulf Coast Yankees in 
1992 and his major league debut with the Yankees on September 3, 1995. 
Rivera was highly touted as a prospect,[1] being ranked as high as second 
overall amongst prospects by Baseball America in 1995, third in 1996, and 
ninth in 1997.[2] He played in 46 games for the 1996 New York Yankees. 
Though he was added to the postseason roster, Rivera only appeared in the 
1996 American League Division Series during the 1996 postseason. On April 
22, 1997, he was traded with pitcher Rafael Medina and US $3 million to 
the San Diego Padres for infielder Homer Bush and minor leaguer Gordon 
Amerson and two players to be named later, who turned out to be the highly 
anticipated Japanese pitcher Hideki Irabu and minor leaguer Vernon Maxwell. 
It was supposed to be a deal to help both teams, but Irabu was a major 
disappointment for the Yankees, and Rivera turned out to be at least a 
minor disappointment for the Padres, as he was never able to get on base 
on a regular basis during his four seasons in the Padres organization, 
mostly with the parent team (including as a starter in 2000 and 2001), 
and his considerable power did not sufficiently compensate for that major 
failing. He was released shortly before the 2001 season. The Cincinnati 
Reds signed Rivera for the 2001 season, but he did not perform any better 
for the Reds in a reserve role than he did the Padres. They waived him 
after the season, and the San Francisco Giants picked him up, but released 
him a month later without his having played a game for them. Early in 2002, 
the Yankees signed him as a free agent, but released him during spring 
training after Rivera took teammate Derek Jeter's glove and bat, and then 
sold them to a sports memorabilia dealer, reportedly for $2,500.[3] After 
this became known, his teammates allegedly voted him off the team, and 
the Yankees released him. When the incident became public, Rivera apologized 
but criticized the team after being removed.[4] The Texas Rangers signed 
him for the 2002 season. He performed poorly for them in a reserve role 
and was released immediately following the season. In 2003, Rivera re-joined 
the Giants as a free agent. He was involved in an infamous baserunning 
gaffe in a 13-inning 4–3 win over the Arizona Diamondbacks at Pacific Bell 
Park on May 27. Representing the potential winning run as a pinch runner 
for Andrés Galarraga at first base with a 2–2 score and one out, Rivera 
advanced to second base but reversed course two steps beyond it thinking 
that the ball hit by Marquis Grissom to deep right-center field was caught 
by right fielder David Dellucci. Realizing that Dellucci had muffed the 
ball for an error, he ran past second base, returned to retouch it, headed 
to third and attempted to score when second baseman Junior Spivey's relay 
throw bounced off third baseman Alex Cintrón's glove and towards shortstop 
Tony Womack, who threw out the sliding Rivera at home plate.[5] Rivera's 
actions were proclaimed by Giants broadcaster Jon Miller as "the worst 
baserunning in the history of the game."[6] Rivera was released a week 
later, after hitting only .180 in 50 at bats. Rivera signed with the Baltimore 
Orioles in July 2003, and played for them in the minors.[7] The Chicago 
White Sox signed Rivera to play for the Triple-A Charlotte Knights for 
2006, where despite hitting 16 home runs, he batted only .239. He played 
for the Piratas de Campeche from 2007-2012, switched to Delfines de Ciudad 
del Carmen in 2013. In 2014 has arrived to Rieleros de Aguascalientes to 
play Center Field. Rivera played in both the 2006 and 2009 World Baseball 
Classic for Panama's national team. He is a combined 3 for 16 with 1 home
