Jeffrey Michael Blauser (born November 8, 1965 in Los Gatos, California) 
is a former Major League Baseball shortstop. He played for the Atlanta 
Braves and Chicago Cubs from 1987 to 1999. Blauser went to Placer High 
School in Auburn, California and Sacramento City College. He was selected 
by the Braves in the first round (4th pick) of the 1984 June amateur draft 
(secondary phase) and made his major league debut on July 5, 1987. Blauser 
was a powerful right-handed shortstop at 6' 0", 170Â lb. He hit well for 
a middle infielder but was shaky with the glove, which often led him to 
be replaced on the field in the later innings.[1] In 1993, Blauser had 
a breakout season, batting over .300 for the first time and scoring 110 
runs. He was also named to the All-Star team. During the next few seasons, 
Blauser's production suffered. He made 23 errors in 1996 and spent half 
the season on the disabled list. He came back in 1997, however, batting 
.308 with 17 home runs and 70 runs batted in. He was an All-Star for the 
second time and also won the Silver Slugger Award for National League shortstops. 
After the season, Blauser signed with the Cubs. In two years with them, 
he struggled with injuries and batted under .230. He was released in October 
1999. Blauser retired with a lifetime batting average of .262 and 122 home 
runs. He managed the Mississippi Braves, the AA affiliate of the Atlanta
