In 1991, the Atlanta Braves became the first team in the National League 
to go from last place one year to first place the next. This feat was also 
accomplished by the 1991 Minnesota Twins. The last Major League Baseball 
team to accomplish this was the 1890 Louisville Colonels of the American 
Association. The Braves had a last place finish in 1990 but managed to 
overtake the Los Angeles Dodgers for first place in the National League 
West clinching the division on the next to the last day of the regular 
season.[1][2] Infielders Coaches Note: Pos = position; G = Games played;
