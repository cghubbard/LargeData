Tony Danza (born Antonio Salvatore Iadanza; April 21, 1951)[1] is an Italian-American 
actor and former professional boxer. He is best known for starring on the 
TV series Taxi and Who's the Boss?, for which he was nominated for an Emmy 
Award and four Golden Globe Awards. In 1998, Danza won the People's Choice 
Award for Favorite Male Performer in a New Television Series for his work 
on the 1997 sitcom The Tony Danza Show (not to be confused with his 2004-2006 
daytime variety talk show of the same name). Danza was born in Brooklyn, 
New York,[1] to parents Anne Cammisa (1925–1993) and Matty Iadanza (1920–1983) 
[2] His mother was a bookkeeper and his father worked as a waste collector 
in Brooklyn.[1][3] Danza's father was an American of Italian ancestry and 
Danza's mother was an immigrant from the town of Campobello di Mazara in 
the Sicilian province of Trapani.[2][4] He has a younger brother, Matty 
Jr. (born 1954), a Los Angeles restaurant owner.[5] When Danza was 14, 
he and his family relocated to Malverne, New York, on Long Island. Danza 
attended Malverne High School, graduating in 1969.[6] In the first episode 
of his show Teach: Tony Danza, Danza describes himself as a "bad student" 
in high school. He earned a bachelor's degree in history in 1972 from the 
University of Dubuque,[7] which he attended on a wrestling scholarship. 
In 1975, as a joke, Danza's friends entered him in the New York City Golden 
Gloves. After knocking out his first six opponents all in the first round, 
Danza was knocked out in the finals.[8] During his first year of college, 
he had the Robert Crumb "Keep on Truckin'" character tattooed on his upper 
right arm. In a 1985 interview in Us Weekly magazine, Danza remarked, "I 
was playing pool with a guy who had all these tattoos, and I wanted to 
be friends."[9] Danza also sports a "Keep Punching" boxing gloves tattoo 
on his right shoulder as well as "Tracy", his (former) wife's name, on 
his chest.[10] In college, Danza met and married his first wife. Danza 
was a professional boxer with a 9–3(9 knockouts, 7 in the first round) 
record, with all but one of his fights, wins and losses, ending in a knockout.[11] 
He was ordained by the Universal Life Church, and has been an ordained 
minister for many years.[12] Shortly after his college graduation, Danza 
was discovered by a producer at a boxing gymnasium in New York.[13] He 
then earned a spot on the television show Taxi. Danza is better known for 
his roles on Taxi, in which he played a cab driver and part-time boxer 
Tony Banta, and Who's the Boss?, in which he portrayed retired baseball 
player, housekeeper and single father Tony Micelli. For his contribution 
to the television industry, in 1988, Danza was honored with a star on the 
Hollywood Walk of Fame at 7000 Hollywood Boulevard. Danza also plays the 
role of a baseball player in Angels in the Outfield (1994). Danza also 
starred in the short-lived sitcoms Hudson Street (1995) and The Tony Danza 
Show (1997), not to be confused with his 2004-2006 talk show, The Tony 
Danza Show. He had a role in the TV drama Family Law from 2000 until 2002. 
He was nominated for an Emmy Award[14] for a guest-starring 1998 role in 
the TV series The Practice. His movie debut was in the comedy The Hollywood 
Knights (1980), which was followed by Going Ape! (1981). He received critical 
acclaim for his performance in the 1999 Broadway revival of the Eugene 
O'Neill play The Iceman Cometh. In 2002, Danza released his debut album 
The House I Live In as a 1950s-style crooner.[15] Danza hosted his own 
TV talk show, The Tony Danza Show, that was produced each weekday morning 
in his hometown of New York and was syndicated across the US. On May 9, 
2005, during a go-kart race with NASCAR star Rusty Wallace, who was a guest 
on the show, Danza's kart flipped after Wallace accidentally bumped him.[16] 
Neither he nor Wallace was wearing a helmet at the time, but both were 
uninjured. Danza returned to go-kart racing on October 20, 2005, to challenge 
IndyCar driver Danica Patrick, but his brakes malfunctioned and he skidded 
into a wall, unharmed. His daytime talk show ended in May 2006; the last 
live episode aired on May 26, 2006.[citation needed] He starred on Broadway 
as "Max Bialystock" in The Producers, from December 19, 2006, to March 
11, 2007[17] and reprised his role at the Paris Las Vegas from August 13, 
2007,[18] to February 9, 2008.[19] In September 2008, it was reported that 
Danza would host the 4th season of The Contender, which was filmed in Singapore 
and began airing in December 2008 on the Versus TV sports channel.[20] 
In August 2009, it was reported that Danza would appear in a new A&E reality 
show Teach: Tony Danza, in which he would co-instruct a 10th Grade English 
class at Northeast High School in Philadelphia. The series was filmed during 
the 2009-2010 school year and premiered on October 1, 2010. The book I'd 
Like to Apologize to Every Teacher I Ever Had: My Year as a Rookie Teacher 
at Northeast High, which was released in 2012, was based on his year of 
teaching. A Broadway adaptation of 1992 film Honeymoon in Vegas opened 
on a pre-Broadway run at New Jersey's Paper Mill Playhouse on September 
26, 2013, co-starring Danza and Tony nominee Rob McClure with Gary Griffin 
directing.[21] Danza was inducted into the Ride of Fame in December 2014 
and the double decker sightseeing bus commemorated his role in the Broadway 
musical.[22] Tony Danza has a son, Marc, from his first marriage, to Rhonda 
Yeoman, whom he wed in 1970 and divorced in 1974. He and Yeoman have a 
daughter, Gina, from a reconciliation in 1983.[23] In 1986 Danza married 
Tracy Robinson. The couple separated in 2006 and filed for divorce on March 
10, 2011; the divorce was finalized on February 6, 2013.[24][25] They have 
two daughters, Katherine (born 1987) and Emily (born 1993). In 2008, Danza 
and his son Marc published a cookbook, Don't Fill Up on the Antipasto:
