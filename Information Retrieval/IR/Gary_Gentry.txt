Gary Edward Gentry (born October 6, 1946 in Phoenix, Arizona), is a former 
right-handed pitcher in Major League Baseball, who played seven seasons 
for the New York Mets and Atlanta Braves between 1969 and 1975. Gentry 
went to Arizona State University and began his professional baseball career 
at age 22 in 1969. As a rookie, he won 13 games, pitching in a rotation 
with Tom Seaver and Jerry Koosman for a Mets team that won the World Series, 
4 games to 1, over the Baltimore Orioles. On September 24, Gentry pitched 
a four-hit, 6–0 shutout against the St. Louis Cardinals to clinch the National 
League East title for the Mets, who had trailed the Chicago Cubs by 9 1⁄2 
games on August 13. Gentry was the starting pitcher for the Mets in Game 
3 of the National League Championship Series against the Atlanta Braves 
on October 6, his 23rd birthday. Gentry struggled in the game, but the 
Mets won, 7–4, to clinch the pennant. A two-run homer by Wayne Garrett 
put New York ahead to stay. On October 14, Gentry was the winning pitcher 
in Game 3 of the World Series. Gentry hit a two-run double in this game, 
which was highlighted by Tommie Agee's two spectacular catches that prevented 
five Oriole runs. Nolan Ryan relieved Gentry in that game, pitching 2 1⁄3 
scoreless innings for the save in what would be the only World Series appearance 
of Ryan's 27-year career. Eight days earlier, Ryan was the winning pitcher 
in relief of Gentry in the final NLCS game. Gentry pitched for the Mets 
for the next three seasons. He won 28 games during this period as the Mets 
finished third in the National League East each year. Gentry's November 
1972 trade to Atlanta was soon followed by an elbow injury.[1] He played 
his last game for the Braves on May 6, 1975 and was waived two days later.[2] 
Gentry was re-signed by the Mets, but was released on June 19.[3] During
