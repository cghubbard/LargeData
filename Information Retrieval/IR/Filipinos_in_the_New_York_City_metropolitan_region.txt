Ricans Russians Filipinos in the New York City metropolitan region constitute 
one of the fastest growing ethnicities in the New York City metropolitan 
area of the United States, attracted to the area's massive population and 
its attendant economic opportunities and cultural offerings. By 2014 Census 
estimates, the New York City-Northern New Jersey-Long Island, NY-NJ-CT-PA 
Combined Statistical Area was home to 262,375 Filipino Americans,[1] 221,612 
(84.5%) of them uniracial Filipinos.[2] Filipinos are relatively recent 
arrivals to New York City, with no significant presence before the 1920s.[3] 
In 1927, one of the first Filipino civic organizations in New York City, 
the Filipino Women's Club, was founded.[4] In 1960, there were only 2,744 
Filipino Americans in New York City.[5] In 1970, there were 14,279 Filipinos 
in New York State, 52.4% of whom were college graduates.[6] Filipinos in 
the New York City metropolitan area also did not enjoy the early advantage 
of their counterparts on the West Coast of the United States in terms of 
perceived geographic proximity to the Philippines by marine and air routes. 
Also in the 1990s, Philippine Airlines, which had provided service to Newark 
Liberty International Airport, discontinued this service due to financial 
difficulties. However, the determined Filipino American communities of 
the New York City metropolitan region ultimately overcame these obstacles 
in conjunction with the sheer number of opportunities provided by the region 
for Filipinos to work and thrive as a highly achieving, ambitious, and 
rapidly growing presence, first within the New York City region's Asian 
American milieu and eventually amidst its mainstream population. Filipino 
Americans started working in the traditional nursing and healthcare fields 
in the region's numerous hospitals and clinics,[7] before branching out 
to other professional fields.[8] In the East Village and the Lower East 
Side, Manhattan, there was significant Filipino migration in the late 1980s 
due to mass recruitment of Filipino medical professionals to area hospitals, 
notably New York Eye and Ear Infirmary, St. Vincent's Hospital, and Beth 
Israel Medical Center. Migration was spurred by the hospitals' offer of 
subsidized housing to employees, in the midst of ongoing rent strikes in 
the neighborhood. The burgeoning Little Manila centered on 1st Avenue and 
14th Street, around which there were, at the peak, a number of grocery/video 
rental stores and Filipino restaurants within a few blocks of one another. 
Filipino American community relations were strengthened by local Roman 
Catholic churches in the East Village and Gramercy Park areas. As rents 
increased, and properties were taken over by New York University, the number 
of Filipinos and Filipino businesses in the East Village's Little Manila 
waned. Elvie's Turo-Turo, the longest standing Filipino business in the 
area, closed in late 2009 after almost 20 years of operation. New Filipino 
businesses continue to sprout up.[9] In the 1970s and '80s, Filipinos in 
the New Jersey and New York metropolitan region had a higher socioeconomic 
status than Filipinos elsewhere, as more than half of Filipino immigrants 
to the metropolitan area were healthcare professionals or other highly 
trained professionals, in contrast to established working-class Filipino 
American populations elsewhere.[10] In 1990, there were 43,229 Filipinos 
in New York City, with the number increasing to around 50,000 in 2000.[3] 
The borough of Queens is home to the largest concentration of Filipinos 
within New York City,[3] with about 38,000 Filipinos per the 2010 Census.[11] 
In 2011, New York City was home to an estimated 82,313 Filipinos, representing 
a 7.7% increase from the estimated 77,191 in 2008, with 56%, or about 46,000, 
living in Queens.[12] The Filipino median household income in New York 
City was $81,929 in 2013, and 68% held a bachelor's degree or higher.[12] 
In 2008, the New York metropolitan area was home to 215,000 Filipinos.[13] 
By the 2010 Census, within the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island, 
NY-NJ-PA MSA, there were 217,349 Filipino Americans,[14] with an additional 
15,631 in the greater New York-Newark-Bridgeport, NY-NJ-CT-PA CSA.[14] 
As of 2011, over 150,000 Filipino-born immigrants resided in the New York 
City metropolitan region.[15] In 2013, 4,098 Filipinos legally immigrated 
to the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island, NY-NJ-PA core based statistical 
area;[16] in 2012, this number was 4,879;[17] 4,177 in 2011;[18] 4,047 
in 2010,[19] 4,400 in 2009,[20] and 5,985 in 2005.[21] These numerical 
values do not include the remainder of the New York-Newark-Bridgeport, 
NY-NJ-CT-PA Combined Statistical Area. Philippine Airlines has resumed 
service to the New York City region since March 2015, with direct, one-seat 
service to Manila, this time utilizing JFK International Airport as its 
gateway.[22] Little Manilas have emerged in the New York City metropolitan 
area, located in Woodside, Queens;[23][24] Jersey City, New Jersey;[25] 
and Bergenfield, New Jersey;[26] in addition to smaller Filipino American 
subenclaves developing throughout the metropolitan region. Woodside, Queens 
is known for its concentration of Filipinos.[23] Of Woodside's 85,000 residents, 
about 13,000 are of Filipino background, comprising 15% of Woodside's population.[27] 
Filipino restaurants dominate the area, as well as several freight delivery 
and remittance centers scattered throughout the neighborhood.[23] Other 
Filipino-owned businesses including professional services (medical, dental, 
optical), driving schools, beauty salons, immigration services, and Filipino 
video rental places are present in the community.[23] Along the IRT Flushing 
Line (7 train), known colloquially as the Orient Express,[28] the 69th 
Street station serves as the gateway to Queens' largest Little Manila. 
This area attracts many local Filipinos and non-Filipinos alike and from 
neighboring places on Long Island. The coverage of Little Manila is along 
Roosevelt Avenue, between 58th and 74th Streets.[23] Elsewhere in Queens, 
Filipinos are also concentrated in Jackson Heights and Elmhurst.[29] There 
are also smaller Filipino communities in Jamaica, Queens and parts of Brooklyn. 
The Benigno Aquino Triangle is located on Hillside Avenue in Hollis, Queens 
to commemorate the slain Filipino political leader and to recognize the 
large Filipino American population in the area.[30] In February 2008, the 
Bayanihan Filipino Community Center opened its doors in Woodside, a project 
spearheaded by the Philippine Forum.[31] The Philippine Forum also hosts 
the annual Bayanihan Cultural Festival at the Hart Playground in September 
in commemoration of Filipino American History Month.[32] The Philippine 
Consulate of New York has a multipurpose role – aside from its governmental 
duties and functions, it also caters to many events of the Filipino American 
community and even has a school called Paaralan sa Konsulado (School at 
the Consulate), which teaches newer-generation Filipino Americans about 
their culture and language.[33] The consulate is known as the Philippine 
Center. The Philippine Center's large edifice is situated on Fifth Avenue 
in Manhattan and is open to the public on business days and closed on Philippine 
and American holidays. The building itself is considered as the largest 
foreign consulate on the strip of the avenue.[34] The Archdiocese of New 
York designated a chapel named after the first Filipino Saint Lorenzo Ruiz 
de Manila for the Filipino Apostolate. Officially designated as the "Church 
of Filipinos," the Chapel of San Lorenzo Ruiz in Lower Manhattan is only 
the third in the world and the first in the United States dedicated as 
such.[35] Long Island, with its vibrant and burgeoning Asian American populations 
including Chinese Americans, Indian Americans, Korean Americans, and Vietnamese 
Americans, now adds the relatively recent growth of Filipino Americans 
as well, following the overall eastward expansion from Queens into Nassau 
and Suffolk counties.[36][37] Northern and Central New Jersey are home 
to significant overseas Filipino populations, numbering at more than 100,000 
statewide, according to the 2010 U.S. Census. While Filipinos can be found 
across the state, the commercial districts catering to the Filipino community 
are found mostly in the state's urban areas. State and local governments 
in the Garden State have significant numbers of employees of Filipino background, 
and they play a vital role in the state's affairs, issues, commerce, and 
health care.[citation needed] Filipino enclaves exist in Jersey City, Bergenfield, 
Paterson, Passaic, Union City, Elizabeth, and most recently, Edison.[38] 
The Meadowlands Exposition Center in Secaucus hosts the annual Philippine 
Fiesta, a cultural festival that draws Filipinos and non-Filipinos alike 
from across the New York metropolitan area. The event takes place on the 
weekend of the second week of August.[38] Bergen County, Hudson County, 
Middlesex County,[39] and Passaic County have developed in Northern and 
Central New Jersey as popular destinations for Filipino Americans. Within 
Bergen County, Bergenfield, along with Paramus, Hackensack,[40] New Milford, 
Dumont,[41] Fair Lawn, and Teaneck,[42] have become growing hubs for Filipino 
Americans.[according to whom?] Taken as a whole, these municipalities are 
home to a significant proportion of Bergen County's Philippine population.[43][44][45][46] 
A census-estimated 20,859 Filipino Americans resided in Bergen County as 
of 2013,[47] embodying an increase from the 19,155 counted in 2010.[48] 
The Philippine-American Community of Bergen County (PACBC) organization 
is based in Paramus,[49] while other Filipino organizations are based in 
Fair Lawn[41][50][51] and Bergenfield.[52] Bergen County's vibrant and 
culturally active Filipino community repatriated significant financial 
assistance to victims of Typhoon Haiyan, which ravaged the Philippines 
in November 2013.[41] In Hudson County, Jersey City is home to the largest 
Filipino population in New Jersey, with over 16,000 Filipinos in 2010.[25][53] 
Holy Name Medical Center in Teaneck, Bergen County, launched its Filipino 
Medical Program in December 2015.[54] Seven per cent (7%) of Jersey City's 
population is Filipino.[55] The Five Corners district has a thriving Filipino 
community, which is the largest Asian-American subgroup in the city.[citation 
needed] Newark Avenue's strip of Filipino culture and commerce is significantly 
large and growing. A variety of Filipino restaurants, shippers and freighters, 
doctors' officers, bakeries, stores, and even an office of The Filipino 
Channel made Newark Avenue their home. The largest Filipino owned grocery 
store on the east coast Phil-Am Food has been there since 1973.[citation 
needed] An array of Filipino-owned businesses can also be found in Jersey 
City's West Side section, where many of its residents are of Filipino descent. 
In 2006, a Red Ribbon pastry shop opened its first branch on the East Coast 
in the Garden State.[56] Manila Avenue in Downtown Jersey City was named 
for the Philippine city because of the many Filipinos who built their homes 
on this street during the 1970s. A memorial, dedicated to the Filipino 
American veterans of the Vietnam War, was built in a small square on Manila 
Avenue. A park and statue dedicated to Jose P. Rizal, the national hero 
of the Philippines, exists in downtown Jersey City.[57] Jersey City is 
the host of the annual Philippine-American Friendship Day Parade, an event 
that occurs yearly in June, on its last Sunday. The City Hall of Jersey 
City raises the Philippine flag in correlation to this event and as a tribute 
to the contributions of the Filipino community. The Santakrusan Procession 
along Manila Avenue has taken place since 1977.[58] In 2011, Rolando Lavarro, 
Jr., became the first Filipino American to win an elective position in 
Jersey City as city council member, and in 2013, Lavarro became the first 
Filipino American council president of Jersey City. Several Filipinos have 
been appointed to various Jersey City municipal posts and commissions.[59] 
Bergenfield is informally known as the Little Manila of Bergen County, 
with a significant concentration of Filipino residents and businesses. 
Between 2000 and 2010, the Filipino-American population of Bergenfield 
grew from 11.7 percent, or 3,081 residents, to 17.1 percent, or 4,569.[60] 
In 2014, Filipino-born attorney Arvin Amatorio was elected a borough councilman;[60] 
while in the late 1990s, Bergenfield had become the first municipality 
on the East Coast of the United States to elect a Filipino mayor, Robert 
C. Rivas.[61] Also in Bergen County, Jonathan Wong was elected city councilman 
in Mahwah in November 2014.[59] The annual Filipino American Festival is 
held in Bergenfield.[62] Edison, in Middlesex County, New Jersey, has emerged 
as a growing hub for Filipinos since 2000.[38] A significant number of 
Filipinos in Middlesex County work in the burgeoning healthcare and other 
life-science disciplines at Central Jersey's numerous medical and pharmaceutical 
institutions. The annual Philippine Independence Day Parade is traditionally 
held on the first Sunday of June on Madison Avenue in Manhattan.[3] The 
parade is said to be one of the largest parades of any kind in the city 
and the largest Philippine celebration in the United States. This celebration 
is a combination of a parade and a street fair. Madison Avenue is replete 
on this day with Filipino culture, colors, and people and is attended by 
many significant political figures, entertainers, civic groups, etc. Former 
Mayor Rudy Giuliani and Senator Charles Schumer are devout attendees of 
this annual parade. A smaller annual Philippine Independence Day parade 
is held in early June in Passaic, New Jersey.[63] The annual Philippine-American 
Friendship Day Parade is held in Jersey City every fourth Sunday of June.[64][65] 
In 2013, so many Filipino films screened across New York City as a part 
of the New York Asian Film Festival that, according to the Philippine Inquirer, 
"it could very well have been called the New York Filipino Film Festival".[66] 
In 2014, Here Lies Love, a bio-musical play about the personal and political 
dynamics between former Philippine first couple Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos, 
opened off-Broadway. The majority of the cast members were of Filipino 
descent,[67] and the play was set in a discotheque.[68] The growth in the 
New York City metropolitan region's Filipino populace has been accompanied 
by growth in the number of Filipino restaurants,[24] with the accessibility 
of Filipino-Chinese specialties such as siopao joining traditional Philippine 
cuisine, including inihaw na liempo and kare kare, snacks such as pandesal, 
and desserts including ensaïmada, purple ube cakes, halo-halo, and mango 
cake rolls.[23][24] Turo Turo-style buffet dining has become readily available.[25] 
Beginning in the mid-2010s, Filipino cuisine began to take on a more prominent 
place in the New York metro as well as Washington metro areas.[69] Water 
purity and availability are a lifeline for the economy of the Little Manilas 
in the New York City metropolitan region. New York City is supplied with 
drinking water by the protected Catskill Mountains watershed.[70] As a 
result of the watershed's integrity and undisturbed natural water filtration 
system, New York is one of only four major cities in the United States 
the majority of whose drinking water is pure enough not to require purification 
by water treatment plants.[71] The Croton Watershed north of the city is 
undergoing construction of a US$3.2 billion water purification plant to 
augment New York City's water supply by an estimated 290 million gallons 
daily, representing a greater than 20% addition to the city's current availability 
of water.[72] The ongoing expansion of New York City Water Tunnel No. 3, 
an integral part of the New York City water supply system, is the largest 
capital construction project in the city's history,[73] with segments serving 
Manhattan and The Bronx completed, and with segments serving Brooklyn and 
Queens planned for construction in 2020.[74] Much of northern and central 
New Jersey is provided by reservoirs to provide fresh water, but numerous 
municipal wells exist which accomplish the same purpose. Filipinos in New 
York and New Jersey, as in the United States as a whole, are highly fluent 
in English. However, in the largest Little Manilas in the area, including 
Woodside, Jersey City, and Bergenfield, Tagalog signage is commonplace.
