Michael Anthony Easler (born November 29, 1950) is a retired Major League 
Baseball outfielder who enjoyed a 14-year major league career from 1973 
to 1987 with the Houston Astros, Pittsburgh Pirates, Philadelphia Phillies, 
California Angels, Boston Red Sox and New York Yankees. He's currently 
a minor league hitting instructor in the New York Mets organization. Easler 
played first base, outfield and designated hitter. He was nicknamed "Hit 
Man" during his playing career and hit a career high .338 in 1980. After 
his major league career, he played two seasons with the Nippon-Ham Fighters 
in the Japanese Leagues in 1988â€“89 and one season with the West Palm Beach 
Tropics of the Senior Professional Baseball Association. After his retirement, 
he managed the independent league team Miami Miracle in 1990. He was the 
hitting coach for the Milwaukee Brewers in 1992, the Boston Red Sox in 
1993, and the St. Louis Cardinals from 1999 to 2001.[1][2] He returned 
to independent baseball in 2004, managing the Florence Freedom for part 
of the season. He was the hitting coach for the Jacksonville Suns in 2006 
and was the hitting coach for the Las Vegas 51s in 2007. On January 22, 
2008, Don Mattingly, who had been announced as Joe Torre's hitting coach, 
chose not to take on the position citing personal reasons. The Dodgers 
named Easler, their Triple-A coach, as the new hitting coach on Torre's 
staff. Easler was dismissed as the Dodgers' hitting coach on July 9, 2008 
when it was announced Mattingly would be returning to his role after dealing 
with turmoil in his marriage. Easler returned to his role as a minor league 
hitting instructor for the remainder of the season and then left the organization, 
confirmed by agent Burton Rocks.[3] In 2011, Easler began his first season 
as hitting coach of the Buffalo Bisons in the New York Mets' organization.[4]
