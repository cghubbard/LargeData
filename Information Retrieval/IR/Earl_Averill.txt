Howard Earl Averill (May 21, 1902 – August 16, 1983) was an American player 
in Major League Baseball (MLB) who was a center fielder from 1929 to 1941. 
He was a six-time All-Star (1933–38) and was elected to the Baseball Hall 
of Fame in 1975. Born in Snohomish, Washington, Averill broke into the 
Major Leagues in 1929 (at the age of 27) with the Cleveland Indians. He 
played for Cleveland for over ten years, and remains the all-time Indians 
leader in total bases, runs batted in, runs, and triples.[1] He also remains 
third in all-time Indians hits and doubles, and fourth in all-time Indians 
home runs and walks. During his time in Cleveland, the team never finished 
higher than third. His nickname was "The Earl of Snohomish".[2] He's famous 
for hitting the line drive that broke Dizzy Dean's toe in the 1937 All-Star 
Game. Dizzy, who had averaged 24 wins a season up to then, and only 4 wins 
a season after, changed his delivery due to the broken toe, damaged his 
arm, which led to his retiring in 1941 at the age of 31.[3] Averill was 
the first Major League player to hit four home runs in a doubleheader (with 
home run in each game) on September 17, 1930; he was also one of the first 
players to hit a home run in his first Major League at-bat (April 16, 1929, 
opening day). Averill batted .378 in 1936, leading the American League 
in hits with 232, but finishing second to Luke Appling in the batting race 
(Appling batted .388 for the White Sox). During a July 1 incident in 1935, 
Averill was lighting firecrackers with his four children as part of a pre-July 
4 celebration. One exploded while he was holding it, and he suffered lacerations 
on the fingers of his right hand, as well as burns on his face and chest. 
After several weeks, he made a full recovery.[4] Averill was traded to 
the Detroit Tigers in the middle of the 1939 season (June 14). The following 
season, his playing time was limited, but the Tigers reached the World 
Series. In the seven-game series against the Cincinnati Reds, the 38-year-old 
Averill went 0-for-3 in three pinch-hit attempts. The Reds won the series 
four games to three. Averill retired in 1941 after struggling in April 
with the Boston Braves. After his career, he was very outspoken on being 
elected to the Hall of Fame. While he did not campaign for induction, he 
did make the statement that, "Had I been elected after my death, I had 
made arrangements that my name never be placed in the Hall of Fame."[5] 
Averill was inducted in 1975, eight years before his passing. He made news 
of a different sort, according to Baseball Digest, in the early 1960s when 
he was boarding an airplane to fly to a site for an old-timers' game. He 
insisted on bringing his own bat in a gun case. His son, Earl D. Averill, 
also played in the majors from 1956 through 1963. He was mainly a catcher
