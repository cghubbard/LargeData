The 2016 Atlanta Braves season was the Braves' 20th and last season of 
home games at Turner Field before moving to SunTrust Park, 51st season 
in Atlanta and 141st season of the franchise. They finished in last place 
in the National League East Division. The 2016 season was the Braves' final 
season at Turner Field, before moving to their new home at SunTrust Park. 
The stadium was originally built as a venue for the 1996 Summer Olympics 
before being converted for use by the Braves for the 1997 season. The team 
scheduled a number of special events and limited-edition giveaways in honor 
of its final season at Turner and the players wore a commemorative sleeve 
patch on their uniforms for the entire season. The patch showed an outline 
of the stadium with the words "Turner Field; Final Season, 1997–2016".[1][2] 
The Braves began their season with a 4–3 loss in 10 innings after blowing 
the save in the top of the 9th.[3] Nick Markakis of the Braves fell afoul 
of Major League Baseball's new "Chase Utley Rule" in the 7th inning when 
he slid too far out to the left of second base and initially prevented 
Daniel Murphy of the Nationals from making the double play.[4] The Braves 
ended their two-game series against the Nationals with a 3–1 loss after 
Matt den Dekker, who had been called up from the Syracuse Chiefs just a 
few hours prior, hit a two-run double to right-center.[5] Despite opening 
up their next series with a four-run lead, the Braves gave up seven unanswered 
runs in a 7–4 loss to the Cardinals.[6] Atlanta also gave up an MLB record 
three home runs to pinch hitters.[7] In the second of the three-game series 
against the Cardinals, the Braves allowed nine unanswered runs in a 12–2 
loss.[8] After the loss, the Braves were the only team in the National 
League to have not won a single game yet.[9] Atlanta closed out a three-game 
series against the Cardinals with a 12–7 loss.[10] Braves pitcher Daniel 
Winkler suffered an elbow fracture after pitching 6 2/3rd's innings.[11] 
Things didn't improve on the first road trip of the season as the Braves 
lost 6–4 to the Nationals and fell to 0–6 for the first time since 1988.[12] 
Mallex Smith, who earned a hit in his MLB debut, left the game in the fourth 
inning after suffering a cut to his face by his helmet.[13] After eight 
scoreless innings in the second game of the series, Bryce Harper brought 
in two runs on a double to left field and the Nationals won 2–1.[14] Home 
runs by Stephen Drew and Jayson Werth in the fourth inning handed the Braves 
their eighth loss of the season as the Nationals won 3–0.[15] The Braves 
ended their road series against the Nationals with a 6–2 loss.[16] After 
trailing 3–0 against the Marlins, the Braves scored six unanswered runs 
to win their first game of the season.[17] Jason Grilli earned his first 
save since July 2015 with a 6–4 win over the Marlins in the second game 
of the series.[18] The Braves swept the series over the Marlins with a 
6–5 victory in a 10-inning game.[19] The Braves earned their fourth win 
of the season against former Braves pitcher Alex Wood and the Los Angeles 
Dodgers in a lopsided 8–1 game at Turner Field.[20] Wood said after the 
game that it "was not really the way I pictured coming back here for the 
first time. Fastball command was the most frustrating thing. I don't even 
know if I've walked in a run before in my professional career. The walks 
were pretty frustrating. It was a tough one to swallow, but I have another 
one in five days."[21] Despite a 3-1 lead, the Dodgers scored four unanswered 
runs to snap the Braves four-game win streak.[22] A Yasmani Grandal double 
in the 10th inning gave the Dodgers a 2–1 victory in the Braves's fourth 
extra-inning game of the season.[23] The Braves opened their next series 
with a 6–3 loss to the New York Mets.[24] In the second game of the series, 
the Braves lost 8–2.[25] The Braves ended their three-game series against 
the Mets with a 3–2 loss.[26] In their first interleague series of the 
season, former Braves closer Craig Kimbrel earned his 94th career save 
at Turner Field in a 1–0 victory over the Braves.[27] In the second game 
of the series, David Price pitched 14 strikeouts to secure an 11–4 victory 
over the Braves.[28] In the third game of the series and first of two at 
Fenway Park, the Braves surrendered a grand slam to Dustin Pedroia in a 
9–4 loss to the Red Sox.[29] Freddie Freeman ended the Braves's 15-game 
home run-less streak with a deep ball into right-center field in the eighth 
inning.[30] In the final game of the series, three RBI's by Markakis contributed 
to the Braves ending their eight-game losing skid with a 5–3 victory over 
the Red Sox.[31] Despite a Freeman home run in the fourth inning, the Braves 
allowed six unanswered runs, including their fourth grand slam of the season, 
in a 6–1 loss to the Cubs.[32] A sacrifice fly by Markakis in the 10th 
inning allowed Daniel Castro to score the go-ahead run and beat the Cubs 
4–3.[33] In his 2016 debut, Mike Foltynewicz gave up three home runs in 
a 4–1 loss to the Mets.[34] In the second game of the series, pitcher Matt 
Wisler surrendered one hit and earned his first win of the season in a 
3–0 game against the Mets.[35] The Braves fell 8–0 in the series finale 
to the Mets.[36] Primary leadoff hitter Markakis wasn't in the lineup for 
the series finale as he traveled back home to Baltimore to tend to a family 
emergency.[37] Two errors by the Braves led to a 7–2 loss in the first 
of three games against the Diamondbacks.[38] Former Braves starting pitcher 
Shelby Miller earned his first win of the season in a 4–2 victory over 
the Braves.[39] Despite a two-run RBI by Jeff Francoeur to tie the game, 
the Braves gave up two home runs in the 11th inning in a 5–3 loss to the 
Diamondbacks.[40] Despite a ninth inning home run from Freeman and two 
players in scoring position, the Braves lost 3–2 in the first of three 
games against the Phillies.[41] After being recalled from Triple-A Gwinnett, 
Williams Pérez surrendered one hit in eight innings pitched in a 5–1 victory 
over the Phillies.[42] Despite a three-run double by Gordon Beckham in 
the seventh inning, the Braves were unable to capitalize with runners in 
walk off position in the ninth and fell 7–4 to the Phillies in the 10th.[43] 
The Braves opened up a three-game road series with a 5–1 loss to the reigning 
World Series champion Kansas City Royals.[44] Foltynewicz earned his first 
win of the season with a 5–0 victory over the Royals.[45] Despite tying 
the game in the ninth inning, Grilli gave up a two-run walk off home run 
to Kendrys Morales to fall 4–2 in the 13th inning.[46] Despite home runs 
from Francoeur and Kelly Johnson, the Braves fell 8–5 to the Pittsburgh 
Pirates.[47] On May 17, Fredi González was fired from his position as team 
manager, as was Carlos Tosca from his position as bench coach.[48] Brian 
Snitker, manager of Triple-A Gwinnett, was promoted to interim manager 
of the Atlanta Braves.[49] His debut didn't fare too well as, despite a 
season-high of nine runs, a seven-run deficit in the first inning proved 
too much to overcome in a 12–9 loss.[50] Tyler Flowers hitting in three 
of four plate appearances and Julio Teherán surrendering only five hits 
gave Snitker his first win as an MLB manager in a 3–1 victory over the 
Pirates.[51] The Braves closed out this four-game road series with an 8–2 
loss.[52] Regular shortstop Erick Aybar was removed from the lineup after 
undergoing a procedure to remove a dislodged chicken bone.[53] Despite 
surrendering a run in the first inning, three two-run home runs from Freeman 
and Markakis gave the Braves a 7–1 victory in the first of three games 
against the Phillies.[54] Pérez allowed only two hits in 6 1/3 innings 
pitched to give the Braves their second series victory of the season in 
a 2–0 win over the Phillies.[55] The Braves were unable to pull off a sweep 
of the series as they fell 5–0 to the Phillies.[56] The Braves opened up

the loss, Julio Teherán recorded a career-high 12 strikeouts, including 
four in one inning.[58] The Braves couldn't capitalize on loaded bases 
in the 12th inning, gave up a run on a single by Jonathan Villar and lost 
3–2 in 13 innings.[59] The Braves concluded their three-game series against

inning, key hits by Freeman and Markakis led to four unanswered runs scored 
by the Braves in a 4–2 win over the Marlins.[61] The Braves earned their 
first home series win of the season in a 7-2 victory over the Marlins.[62] 
The Braves failed to sweep the Marlins for the second time this season 
in a 7–3 loss to conclude the series.[63] The Braves opened up their next 
series with a 5–3 win over the Giants.[64] Wisler put on a solid pitching 
performance until he allowed three runs in the eighth inning and the Braves 
fell 4–0.[65] Despite trailing 4–1 at a point in the game, Markakis scored 
the tying run on a wild pitch in the bottom of the ninth inning, Chris 
Withrow kept the Braves in the game with his relief performance and Freeman 
hit a walk-off home run to center-right to beat the Giants 5–4 in the 11th

lead, the Braves surrendered four home runs, including three to Corey Seager, 
in a 4–2 loss to the Dodgers.[68] Despite holding Clayton Kershaw to his

the offensive-inept Braves were unable to capitalize and fell 4–0 to the 
Dodgers.[69] The Braves concluded their series against the Dodgers by giving 
up multiple home runs in a 12–6 loss.[70] The Braves opened their next 
three-game series with Pérez exiting the game due to tricep soreness in 
the fifth inning and falling 7–2 to the Padres.[71] Despite carrying a 
one-run lead into the ninth inning, Arodys Vizcaíno blew the save by surrendering 
a home run and a walk off single in a 4–3 loss.[72] The Braves concluded 
their series with the Padres with Teherán surrendering just two runs in 
eight innings. Vizcaíno, who blew the save the night before, earned the 
save and the Braves won 4–2.[73] Back home at the Ted after a six-game 
road trip, Bud Norris pitched seven innings and gave up only four hits 
and one run as the Braves won 5-1 over the Cubs.[74] The next game in the 
series saw Anthony Rizzo, who was scratched from the lineup the day before 
due to back issues, hit his 14th home run of the season as the Braves fell 
8-2 to the Cubs.[75] The Braves closed out their three-game series with 
a 13-2 loss to the Cubs.[76] Despite a scoring opportunity with bases loaded 
in the eighth inning, the Braves squandered it, gave up a shallow left 
hit to Joey Votto with bases loaded and lost 9-8 to the Reds.[77] After 
a rough first inning for Teherán, the Braves only put up a run in a 3-1 
loss to the Reds.[78] After failing to score a walk off with bases loaded 
in the 11th and giving up two runs in the top of the 13th, a single by 
d'Arnaud allowed Jace Peterson to score the walk off run and gave the Braves 
a 9-8 victory.[79] During the game, Freeman doubled in the third, tripled 
in the fourth, hit a home run in the sixth and singled in the 11th to become 
only the seventh Braves player to hit for the cycle and first to do so 
since Mark Kotsay in 2008.[80] The Braves concluded the four-game series 
with two home runs from Freeman in a 7-2 victory over the Reds.[81] In

win in Major League Baseball in a 5-1 victory over the Mets.[82] After 
Inciarte scored the go-ahead run in the eighth inning, relief pitcher Jim 
Johnson struck out Curtis Granderson to earn his first save of the season 
and give the Braves the series victory in a 4-3 win over the Mets.[83] 
Teherán pitched a complete game, gave up only one hit, kept the Mets from 
putting up a run in a 6-0 win and gave the Braves their longest win streak 
of the season.[84] Despite trailing 2-0 going into the eighth inning, Peterson 
tied the game with a two-run homer and hit the go-ahead RBI single to give

The Braves opened up their next series at home with a two-run go-ahead 
homer by Adonis García in the eighth inning to beat the Mets 4-3[87] Despite 
a six-run rally in the fifth inning, the Braves were unable to overcome 
the eight-run deficit they found themselves in early in the game and lost 
8-6 to the Mets.[88] After a scoreless pitching duel between Jacob deGrom 
and Teherán and going into extra innings, Kelly Johnson – who was traded 
from the Braves to the Mets earlier in the month – hit the game-winning 
home run in the 11th inning to hand the Braves a 1-0 loss.[89] The Braves 
concluded the four-game series with home runs from Freeman and Garcia and

the series with a 3-0 loss to the Indians who earned their 12th straight 
victory.[94] Despite giving up a three-run homer in the second inning, 
seven unanswered runs and a save by Mauricio Cabrera gave the Braves an 
8-5 victory in the first of a four-game series against the Marlins.[95] 
Despite a game-tying home run in the bottom of the ninth by Tyler Flowers 
and bases loaded in the 10th and 11th inning, a two-run double by pinch-hitter 
José Fernández in the 12th inning gave the Marlins a 7-5 victory over the 
Braves.[96] The next day proved rough for Fernández as he surrendered eight 
hits, six runs and a walk in five and 2/3rd's innings pitched as the Braves

a one-run lead into the eighth inning, a two-run homer by Freddy Galvis 
gave a 4-3 victory to the Phillies.[101] In a makeup game postponed from 
April 30 due to rain, Markakis hit two home runs - including the game-tying 
home run in the ninth – and Flowers hit a two-out single in the 11th inning 
to give the Braves a 4-3 victory over the Cubs.[102] The Braves put on 
their best offensive output of the season to date with 15 hits, eight of 
which came in the fifth inning alone, 11 runs – four of which also came 
in the fifth inning – and three home runs from Flowers, Freeman and Markakis 
to beat the White Sox 11-8 in the first of a three-game series.[103] Three 
home runs weren't enough to overcome a five-run deficit as the Braves fell 
5-4 to the White Sox in the second game of the series.[104] The Braves 
concluded the series with Foltynewicz allowing five hits, no runs and two 
homers scored by Francoeur and Peterson to beat the White Sox 2-0.[105] 
In their first game following the All-Star break, the Braves gave up 11 
runs – including a grand slam in the ninth inning – in an 11-2 loss to 
the Rockies.[106] Despite leading by three runs going into the eighth inning 
and Foltynewicz only surrendering two hits in 7 1/3 innings pitched, four 
different pitchers in the eighth allowed the Rockies to rally back, allowed

trailing after seven innings and resulted in a 4-3 loss to the Rockies.[107]

series by surrendering a three-run homer in the sixth inning and falling 
6-3 to the Rockies.[112] Despite loading the bases with one out in the 
ninth inning, the Braves were unable to capitalize and fell 4-3 to the 
Rockies.[113] Teherán exited the game in the fifth inning with upper back 
discomfort.[114] What had started as a strong outing for Wisler with only 
surrendering two hits after five innings pitched turned into a five-run

eighth inning and the Braves fell 9-5.[121] The Braves closed out the four-game 
series against the Phillies with a two-run homer by Francouer in a 2-1 
victory.[122] Despite putting up the first run of the game and not allowing

struggles with batters the third time up – gave up five runs, including 
a home run to Matt Joyce, in a 5-3 loss to the Pirates.[123] Despite allowing 
four runs in the first inning, the Braves rallied back to score eight unanswered 
runs and earned Rob Whalen his first career victory as a major league pitcher 
in an 8-4 win over the Pirates.[124] The Braves concluded their three-game 
home stand, thanks to an improbable stolen base attempt by García in the 
seventh inning, with a 5-2 victory to win the series against the Pirates.[125]

second inning and the Braves fell 1-0 in the first of three games against 
the Cardinals.[126] Three-run homers from Freeman and García, and two-run

of the game off a Ryan Braun home run, the Braves scored two runs on a 
walk and three singles in the seventh inning to win the second game of 
the series 2-1.[130] Two home runs from Freeman weren't enough to overcome 
a three-run homer by Chris Carter in the third inning as the Braves fell 
4-3.[131] In the final game of the series, the Brewers scored a run in 
every inning of the game – only the eighth time this feat has occurred 
since 1961 – as the Braves could only put up an Aybar homer in an 11-3 
loss.[132] A three-run homer by Freeman and a solo home run by Peterson 
led to the Braves snapping a 14-game losing streak at Nationals Park in 
an 8-5 win in the first of three games against the Nationals.[133] A four-run 
rally in the ninth inning wasn't enough to overcome a five-run deficit 
as the Braves fell 7-6 in the second game of the series.[134] The Braves 
concluded the three-game series and 10-game stretch on the road by surrendering 
a three-run homer to Anthony Rendon in a 9-1 loss to the Nationals.[135] 
A two-run rally in the bottom of the eighth to pull to within a run was 
not enough to overcome the three-run deficit or a Trevor Plouffe RBI in 
the top of the ninth as the Braves dropped fell 4-2 in the first of a two-game 
interleague series against the Twins.[136] The Braves concluded their two-game 
series against the Twins by surrendering 10 runs in a 10-3 loss.[137] Despite 
pulling to within a run off a Kemp groundout in the sixth inning, the Nationals 
went on a five-run tear in the eighth to beat the Braves 8-2 in the first 
of a four-game series.[138] Despite a three-run rally in the eighth to 
tie the game, Clint Robinson hit a go-ahead RBI single to left field that 
handed the Braves their sixth straight loss in a 7-6 defeat.[139] A late 
rally by the Braves wasn't enough to overcome giving up eight runs in the 
fourth inning as the Braves lost their seventh straight game in a 11-9 
defeat.[140] The Braves concluded the four-game series agains the Nationals 
with a walk-off homer from Peterson in the 10th inning to snap a seven-game

blew a 7-4 lead in the seventh inning and Gant gave up a walk-off homer 
to Paul Goldschmidt in the ninth as the Braves fell 9-8 in the first of 
a four-game series against the Diamondbacks.[142] Trailing by a run with 
three runners on base and two outs in the eighth inning, Kemp hit a base-clearing 
double to right-field that put the Braves ahead and went on to win 7-4.[143] 
A four-run rally in the ninth inning tied the game, but a sacrifice fly 
by former Braves prospect Brandon Drury allowed Jake Lamb to score the 
winning run in the 11th inning and the Braves fell 10-9.[144] After a stint 
in AAA, Wisler surrendered only one run and two hits with four strikeouts 
and three walks as the Braves used the three runs scored in the third inning 
to split the series with the Diamondbacks in a 3-1 victory.[145] Despite 
loading the bases in both the first and second innings, the Braves were 
unable to score a run and surrendered five runs in those first two innings 
in a 7-2 loss in the first of three games against the Giants.[146] A three-run 
homer by Kemp in the fourth inning and one run surrendered in 7 2/3rd innings 
pitched by Foltynewicz was enough to secure a 3-1 win for the Braves in 
the second game of the series.[147] The Braves concluded the series by 
surrendering four homers in a 13-4 loss to the Giants.[148] In their return 
to Turner Field on August 30, the Braves put on an offensive showcase with 
12 hits and scored on six of those hits to win 7-3 in the first of a three-game 
series against the Padres.[149] The next day, the Braves continued their 
high offensive output with 12 hits and eight runs scored, including an 
Inciarte run scored off a Paul Clemens balk in the first inning, to beat 
the Padres 8-1 in the second game of the series.[150] The Braves concluded 
the three-game series against the Padres on September 1 with another high 
offensive output, that included a Freeman homer that kick-started a five-run 
rally in the fifth inning, as they earned their first home sweep of the 
season in a 9-6 victory.[151] Back on the road in Philadelphia on September 
2, the Braves, starting the top of the ninth inning with the game tied 
4-4, batted around with hits from Inciarte, Garcia, Freeman, Kemp, Markakis 
and Freeman a second time to score five runs, and win 9-4 in the first 
of a three-game series against the Phillies.[152] The next night, two homers 
from Garcia, a fielders choice grounder from Flowers to drive in the go-ahead 
run and a ground out from Peterson to bring in another run gave the Braves 
a 6-4 victory in the second game of the series.[153] In the final game 
of the three-game series, Teheran gave up only five hits and struck out 
seven batters in six innings pitched, Kemp hit his 28th homer of the season 
in the second and Freeman hit his 29th in the eighth, and Johnson earned 
his 15th save of the season to beat the Phillies 2-0.[154] In the first 
game of a three-game series in the nation's capital, a fielder's choice 
RBI by Peterson and a two-run rally in the ninth wasn't enough to overcome 
a five-run deficit – a two-run homer by Trea Turner and a three-run homer 
by Chris Heisey, both in the third inning – and the Braves's six-game win 
streak was snapped with a 6-4 loss to the Nationals.[155] After Perez gave 
up a 4-1 lead in the third inning of the second game of the series, which 
included a Rendon grand slam and a homer from Ryan Zimmerman, the Braves 
rallied back with RBI's from Dansby Swanson and Joel De La Cruz to tie 
the game at 6-6.[156] However, the Nationals responded with a three-run 
eighth inning, which included Michael Taylor scoring on a Flowers throwing 
error, and a Swanson single RBI in the ninth wasn't enough to prevent a 
9-7 loss.[157] In the final game of the series, Chris Withrow blew a two-run 
lead in the seventh inning and the game eventually went into extra innings.[158] 
A Peterson RBI single in the 10th put the Braves up a run in the 10th, 
but Rendon responded with an RBI single to tie the game again.[159] A walk-off 
single by Wilson Ramos in the 11th secured a 5-4 victory for the Nationals.[160] 
The Braves started the first of a three-game series on September 9 with 
a 4-0 lead, but a six-run unanswered rally – which included a two-run homer 
by Curtis Granderson – by the Mets beginning in the sixth inning led to 
a 6-4 defeat for the Braves.[161] In the second game of the series, Kemp 
tied the game with a homer in the sixth and a walk-off RBI single by Garcia 
in the 10th gave the Braves a 4-3 victory over the Mets.[162] In the final 
game of the series, the Braves gave up 10 runs – including a third inning 
grand slam by Yoenis Céspedes – in a 10-3 loss to the Mets.[163] In the 
first of a three-game series against the Marlins on September 12, the Braves 
put up seven unanswered runs in the first three innings – including a Markakis 
homer – before giving up seven runs to the Marlins.[164] The Braves responded 
with five runs to beat the Marlins 12-7.[165] Five runs, including a two-run 
homer by Freeman and a solo homer by Kemp, were not enough to overcome 
seven runs by the Marlins in a 7-5 loss in the second game of the series.[166] 
In the final game of the series, benches cleared after José Ramírez threw 
a pitch that went behind the head of Marlins pitcher José Fernández.[167] 
No punches were thrown and Ramírez was ejected from the game.[168] The 
Marlins went on to win 7-5.[169] In the first of a three-game series against 
the Nationals on September 16, Max Scherzer surrendered only two runs in 
seven innings pitched, the Nationals put up seven runs, including a two-run 
homer from Turner, and the Braves fell 7-2.[170] Despite surrendering a 
lead-off homer to Tuner to start the second game of the series, the Braves 
responded with six runs off nine hits in the fifth inning and beat the 
Nationals 7-3.[171] In the final game of the series, Wisler surrendered 
just two runs and Garcia drove in three runs before the game was called 
in the bottom of the seventh, and the Braves won their first series against 
the Nationals this season in the final game against the NL East rival for 
the season.[172] In the first of a three-game road series against the Mets 
on September 19, the Braves put up seven runs, including a solo homer by 
Freeman, and Blair surrendered just two runs off four hits in six innings 
pitched to earn his first victory of the season in a 7-3 win over the Mets.[173] 
In the second game, the Braves put up five runs, including a three-run 
homer in the seventh inning by Garcia, and Johnson earned the save to win 
series in a 5-4 victory over the Mets.[174] The Mets jumped to a three-run 
lead in the final game of the series, but the Braves rallied back with 
four unanswered runs, which included a two-run homer by Anthony Recker 
in the seventh inning, to take the lead in the top of the ninth.[175] In 
an almost exact repeat of the night before, Braves closer Johnson faced 
off against Cespedes with two outs in the bottom of the ninth.[176] Cespedes 
hit the ball to deep right-center and had the distance for a three-run 
homer, but center fielder Inciarte raced towards the wall, made the jump 
and caught the ball above the fence to get the final out for a 4-3 Braves 
victory in their final game of the season against the Mets.[177] In the 
first of a four-game road series against the Marlins on September 22, the 
Braves put up six runs, including two homers from Kemp totaling three runs, 
in a 6-3 victory over the Marlins.[178] In the second game of the series, 
the Braves rallied back from a two-run deficit to score three unanswered 
runs and beat the Marlins 3-2.[179] In the third inning, Kemp was ejected, 
and so was manager Snitker, for arguing with the home plate umpire over 
a 3-1 pitch call.[180] Despite Freeman's adding to his 28-game hit streak 
with two hits and a homer, the Braves couldn't overcome Blair surrendering 
six hits, five runs and three walks in 3 1/3 innings pitched, and fell 
6-4 for only the second time at Marlins Park in 2016 in the third game 
of the series.[181] The final game of the series was cancelled following 
the news that Marlins pitcher José Fernández died in a boating accident 
earlier that morning.[182] The game was never made up as the season was 
nearly ending and both teams were out of playoff contention.[183] In the 
first of a three-game home series against the Phillies on September 28, 
the Braves found themselves in a six-run hole, largely due to Teheran surrendering 
a grand slam homer in the first inning.[184] However, they scored seven 
unanswered runs and beat the Phillies 7-6.[185] High offensive output defined 
the second game of the series as the Braves put up 12 runs, nine of which 
were surrendered by Adam Morgan, in a 12-2 win over the Phillies.[186] 
With the score tied at one in the bottom of the eighth, Kemp opened the 
floodgates with an RBI double into right field that allowed Swanson to 
score and the Braves swept the Phillies 5-2 in the final division series 
of the season.[187] In the first game of the final series of the season 
and final series at Turner Field on September 30, the Braves put up just 
two runs, via solo homers from Kemp and Brandon Snyder, against six runs 
by the wild-card hopeful Detroit Tigers, three of which came via two Miguel 
Cabrera homers, in a 6-2 loss.[188] In the second game of the series against 
the Tigers on October 1, the Braves damaged the Tigers' wild-card hopes 
with five runs, including a two-run homer by Freeman and a solo homer by 
Markakis, in a 5-3 victory.[189] In the final game of the season, and last 
at Turner Field, the Braves beat the Tigers 1-0 with Freddie Freeman's 
first-inning sacrifice fly providing the only run of the game to finish 
the season at 68-93,[190][191]and for the first time all season, the Braves 
did not have the worst record in the National League.[citation needed]
