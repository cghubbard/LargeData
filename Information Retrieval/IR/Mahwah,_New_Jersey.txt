Mahwah is a township in Bergen County, New Jersey, United States. As of 
the 2010 United States Census, the township's population was 25,890.[9][10] 
The population increased by 1,828 (+7.6%) from the 24,062 counted in the 
2000 Census, which had in turn increased by 6,157 (+34.4%) from the 17,905 
counted in the 1990 Census.[20][21] The name "Mahwah" is derived from the 
Lenape word "mawewi" which means "Meeting Place" or "Place Where Paths 
Meet".[22][23][24] The area that is now Mahwah was originally formed as 
Hohokus Township on April 9, 1849, from portions of Franklin Township. 
While known as Hohokus Township, territory was taken to form Orvil Township 
(on January 1, 1886; remainder of township is now Waldwick), Allendale 
(November 10, 1894), Upper Saddle River (November 22, 1894) and Ramsey 
(March 10, 1908). On November 7, 1944, the area was incorporated by an 
act of the New Jersey Legislature as the Township of Mahwah, based on the 
results of a referendum held that day, replacing Hohokus Township.[25] 
New Jersey Monthly magazine ranked Mahwah as its 9th best place to live 
in its 2008 rankings of the "Best Places To Live" in New Jersey.[26] The 
Lenape and ancestral indigenous peoples were the original inhabitants of 
Mahwah (the meeting place) and surrounding area. Their descendants have 
combined with other Native Americans and ethnicities and were recognized 
in 1980 by the state as the Ramapough Mountain Indians. They number approximately 
5,000 people living around the Ramapo Mountains of northern New Jersey 
and southern New York. The tribe is officially recognized by New Jersey, 
but does not have federal recognition.[27] Their tribal office is located 
on Stag Hill Road in Mahwah, and the Chief of the Ramapough Lenape Indian 
Nation is Dwaine Perry (as of March 2007).[28] For 25 years, beginning 
in 1976, Mahwah hosted the A&P Tennis Classic, a tune-up for the U.S. Open 
tennis tournament held at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center 
in New York City's Flushing Meadows–Corona Park.[29][30] The 75-room, three-story 
Crocker Mansion was built in 1901 for George Crocker, son of railroad magnate 
Charles Crocker. The estate, located at Crocker Mansion Drive, is one of 
New Jersey's historical landmarks.[31] Ford Motor Company operated the 
Mahwah Assembly plant from 1955, producing 6 million cars in the 25 years 
it operated before the last car rolled off the line on June 20, 1980.[32][33] 
At the time of its completion, it was the largest motor vehicle assembly 
plant in the United States. The Ford plant, along with other businesses 
such as American Brake Shoe and Foundry Company, helped contribute to the 
economic development of the town and its reputation for low home property 
taxes.[34] The Mahwah town sports teams remain named Thunderbirds in honor 
of the Ford plant. Due to contractors' dumping of hazardous wastes at the 
Ringwood Mines landfill site before federal regulation, it has been designated 
as an EPA Superfund site which needs extensive environmental cleanup. In 
2006, some 600 Ramapough Indians filed a mass tort claim against Ford for 
damages.[35] Mahwah, and the closure of the Ford plant, is mentioned in 
the opening line of the 1982 Bruce Springsteen song "Johnny 99".[36][37] 
According to the United States Census Bureau, the township had a total 
area of 26.191 square miles (67.835 km2), including 25.693 square miles 
(66.545 km2) of land and 0.498 square miles (1.290 km2) of water (1.90%).[1][2] 
It is the largest municipality in Bergen County by area, more than 2½ times 
larger than the next-largest municipality, Paramus, and covering 10.6% 
of the total area of the entire county.[38] Mahwah is near the Ramapo Mountains 
and the Ramapo River. Interstate 287 passes through Mahwah, but the only 
point of access is at the New Jersey–New York border, where 287 meets Route 
17. U.S. Route 202 runs through Mahwah from Oakland to Suffern, across 
the state line.[39] Several state and county parks are located in Mahwah, 
including Campgaw Mountain Reservation, Darlington County Park and Ramapo 
Valley County Reservation, all operated by Bergen County.[40] The Ramapo 
River runs through the western section of Mahwah. Mahwah is bordered by 
the towns of Upper Saddle River, Ramsey, Allendale, Wyckoff, Franklin Lakes, 
and Oakland in Bergen County; Ringwood in Passaic County; and Airmont, 
Hillburn, Ramapo and Suffern in Rockland County, New York.[39][41] Unincorporated 
communities, localities, and place names located partially or completely 
within the township include the residential areas of Ackermans Mills, Bear 
Swamp, Bogerts Ranch Estates, Cragmere, Cragmere Park, Darlington, Fardale, 
Halifax, Havemeyers Reservoir, Masonicus, Mountainside Farm, Pulis Mills, 
Ramapo Farm and Wanamakers Mills, along with the mixed residential and 
commercial area of West Mahwah.[42][43] Mahwah has a humid subtropical 
climate (Köppen climate classification Cfa). Corporate residents of Mahwah 
include: Campgaw Mountain Reservation is a Bergen County accredited park, 
covering 1,351 acres (547 ha) in Mahwah and portions of Oakland, that has 
campgrounds and ski slopes for skiing.[60] At the 2010 United States Census,

Mahwah is governed within the Faulkner Act (formally known as the Optional 
Municipal Charter Law) under the Mayor-Council system of municipal government 
(Plan B), implemented by direct petition as of July 1, 1984.[76] The governing 
body consists of a mayor and a seven-member Township Council, with all 
members elected at-large to four-year terms of office in non-partisan elections 
held as part of the November general election in even years, with either 
three seats (and the mayoral seat) or four seats up for vote. The legislative 
power of the municipality is exercised by a seven-member Township Council.[7][3] 
In September 2010, the township council voted to shift the township's non-partisan 
elections from May to November, citing increased voter participation and 
prospective savings of $30,000 associated with supporting each election, 
with the first November election taking place in 2012.[77] As of 2016[update], 
the Mayor of Mahwah is William C. Laforet, whose term of office ends December 
31, 2016, after first being elected in November 2011 to serve the balance 
of the term of Richard Martel through December 31, 2013.[78][79] Members 
of the Township Council are Council President John F. Roth (2016), Council 
Vice President Steven Sbarra (2016), Mary Amoroso (2018), Janet Ariemma 
(2018), Lisa H. DiGiulio (2016), Robert Hermansen (2018) and Jonathan Wong 
(2018).[3][80][81][82][83] John Speich resigned from the council in June 
2013 from a seat that expired in December 2014, but the vacancy could not 
be filled until the November 2013 general election, as the council was 
unable to reach consensus on a replacement.[84] In August 1997, due to 
personal debt, then-Mayor David J. Dwork shot and killed himself in the 
town's mayoral offices. There were also unverified allegations of corruption.[85] 
Dwork was memorialized with a tree dedicated to him at the site of the 
Mahwah Public Library. Dwork was succeeded by Richard J. Martel, then a 
township council member, who served for 14 years until his own death, of 
natural causes, on March 7, 2011.[86] Martel himself was succeeded by Council 
President John DaPuzzo as acting mayor.[87] Mahwah is located in the 5th 
Congressional District[88] and is part of New Jersey's 39th state legislative 
district.[10][89][90] Prior to the 2011 reapportionment following the 2010 
Census, Mahwah had been in the 40th state legislative district.[91] New 
Jersey's Fifth Congressional District is represented by Scott Garrett (R, 
Wantage Township).[92] New Jersey is represented in the United States Senate 
by Cory Booker (D, Newark, term ends 2021)[93] and Bob Menendez (D, Paramus, 
2019).[94][95] For the 2016–2017 session (Senate, General Assembly), the 
39th Legislative District of the New Jersey Legislature is represented 
in the State Senate by Gerald Cardinale (R, Demarest) and in the General 
Assembly by Holly Schepisi (R, River Vale) and Robert Auth (R, Old Tappan).[96] 
The Governor of New Jersey is Chris Christie (R, Mendham Township).[97] 
The Lieutenant Governor of New Jersey is Kim Guadagno (R, Monmouth Beach).[98] 
Bergen County is governed by a directly elected County Executive, with 
legislative functions performed by a seven-member Board of Chosen Freeholders.[99] 
As of 2015[update], the County Executive is James J. Tedesco III (D, Paramus; 
term ends December 31, 2018).[100] The seven freeholders are elected at-large 
in partisan elections on a staggered basis, with two or three seats coming 
up for election each year, with a Chairman, Vice Chairman and Chairman 
Pro Tempore selected from among its members at a reorganization meeting 
held each January.[101] Bergen County's Freeholders are Freeholder Chairwoman 
Joan Voss (D, 2017; Fort Lee),[102] Vice Chairman Steve Tanelli (D, 2015; 
North Arlington)[103] Chairman Pro Tempore John A. Felice (R, 2016; River 
Edge),[104] David L. Ganz (D, 2017; Fair Lawn),[105] Maura R. DeNicola

before he was sworn in as County Executive)[107][108] and Tracy Silna Zur 
(D, 2015; Franklin Lakes).[109][110] Countywide constitutional officials 
are County Clerk John S. Hogan (D, Northvale),[111] Sheriff Michael Saudino

In 2004, the New Jersey Legislature passed the Highlands Water Protection 
and Planning Act, which regulates the New Jersey Highlands region. Mahwah 
was included in the highlands preservation area and is subject to the rules 
of the act and the Highlands Water Protection and Planning Council, a division 
of the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection.[125] Some of 
the territory in the protected region is classified as being in the highlands 
preservation area, and thus subject to additional rules.[126] The Mahwah 
Township Public Schools provides public education for students in pre-Kindergarten 
through twelfth grade. As of the 2011-12 school year, the district's six 
schools had an enrollment of 3,259 students and 250.1 classroom teachers 
(on an FTE basis), for a student–teacher ratio of 13.03:1.[127] Schools 
in the district (with 2010-11 enrollment data from the National Center 
for Education Statistics[128]) are four elementary schools — Lenape Meadows 
Elementary School[129] (PreK-3; 480 students), Betsy Ross Elementary School[130] 
(K-3; 230), George Washington Elementary School[131] (K-3; 175) and Joyce 
Kilmer Elementary School[132] (4-5; 528) — along with Ramapo Ridge Middle 
School[133] (6-8; 796) and Mahwah High School[134] (9-12; 1,049).[135][136] 
The district's newest building, Lenape Meadows, was opened in 2002 and 
changed the way the district divided up grade levels. Since each the K-3 
grades are broken up by location in the township which determines the elementary 
school to attend, before Lenape Meadows was built, students of that section 
of town attended Commodore Perry School. Commodore Perry School, Betsy 
Ross, and George Washington originally only housed the K-2 grades and the 
entire 3rd grade class attended Joyce Kilmer. The construction of Lenape 
Meadows was so massive that there was room for 3rd grade students as well, 
making Betsy Ross and George Washington house their students for 3rd grade, 
too. Public school students from the township, and all of Bergen County, 
are eligible to attend the secondary education programs offered by the 
Bergen County Technical Schools, which include the Bergen County Academies 
in Hackensack, and the Bergen Tech campus in Teterboro or Paramus. The 
district offers programs on a shared-time or full-time basis, with admission 
based on a selective application process and tuition covered by the student's 
home school district.[137][138] Young World Day School serves students 
in pre-Kindergarten through fifth grade using Montessori and traditional 
educational methods.[139] As of May 2010[update], the township had a total 
of 110.29 miles (177.49 km) of roadways, of which 81.91 miles (131.82 km) 
were maintained by the municipality, 20.59 miles (33.14 km) by Bergen County 
and 7.79 miles (12.54 km) by the New Jersey Department of Transportation.[142] 
Interstate 287 and Route 17 merge in Mahwah, and U.S. Route 202 also passes 
through. The northern terminus of County Route 507 is also in Mahwah. Interstate 
87, the New York Thruway, is just outside the state in Suffern, New York. 
Interstate 287 heads north from Franklin Lakes, continuing for 5.3 miles 
(8.5 km) to the New York State border.[143] U.S. Route 202 heads north 
for 5.7 miles (9.2 km), running from Oakland to the New York State border.[144] 
Route 17 extends 2.5 miles (4.0 km) from Ramsey until it forms a concurrency 
where it merges with Interstate 287.[145] County Route 507 runs 2.0 miles 
(3.2 km) across the northeastern portion of the township, from Ramsey to 
an intersection with U.S. Route 202 near the state line.[146] NJ Transit 
rail service is available from the Mahwah station[147] to Secaucus Junction, 
Hoboken Terminal, and Newark on the Main Line and Bergen County Line.[148][149][150] 
Passengers may also take advantage of express service on the same line 
from the Suffern station, just across the New York state line.[151] Short 
Line Bus offers service to the Port Authority Bus Terminal in Midtown Manhattan 
and intermediate locations.[152][153] People who were born in, residents
