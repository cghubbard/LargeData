John Adams (born 1951) is a dedicated fan of the Cleveland Indians, a Major 
League Baseball team based in Cleveland, Ohio. Adams has played his bass 
drum in the bleacher seats during nearly every Indians home game since 
1973, which has brought him notoriety and recognition from the Indians 
and other organizations. The Indians now pay for two season tickets for 
Adams and his drum, he has been involved in two ceremonial first pitches, 
and he is the only fan for whom the Indians have dedicated a bobblehead 
day. Adams first drummed at an Indians game on August 24, 1973, at Cleveland 
Stadium, at a game in which the Indians beat the Texas Rangers, 11â€“5.[1] 
Adams, who was 21 years old at the time,[2] has stated that he brought 
his bass drum to that first game because he wanted to add to the noise 
of "seat banging", a tradition at Cleveland Stadium in which fans would 
bang the swivel seat of their chairs against the chair's base during tense 
moments in the game.[3] But Adams preferred to sit in the bleachers, where 
there were no seats to bang.[3] During the game, Bob Sudyk, a reporter 
for the Cleveland Press, interviewed Adams and asked if he was going to 
drum again at the following game. Adams said no, but Sudyk wrote in his 
article that he would. According to Adams, "not to make a liar out of Bob, 
I showed up with my drum, and then I came to the next game and the next 
game and the next game."[4] The Indians' promotions director at the time, 
Jackie York, also approached Adams and asked him to play at every game. 
Adams formally declined but continued to attend games with his drum.[5] 
Ever since, Adams has sat in the highest bleacher seat in left-center field 
with his bass drum; as of August 2013[update] he has missed only 38 home 
games in more than 40 seasons.[6] Adams played at Cleveland Stadium until 
October 1993, when the Indians played their last game there.[7] Next spring 
he moved with the team to its new ballpark, Jacobs Field (renamed Progressive 
Field in 2008).[8] Adams played the drum at his 3,000th game on April 27, 
2011.[4] During his tenure, he has witnessed Indians pitcher Len Barker 
pitch a perfect game on May 15, 1981, and witnessed the Indians play in 
the 1995, 1997, and 2016 World Series.[1] Adams still uses the same 26-inch-wide 
bass drum he began with in 1973. He has stated that he bought it as part 
of a set for $25 at a garage sale. It has the same head on the side of 
the drum that Adams does not beat, but Adams has stated that he replaces 
the other side about twice a year and also goes through about three sets 
of mallets each year.[9] During games, Adams tends to drum at particular 
moments: when the Indians take the field at the beginning of the game, 
if the Indians have runners in scoring position, if the Indians are tied 
or trailing near the end of the game, or if they are winning at the top 
of the ninth inning.[1] Because of his drumming, Adams became a celebrity 
and his drum was soon nicknamed Big Chief Boom-Boom, by Indians radio announcer 
Herb Score.[1] It has also helped him meet politicians, including U.S. 
senators and a Pakistani government official.[1] Adams has been recognized 
by the Cleveland Indians and other organizations for his long commitment 
to the team. On October 4, 2007, he threw out the ceremonial first pitch 
for the Indians' first game in the 2007 American League Division Series, 
against the New York Yankees.[10] After Adams drummed at his 3,000th game 
on April 27, 2011, the Indians celebrated it the following Saturday, on 
April 30, 2011, by incorporating Adams in the ceremonial first pitch and 
putting on a pregame parade featuring Adams' fellow Indians fans carrying 
bongos, snares and plastic toy drums.[11][5] For the ceremonial first pitch, 
Adams swung at the ball with his drum from home plate after it was thrown 
by former Indians player Joe Charboneau.[5] Soon after the move to Jacobs 
Field, Cleveland began a record-breaking run of sellouts, which ended at 
455 games in April 2001.[a] Soon after, the Indians retired the number 
455 in honor of their fans and Adams helped unveil the commemorative sign.[12][10] 
Adams once paid for his tickets (one for himself, and one for his drum),[4] 
but the Indians now pay for two of his season tickets in honor of the contributions 
he has made to the ballpark atmosphere. Adams buys an additional two season 
tickets.[7] In 2006, the Indians gave out bobblehead dolls depicting Adams, 
making him the only fan for whom the team has dedicated a bobble head day.[2] 
In 2008, he won the Hilda Award, which is awarded annually by The Baseball 
Reliquary "to recognize distinguished service to the game by a baseball 
fan" and is named in memory of Hilda Chester, a dedicated fan of the Brooklyn 
Dodgers.[13][14] In April 2012, Great Lakes Brewing Company, a Cleveland-based 
brewery and brewpub, released a product called Rally Drum Red Ale in honor 
of Adams and Opening Day.[15] In April 2015, The Plain Dealer columnist 
Tim Warsinskey wrote a column suggesting that a statue of Adams be built 
in Cleveland in his honor.[16] Adams also has a plaque located by his seat 
just under the left field scoreboard commemorating his tenure as the Indians' 
"#1 Fan".[citation needed] Adams lives in Brecksville, Ohio, a suburb of 
Cleveland.[17] He attended both Saint Ignatius High School in Cleveland 
and Parma Senior High School in Parma, Ohio, where he played bass drum 
in band before graduating high school in 1969. Adams works on computer 
systems for AT&T and teaches classes, without pay, at Cleveland State University.[9][17] 
Adams has also volunteered his time as a member of the Kiwanis service 
club and the community emergency response team in his hometown and has
