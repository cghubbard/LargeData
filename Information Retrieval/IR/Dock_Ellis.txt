Dock Phillip Ellis, Jr. (March 11, 1945 – December 19, 2008) was an American 
professional baseball player. A pitcher, Ellis played in Major League Baseball 
from 1968 through 1979 for the Pittsburgh Pirates, New York Yankees, Oakland 
Athletics, Texas Rangers, and New York Mets. In his MLB career, he had 
a 138–119 win–loss record, a 3.46 earned run average, and 1,136 strikeouts. 
Ellis threw a no-hitter on June 12, 1970. He later stated that he accomplished 
the feat under the influence of LSD. Reporters at the game say they do 
not believe the claim. Ellis was the starting pitcher for the National 
League in the All-Star Game in 1971. That year, the Pirates were World 
Series champions. Joining the Yankees in 1976, he helped lead the team 
to the 1976 World Series, and was named the American League Comeback Player 
of the Year in the process. Ellis was an outspoken individual who advocated 
for the rights of players and African Americans. He also had a substance 
abuse problem, and he acknowledged after his retirement that he never pitched 
without the use of drugs. After going into treatment Ellis remained sober 
and devoted the remainder of his life to counseling drug addicts in treatment 
centers and prisons. He died of a liver ailment in 2008 at the age of 63. 
Ellis attended Gardena High School in Gardena, California. At the age of 
14, he began drinking and using drugs.[1][2] Ellis played for the school's 
basketball team, recording 21 assists in one game.[3] He played baseball 
as an infielder for a local semi-professional team called the "Pittsburgh 
Pirates Rookies", along with future major leaguers Bobby Tolan, Roy White, 
Ron Woods, Reggie Smith, Don Wilson, Bob Watson, and Dave Nelson; the team 
was managed by Chet Brewer.[4] However, Ellis refused to play for the Gardena 
High School baseball team, because a baseball player referred to him as 
a "spearchucker".[3] When Ellis was caught drinking and smoking marijuana 
in a high school bathroom during his senior year, the school agreed not 
to expel him if he agreed to play for the school's baseball team.[5] He 
appeared in four games and was named all-league.[3] Ellis then attended 
Los Angeles Harbor College (LAHC), a junior college.[2] At the age of 17, 
Ellis was diagnosed with sickle cell anemia. The diagnosis was later changed 
to sickle cell trait.[6] While Ellis attended LAHC, various Major League 
Baseball teams attempted to sign him to a professional contract, but as 
he heard the Pittsburgh Pirates gave out signing bonuses of $60,000, he 
held out until the Pirates made him an offer.[3] He was arrested for stealing 
a car, and given probation.[3] Brewer, working as a scout for the Pirates, 
signed Ellis to the Pirates; as a result of the arrest, the Pirates offered 
Ellis $500 a month and a $2,500 signing bonus.[3] Ellis played for the 
Batavia Pirates of the Class A New York–Pennsylvania League in 1964. The 
next season, he played for the Kinston Eagles of the Class A Carolina League[7] 
and the Columbus Jets of the Class AAA International League.[8] Ellis pitched 
in an exhibition game for the Pirates against the Cleveland Indians in 
July, receiving the win.[7] After the season, the Pirates added Ellis to 
their 40-man roster.[8] In 1966, Ellis played for the Asheville Tourists 
of the Class AA Southern League, pitching to a 10–9 win–loss record, a 
2.77 earned run average (ERA),[9] and an All-Star Game appearance.[10] 
The Pirates called Ellis up to the majors near the end of the season, but 
the team did not use him in a game that year.[9] Ellis started the 1967 
season with Columbus. He believed that he was not on the major league club 
because the Pirates already had a number of African American players; he 
felt that the team did not want to alienate white fans.[11] Ellis was sent 
down to the Macon Peaches of the Southern League,[12] which Ellis believed 
was due to the length of his hair. Ellis said that he was promoted back 
to Columbus after shaving his head.[13] He had a 2–0 win-loss record with 
Macon and a 5–7 record with Columbus.[14] During his minor league career, 
Ellis once chased a heckler in the stands with a baseball bat.[5] He also 
used pills when he pitched, specifically the amphetamines Benzedrine and 
Dexamyl.[5] Stressed by the pressure of his "can't-miss" status as a prospect, 
Ellis became addicted.[5] Ellis later said that he never pitched a game 
without using amphetamines.[5] He eventually needed 70 to 85 milligrams 
(1.08–1.31 gr) per game, between five and twelve capsules, depending on 
their strength.[3] Ellis acknowledged that he began to use cocaine in the 
late 1960s.[2] Ellis held out from the Pirates in February 1968;[14] he 
came to terms with the team in March.[15] The Pirates optioned Ellis to 
Columbus,[16] who moved Ellis from the starting rotation to the bullpen.[17] 
At Columbus, Ellis credited his work with manager Johnny Pesky and pitching 
coach Harvey Haddix for improving his performance.[18] Ellis made his MLB 
debut that June, beginning as a relief pitcher.[19][20] The Pirates moved 
Ellis into the starting rotation later that season. Ellis pitched his first 
complete game in September.[21] He had a 6–5 win-loss record with a 2.51 
ERA with the Pirates in 1968.[3] In 1969, Ellis made the team's starting 
rotation for Opening Day.[22] The struggles of Steve Blass kept Ellis in 
the starting rotation, as Blass was moved to the bullpen.[23] Self-reportedly 
under the influence of LSD, Ellis threw a no-hitter against the San Diego 
Padres 2-0 on Friday, June 12, 1970 in the first game of a doubleheader 
at San Diego Stadium. The Pirates flew to San Diego on Thursday, June 11 
for a series against the Padres. Ellis reported that he visited a friend 
in Los Angeles and used LSD "two or three times." Thinking it was still 
Thursday, he took a hit of LSD on Friday at noon, and his friend's girlfriend 
reminded him at 2:00 PM that he was scheduled to pitch that night. Ellis 
flew from Los Angeles to San Diego at 3:00 PM and arrived at San Diego 
Stadium at 4:30 PM; the game started at 6:05 PM.[5] Ellis threw the no-hitter 
despite being unable to feel the ball or see the batter or catcher clearly.[24] 
Ellis said his catcher Jerry May wore reflective tape on his fingers which 
helped him to see May's signals. Ellis walked eight batters and struck 
out six, and he was aided by excellent fielding plays from second baseman 
Bill Mazeroski and center fielder Matty Alou.[25] As Ellis recounted: I 
can only remember bits and pieces of the game. I was psyched. I had a feeling 
of euphoria. I was zeroed in on the [catcher's] glove, but I didn't hit 
the glove too much. I remember hitting a couple of batters, and the bases 
were loaded two or three times. The ball was small sometimes, the ball 
was large sometimes, sometimes I saw the catcher, sometimes I didn't. Sometimes, 
I tried to stare the hitter down and throw while I was looking at him. 
I chewed my gum until it turned to powder. I started having a crazy idea 
in the fourth inning that Richard Nixon was the home plate umpire, and 
once I thought I was pitching a baseball to Jimi Hendrix, who to me was 
holding a guitar and swinging it over the plate. They say I had about three 
to four fielding chances. I remember diving out of the way of a ball I 
thought was a line drive. I jumped, but the ball wasn't hit hard and never 
reached me.[26] Ellis reported that he never used LSD during the season 
again, though he continued to use amphetamines.[5] An animated short film 
by James Blagden about the game, "Dock Ellis and the LSD No-No", features 
narration in Ellis' own voice, taken from a 2008 NPR interview.[27] Bob 
Smizik of the Pittsburgh Press believes Ellis' version of events that day, 
although he did not witness the game in person. Smizik was the reporter 
who first broke the story. Bill Christine, also of the Pittsburgh Press, 
does not believe Ellis' claim and was at the game that day. Christine was 
a beat reporter who "practically lived with the team that year". Christine 
said that he did not notice anything unusual, and says that if Ellis had 
reported to the stadium only 90 minutes before his scheduled start, reporters 
would have been told. John Mehno, a reporter who had "extensive interactions" 
with Ellis over his career, was skeptical about many stories told by Ellis, 
including the LSD no-hitter. Mehno said that he has not found a teammate 
who would corroborate the story.[28] However, one of his close friends, 
Scipio Spinks, a pitcher for the Astros, has said he has no doubt Ellis 
was telling the truth about his LSD use as he was very familiar with Dock's 
drug habits, including the use of LSD.[29] Ellis struggled for the remainder 
of the 1970 season, and finished the year with a 13–10 win-loss record 
as he experienced elbow and shoulder pain. However, he finished second 
in the NL with four shutouts and seventh with a 3.21 ERA.[30] The Pirates 
won the National League (NL) East division championship.[31] Ellis started 
Game 1 of the 1970 National League Championship Series (NLCS) to the Cincinnati 
Reds.[32] Ellis took the loss, and the Pirates lost the series to the Reds 
in three games.[33] Ellis worked on his changeup for the 1971 season.[34] 
He was rewarded by being named the Pirates' Opening Day starting pitcher; 
he defeated the Philadelphia Phillies by a score of 4-2.[35] After a strong 
start to the 1971 season, posting a 13–3 win-loss record,[36] Ellis was 
named to appear in the 1971 Major League Baseball All-Star Game, held at 
Tiger Stadium in Detroit. The AL selected Vida Blue of the Oakland Athletics 
as their starter, and Ellis publicly stated that National League All-Star 
Team manager Sparky Anderson would "never start two brothers against each 
other".[27][37] Anderson surprised Ellis by naming him the starting pitcher 
of the All-Star Game.[38][39] Ellis was the losing pitcher in the game.[39] 
During the game, Reggie Jackson hit a towering home run off of Ellis.[5] 
The home run, estimated to have traveled 600 feet (180 m), tied a 1926 
home run hit by Babe Ruth for the longest measured home run on record.[40] 
The next time the two opposed each other, Ellis beaned Jackson in the face 
in retaliation for his earlier home run.[5][41] Ellis started Game 2 of 
the 1971 NLCS,[42] earning the victory over the San Francisco Giants.[43] 
During the series, Ellis created a stir by complaining about the Pirates' 
lodgings,[44] complaining that the organization was "cheap".[45] He changed 
hotels because he said the hotel rooms were too small.[5] Ellis started 
Game 1 of the 1971 World Series against the Baltimore Orioles.[46] In a 
losing effort, he lasted only 2 1⁄3 innings. He allowed four hits and four 
runs, including two home runs.[46][47] Though Ellis denied being in pain 
before the game,[46] he later acknowledged that elbow pain limited his 
performance,[46] and wondered if his sickle cell trait could be related 
to this pain.[6] The Pirates defeated the Orioles in seven games to win 
the World Series.[48] Ellis finished the season with a 19–9 win-loss record 
and a 3.06 ERA. He placed fourth in the Cy Young Award balloting.[49] His 
19 wins were fifth best in the league, and his .679 winning percentage 
was fourth best.[50] On May 5, 1972, Ellis, Willie Stargell, and Rennie 
Stennett missed the team bus to Riverfront Stadium. A security guard asked 
the three for identification; Stargell and Stennett complied and were allowed 
in, but Ellis did not have identification with him.[51] The guard said 
that Ellis did not identify himself, appeared drunk, and "made threatening 
gestures with a closed fist."[5][52] Ellis countered that he was showing 
his World Series ring as evidence of his affiliation with the Pirates. 
In response, the guard maced Ellis.[52] Ellis was arrested and charged 
with disorderly conduct.[53] The Reds sued Ellis for assault and Ellis 
countersued. Before going to trial, the Reds dropped the suit and wrote 
Ellis a letter of apology.[5] The municipal court dropped the charges against 
Ellis, though Ellis stated that this incident made him "hate better".[54] 
Ellis finished the 1972 season ninth in the NL in ERA (2.70), sixth in 
winning percentage (.682), fourth in walks per nine innings pitched (1.818), 
and first in home runs per nine innings ratio (0.331). The Pirates won 
the NL East that year and faced the Reds in the 1972 NLCS. The Pirates 
pitched Ellis with a sore arm,[55] but the Reds won the series.[5] Ellis 
said that the scariest moment of his career was when he attempted to pitch 
while sober in a 1973 game. During pre-game warmups, he could not recreate 
his pitching mechanics. Ellis went to his locker, took some amphetamines 
with coffee, and returned to pitch.[56] In August 1973, pictures circulated 
of Ellis wearing hair curlers in the bullpen during pre-game warmups.[1][5] 
The Pirates told him not to wear curlers on the field again. Ellis agreed,[5][57] 
but charged that the Pirates were displaying racism.[5] Ebony devoted a 
spread to Ellis about his hairstyles, which was inspired by the hair curlers.[3] 
After Ellis defeated the Reds by a score of 1-0 in a 1973 game, Joe Morgan 
claimed that Ellis threw a spitball. Anderson had the umpire check Ellis, 
but found no evidence.[58] In his 1980 book, Ellis admitted that wearing 
hair curlers produced sweat on his hair, which he used to throw a modified 
version of a spitball.[5] Ellis missed the last month of the season due 
to tendinitis in his elbow.[4] Despite a strong start from Ellis during 
the playoff chase in the final week of the season,[59] the Pirates lost 
the division to the New York Mets.[60] Ellis again led the league in home 
runs allowed per nine innings pitched ratio (0.328).[61] Ellis attempted 
to hit every batter in the Cincinnati Reds lineup on May 1, 1974, as he 
was angry that the Pirates were intimidated by the Big Red Machine.[1][27] 
Ellis admired Pete Rose and was concerned about how he would respond, but 
Ellis decided to do it regardless.[62] Ellis hit Rose, Joe Morgan, and 
Dan Driessen in the top of the first inning. Cleanup batter Tony Pérez 
avoided Ellis' attempts and drew a walk; the first pitch to Perez was thrown 
behind him and over his head. Ellis threw two pitches that he aimed at 
the head of Johnny Bench, at which point Ellis was removed from the game 
by manager Danny Murtaugh.[1] Ellis' box score for the game reads as follows: 
0 IP, 0 H, 1 R, 1 ER, 1 BB, 0 K.[52] Ellis tied eight other players for 
the MLB record with the three hit batsmen in the inning.[63] Ellis struggled 
at the start of the 1974 season, pitching to a 3–8 win-loss record and 
4.54 ERA through July 10. Subsequently he won eight consecutive games and 
nine out of ten, pitching seven completed games in that ten-game stretch.[64] 
A line drive off of the bat of Willie Montañez fractured the fifth metacarpal 
bone in Ellis' pitching hand on September 10, prematurely ending his season.[65] 
Ellis had the seventh best walks plus hits per inning pitched ratio (1.155).[66] 
The Pirates won the NL East, but they lost the 1974 NLCS three games to 
one to the Los Angeles Dodgers.[67] Healthy to begin the 1975 season, Ellis 
continued to perform well at the beginning of the season.[68] In August, 
the Pirates asked Ellis to pitch in the bullpen; he refused on consecutive 
nights.[69] On August 15, 1975, Ellis refused assignment to the bullpen 
again; as a result, the Pirates suspended him for one day.[5] Ellis called 
for a team meeting the next day, where he was expected to apologize. Instead, 
he berated Murtaugh, who responded by cursing at Ellis, ordering the pitcher 
out of the clubhouse[70] and attempting to fight him.[5] Coach Don Leppert 
reportedly also tried to fight Ellis.[5] The Pirates suspended Ellis for 
thirty days[5] and fined him $2,000.[70] The suspension was lifted on August 
30 when Ellis apologized to Murtaugh.[5] Ellis pitched to an 8-9 win-loss 
record and 3.79 ERA during the 1975 season.[71] The Pirates again won the 
NL East, but were swept by the Reds in the 1975 NLCS in three games. Ellis 
pitched in relief for two innings in Game 1.[72] Ellis sensed that he would 
be traded that offseason due to the fallout from his suspension.[70] On 
December 11, Ellis was traded to the New York Yankees of the American League 
(AL) along with pitcher Ken Brett and top infield prospect Willie Randolph, 
in exchange for pitcher Doc Medich.[73][74] Tired of Ellis' behavior, Pittsburgh 
general manager Joe L. Brown insisted that the Yankees take Ellis as part 
of the deal.[41] With the Yankees, Ellis pitched to a 17–8 win-loss record 
with a 3.15 ERA during the 1976 regular season.[75] His 17 wins were eighth 
in the AL, while his .680 winning percentage was third best. After the 
season, he was voted the AL Comeback Player of the Year by the United Press 
International.[71] The Yankees won the AL East division championship in 
1976. Ellis started in Game 3 of the 1976 American League Championship 
Series (ALCS),[76] getting the win.[41] The Yankees reached the 1976 World 
Series. Ellis started Game 3 but received the loss, allowing four earned 
runs in 3 1⁄3 innings.[77][78] The Reds defeated the Yankees in four games.[79] 
Before the 1977 season, Ellis publicly criticized Yankees owner George 
Steinbrenner for giving him a raise that was inadequate given his 1976 
performance and for interfering with manager Billy Martin.[75][80] As Ellis 
refused to sign his contract, and the Yankees did not want to have players 
who could become free agents,[75][80] the Yankees traded Ellis with Larry 
Murray and Marty Perez to the Oakland Athletics for Mike Torrez in April 
1977.[80] Torrez emerged as a top starting pitcher for the Yankees that 
season, while Ellis struggled.[81] While pitching for Oakland, the team 
asked him to keep charts. Defiant, Ellis set the charts on fire in the 
clubhouse, setting off sprinklers.[5] Ellis ranked this as the "craziest" 
thing he did during his career.[5] On June 15, 1977, the Rangers purchased 
Ellis from the Oakland Athletics. Ellis had a resurgent second half of 
the 1977 season,[82] going 10–6 with a 2.90 ERA.[3] Ellis complained about 
manager Billy Hunter's liquor policy in 1978.[83] Hunter, responding to 
a raucous team flight, banned liquor on team flights; Ellis vowed that 
he would bring liquor on the plane to Toronto anyway.[84] Ellis led a player 
insurrection against manager Billy Hunter's authoritarian style, declaring 
that Hunter "may be Hitler, but he ain't making no lampshade out of me."[85] 
The Rangers organization blamed Ellis for the team's disappointing finish 
in 1978 and indicated that they would look to trade Ellis.[86] However, 
owner Brad Corbett sided with Ellis over Hunter, firing Hunter after the 
season.[87] After starting the 1979 season with a 1–5 win-loss record, 
Ellis was traded to the New York Mets on June 15, 1979 for minor league 
pitchers Mike Bruhert and Bob Myrick. The Mets, seeking to upgrade their 
pitching staff due to poor performances and injuries to Pat Zachry and 
Skip Lockwood, acquired Andy Hassler from the Boston Red Sox on the same 
day.[88] Ellis went 3–7 with a 6.04 ERA with the Mets.[89] Ellis requested 
the Mets send him back to the Pirates. Seeking more pitching in their pennant 
race, the Pirates purchased Ellis from the Mets on September 21, 1979 for 
an undisclosed sum of money;[90] the price was later revealed to be "something 
in excess of the waiver price of $20,000".[91] Ellis made three relief 
appearances with the Pirates that year,[3] retiring after that season. 
Ellis finished his career with a lifetime win-loss record of 138–119 and 
an ERA of 3.46.[3] Ellis threw five distinct pitches: a fastball, a curveball, 
a changeup, a palmball, and what Ellis called a "sliding fastball". The 
latter pitch was distinct from a slider.[92] Ellis trusted his catcher 
to call pitches, and he rarely asked for a new sign.[11] Ellis kept a notebook, 
called "The Book", with detailed information about each hitter's strengths 
and weaknesses. He often asked teammates and members of other teams, including 
pitchers Bob Gibson and Juan Marichal, for advice on how to pitch opposing 
batters.[93] Ellis was married four times.[5] His first wife was Paula;[51] 
they divorced in 1972.[94] Ellis' second wife was Austine, divorced in 
1980,[95] the third wife was Jacquelyn,[5] and the fourth was Hjordis.[1][56] 
Ellis had three children and two grandchildren; both daughters have since 
died, one in 2003 due to complications arising from type 1 diabetes.[1][56] 
Ellis had a daughter, Shangalesa, with Paula.[94] His son with Austine, 
Dock Ellis III (Trey), played college basketball at California State University, 
Bakersfield.[27][96] Trey fathered Ellis' first grandchild, Dock Phillip 
Ellis IV. Ellis' youngest daughter Simone, who mothered Ellis' second grandchild, 
passed in December 2012 after losing her battle with cancer. Ellis stopped 
using drugs and alcohol in 1980, when his son was an infant.[27] Ellis 
fought for players' rights, including the right to free agency. Jackie 
Robinson credited him with trying to further the rights of African American 
players, but warned him that he said too much.[1] In 1971, Ellis testified 
before the United States Senate Subcommittee on Public Health about his 
experiences with sickle cell[6] and later worked with people who had the 
disease and raised money for sickle cell research.[89] Ellis collaborated 
with future United States Poet Laureate Donald Hall on a book, Dock Ellis 
in the Country of Baseball, published in 1976. Although Hall knew of the 
LSD incident, he did not include it in the first edition of his book.[97] 
Ellis retired from baseball in the spring of 1980, saying that he lost 
interest in the game. That year, Ellis entered drug treatment, staying 
for forty days at The Meadows in Wickenburg, Arizona.[1][5] In 1984, he 
revealed that he had pitched his no-hitter under the influence of LSD.[2] 
Ellis lived in Apple Valley, California.[1] He worked in Victorville, California 
as a drug counselor.[1][27][56] He also counseled prisoners in Pittsburgh 
and at a prison in Adelanto, California.[1] The Yankees hired Ellis in 
the 1980s to work with their minor league players,[98] including Pascual 
Perez, whom he counseled for drug problems.[1][2] In 2005, Ellis began 
teaching weekly classes for individuals convicted of driving under the 
influence.[56] Ellis also appeared in the 1986 film Gung Ho, directed by 
Ron Howard.[99] In 1989, Ellis served as player/coach for the St. Petersburg 
Pelicans of the Senior Professional Baseball Association and went 0–2 with 
a 1.76 ERA and seven saves as a part of the team's bullpen.[2] In 1990, 
he allowed no earned runs and recorded two saves for the Pelicans before 
the league folded. He continued to play in the Los Angeles Veterans League.[5] 
Ellis was diagnosed with cirrhosis in 2007 and was placed on the list for 
a liver transplant.[37] Though he had no health insurance, friends from 
his baseball career helped him to pay his medical bills.[100] However, 
Ellis suffered heart damage in his last weeks of life, which made a transplant 
impossible.[1] Ellis died on December 19, 2008 at Los Angeles County-USC 
Medical Center due to his liver ailment.[100] Services were held at the 
Angelus Funeral Home.[1] He is interred at Inglewood Park Cemetery in Inglewood, 
California.[101] His life was the subject of the critically acclaimed 2014
