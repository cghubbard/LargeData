As player As manager As coach Ronald "Ron" Washington (born April 29, 1952) 
is a former Major League Baseball (MLB) shortstop, and current third base 
coach for the Atlanta Braves. He is also the former manager of the Texas 
Rangers whom he took to the World Series in 2010 and 2011.[1] Prior to 
managing the Rangers, Washington coached in the New York Mets and Oakland 
Athletics organizations. He is one of only three MLB players, along with 
U L Washington and Frank White, who were products of the Royals Academy.[2] 
Washington was signed by the Kansas City Royals on July 17, 1970. He spent 
the next ten seasons in the minor leagues with three different organizations 
(Royals, Mets, and Dodgers). He earned a brief September callup with the 
Los Angeles Dodgers in 1977 hitting .368 (7 for 19). He would not return 
to the major league level until 1981 with the Minnesota Twins where he 
would remain until 1986. He then played one season each for the Baltimore 
Orioles, Cleveland Indians, and Houston Astros before retiring from Triple-A 
Oklahoma City in 1990. He was a middle infielder for most of his career. 
On May 28, 1988, while playing for the Indians, Washington broke up Milwaukee 
Brewers pitcher Odell Jones' no-hit bid after 8 and 1/3 innings with a 
pinch-hit single.[3] Following his retirement as a player, Washington worked 
in the New York Mets organization for five years. After being hired as 
the Oakland Athletics first base coach in 1996 under his former Astros 
manager Art Howe, Washington then served as infield and third base coach 
for the A's between 1997 and 2006. As infield coach Washington has been 
credited for developing much of the A's young infield talent in the last 
decade, including six-time Gold Glover Eric Chavez, and former MVP and 
A's shortstop Miguel Tejada. In 2004, Chavez expressed his appreciation 
by giving Washington one of his Gold Glove trophies, signed "Wash, not 
without you."[4] Washington plays a significant role in the events of the 
book Moneyball, a book detailing how the A's have been successful despite 
a small budget. Washington is shown in a positive light for the way he 
trained Scott Hatteberg to field first base for the first time in his career. 
Washington is also, however, portrayed as too old-fashioned and traditional 
in his lack of acceptance of general manager Billy Beane's sabermetric 
strategies. He was portrayed in the film adaptation of the book by Brent 
Jennings. Washington parodied his character in Moneyball during a July 
2014 Texas Rangers commercial in which he repeated the line "It's incredibly 
hard". On November 6, 2006, the Texas Rangers announced that Washington 
had accepted their offer to manage the team[5] replacing Buck Showalter, 
who was fired a month earlier. Washington beat out four other candidates 
for the job: Rangers bench coach Don Wakamatsu, then New York Mets third 
base coach Manny Acta, Nippon Ham Fighters manager Trey Hillman[6] and 
former Rangers catcher John Russell.[7] At the beginning of the 2007 season, 
it was rumored that there was a rift between Washington and Rangers star 
Mark Teixeira. Asked about it, Washington responded, A lot of times we 
make three outs on four or five pitches... I just can't see that late in 
the game when you're four or five runs down. You're at the point where 
the starter is out of the game, you're in the middle (of the bullpen), 
these are the guys you want to get to. I've never asked him (Teixeira) 
to do it when the closer is in the game. But the middle guys, you want 
to make 'em throw... He feels like he's going to only get one pitch in 
that type of situation to do something with. He wants to take advantage 
of it. I've got no problem with that. But can you guarantee with that one 
pitch that you're going to do something with it? I don't think any ballplayer 
on earth can guarantee that. You might pop it up, miss it, roll over it, 
jam yourself. Then you make one out on one pitch. I want to see him get 
a pitchers' strike right there.[8] Teixeira was traded to the Atlanta Braves 
in July 2007 and had been rumored to have been on the trading block before 
reports of tensions with Washington, as his agent, Scott Boras, had refused 
to negotiate a contract extension beyond the 2008 season. Reports also 
suggested tensions between Washington and catcher Gerald Laird. Questioned 
about the rumors, Washington conceded that the pressure he put on Laird 
was "a lot to put on a young kid... (But) that's what we've got. He's got 
to grow up fast."[9] On March 17, 2010, Jon Heyman of Sports Illustrated 
reported that Washington tested positive for cocaine during the 2009 season 
and has acknowledged using cocaine.[10] In 2010, Washington became the 
second manager of the Rangers franchise (after Johnny Oates) to take his 
team to the postseason. On October 12, 2010, Washington became the first 
manager in franchise history to win a playoff series, with a 3–2 victory 
in the ALDS over the Tampa Bay Rays. On October 22, 2010, Washington's 
Rangers defeated the New York Yankees in the ALCS in six games, to advance 
to their first World Series in franchise history, before losing to the 
San Francisco Giants in five games. He also became the third African American 
to manage a team into a World Series, joining Cito Gaston, who managed 
the Toronto Blue Jays to the World Championship in the 1992 and 1993 World 
Series, and Dusty Baker, who managed the Giants in the 2002 World Series. 
Referring to Washington, second baseman Ian Kinsler said: "I just love 
the way he never holds his emotion back, especially when he's managing. 
He hangs on every pitch, and it's great to know that your manager is in 
every single pitch and cares that much."[11] In 2009 his salary was about 
$750,000.[12] On November 4, 2010, Washington agreed to a two-year contract 
extension. On October 15, 2011, Washington managed the Rangers to their 
second World Series in as many years, when the Rangers defeated the Detroit 
Tigers in the ALCS. The Rangers eventually lost to the St. Louis Cardinals 
in 7 games, after twice being one strike away from the title in game 6. 
On January 30, 2012, Washington agreed to another two-year contract extension. 
He managed the American League in the 2012 MLB All-Star Game. On September 
2, 2012, Washington earned his 507th win as a manager of the Texas Rangers, 
passing Johnny Oates for 2nd most wins by a Rangers manager. On August 
4, 2013, Washington passed Bobby Valentine for the most wins as a Rangers 
manager, at 582. Following the conclusion of the 2014 season, Washington 
is scheduled to travel to Japan to manage a team of MLB All-Stars playing 
against All-Stars of Nippon Professional Baseball in the 2014 Major League 
Baseball Japan All-Star Series.[13] On September 5, 2014, Washington announced 
his resignation as manager of the Rangers, citing personal reasons.[14] 
On September 11, 2014, it was announced by several media outlets that Ron 
Washington's resignation may be related to allegations of sexual assault 
against a reporter.[15] On September 18, 2014, Washington announced that 
he had been having an extramarital affair, and that he had resigned to 
reconcile with his family.[16] Washington's managerial record with the 
Rangers was 664–611 (.521), including four consecutive 90-win seasons (2010–13), 
and two pennants. However, his 2014 squad was only 53–87 (.379). Washington 
was hired as an infield coach by the Oakland Athletics on May 21, 2015.[17] 
He became the A's third base coach on August 24, 2015.[18] In October 2016, 
it was learned that Washington was a finalist for the Atlanta Braves managerial 
vacancy. The Braves opted to promote interim manager Brian Snitker instead, 
and then announced the hiring of Washington as their new third base coach,
