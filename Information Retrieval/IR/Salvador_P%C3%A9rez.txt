Salvador Johan Pérez Diaz (born May 10, 1990) is a Venezuelan professional 
baseball catcher for the Kansas City Royals of Major League Baseball (MLB). 
He is a four-time MLB All-Star, four-time Gold Glove Award winner, and 
won the World Series Most Valuable Player Award when the Royals won the 
2015 World Series. Pérez was born in Valencia, Carabobo, Venezuela. He 
was abandoned by his father at age four and raised by his mother, Yilda 
Diaz. When he was eight years old, the two relocated to Valencia to live 
with Yilda's mother, Carmen de Diaz. Yilda supported the family by selling 
homemade cakes, flan, and lasagna.[1] To keep her only child busy, Yilda 
enrolled him in a baseball school in Valencia, where he showed an ability 
to throw, catch, and hit balls as young as age six. He played pitcher and 
shortstop with teams competing in state and national tournaments. At age 
eight, he indicated his preference to play catcher, and, at 14, set his 
mind to playing that position professionally.[1] Pérez played with and 
against current Major Leaguer and fellow Venezuelan second baseman José 
Altuve during his boyhood.[2] Pérez was signed by the Royals for $65,000 
when he was 16 years old.[3] His minor league career began in 2007 when 
he was placed in the Arizona Rookie League.[3] Pérez was called up to the 
majors for the first time on August 10, 2011.[4] He picked off two baserunners, 
caught five popups – both uncommon occurrences for the Royals that season 
– and recorded his first hit.[1] On August 29, Pérez hit his first Major 
League home run against Max Scherzer of the Detroit Tigers. In that game, 
Pérez was a triple away from hitting for the cycle. In his rookie year, 
he batted .331 with 3 HRs and 21 runs driven in, in 39 games played. On 
February 27, 2012, Pérez signed a five-year, $7 million extension that 
includes three club options. He is under team control through 2019. He 
could earn up to $26.75 million if he reaches all of his incentives and 
all of his options are picked up. The extension covers his pre-arbitration 
seasons, two of his three arbitration eligible years, and, if all of his 
options are picked up, his final arbitration year and his first two years 
of free agency.[5] Pérez earned $.75 million in 2012, $1 million in 2013, 
$1.5 million in 2014, $1.75 million in 2015 and will earn $2 million in 
2016. His options are $3.75 million in 2017, $5 million in 2018 and $6 
million in 2019. While catching a bullpen session before a spring training 
game in 2012, Pérez tore the meniscus in his left knee.[6] He did not return 
until July 2. In the 2012 season, he hit .301 with 11 homers and 39 RBIs 
in 79 games played. On July 16, 2013, Pérez was the catcher for Mariano 
Rivera in Rivera's final All-Star Game before retirement. After the season, 
Pérez was awarded the American League Gold Glove Award for his defense 
at catcher.[7] He finished the year playing 138 games with a .292 batting 
average, 13 home runs, and 79 RBI. In 2014 he logged more starts (143) 
than any other catcher in the Major Leagues.[8] Pérez played 150 games 
all together in 2014 batting .260 with 28 doubles, 17 home runs, and 70 
RBI. In the 2014 American League Wild Card Playoff, Pérez singled down 
the left field line in the bottom of the 12th inning, knocking in the winning 
run to lift the Royals over the Oakland As 9–8.[9] In Game 1 of the 2014 
World Series against the San Francisco Giants, Pérez hit a home run off 
eventual series MVP Madison Bumgarner, representing the only run given 
up by Bumgarner in five World Series appearances covering 36 innings. Pérez 
was the final out of the series, popping out to Pablo Sandoval in foul 
territory to clinch the series for the Giants.[10] In 2015, Pérez was voted 
to start in the 2015 All-Star Game, his third All-Star appearance.[11] 
Pérez batted .364 in the 2015 World Series, which the Royals won in five 
games. In the Series-clinching win, Perez grounded to third in the ninth 
inning allowing the tying run in the Royals' comeback. The game continued 
into extra innings. In the 12th, Perez singled to right with no outs and 
Jarrod Dyson pinch ran for Perez. Dyson would eventually score, giving 
the Royals their first lead of the night. The Royals won 7–2 in the twelfth 
inning, making them the 2015 World Series Champions.[12] Pérez was unanimously 
named the World Series Most Valuable Player.[13] He is the first catcher 
to win the award since 1992 and the second Venezuelan to win World Series 
MVP.[14] He won his third consecutive Gold Glove Award in 2015.[15] On 
March 1, Pérez signed a five-year extension to remain with the team.[16] 
Pérez would finish the 2016 season with 22 home runs, more than any other 
American League catcher en route to his first career Silver Slugger award. 
Pérez won his fourth consecutive Gold Glove Award on November 8th. Near 
the end of the 2013 season, teammate Alcides Escobar sprayed Pérez with 
Victoria's Secret women's perfume and he had four hits. Pérez continued 
to wear perfume during games as a good-luck charm, switching to 212 VIP 
cologne by Carolina Herrera in 2014.[3][17] Pérez is also well known for 
giving a Gatorade shower (Salvy Splash) to teammates during television 
interviews after every home win and notable away wins.[18][19] Pérez delighted 
fans with his positive attitude and humorous postings on social media. 
In the 2014 and 2015 season, Pérez made a habit of playfully pestering 
teammate Lorenzo Cain by taking videos of him and posting them on Instagram.[20]
