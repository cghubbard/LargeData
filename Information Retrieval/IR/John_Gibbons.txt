As player As manager As coach John Michael Gibbons (born June 8, 1962[1]) 
is an American former professional baseball player and the current manager 
of the Toronto Blue Jays of Major League Baseball (MLB). Gibbons briefly 
played in the Major Leagues as a catcher with the New York Mets, in the 
mid-1980s. Gibbons was born in Great Falls, Montana and raised in San Antonio, 
Texas, where he attended Douglas MacArthur High School.[2][3] The son of 
United States Air Force colonel William Gibbons, he had his first Little 
League Baseball at-bat while playing in Happy Valley-Goose Bay, Labrador, 
Canada, where the family lived temporarily.[4] After being selected by 
the New York Mets with the 24th overall pick of the 1980 amateur draft, 
Gibbons had a very brief 18-game major league playing career as a catcher 
with the Mets in 1984 and 1986. He was projected to be the Mets' catcher 
of the future[by whom?] but he batted only .220, with one home run and 
2 RBIs (but 16 strikeouts) in 50 at-bats. Injuries also took a toll on 
him so he retired as a player in 1990. Gibbons served as the Mets' bullpen 
catcher during the 1986 postseason, in which the Mets won the World Series.[3][5] 
Gibbons began his coaching career with the Mets in 1991 as a minor league 
hitting instructor. In 1994, he joined the Capital City Bombers, the Mets' 
South Atlantic League franchise, as a coach. Gibbons began his successful 
minor-league managing career in the Mets' organization with the Kingsport 
Mets, guiding them to the Appalachian League championship in 1995. He followed 
that by guiding the St. Lucie Mets to the Florida State League title the 
next season. In 1998, he led the Eastern League's Binghamton Mets to the 
playoffs, and then immediately followed that with three seasons as manager 
of the Norfolk Tides. He led the Tides to the International League playoffs 
in 2001.[6] Hired by the Toronto Blue Jays' former general manager J. P. 
Ricciardi in 2002, as a bullpen catcher, Gibbons worked his way up to first 
base coach in June 2002. Ricciardi was his former roommate in the minor 
leagues.[7] After Ricciardi fired manager Carlos Tosca in 2004, Gibbons 
was promoted to the manager position. The Blue Jays went 20–30 with Gibbons 
at the helm. At the end of the 2004 regular season, Gibbons signed a one-year 
contract as the manager for the 2005 season. This contract was extended 
for three seasons just a week into the 2005 season.[citation needed] Gibbons 
went on to lead the Jays to an 80–82 record in his first full season as 
a big league manager. Expectations were higher in 2006, after the Blue 
Jays acquired A.J. Burnett, Troy Glaus, Lyle Overbay, B. J. Ryan, and Bengie 
Molina. Toronto ended the season in second place in the American League 
East division with an 87–75 record, one game ahead of the Boston Red Sox. 
Although they finished 10 games out of first, it was the first time the 
Jays had finished higher than third since 1993, when they won their second 
of two consecutive World Series titles. With the Blue Jays mired in a slump 
that put them five games below .500, Gibbons was fired on June 20, 2008. 
He was replaced by former Jays manager Cito Gaston.[3] He finished with 
a record of 305 wins and 305 losses.[8] On October 10, 2008, Gibbons was 
hired as the bench coach by the Kansas City Royals, replacing Dave Owen[9] 
who became the third base coach. Gibbons was hired at the end of the 2011 
season to manage the San Diego Padres' Double-A affiliate, the San Antonio 
Missions.[10] On November 20, 2012, it was announced that Gibbons was re-hired 
as manager of the Toronto Blue Jays[11] on a two–year rolling contract.[12] 
Gibbons was named to the 2013 American League All-Star coaching staff by 
Detroit Tigers manager Jim Leyland.[13] The Blue Jays finished the 2013 
season with a 74–88 record, putting them last in the AL East.[8] In 2014, 
the Blue Jays were six games up in the AL East title race on June 6, 2014, 
but posted a 45–54 record from that point on, including a 9–17 record in 
August. They would finish the season with a record of 83–79,[8] good enough 
for third place in the AL East,[8] and 5 games back of a wild card spot.[14] 
On June 22, 2015, the Blue Jays defeated the Tampa Bay Rays 8–5 for Gibbons' 
500th managerial win.[15] On August 2, Gibbons was ejected for the third 
time in the 2015 season, for arguing with umpire Jim Wolf. Gibbons returned 
to the field later in the game during a bench-clearing incident, and was 
subsequently suspended 1 game.[16] On September 25, 2015, Gibbons and the 
Blue Jays ended the team's 22-year playoff drought by clinching a playoff 
berth.[17] Five days later, the Blue Jays defeated the Baltimore Orioles 
15–2, and clinched the American League East.[18] On October 14, 2015 the 
Blue Jays defeated the Texas Rangers to win the American League Division 
Series after losing the first two games of the series. The Blue Jays moved 
on to play in their first American League Championship Series since 1993. 
They would, however, lose the series to the eventual World Series winners, 
the Kansas City Royals, 4 games to 2. On April 5, 2016, after a 3–2 loss 
to the Tampa Bay Rays ended on a questionable slide by José Bautista which 
was ruled as a double play, Gibbons stated, "Maybe we'll come out and wear 
dresses tomorrow. Maybe that's what everybody's looking for." A day later, 
after he received criticism for his initial comment, he said that "the 
world needs to lighten up a little bit".[19] On May 17, 2016, Gibbons was 
suspended three games by Major League Baseball for his role in a benches-clearing 
incident between the Blue Jays and Texas Rangers on May 15 involving Rangers 
infielder Rougned Odor and Blue Jays outfielder Jose Bautista.[20] On September 
11, Gibbons was ejected for the eighth time in the 2016 season, tying the
