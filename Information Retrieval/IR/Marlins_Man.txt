Laurence Leavy, better known as Marlins Man or Marlins Guy (born October 
13, 1956), is an American attorney and sports fan from North Miami Beach, 
Florida who, beginning in 2012, gained notoriety for his frequent appearances 
at major sporting events while wearing orange Miami Marlins apparel. His 
seating placement in view of broadcast cameras has drawn attention at the 
World Series, Super Bowl, NBA Finals, Kentucky Derby, College World Series 
and other events.[1] Leavy has been described by USA Today as a "ubiquitous 
superfan".[2] Leavy announced in a tweet in July 2016 that he was originally 
a fan of the Atlanta Braves from 1974-1993.[3] At a 2012 Miami Heat playoff 
game in which white T-shirts were distributed, Leavy stood out in his bright 
orange Miami Marlins jersey. After attending a Marlins game the same day, 
the white T-shirt was stolen from his seat, causing him to be visible on 
television. Later that year, Leavy was seen sitting behind home plate at 
AT&T Park during the World Series.[4] The following day, a park ranger 
near the Golden Gate Bridge coined the term "Marlins Man".[5] Leavy credits 
his rise to prominence to the new color scheme introduced by the Miami 
Marlins in 2012.[6] He lists his favorite sports teams as the Miami Marlins, 
Heat, Dolphins and Florida State Seminoles.[1] He is also notable for being 
one of Pardon My Take's "Wokest Guests", along with AJ Green and Addison 
Russell. In addition to the World Series, Leavy has been spotted by media 
at a variety of other events. In 2014, Leavy estimated that he spent an 
average of 300 days per year traveling to sporting events.[1] In May 2014, 
media spotted Leavy behind the Oklahoma City Thunder bench in a Western 
Conference semifinals playoff game against the Los Angeles Clippers.[7]
