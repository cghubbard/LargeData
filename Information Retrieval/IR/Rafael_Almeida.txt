Rafael D. Almeida (July 30, 1887 in Havana, Cuba – March 19, 1968 in Havana, 
Cuba) was a Major League Baseball third baseman from 1911 to 1913 with 
the Cincinnati Reds. Almeida and Armando Marsans debuted together with 
the Reds on July 4, 1911.[1] They are sometimes named the first major league 
players born in Cuba, which is disputable because Cuban-born Steve Bellán 
played from 1871 to 1873 in the National Association of Professional Base 
Ball Players (NA), a league whose status as a major league is disputed. 
Six years before Cincinnati, Almeida and Marsans both played "Negro baseball" 
in the United States as 1905 members of the integrated All Cubans.[2] Almeida 
played winter baseball in the Cuban League from 1904 to 1925 and was one 
of ten players elected to the Cuban Baseball Hall of Fame in its 1939 inaugural
