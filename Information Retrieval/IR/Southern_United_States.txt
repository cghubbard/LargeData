The Southern United States, commonly referred to as the American South, 
Dixie, or simply the South, is a region of the United States of America. 
The South does not exactly match the geographic south, but is predominantly 
located in the southeastern corner; Arizona and New Mexico, which are geographically 
in the southern part of the country, are rarely considered part of the 
Southern United States, while West Virginia, which separated from Virginia 
in 1863,[2] commonly is.[3][4][5] Some scholars have proposed definitions 
of the South that do not coincide neatly with state boundaries.[6][7] While 
the states of Delaware and Maryland, as well as the District of Columbia 
permitted slavery prior to the start of the Civil War, they remained with 
the Union. Since the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s, they became more 
culturally, economically, and politically aligned with the industrial Northern 
states, and are often identified as part of the Mid-Atlantic and/or Northeast 
by many residents, businesses, public institutions, and private organizations.[8][9][10][11][12] 
However, the United States Census Bureau puts them in the South. Usually, 
the South is defined as including the southeastern and south-central United 
States. The region is known for its culture and history, having developed 
its own customs, musical styles, and cuisines, which have distinguished 
it in some ways from the rest of the United States. The Southern ethnic 
heritage is diverse and includes strong European (mostly Scotch-Irish, 
Scottish, English, German and French), African, and some Native American 
components.[13] Some other aspects of the historical and cultural development 
of the South have been influenced by an early support for the doctrine 
of states' rights, the institution of slave labor on plantations in the 
Lower South to an extent seen nowhere else in the United States; the presence 
of a large proportion of African Americans in the population; and the legacy 
of the Civil War and Reconstruction Era, as seen in thousands of lynchings 
(mostly from 1880 to 1930), the segregated system of separate schools and 
public facilities known as "Jim Crow laws", that lasted until the 1960s, 
and the widespread use of poll taxes and other methods to frequently deny 
black people of the right to vote or hold office until the 1960s. Since 
the late 1960s, black people have held many offices in Southern states, 
especially in the coastal states of Virginia and South Carolina. Many black 
people have also been elected or appointed as mayors and police chiefs 
in the metropolises of Memphis, Houston, Atlanta, and New Orleans, and 
serve in both the U.S. Congress and state legislatures.[14] Historically, 
the South relied heavily on agriculture, and was highly rural until after 
1945. It has since become more industrialized and urban and has attracted 
national and international migrants. The American South is now among the 
fastest-growing areas in the United States. Houston is the largest city 
in the Southern United States.[15] Sociological research indicates that 
Southern collective identity stems from political, demographic, and cultural 
distinctiveness from the rest of the United States. The region contains 
almost all of the Bible Belt, an area of high Protestant church attendance 
(especially evangelical churches such as the Southern Baptist Convention) 
and predominantly conservative, religion-influenced politics. Indeed, studies 
have shown that Southerners are more conservative than non-Southerners 
in several areas, including religion, morality, international relations 
and race relations.[16][17] This is evident in both the region's religious 
attendance figures and in the region's usually strong support for the Republican 
Party in political elections since the 1960s, and especially since the 
1990s.[16][17] Apart from its climate, the living experience in the South 
increasingly resembles the rest of the nation. The arrival of millions 
of Northerners (especially in major metropolitan areas and coastal areas)[18] 
and millions of Hispanics[19] meant the introduction of cultural values 
and social norms not rooted in Southern traditions.[20][21] Observers conclude 
that collective identity and Southern distinctiveness are thus declining, 
particularly when defined against "an earlier South that was somehow more 
authentic, real, more unified and distinct".[22] The process has worked 
both ways, however, with aspects of Southern culture spreading throughout 
a greater portion of the rest of the United States in a process termed 
"Southernization".[23] The question of how to define the subregions in 
the South has been the focus of research for nearly a century.[24][25] 
As defined by the United States Census Bureau,[1] the Southern region of 
the United States includes sixteen states. As of 2010, an estimated 114,555,744 
people, or thirty-seven percent of all U.S. residents, lived in the South, 
the nation's most populous region.[26] The Census Bureau defined three 
smaller divisions: The Council of State Governments, an organization for 
communication and coordination between states, includes in its South regional 
office the states of Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, 
Mississippi, Missouri, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, 
Texas, Virginia, and West Virginia.[27] Other terms related to the South 
include: The popular definition of the "South" is more informal and generally 
associated with the 11 states that seceded before or during the Civil War 
to form the Confederate States of America.[41] In order of their secession, 
these were: South Carolina, Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, 
Texas, Virginia, Arkansas, Tennessee, and North Carolina. These states 
share commonalities of history and culture that carry on to the present 
day. Oklahoma was not a state during the Civil War, but all its major Native 
American tribes signed formal treaties of alliance with the Confederacy.[citation 
needed] The South is a diverse meteorological region with numerous climatic 
zones, including temperate, sub-tropical, tropical, and arid—though the 
South is generally regarded as hot and humid, with long summers and short, 
mild winters. Most of the south—except for the higher elevations and areas 
near the western, southern and some northern fringes—fall in the humid 
subtropical climate zone. Crops grow easily in the South; its climate consistently 
provides growing seasons of at least six months before the first frost. 
Landscapes, particularly in the Southeast, are characterized by live oaks, 
Lagerstroemia indica, Nandina domestica, camellias, southern magnolia trees, 
yellow jessamine vines, Spanish moss, cabbage palms and flowering dogwoods. 
Another common environment is found in the bayous and swamplands of the 
Gulf Coast, especially in Louisiana and Texas. Parts of the rural South 
have been overrun by kudzu, an invasive, fast-growing, leafy vine that 
can spread over trees, land, roads, and buildings, choking and killing 
indigenous plants. Kudzu is a particularly severe problem in the Piedmont 
regions of South Carolina, Mississippi, Alabama, and Georgia.[42] The first 
well-dated evidence of human occupation in the south United States occurs 
around 9500 BC with the appearance of the earliest documented Americans, 
who are now referred to as Paleo-Indians.[43] Paleoindians were hunter-gathers 
that roamed in bands and frequently hunted megafauna. Several cultural 
stages, such as Archaic (ca. 8000–1000 BC) and the Woodland (ca. 1000 BC 
– AD 1000), preceded what the Europeans found at the end of the 15th century—the 
Mississippian culture.[43] The Mississippian culture was a complex, mound-building 
Native American culture that flourished in what is now the southeastern 
United States from approximately 800 AD to 1500 AD. Natives had elaborate 
and lengthy trading routes connecting their main residential and ceremonial 
centers extending through the river valleys and from the East Coast to 
the Great Lakes.[43] Some noted explorers who encountered and described 
the Mississippian culture, by then in decline, included Pánfilo de Narváez 
(1528), Hernando de Soto (1540), and Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville (1699). 
Native American descendants of the mound-builders include Alabama, Apalachee, 
Caddo, Cherokee, Chickasaw, Choctaw, Creek, Guale, Hitchiti, Houma, and 
Seminole peoples, all of whom still reside in the South. Other peoples 
whose ancestral links to the Mississippian culture are less clear but were 
clearly in the region before the European incursion include the Catawba 
and the Powhatan. European immigration resulted in a corresponding die 
off of Native Americans who had not been exposed to various diseases.[44] 
The predominant culture of the South was rooted in the settlement of the 
region by British colonists. In the 17th century, most voluntary immigrants 
were of English origins who settled chiefly along the coastal regions of 
the Eastern seaboard but had pushed as far inland as the Appalachian Mountains 
by the 18th century. The majority of early English settlers were indentured 
servants, who gained freedom after enough work to pay off their passage. 
The wealthier men who paid their way received land grants known as headrights, 
to encourage settlement.[45] The Spanish and French established colonies 
in Florida, Texas and Louisiana. The Spanish colonized Florida in the 16th 
century, with their communities reaching a peak in the late 17th century. 
In the British colonies, immigration began in 1607 and continued until 
the outbreak of the Revolution in 1775. Settlers cleared land, built houses 
and outbuildings, and on their own farms. The rich owned large plantations 
that dominated export agriculture and used black slaves. Many were involved 
in the labor-intensive cultivation of tobacco, the first cash crop of Virginia. 
Tobacco exhausted the soil quickly, requiring that farmers regularly clear 
new fields. They used old fields as pasture, and for crops such as corn 
and wheat, or allowed them to grow into woodlots.[46] In the mid-to-late-18th 
century, large groups of Ulster Scots (later called the Scotch-Irish) and 
people from the Anglo-Scottish border region immigrated and settled in 
the back country of Appalachia and the Piedmont. They were the largest 
group of non-English immigrants from the British Isles before the American 
Revolution.[47] In the 1980 Census, 34% of Southerners reported that they 
were of English ancestry; English was the largest reported European ancestry 
in every Southern state by a large margin.[48] The early colonists engaged 
in warfare, trade, and cultural exchanges. Those living in the backcountry 
were more likely to encounter Creek Indians, Cherokee, and Choctaws and 
other regional native groups. The oldest university in the South, the College 
of William & Mary, was founded in 1693 in Virginia; it pioneered in the 
teaching of political economy and educated future U.S. Presidents Jefferson, 
Monroe and Tyler, all from Virginia. Indeed, the entire region dominated 
politics in the First Party System era: for example, four of the first 
five presidents—Washington, Jefferson, Madison, and Monroe—were from Virginia. 
The two oldest public universities are also in the South: the University 
of North Carolina (1789) and the University of Georgia (1785). With Virginia 
in the lead, the Southern colonies embraced the American Revolution, providing 
such leaders as commander in chief George Washington, and the author of 
the Declaration of Independence, Thomas Jefferson. In 1780–81, the British 
largely halted reconquest of the northern states, and concentrated on the 
south, where they were told there was a large Loyalist population ready 
to leap to arms once the royal forces arrived. The British took control 
of Savannah and Charleston, capturing a large American army in the process, 
and set up a network of bases inland. There were many more Loyalists in 
the South than in the North,[49] but they were concentrated in larger coastal 
cities and were not great enough in number to overcome the revolutionaries. 
Large numbers of loyalists from South Carolina fought for the British in 
the Battle of Camden. The British forces at the Battle of Monck's Corner 
and the Battle of Lenud's Ferry consisted entirely of Loyalists with the 
exception of the commanding officer (Banastre Tarleton).[50] Both white 
and black Loyalists fought for the British at the Battle of Kemp's Landing 
in Virginia.[51][52] Led by Nathanael Greene and other generals, the Americans 
engaged in Fabian tactics designed to wear down the British invasion force, 
and to neutralize its strong points one by one. There were numerous battles 
large and small, with each side claiming some victories. By 1781, however, 
British General Cornwallis moved north to Virginia, where an approaching 
army forced him to fortify and await rescue by the British Navy. The British 
Navy did arrive, but so did a stronger French fleet, and Cornwallis was 
trapped. American and French armies, led by Washington, forced Cornwallis 
to surrender his entire army in Yorktown, Virginia in October 1781, effectively 
winning the North American part of the war.[53] The Revolution provided 
a shock to slavery in the South. Thousands of slaves took advantage of 
wartime disruption to find their own freedom, catalyzed by the British 
Governor Dunmore of Virginia's promise of freedom for service. Many others 
were removed by Loyalist owners and became slaves elsewhere in the Empire. 
Between 1770 and 1790, there was a sharp decline in the percentage of blacks 
– from 61% percent to 44% in South Carolina and from 45% to 36% in Georgia.[54] 
In addition, some slaveholders were inspired to free their slaves after 
the Revolution. They were moved by the principles of the Revolution, and 
Quaker and Methodist preachers worked to encourage slaveholders to free 
their slaves. Planters such as George Washington often freed slaves by 
their wills. In the upper South, more than 10 percent of all blacks were 
free by 1810, a significant expansion from pre-war proportions of less 
than 1 percent free.[55] Cotton became dominant in the lower South after 
1800. After the invention of the cotton gin, short staple cotton could 
be grown more widely. This led to an explosion of cotton cultivation, especially 
in the frontier uplands of Georgia, Alabama and other parts of the Deep 
South, as well as riverfront areas of the Mississippi Delta. Migrants poured 
into those areas in the early decades of the 19th century, when county 
population figures rose and fell as swells of people kept moving west. 
The expansion of cotton cultivation required more slave labor, and the 
institution became even more deeply an integral part of the South's economy.[56] 
With the opening up of frontier lands after the government forced most 
Native Americans to move west of the Mississippi, there was a major migration 
of both whites and blacks to those territories. From the 1820s through 
the 1850s, more than one million enslaved Africans were transported to 
the Deep South in forced migration, two-thirds of them by slave traders 
and the others by masters who moved there. Planters in the Upper South 
sold slaves excess to their needs as they shifted from tobacco to mixed 
agriculture. Many enslaved families were broken up, as planters preferred 
mostly strong males for field work.[57] Two major political issues that 
festered in the first half of the 19th century caused political alignment 
along sectional lines, strengthened the identities of North and South as 
distinct regions with certain strongly opposed interests, and fed the arguments 
over states' rights that culminated in secession and the Civil War. One 
of these issues concerned the protective tariffs enacted to assist the 
growth of the manufacturing sector, primarily in the North. In 1832, in 
resistance to federal legislation increasing tariffs, South Carolina passed 
an ordinance of nullification, a procedure in which a state would, in effect, 
repeal a Federal law. Soon a naval flotilla was sent to Charleston harbor, 
and the threat of landing ground troops was used to compel the collection 
of tariffs. A compromise was reached by which the tariffs would be gradually 
reduced, but the underlying argument over states' rights continued to escalate 
in the following decades. The second issue concerned slavery, primarily 
the question of whether slavery would be permitted in newly admitted states. 
The issue was initially finessed by political compromises designed to balance 
the number of "free" and "slave" states. The issue resurfaced in more virulent 
form, however, around the time of the Mexican–American War, which raised 
the stakes by adding new territories primarily on the Southern side of 
the imaginary geographic divide. Congress opposed allowing slavery in these 
territories. Before the Civil War, the number of immigrants arriving at 
Southern ports began to increase, although the North continued to receive 
the most immigrants. Hugenots were among the first settlers in Charleston, 
along with the largest number of Hasidic Jews outside of New York City.[citation 
needed] Numerous Irish immigrants settled in New Orleans, establishing 
a distinct ethnic enclave now known as the Irish Channel. Germans also 
went to New Orleans and its environs, resulting in a large area north of 
the city (along the Mississippi) becoming known as the German Coast; however, 
still greater numbers immigrated to Texas (especially after 1848), where 
many bought land and were farmers. Many more German immigrants arrived 
in Texas after the Civil War, where they created the brewing industry in 
Houston and elsewhere, became grocers in numerous cities, and also established 
wide areas of farming. By 1856, the South had lost control of Congress, 
and was no longer able to silence calls for an end to slavery—which came 
mostly from the more populated, free states of the North. The Republican 
Party, founded in 1854, pledged to stop the spread of slavery beyond those 
states where it already existed. After Abraham Lincoln was elected the 
first Republican president in 1860, seven cotton states declared their 
secession and formed the Confederate States of America before Lincoln was 
inaugurated. The United States government, both outgoing and incoming, 
refused to recognize the Confederacy, and when the new Confederate President 
Jefferson Davis ordered his troops to open fire on Fort Sumter in April 
1861, there was an overwhelming demand, North and South, for war. Only 
the state of Kentucky attempted to remain neutral, and it could only do 
so briefly. When Lincoln called for troops to suppress what he referred 
to as "combinations too powerful to be suppressed by the ordinary" judicial 
or martial means,[58] four more states decided to secede and join the Confederacy 
(which then moved its capital to Richmond, Virginia). Although the Confederacy 
had large supplies of captured munitions and many volunteers, it was slower 
than the Union in dealing with the border states. By March 1862, the Union 
largely controlled Maryland, West Virginia, Kentucky and Missouri, had 
shut down all commercial traffic from all Confederate ports, had prevented 
European recognition of the Confederate government, and was poised to seize 
New Orleans. In the four years of war 1861–65 the South was the primary 
battleground, with all but two of the major battles taking place on Southern 
soil. Union forces relentlessly squeezed the Confederacy, controlling the 
border states in 1861, the Tennessee River, the Cumberland River and New 
Orleans in 1862, and the Mississippi River in 1863. In the East, however, 
the Confederate Army under Robert E. Lee beat off attack after attack in 
its defense of their capital at Richmond. But when Lee tried to move north, 
he was repulsed (and nearly captured) at Sharpsburg (1862) and Gettysburg 
(1863). The Confederacy had the resources for a short war, but was unable 
to finance or supply a longer war. It reversed the traditional low-tariff 
policy of the South by imposing a new 15% tax on all imports from the Union. 
The Union blockade stopped most commerce from entering the South, and smugglers 
avoided the tax, so the Confederate tariff produced too little revenue 
to finance the war. Inflated currency was the solution, but that created 
distrust of the Richmond government. Because of low investment in railroads, 
the Southern transportation system depended primarily on river and coastal 
traffic by boat; both were shut down by the Union Navy. The small railroad 
system virtually collapsed, so that by 1864 internal travel was so difficult 
that the Confederate economy was crippled. The Confederate cause was hopeless 
by the time Atlanta fell and William T. Sherman marched through Georgia 
in late 1864, but the rebels fought on, refusing to give up their independence 
until Lee's army surrendered in April 1865. All the Confederate forces 
surrendered, and there was no insurgency as the region moved into the Reconstruction 
Era. The South suffered much more than the North overall, as the Union 
strategy of attrition warfare meant that Lee could not replace his casualties, 
and the total war waged by Sherman, Sheridan and other Union armies devastated 
the infrastructure and caused widespread poverty and distress. The Confederacy 
suffered military losses of 95,000 men killed in action and 165,000 who 
died of disease, for a total of 260,000,[59] out of a total white Southern 
population at the time of around 5.5 million.[60] Based on 1860 census 
figures, 8% of all white males aged 13 to 43 died in the war, including 
6% in the North and about 18% in the South.[61] Northern military casualties 
exceeded Southern casualties in absolute numbers, but were two-thirds smaller 
in terms of proportion of the population affected. After the Civil War, 
the South was devastated in terms of population, infrastructure and economy. 
Because of states' reluctance to grant voting rights to freedmen, Congress 
instituted Reconstruction governments. It established military districts 
and governors to rule over the South until new governments could be established. 
Many white Southerners who had actively supported the Confederacy were 
temporarily disenfranchised. Rebuilding was difficult as people grappled 
with the effects of a new labor economy of a free market in the midst of 
a widespread agricultural depression. In addition, what limited infrastructure 
the South had was mostly destroyed by the war. At the same time, the North 
was rapidly industrializing. To avoid the social effects of the war, most 
of the Southern states initially passed black codes. Eventually, these 
were mostly legally nullified by federal law and anti-Confederate legislatures, 
which existed for a short time during Reconstruction.[62] There were thousands 
of people on the move, as African Americans tried to reunite families separated 
by slaves sales, and sometimes migrated for better opportunities in towns 
or other states. Other freed people moved from plantation areas to cities 
or towns for a chance to get different jobs. At the same time, whites returned 
from refuges to reclaim plantations or town dwellings. In some areas, many 
whites returned to the land to farm for a while. Some freedpeople left 
the South altogether for states such as Ohio and Indiana, and later, Kansas. 
Thousands of others joined the migration to new opportunities in the Mississippi 
and Arkansas Delta bottomlands and Texas. With passage of the 13th Amendment 
to the Constitution of the United States (which outlawed slavery), the 
14th Amendment (which granted full U.S. citizenship to African Americans) 
and the 15th amendment (which extended the right to vote to African American 
males), African Americans in the South were made free citizens and were 
given the right to vote. Under Federal protection, white and black Republicans 
formed constitutional conventions and state governments. Among their accomplishments 
were creating the first public education systems in Southern states, and 
providing for welfare through orphanages, hospitals and similar institutions. 
Northerners came south to participate in politics and business. Some were 
representatives of the Freedmen's Bureau and other agencies of Reconstruction; 
some were humanitarians with the intent to help black people. Some were 
adventurers who hoped to benefit themselves by questionable methods. They 
were all condemned with the pejorative term of carpetbagger. Some Southerners 
also took advantage of the disrupted environment and made money off various 
schemes, including bonds and financing for railroads.[63] Secret vigilante 
organizations such as the Ku Klux Klan—an organization sworn to perpetuate 
white supremacy—had arisen quickly after the war's end and used lynching, 
physical attacks, house burnings and other forms of intimidation to keep 
African Americans from exercising their political rights. Although the 
first Klan was disrupted by prosecution by the Federal government in the 
early 1870s, other groups persisted. By the mid-to-late-1870s, elite Southerners 
created increasing resistance to the altered social structure. Paramilitary 
organizations such as the White League in Louisiana (1874), the Red Shirts 
in Mississippi (1875) and rifle clubs, all "White Line" organizations, 
used organized violence against Republicans, both black and white, to remove 
Republicans from political office, repress and bar black voting, and restore 
the Democratic Party to power.[64] In 1876 white Democrats regained power 
in most of the state legislatures. They began to pass laws designed to 
strip African Americans and poor whites from the voter registration rolls. 
The success of late-19th century interracial coalitions in several states 
inspired a reaction among some white Democrats, who worked harder to prevent 
both groups from voting.[65] Despite discrimination, many blacks became 
property owners in areas that were still developing. For instance, 90% 
of the Mississippi's bottomlands were still frontier and undeveloped after 
the war. By the end of the century, two-thirds of the farmers in Mississippi's 
Delta bottomlands were black. They had cleared the land themselves and 
often made money in early years by selling off timber. Tens of thousands 
of migrants went to the Delta, both to work as laborers to clear timber 
for lumber companies, and many to develop their own farms.[66] Nearly all 
Southerners, black and white, suffered as a result of the Civil War. Within 
a few years cotton production and harvest was back to pre-war levels, but 
low prices through much of the 19th century hampered recovery. They encouraged 
immigration by Chinese and Italian laborers into the Mississippi Delta. 
While the first Chinese entered as indentured laborers from Cuba, the majority 
came in the early 20th century. Neither group stayed long at rural farm 
labor.[67] The Chinese became merchants and established stores in small 
towns throughout the Delta, establishing a place between white and black.[68] 
Migrations continued in the late 19th and early 20th centuries among both 
blacks and whites. In the last two decades of the 19th century about 141,000 
blacks left the South, and more after 1900, totaling a loss of 537,000. 
After that the movement increased in what became known as the Great Migration 
from 1910 to 1940, and the Second Great Migration through 1970. Even more 
whites left the South, some going to California for opportunities and others 
heading to Northern industrial cities after 1900. Between 1880 and 1910, 
the loss of whites totaled 1,243,000.[69] Five million more left between 
1940 and 1970. From 1890 to 1908, 10 of the 11 states passed disfranchising 
constitutions or amendments that introduced voter registration barriers—such 
as poll taxes, residency requirements and literacy tests—that were hard 
for many poor to meet. Most African Americans, Mexican Americans, and tens 
of thousands of poor whites were disfranchised, losing the vote for decades. 
In some states, grandfather clauses temporarily exempted white illiterates 
from literacy tests. The numbers of voters dropped drastically throughout 
the South as a result. This can be seen on the feature "Turnout in Presidential 
and Midterm Elections" at the University of Texas Politics: Barriers to 
Voting. Alabama, which had established universal white suffrage in 1819 
when it became a state, also substantially reduced voting by poor whites.[70][71]Democrat 
controlled legislatures passed Jim Crow laws to segregate public facilities 
and services, including transportation. While African Americans, poor whites 
and civil rights groups started litigation against such provisions in the 
early 20th century, for decades Supreme Court decisions overturning such 
provisions were rapidly followed by new state laws with new devices to 
restrict voting. Most blacks in the South could not vote until 1965, after 
passage of the Voting Rights Act and Federal enforcement to ensure people 
could register. Despite increases in the eligible voting population with 
the inclusion of women, blacks, and those eighteen and over throughout 
this period, southern turnout remained below the national average throughout 
the 20th century.[72] Not until the late 1960s did all American citizens 
regain protected civil rights by passage of legislation following the leadership 
of the American Civil Rights Movement. At the end of the 19th century, 
white Democrats in the South had created state constitutions that were 
hostile to industry and business development. Banking was limited, as was 
access to credit. States persisted in agricultural economies.[citation 
needed] As in Alabama and Florida, rural minorities held control in many 
state legislatures long after population had shifted to industrializing 
cities, and the legislators resisted business and modernizing interests. 
For instance, Alabama refused to redistrict from 1901 to 1972, long after 
major population and economic shifts to cities. For decades Birmingham 
generated the majority of revenue for the state, for instance, but received 
little back in services or infrastructure.[73] In the late 19th century, 
Texas rapidly expanded its railroad network, creating a network of cities 
connected on a radial plan and linked to the port of Galveston. It was 
the first state[citation needed]in which urban and economic development 
proceeded independently of rivers, the primary transportation network of 
the past. A reflection of increasing industry were strikes and labor unrest: 
"in 1885 Texas ranked ninth among forty states in number of workers involved 
in strikes (4,000); for the six-year period it ranked fifteenth. Seventy-five 
of the 100 strikes, chiefly interstate strikes of telegraphers and railway 
workers, occurred in the year 1886."[74] In 1890 Dallas was the largest 
city in Texas. By 1900 it had a population of more than 42,000, which more 
than doubled to over 92,000 a decade later. Dallas was the harnessmaking 
capital of the world and center of other manufacturing. As an example of 
its ambitions, in 1907 Dallas built the Praetorian Building, 15 stories 
tall and the first skyscraper west of the Mississippi. Others soon followed.[75] 
Texas was transformed by a railroad network linking five important cities, 
among them Houston with its nearby port at Galveston, Dallas, Fort Worth, 
San Antonio, and El Paso. Each exceeded 50,000 in population by 1920, with 
the major cities having three times that population.[76] Business interests 
were ignored by the Bourbon[clarification needed] class. Nonetheless, major 
new industries started developing in cities such as Atlanta, GA; Birmingham, 
AL; and Dallas, Fort Worth and Houston, Texas. Growth began occurring at 
a geometric rate. Birmingham became a major steel producer and mining town, 
with major population growth in the early decades of the 20th century. 
The first major oil well in the South was drilled at Spindletop near Beaumont, 
Texas, on the morning of January 10, 1901. Other oil fields were later 
discovered nearby in Arkansas, Oklahoma, and under the Gulf of Mexico. 
The resulting "Oil Boom" permanently transformed the economy of the West/South 
Central states and led to the most significant economic expansion after 
the Civil War. In the early 20th century, invasion of the boll weevil devastated 
cotton crops in states of the South. This was an additional catalyst to 
African Americans' decisions to leave the South. From 1910 to 1940, and 
then from the 1940s to 1970, more than 6.5 million African Americans left 
the South in the Great Migration to northern and midwestern cities, making 
multiple acts of resistance against persistent lynching and violence, segregation, 
poor education, and inability to vote. Their movements transformed many 
cities, creating new cultures and music in the North. Many African Americans, 
like other groups, became industrial workers; others started their own 
businesses within the communities. Southern whites also migrated to industrial 
cities, especially Chicago and Detroit, where they took jobs in the booming 
new auto industry. Later, the Southern economy was dealt additional blows 
by the Great Depression and the Dust Bowl. After the Wall Street Crash 
of 1929, the economy suffered significant reversals and millions were left 
unemployed. Beginning in 1934 and lasting until 1939, an ecological disaster 
of severe wind and drought caused an exodus from Texas and Arkansas, the 
Oklahoma Panhandle region, and the surrounding plains, in which over 500,000 
Americans were homeless, hungry and jobless.[77] Thousands left the region 
forever to seek economic opportunities along the West Coast. President 
Franklin D. Roosevelt noted the South as the "number one priority" in terms 
of need of assistance during the Great Depression. His administration created 
programs such as the Tennessee Valley Authority in 1933 to provide rural 
electrification and stimulate development. Locked into low-productivity 
agriculture, the region's growth was slowed by limited industrial development, 
low levels of entrepreneurship, and the lack of capital investment. World 
War II marked a time of change in the South as new industries and military 
bases were developed by the Federal government, providing badly needed 
capital and infrastructure in many regions. People from all parts of the 
US came to the South for military training and work in the region's many 
bases and new industries. Farming shifted from cotton and tobacco to include 
soybeans, corn, and other foods. This growth increased in the 1960s and 
greatly accelerated into the 1980s and 1990s. Large urban areas with over 
4 million people rose in Texas, Georgia, and Florida. Rapid expansion in 
industries such as autos, telecommunications, textiles, technology, banking, 
and aviation gave some states in the South an industrial strength to rival 
large states elsewhere in the country. By the 2000 census, the South (along 
with the West) was leading the nation in population growth. However, with 
this growth has come long commute times and air pollution problems in cities 
such as Dallas, Houston, Atlanta, Austin, Charlotte, and others that rely 
on sprawling development and highway networks. The South produced nine 
of the first 12 U.S. Presidents prior to the Civil War. For more than a 
century after the Civil War, no Southerner became President unless he either 
moved North (like Woodrow Wilson) or was vice president when the president 
died in office (like Vice-Presidents Andrew Johnson, Harry Truman and Lyndon 
B. Johnson). In 1976, Jimmy Carter defied this trend and became the first 
Southerner to break the pattern since Zachary Taylor in 1848. The South 
produced five of the last nine American Presidents: Lyndon B. Johnson (1963–69), 
Jimmy Carter (1977–81), George H. W. Bush (1989–93), Bill Clinton (1993–2001) 
and George W. Bush (2001–2009). Johnson was a native of Texas, while Carter 
is from Georgia, and Clinton from Arkansas. George H.W. and George W. Bush 
are from Texas, although born in New England. By 1840, New Orleans was 
the wealthiest city in the country and the third largest in population. 
The success of the city was based on the growth of international trade 
associated with products being shipped to and from the interior of the 
country down the Mississippi River. New Orleans also had the largest slave 
market in the country, as traders brought slaves by ship and overland to 
sell to planters across the Deep South. The city was a cosmopolitan port 
with a variety of jobs that attracted more immigrants than other areas 
of the South.[78] Because of lack of investment, however, construction 
of railroads to span the region lagged behind the North. People relied 
most heavily on river traffic for getting their crops to market and for 
transportation. In Mississippi, most plantations were developed along the 
Mississippi and other navigable rivers. The bottomlands were not developed 
until after the war, when the chance to buy land attracted tens of thousands 
of migrants, both black and white. By the end of the century, two-thirds 
of farm owners in the Delta bottomlands were black.[citation needed] However, 
the long agricultural depression, along with disenfranchisement and lack 
of access to credit, led to many blacks in the Delta losing their property 
by 1910 and becoming sharecroppers or landless workers over the following 
decade. More than two generations of free African Americans had lost their 
stake in property.[79] In the late 20th century, the South changed dramatically. 
It saw a boom in its service economy, manufacturing base, high technology 
industries, and the financial sector. Texas in particular witnessed dramatic 
growth and population change with the dominance of the energy industry. 
Tourism in Florida and along the Gulf Coast grew steadily throughout the 
last decades of the 20th century. Numerous new automobile production plants 
have opened in the region, or are soon to open, such as Mercedes-Benz in 
Tuscaloosa, Alabama; Hyundai in Montgomery, Alabama; the BMW production 
plant in Spartanburg, South Carolina; Toyota plants in Georgetown, Kentucky, 
Blue Springs, Mississippi and San Antonio; the GM manufacturing plant in 
Spring Hill, Tennessee; a Honda factory in Lincoln, Alabama; the Nissan 
North American headquarters in Franklin, Tennessee and factories in Smyrna, 
Tennessee and Canton, Mississippi; a Kia factory in West Point, Georgia; 
and the Volkswagen Chattanooga Assembly Plant in Tennessee. The two largest 
research parks in the country are located in the South: Research Triangle 
Park in North Carolina (the world's largest) and the Cummings Research 
Park in Huntsville, Alabama (the world's fourth largest). In medicine, 
the Texas Medical Center in Houston has achieved international recognition 
in education, research, and patient care, especially in the fields of heart 
disease, cancer, and rehabilitation. In 1994 the Texas Medical Center was 
the largest medical center in the world including fourteen hospitals, two 
medical schools, four colleges of nursing, and six university systems.[80] 
The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center is consistently ranked 
the #1 cancer research and treatment center in the United States.[81] Many 
major banking corporations have headquarters in the region. Bank of America 
is in Charlotte, North Carolina. Wachovia was headquartered there before 
its purchase by Wells Fargo. Regions Financial Corporation is in Birmingham, 
as is AmSouth Bancorporation, and BBVA Compass. SunTrust Banks is located 
in Atlanta as is the district headquarters of the Federal Reserve Bank 
of Atlanta. BB&T is headquartered in Winston-Salem. Many corporations are 
headquartered in Atlanta and its surrounding area, such as The Coca-Cola 
Company, Delta Air Lines, and The Home Depot, and also to many cable television 
networks, such as the Turner Broadcasting System (CNN, TBS, TNT, Turner 
South, Cartoon Network), and The Weather Channel. In recent years some 
southern states, notably Texas, have lured companies with lower tax burdens 
and lower cost of living for their workforce. Today, the states with the 
most Fortune 500 companies include California, New York, and Texas; closely 
mirroring the economic and population resources of those states.[82] This 
economic expansion has enabled parts of the South to report some of the 
lowest unemployment rates in the United States.[83] But in the U.S. top 
ten of poorest big cities, the South is represented in the rankings by 
two cities: Miami, Florida and Memphis, Tennessee.[84] In 2011, nine out 
of ten poorest states were in the South.[85] Southern public schools in 
the past ranked in the lower half of some national surveys.[86] When allowance 
for race is considered, a 2007 US Government list of test scores often 
shows white fourth and eighth graders performing better than average for 
reading and math; while black fourth and eighth graders also performed 
better than average.[87] This comparison does not hold across the board. 
Mississippi scores lower than average no matter how the statistics are 
compared. However, newer data suggests that education in the south is on 
par with the nation, with 72% of high schoolers graduating compared to 
73% nationwide.[88] Southern education is also unique in that it is one 
of few areas of the West[clarification needed] where school corporal punishment 
is legal and commonly practiced in public schools; virtually all paddling 
in the United States occurs at Southern schools.[89] Several Southern states 
(Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia) 
were British colonies that sent delegates to sign the Declaration of Independence 
and then fought against the government along with the Northern colonies 
during the Revolutionary War. The basis for much Southern culture derives 
from the pride in these states being among the 13 original colonies, and 
from the fact that much of the population of the South has strong ancestral 
links to Colonists who emigrated west. Southern manners and customs reflect 
the relationship with England and Africa that was held by the early population, 
with some influences being provided by the Native American populations 
of the area.[90] Overall, the South has had lower percentages of high school 
graduates, lower housing values, lower household incomes, and lower cost 
of living than the rest of the United States.[91] These factors, combined 
with the fact that Southerners have continued to maintain strong loyalty 
to family ties, has led some sociologists to label white Southerners an 
ethnic or quasi-ethnic group,[92][93] though this interpretation has been 
subject to criticism on the grounds that proponents of the view do not 
satisfactorily indicate how Southerners meet the criteria of ethnicity.[94] 
The predominant culture of the South has its origins with the settlement 
of the region by large groups of Northern English, Scots lowlanders and 
Ulster-Scots (later called the Scotch-Irish) who settled in Appalachia 
and the Piedmont in the 18th century, and from parts of southern England 
such as East Anglia, Kent and the West Country in the 17th century,[95] 
and the many African slaves who were part of the Southern economy. African-American 
descendants of the slaves brought into the South compose the United States' 
second-largest racial minority, accounting for 12.1 percent of the total 
population according to the 2000 census. Despite Jim Crow era outflow to 
the North, the majority of the black population remains concentrated in 
the Southern states, and has heavily contributed to the cultural blend 
(Christianity, foods, art, music (see spiritual, blues, jazz and rock and 
roll)) that characterize Southern culture today. In previous censuses, 
the largest ancestry group identified by Southerners was English or mostly 
English,[48][96][97] with 19,618,370 self-reporting "English" as an ancestry 
on the 1980 census, followed by 12,709,872 listing "Irish" and 11,054,127 
"Afro-American".[48][96][97] Almost a third of all Americans who claim 
English ancestry can be found in the American South, and over a quarter 
of all Southerners claim English descent as well.[98] The South also continues 
to have the highest percentage of African Americans in the country, due 
to the history of slavery. The South has been a stronghold of evangelical 
Protestantism[99] Although the upper class In Virginia and South Carolina 
was Anglican, The First Great Awakening and the Second Great Awakening 
from about 1742 about 1850 generated large numbers of Methodists and Baptists.[100] 
By 1900, the Southern Baptist Convention had become numerically largest 
group, especially in rural areas and remain so.[101][102] followed by Methodists, 
with other denominations found throughout the region. Roman Catholics historically 
were concentrated in Maryland, Louisiana, and Hispanic areas such as South 
Texas and South Florida and along the Gulf Coast. The great majority of 
black Southerners are Baptist or Methodist.[103] Statistics show that Southern 
states have the highest religious attendance figures of any region in the 
United States.[104] Pentecostalism has been strong across the South since 
the late 19th century.[105] American football, especially at the college 
and high school level, is by far the most popular team sport in most areas 
of the Southern United States. The region is home to numerous decorated 
and historic college football programs, particularly in the Southeastern 
Conference (known as the "SEC"), Atlantic Coast Conference (known as the 
"ACC"), and the Big 12 Conference. The SEC, consisting entirely of teams 
based in Southern states, is widely considered to be the strongest league 
in contemporary college football and includes the Alabama Crimson Tide, 
the program with the most national championships in the sport's history. 
The sport is also highly competitive and has a spectator following at the 
high school level, particularly in rural areas where high school football 
games often serve as prominent community gatherings. Though not as popular 
on a wider basis as the collegiate game, professional football also has 
a growing tradition in the Southern United States. Before league expansion 
began in the 1960s, the only established professional team based in the 
South was the Washington Redskins, who still retain a large following in 
many pockets of the region. Later on, the merger-era National Football 
League began to expand into the football-crazed Deep South in the 1960s 
with franchises like the Atlanta Falcons, New Orleans Saints, Houston Oilers, 
Miami Dolphins, and most prominently the Dallas Cowboys, who overtook Washington 
as the region's most popular team and eventually became widely considered 
the most popular team in the United States. In later decades, NFL expansion 
into Southern states continued, with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Jacksonville 
Jaguars, and Carolina Panthers added to the league, while the Houston Oilers 
were replaced by the Houston Texans after the Oilers relocated to Nashville 
to become the Tennessee Titans. Baseball has been played in the Southern 
United States since at least the years leading up to the American Civil 
War. It was traditionally more popular than American football until the 
1980s, and still accounts for the most annual attendance in sports for 
the South. The first mention of a baseball team in Houston was on April 
11, 1861.[107][108] 19th century and early 20th century games were common, 
especially once the professional leagues such as the Texas League, the 
Dixie League, and the Southern League were organized. The short-lived Louisville 
Colonels were a part of the early National League and American Association, 
but ceased to exist in 1899. The first Southern Major League Baseball team 
after the Colonels appeared in 1962 when the Houston Colt .45s (known today 
as the Houston Astros) were enfranchised. Later, the Atlanta Braves came 
in 1966, followed by the Texas Rangers in 1972, and finally the Miami Marlins 
and Tampa Bay Rays in the 1990s. College baseball appears to be more well 
attended in the Southern U.S. than elsewhere, as teams like Arkansas, LSU, 
Virginia, Mississippi State, Ole Miss, South Carolina, and Texas are commonly 
at the top of the NCAA's attendance.[109] The South generally produces 
very successful collegiate baseball teams as well, with Virginia, Vanderbilt, 
LSU, and South Carolina winning recent College World Series Titles. The 
following is a list of best-attended baseball teams in the Southern U.S.: 
The Southern states are commonly associated with stock car racing and its 
most prominent competition NASCAR, which is based in Charlotte, North Carolina. 
The sport was developed in the Deep South in the early 20th century, with 
stock car racing's historic mecca being Daytona Beach, Florida, where cars 
initially raced on the wide, flat beachfront before the construction of 
Daytona International Speedway. Though the sport has attained a following 
throughout the United States, a majority of NASCAR races continue to take 
place at Southern tracks. Basketball is very popular throughout the Southern 
United States as both a recreational and spectator sport, particularly 
in the states of North Carolina and Kentucky which are home to several 
historically prominent college basketball programs. Prominent NBA teams 
based in the South include the Houston Rockets, San Antonio Spurs, Dallas 
Mavericks, Washington Wizards, Charlotte Hornets, Atlanta Hawks, Memphis 
Grizzlies, and the Miami Heat. Golf is a popular recreational sport in 
most areas of the South, with the region's temperate climate allowing it 
to host many professional tournaments and numerous destination golf resorts, 
particularly in the state of Florida. The region is home to The Masters, 
an elite invitational competition played at Augusta National Golf Club 
in Augusta, Georgia, which has become one of the professional game's most 
important tournaments. In recent decades association football, known in 
the South as in the rest of the United States as "soccer", has become a 
popular sport at youth and collegiate levels throughout the region. The 
game has been historically widespread at the college level in the Atlantic 
coast states of Maryland, Virginia, and the Carolinas, which contain many 
of the nation's most successful college soccer programs. Nine Southern 
states have obesity rates over 30% of the population, the highest in the 
country: Mississippi, Louisiana, West Virginia, Alabama, Oklahoma, Arkansas, 
South Carolina, Kentucky, and Texas.[111][112] Rates for hypertension and 
diabetes for these states are also the highest in the nation.[112] A study 
reported that six Southern states have the worst incidence of sleep disturbances 
in the nation, attributing the disturbances to high rates of obesity and 
smoking.[113] The South has a higher percentage of obese people[114] and 
diabetics.[115] It has the largest number of people dying from stroke.[116] 
The South has the highest rates of cognitive decline.[117] Life expectancy 
is lower and death rates higher in the South than in the other regions 
of the country for all racial groups.[118][119] This disparity reflects 
substantial divergence between the South and other regions since the middle 
of the 20th century.[120] The East South Central Census Division of the 
United States (made up of Kentucky, Tennessee, Mississippi, and Alabama) 
had the highest rate of inpatient hospital stays in 2012. The other divisions, 
West South Central (Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, and Louisiana) and South 
Atlantic (West Virginia, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, 
South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida) ranked 7th and 5th, respectively.[121] 
The South had a significantly higher rate of hospital discharges in 2005 
than other regions of the United States, but the rate had declined to be 
closer to the overall national rate by 2011.[122] For cancer in a region, 
the South, particularly an axis from West Virginia through Texas, leads 
the nation in adult obesity, adult smoking, low exercise, low fruit consumption, 
low vegetable consumption, all known cancer risk factors,[123] which matches 
a similar high risk axis in "All Cancers Combined, Death Rates by State, 
2011" from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.[124] In the 
first decades after Reconstruction, when white Democrats regained power 
in the state legislatures, they began to make voter registration more complicated, 
to reduce black voting.[citation needed] With a combination of intimidation, 
fraud and violence by paramilitary groups, they turned Republicans out 
of office and suppressed black voting. From 1890 to 1908, ten of eleven 
states ratified new constitutions or amendments that effectively disenfranchised 
most black voters and many poor white voters. This disfranchisement persisted 
for six decades into the 20th century, depriving blacks and poor whites 
of all political representation. Because they could not vote, they could 
not sit on juries. They had no one to represent their interests, resulting 
in state legislatures consistently underfunding programs and services, 
such as schools, for blacks and poor whites.[125] With the collapse of 
the Republican Party in nearly all parts of the South, the Democrats after 
1900 moved to a system of primaries to select their candidates. Victory 
in a primary was tantamount to election. Apart from a few states (such 
as the Byrd Machine in Virginia, the Crump Machine in Memphis), and a few 
other local organizations, the Democratic Party itself was very lightly 
organized. It managed primaries but party officials had little other role. 
To be successful a politician built his own network of friends, neighbors 
and allies. Reelection was the norm, and the result from 1910 to the late 
20th century was that Southern Democrats in Congress had accumulated seniority, 
and automatically took the chairmanships of all committees.[126] By the 
1940s the Supreme Court began to find disfranchisement such as the "grandfather 
clause" and the white primary to be unconstitutional. Southern legislatures 
quickly passed other measures to keep blacks disfranchised, even after 
suffrage was extended more widely to poor whites. Because white Democrats 
controlled all the Southern seats in Congress they had outsize power in 
Congress and could sidetrack or filibuster efforts by Northerners to pass 
legislation against lynching, for example. The region became known as the 
Solid South. The Republicans controlled parts of the Appalachian Mountains 
and competed for power in the Border States. From the late 1870s to the 
1960s, only rarely was a state or national Southern politician a Republican, 
apart from a few Appalachian mountain districts.[127][128] Increasing support 
for civil rights legislation by the national Democratic Party beginning 
in 1948 caused segregationist Southern Democrats to nominate J. Strom Thurmond 
on a third-party "Dixiecrat" ticket in 1948. These Dixicrats returned to 
the party by 1950, but Southern Democrats held off Republican inroads in 
the suburbs by arguing that only they could defend the region from the 
onslaught of northern liberals and the civil rights movement. In response 
to the Brown v. Board of Education ruling of 1954, 101 Southern congressmen 
(19 senators, 82 House members of which 99 were Southern Democrats and 
2 were Republicans) in 1956 denounced the Brown decisions as a "clear abuse 
of judicial power [that] climaxes a trend in the federal judiciary undertaking 
to legislate in derogation of the authority of Congress and to encroach 
upon the reserved rights of the states and the people." The manifesto lauded, 
"...those states which have declared the intention to resist enforced integration 
by any lawful means." It was signed by all Southern senators except Majority 
Leader Lyndon B. Johnson, and Tennessee senators Albert Gore, Sr. and Estes 
Kefauver. Virginia closed schools in Warren County, Prince Edward County, 
Charlottesville, and Norfolk rather than integrate, but no other state 
followed suit. Democratic governors Orval Faubus of Arkansas, Ross Barnett 
of Mississippi, John Connally of Texas, Lester Maddox of Georgia, and, 
especially, George Wallace of Alabama resisted integration and appealed 
to a rural and blue-collar electorate.[129] The northern Democrats' support 
of civil rights issues culminated when Democratic President Lyndon B. Johnson 
signed into law the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act 
of 1965, which ended legal segregation and provided federal enforcement 
of voting rights for blacks. In the presidential election of 1964, Barry 
Goldwater's only electoral victories outside his home state of Arizona 
were in the states of the Deep South where few blacks could vote before 
the 1965 Voting Rights Act.[130] Pockets of resistance to integration in 
public places broke out in violence during the 1960s by the shadowy Ku 
Klux Klan, which caused a backlash among moderates.[131] Major resistance 
to school busing extending into the 1970s.[132] National Republicans such 
as Richard Nixon began to develop their Southern strategy to attract conservative 
white Southerners, especially the middle class and suburban voters, in 
addition to traditional GOP pockets (such as Appalachia) and migrants from 
the North. The transition to a Republican stronghold in the South took 
decades. First, the states started voting Republican in presidential elections, 
except for native sons Jimmy Carter in 1976 and Bill Clinton in 1992 and 
1996. Then the states began electing Republican senators and finally governors. 
Georgia was the last state to do so, with Sonny Perdue taking the governorship 
in 2002.[133] In addition to its middle class and business base, Republicans 
cultivated the religious right and attracted strong majorities from the 
evangelical or Fundamentalist vote, mostly Southern Baptists, which had 
not been a distinct political force prior to 1980.[134] After the 2012 
elections, the 11 states of the former Confederacy were represented by 
98 Republicans, 40 Democrats.[135] The South has produced various nationally 
known politicians and political movements. In 1948, a group of Democratic 
congressmen, led by Governor Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, split from 
the Democrats in reaction to an anti-segregation speech given by Minneapolis 
mayor and future senator Hubert Humphrey of Minnesota. They founded the 
States Rights Democratic or Dixiecrat Party. During that year's Presidential 
election, the party ran Thurmond as its candidate, but he finally lost 
the election. In the 1968 Presidential election, Alabama Governor George 
C. Wallace ran for President on the American Independent Party ticket. 
Wallace ran a "law and order" campaign similar to that of Republican candidate, 
Richard Nixon. Nixon's Southern Strategy of gaining electoral votes downplayed 
race issues and focused on culturally conservative values, such as family 
issues, patriotism, and cultural issues that appealed to Southern Baptists. 
In 1994 mid-term elections, another Southern politician, Newt Gingrich, 
led the Republican Revolution, ushered in 12 years of GOP control of the 
House. Gingrich became Speaker of the United States House of Representatives 
in 1995 and served until his resignation in 1999. Tom DeLay was the most 
powerful Republican leader in Congress[citation needed] until he was indicted 
under criminal charges in 2005 and was forced to step aside by Republican 
rules.[citation needed] Apart from Bob Dole of Kansas (1985–96), the recent 
Republican Senate leaders have been Southerners: Howard Baker (1981–85) 
of Tennessee, Trent Lott (1996–2003) of Mississippi, Bill Frist (2003–2006) 
of Tennessee, and Mitch McConnell (2007–present) of Kentucky. The Republicans 
candidates for President have won the South in elections since 1972, except 
for 1976. However, the region is not entirely monolithic, and every successful 
Democratic candidate since 1976 has claimed at least three Southern states. 
Barack Obama won Florida, Maryland, Delaware, North Carolina, and Virginia 
in 2008 but did not repeat his victory in North Carolina during his 2012 
reelection campaign.[136] Native Americans had lived in the south for nearly 
12,000 years. They were defeated by settlers in a series of wars ending 
in the War of 1812 and the Seminole Wars, and most were removed west to 
Indian Territory (now Oklahoma and Kansas). However large numbers of Native 
Americans managed to stay behind by blending into the surrounding society. 
This was especially true of the wives of Euro-American merchants and miners. 
The South witnessed two major events in the lives of 20th century African 
Americans: the Great Migration and the American Civil Rights Movement. 
The Great Migration began during World War I, hitting its high point during 
World War II. During this migration, blacks left the South to find work 
in Northern factories and other sectors of the economy.[137] The migration 
also empowered the growing Civil Rights Movement. While the movement existed 
in all parts of the United States, its focus was against disfranchisement 
and the Jim Crow laws in the South. Most of the major events in the movement 
occurred in the South, including the Montgomery Bus Boycott, the Mississippi 
Freedom Summer, the March on Selma, Alabama, and the assassination of Martin 
Luther King, Jr.. In addition, some of the most important writings to come 
out of the movement were written in the South, such as King's "Letter from 
Birmingham Jail". Most of the civil rights landmarks can be found around 
the South. The Martin Luther King, Jr., National Historic Site in Atlanta 
includes a museum that chronicles the American Civil Rights Movement as 
well as Martin Luther King, Jr.'s boyhood home on Auburn Avenue. Additionally, 
Ebenezer Baptist Church is located in the Sweet Auburn district as is the 
King Center, location of Martin Luther and Coretta Scott King's gravesites. 
The Civil Rights Movement ended Jim Crow laws across the South. A second 
migration appears to be underway, with African Americans from the North 
moving to the South in record numbers.[138] While race relations are still 
a contentious issue in the South, the region surpasses the rest of the 
country in many areas of integration and racial equality. According to 
2003 report by researchers at the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee, Virginia 
Beach, Charlotte, Nashville-Davidson, and Jacksonville were the four most 
integrated of the nation's fifty largest cities, with Memphis at number 
six.[139] Southern states tend to have a low disparity in incarceration 
rates between blacks and whites relative to the rest of the country.[140] 
Some Southerners use the Confederate flag to identify themselves with the 
South, states' rights and Southern tradition. Groups, such as the League 
of the South, have a high regard for the secession movement of 1860, citing 
a desire to protect and defend Southern heritage.[141] Numerous political 
battles have erupted over flying the Confederate flag over state capitols, 
and the naming of public buildings or highways after Confederate leaders, 
the prominence of certain statues, and the everyday display of Confederate 
insignia.[142] Other symbols of the South include the Bonnie Blue Flag, 
magnolia trees, and the song "Dixie".[143] The South was heavily rural 
as late as the 1940s, but now the population is increasingly concentrated 
in metropolitan areas. The following table shows the twenty largest metropolitan 
areas in the South. Houston is the largest city in the South. * Asterisk 
indicates part of the metropolitan area is outside the states classified 
as Southern. Metropolitan areas of the South with a combined population
