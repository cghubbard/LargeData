Allen Thomas Craig (born July 18, 1984) is an American professional baseball 
first baseman and outfielder in the Boston Red Sox organization. He has 
played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the St. Louis Cardinals and Boston 
Red Sox. The Cardinals drafted him from the University of California, Berkeley, 
in 2006, and he made his Major League debut with the Cardinals in 2010. 
Besides the outfield and first base, he has appeared at every position 
except pitcher, catcher and shortstop. Each season in the minor leagues 
from 2007–09, Craig finished with a batting average of over .300 with at 
least 20 home runs. A .306 career hitter in MLB through 2013, he increased 
his production with runners in scoring position (RISP). In 2012, he posted 
a .400 batting average with RISP. The next season, he raised that figure 
to .454, the third-highest average of all time. Craig has appeared in two 
World Series and in both made history. In the 2011 World Series, he tied 
a record by collecting three hits that drove in the game-winning run. In 
2013, he became the first player to score a game-winning run on an obstruction 
call. Allen Craig was born in Mission Viejo, California, to Ron and Kim 
Craig and raised in Temecula, California.[1] He has one younger sister 
named Kendal. His parents had moved to the Temecula Valley in the 1970s 
so that Mr. Craig could secure employment with the Rancho California Water 
District. In addition to relocating from Mission Viejo in Orange County 
to Temecula in Riverside County after Craig's birth, the family shifted 
residences multiple times before finally settling in Temecula.[2] Craig's 
father was an early volunteer to help build the baseball fields that became 
the Ronald Reagan Sports Complex near Temecula Valley High School in Temecula, 
California. As soon as he was able to swing a baseball bat, his parents 
entered him into the national Tee Ball division of Little League Baseball 
where his father coached and his mother served on the board of directors.[2] 
While participating on the 14-and-under USA Baseball team, he played games 
in Venezuela.[1] At Chaparral High School, Temecula, California, Craig 
was a two-sport standout thlete in baseball and basketball. As a senior 
in 2002, Craig was recognized in both sports. He earned first team all-league 
and all-valley honors in basketball while setting a school record with 
94 three-pointers.[1] In baseball, he was named All-Valley Baseball Player 
of the Year.[2] At the Riverside All-Star Game, he earned the Most Valuable 
Player (MVP) accolade. His .585 batting average and eight home runs helped 
energize Chaparral to the Southwest League title. That summer, Craig played 
for the USA Junior National team, batting .485 with 11 runs scored in their 
effort to earn a bronze medal at the International Baseball Federation 
(IBAF) World Junior Championship in Sherbrooke, Quebec.[1] After high school, 
Craig attended the University of California, Berkeley, and was a four-year 
starter for the California Golden Bears baseball team at all four infield 
positions.[1] Primarily playing shortstop as a freshman, he posted a .353 
batting average with runners in scoring position (RISP). He earned Pac-10 
Player of the Week honors for February 4–10, 2003, after his 7-for-17 (.412) 
effort with two doubles, a grand slam and five runs batted in (RBI) at 
San Francisco and versus Loyola Marymount. Applying more time at first 
base in his sophomore season, Craig batted .285, led the team with 29 bases 
on balls (BB) and aggregated 19 multi-hit games. He was an honorable mention 
for the Pac-10 all-academic team. The next year, Craig started primarily 
in left field, batted .308 overall, and batted .338 with RISP. Against 
Washington State, March 22–24, 2005, he put together a 7–13 series (.538). 
One month later, on April 22, Craig collected three hits in three at-bats 
and two days later went 4–4; both games were against USC. Craig was an 
honorable mention for the All-Pacific-10 baseball team and again for the 
academic team.[1] His career batting numbers at UC Berkeley included a 
.308 batting average, 27 home runs and 108 RBI.[3] During his off-season 
playing time at UC Berkeley, Craig played two campaigns for the Alexandria 
Beetles (Minnesota) of the Northwoods League (NWL), a collegiate summer 
baseball league. Craig spent most games at shortstop but also contributed 
in the outfield, at third base, and first base. His first season was in 
2003, after his freshman season at UC. He batted just .229 in 15 games 
in which his playing time was cut short by injury. He returned in 2005 
after his junior season and put together a landmark NWL season that included 
a 21-game hitting streak. In 49 games, Craig hit .362 with 12 home runs, 
17 doubles and 40 RBI.[4] Craig was named first-team shortstop for Baseball 
America's 2005 College Summer All-America team.[1] The Cardinals drafted 
Craig as a shortstop in the eighth round of the 2006 draft (256th overall) 
and signed him for $15,000.[5][6] However, he played just three games at 
shortstop with the State College Spikes in 2006 before spending the most 
games playing third base. As a hitter, Craig showed power at all levels 
of the Cardinal farm system, hitting 76 home runs in a three and one-half 
season span between 2006 and 2010 that comprised the bulk of his minor 
league playing time.[7] In the Florida State League in 2006, he posted 
an adjusted on-base plus slugging at 26% above league average.[8] His 21 
home runs in an environment of primarily humid air and large ballparks 
brought notice as one of the top minor league hitters. Baseball America 
ranked him as the Cardinals' number-15 prospect following the season.[9] 
Each season from 2007 through 2009, Craig progressed from the high-A level 
to AAA and participated between 119 and 129 games while hitting at least 
.304 with 22 home runs and 80 RBI.[7] Although for a time Craig appeared 
to play adequately at third base, his throwing motion raised questions 
whether he could play there in the Major Leagues as he was promoted through 
the minor leagues. With David Freese one step further up the Cardinals 
depth chart and having the better-regarded glove, Craig was shifted more 
to the outfield in 2009.[9] He further increased his versatility by playing 
first base. Despite the defensive transitions, his hitting remained steady 
as he posted a .921 on-base plus slugging percentage with the AAA Memphis 
Redbirds. His consistent hitting and increased positional coverage prompted 
Craig to be named Cardinals system Player of the Year. The club added him 
to their 40-man roster that November.[5] After making his Major League 
debut in April, 2010, Craig spent significant time on the Cardinals roster. 
In addition, he amassed 83 games at Memphis, batting .320 with 14 home 
runs, 81 RBI and a .549 slugging percentage.[7] The next two seasons, he 
made 19 more appearances at Memphis, Springfield and Palm Beach, accumulating 
20 hits in 69 at-bats with four home runs and 14 RBI.[7] Allen Craig made 
the Cardinals big-league club out of spring training in 2010 and appeared 
in his first MLB game on April 8.[10][11] He started in right field and 
went 0–4 at the plate against the Cincinnati Reds.[4] Craig hit his first 
home run on July 19 off the Philadelphia Phillies' Kyle Kendrick.[12] His 
second home run came on August 22 in the Cardinals' 9–0 drubbing of the 
San Francisco Giants' Barry Zito.[13] One month later, he hit his third 
home run in a 7–1 defeat of the Chicago Cubs on September 24 in support 
of Adam Wainwright's bid for his first 20-win season.[14] In 44 total games 
in 2010, Craig saw 124 plate appearances (PA), batted .246, hit seven doubles 
and four home runs with 18 RBI.[11] By 2011, it became apparent that Craig 
was able to hit major league pitching as well he had in the minor leagues. 
However, the situation was less than ideal for him to realize regular playing 
time. Lance Berkman, Matt Holliday, and Albert Pujols each already occupied 
corner positions first base, left field and right field – positions Craig 
was best suited to play.[15] To get his bat in the lineup more, manager 
Tony La Russa began playing him at second base near the end of May.[16] 
In June, after batting .336 with 23 RBI in 107 at-bats, he suffered a small 
knee cap fracture against the Houston Astros by running into the wall tracking 
a fly ball in right field. The team placed him on the disabled list (DL) 
with an expected intermission of about six weeks.[17][18] The healing of 
the fracture stagnated throughout the season, however, and swelling persisted 
around the knee, slowing Craig's rehabilitation. Nevertheless, he regularly 
strengthened the muscles around his patella and was cleared to play after 
passing a battery of medical tests. He also spent extra time warming up 
his knee before each game. After his return, Craig hit .290 in 35 games.[18] 
He ended the regular season with a .315 batting average, 15 doubles, 11 
home runs, 40 RBI, and a .555 slugging percentage in 75 games and 219 PA.[11] 
The Cardinals made the playoffs that year. Craig struggled in his first 
ten games covering 21 plate appearances against the Philadelphia Phillies 
in the National League Division Series (NLDS) and the Milwaukee Brewers 
in the National League Championship Series (NLCS), collecting just three 
hits in 17 at-bats. However, he delivered the go-ahead pinch-hit single 
in Game 6 to send the Cardinals to the World Series.[19] In the World Series, 
Craig debuted in Game 1 by hitting a two-out, go-ahead pinch-hit single 
off Texas Rangers' pitcher Alexi Ogando's fastball. The next night, La 
Russa again summoned Craig to pinch hit against Ogando. This time, he lined 
a 96 miles per hour (154 km/h) fastball to right field to break a scoreless 
tie. On that single, he joined Dusty Rhodes, Del Unser and Hal McRae as 
the only players to collect pinch-hit RBI in three consecutive postseason 
at bats. He also joined Duke Snider and Amos Otis as the only hitters with 
the go-ahead hit in the sixth inning or later in consecutive World Series 
games. Further, Craig became the first player with two go-ahead RBIs as 
a pinch-hitter in World Series play.[15] After hitting the go-ahead home 
run in Game 7, he caught the last out of the Series, helping to secure 
the Cardinals' eleventh World Series championship. That home run tied a 
World Series record Kiki Cuyler and Hank Greenberg shared with three game-winning 
RBI.[20] For the series, Craig appeared in all seven games, collected five 
hits in 19 at-bats (.263 batting average), three home runs and five RBI 
for a .737 slugging percentage.[11] His totals in the 2011 postseason included 
.622 slugging percentage and 1.013 on-base plus slugging (OPS).[21] However, 
with his knee cap still not fully healed, Craig elected to have surgery 
to repair the fracture the following November.[18] Despite his strong 2011 
performance and World Series exploits, new manager Mike Matheny assigned 
Craig the role of utility player in the outset of 2012, with the likes 
of veterans Carlos Beltrán, Berkman, and Holliday already stationed at 
first base and in the outfield corners.[22] Further, Craig spent all of 
April on the disabled list (DL) recovering from knee surgery.[23][24][25] 
However, when he returned to play May 1, the Cardinals designated outfielder 
Erik Komatsu for assignment to make room, and Craig found a windfall of 
playing time with Berkman now on the DL.[22][26] After hitting five home 
runs in a seven-game stretch, injury quickly struck again when he pulled 
a hamstring in a game against the San Francisco Giants on May 18 and landed 
back on the 15-day DL. To that point, Craig made a convincing argument 
for forcing his way into the starting lineup with a combination of top 
prospect Matt Adams' slumping and hitting .373 with a .424 on-base percentage 
and .765 slugging percentage in thirteen games.[27] Craig was back in action 
on June 1, and three days later, his tiebreaking two-run home run against 
the Mets allowed the Cardinals to end a five-game losing streak with a 
5–4 win.[28] In a stretch from June 9–21, he encountered a rare slump as 
he batted just .175 with one home run in 11 games. However, Craig discovered 
that pitchers were throwing him more sliders. Over the next nine games 
through July 3, he solved his opponents' strategy, batting .364 with five 
HR and 15 RBI. His season total to that date included appearing in just 
40 of the Cardinals' 80 first games, taking 152 at-bats. Nonetheless, he 
tied Holliday (296 at-bats), catcher Yadier Molina (265), and third baseman 
David Freese (276) with 13 HRs. He also carried a .322 batting average 
with 43 RBI. The RBI total ranked third in the NL since May 1, even with 
the second DL stay.[29] Through September 16, he showed that he was adept 
at hitting with runners in scoring position with a .355 batting average 
in his 197 career at-bats.[21] Craig fabricated consistency throughout 
the season, finishing with a .307 average, 22 HR and 92 RBI in 119 games. 
He ranked tenth in the NL in batting, seventh in slugging percentage (.522) 
and placed 19th in the Most Valuable Player award (MVP) balloting.[11] 
He also led all major leaguers with a .400 batting average with runners 
in scoring position (RISP).[20] Despite two DL trips, Craig played 30 games 
in the outfield and led the team in starts at first base with 86, while 
Berkman appeared in just 32 total games.[27] With Berkman's departure via 
free agency, Craig became the Cardinals' primary first baseman. On March 
8, the club announced they had reached an agreement with him on a five-year 
contract with a team option for a sixth season.[20] The $31 million deal 
bought out his three future arbitration-eligible years and first year of 
free agency. Craig would earn $13 million in the 2018 season if the Cardinals 
exercised their option.[30] In July, National League manager Bruce Bochy 
selected Craig to his first All-Star Game at Citi Field in Queens, New 
York City, as a reserve first baseman. His first-half performance included 
batting .333 with 10 home runs and 74 RBI. Both his RBI and hit totals 
(116) placed second in the NL. He became the fifth alumnus of the California 
Golden Bears to be named to an MLB All-Star team.[31] With his team facing 
a 5–4 deficit, Craig belted the game-winning grand slam against the division 
rival Reds on August 26. The final outcome was 8–6. It was his first career 
grand slam, boosting his totals to seven hits in ten bases-loaded at-bats 
to go with 20 RBI to that point in the season (14 for 31, .452 batting 
average for his career).[32] He was also batting .452 with runners in scoring 
position – again leading the Major Leagues – and it was the third-highest 
of all time for a single season, after George Brett (.469, 1980) and Tony 
Gwynn (.459, 1997).[33] A Lisfranc injury on September 4 on an infield 
hit against the Reds prevented him from appearing in a game for the rest 
of the regular season. At the time, he was third in the NL in RBI with 
97. He eventually finished eighth. Despite being shut down early, he led 
Cardinals in this category. St. Louis Post-Dispatch sportswriter Bernie 
Miklasz dubbed Craig "The Clutchmaster", "The RBI Machine" and "an RBI 
Monster."[34][35] He also finished eighth in batting average (.315).[11] 
His final batting average with RISP –.454 – remained the Major-League high 
and third-highest all-time.[36] That figure surpassed Brian Jordan's average 
of .422 in 1996 (62 of 147) as the team record.[35] In spite of his success 
hitting with RISP, Baseball-Reference.com rated his Wins Above Replacement 
(WAR) at 2.2 and Fangraphs at 2.6.[11][37] Craig's chances of returning 
to play before the end of the season depended on how far the Cardinals 
could extend their season in the playoffs. They qualified for the postseason 
by finishing with the best regular season record (97–65) in the National 
League. They kept winning through the playoffs, defeating the Pittsburgh 
Pirates in the NLDS and the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NLCS. Ready as a 
hitter in time for the World Series against the Boston Red Sox, Matheny 
at first excluded him from defense as the injury was not fully healed. 
Therefore, he served as the designated hitter (DH) at Fenway Park in Boston 
and a pinch hitter at Busch Stadium in St. Louis, a National League park 
where the DH is not normally played.[38] In Game 3, Craig was part of an 
unusual, game-ending, play. With the scored tied 4–4 in the bottom of the 
ninth, Cardinals center fielder Jon Jay hit a ground ball off pitcher Koji 
Uehara toward second baseman Dustin Pedroia, who threw the ball home to 
catcher Jarrod Saltalamacchia to easily tag Yadier Molina out attempting 
to score. Saltalamacchia then threw the ball to Will Middlebrooks as Craig 
rounded third, but it sailed wide into left field for an error, and, at 
the same time, Middlebrooks tripped while reaching for the ball. Daniel 
Nava recovered the ball and threw it back to home plate long before Craig 
would have successfully scored. Due to being tripped, umpire Jim Joyce 
awarded Craig home plate when he called an obstruction on Middlebrooks, 
giving the Cardinals a 5–4 walk-off victory. This is the first known such 
walk-off victory in World Series history.[39][40] However, the Cardinals 
lost the series to the Red Sox in six games. Craig batted 16 times and 
collected six hits for a .375 batting average.[11] After the season, he 
finished 21st in the MVP balloting, but likely would have finished much 
higher had he not missed nearly a month of the season due to injury.[41] 
With another free agent departure in Beltrán, Craig again shifted positions 
in 2014, replacing him in right field. It also cleared the way for Matt 
Adams to assume first base.[42] Craig started the season slowly, batting 
just .220 with a .644 OPS in April. He batted .291 and raised his OPS to 
.781 in May.[43] On July 31, 2014, Craig was traded along with Joe Kelly 
to the Red Sox in exchange for John Lackey and prospect Corey Littrell.[44] 
On May 9, 2015, the Red Sox optioned Craig to the Pawtucket Red Sox of 
the Class AAA International League; since Craig had yet to accrue five 
years of service time, the Red Sox could option him to the minor leagues 
without his consent.[45] On May 18, they outrighted him to the minors, 
removing him from the 40 man roster.[46] He was re-added to the major league 
roster on September 1. While still in the minor leagues, Craig showed in 
little time that he could hit at all levels but he had no natural position. 
In spite of the challenge to categorize his defensive abilities, his versatility 
and athleticism has allowed him to play at all positions in the major leagues 
except pitcher, shortstop, and catcher.[11][15] After an experiment at 
second base early in his Major League career, first base and the corners 
in the outfield emerged as the positions for which he was best suited. 
He played shortstop in amateur ball and third base in the minor leagues, 
but he was not well-suited to play either position in the major leagues, 
due to the speed of the game. He posted a fielding percentage of just .927 
in 246 minor league games at third base, considered a very low percentage.[47] 
According to former Cardinals player development executive Jeff Luhnow 
and Memphis Redbirds manager Ron Warner, Craig's arm, range and footwork 
proved problematic for third base. He improved his footwork well enough 
for the Texas League, but they still considered it insufficient for the 
major leagues because his movement to his left was inhibited, restricting 
his ability to start double plays. Further, with an inefficient, semi-sidearm 
throwing motion that he could not resolve, Craig relied on his innate strength 
to compensate for time lost.[47] Bold: led National League †: led all Major 
Leagues Allen Craig holds a degree in Social Welfare from the University 
of California-Berkeley.[49] When growing up, his favorite baseball player 
was Ken Griffey, Jr. He was also a fan of Cal Ripken, Jr.[49] Craig attended 
high school with Brandon Snider, the grandson of Duke Snider, with whom 
he tied the World Series consecutive pinch hit mark.[19] His sister, Kendal 
Craig, also graduated from Chaparral High School in Temecula and played 
softball. She attended California State University San Marcos in San Marcos, 
California.[2] On November 12, 2011, Craig married his long-time girlfriend, 
Marie LaMarca, who also is a graduate of Chaparral High School. The couple 
reside in their mutual hometown of Temecula, along with their daughter 
Eden and pet tortoise, Torty.[21][50] Torty, whom he has had since a hatchling, 
gained notoriety and a cult following through a vicarious Twitter account 
and has since served as an informal mascot for the Cardinals. Craig's favorite 
movies are Major League and Major League II. He still enjoys playing basketball 
and has also played golf since his father introduced him to the sport as 
a small child.[49] In May, 2014, Craig partnered with fellow Cardinals 
outfielder Jon Jay for the Jay-Craig Celebrity Bowl and the Flamingo Bowl 
in downtown St. Louis. The proceeds benefited Great Circle, a nonprofit 
organization that provides behavioral health services autism, educational 
challenges, emotional health, in-home crisis intervention, foster care 
and adoption, adventure therapy and psychological trauma recovery.[51]
