Thomas H. "Tom" Cahill (October, 1868 – December 25, 1894) was an American 
professional baseball player who played from 1888 to 1894. He played one 
season in Major League Baseball and had a career batting average of .253 
with 109 hits, 17 doubles, 7 triples, 3 home runs, 44 RBIs, and 38 stolen

in October, 1868. His father, also named Thomas Cahill, was born in Ireland 
and worked as a laborer.[1] Cahill's mother was also born in Ireland.[2] 
Cahill attended both the College of the Holy Cross, and the University 
of Pennsylvania. At the University of Pennsylvania, Cahill studied medicine 
while playing professional baseball.[3] He left the University of Pennsylvania 
School of Medicine in 1891 to play professional baseball full-time, but 
planned on returning to his studies and eventually becoming a doctor.[4] 
In 1888, Cahill began his professional career at the age of 19 with the 
Worcester Grays of the New England League. The next season, Cahill played 
with the New Haven, Connecticut baseball club of the Atlantic Association. 
Cahill was described by the Meriden Daily Republican as "a popular catcher," 
and the New Haven club resigned Cahill for the 1890 season.[3] Cahill began 
to play with the Major League Baseball franchise Louisville Colonels of 
the American Association in 1901, a year after they won the American Association 
pennant. On the season, Cahill played multiple positions including catcher 
(55 games), shortstop (49 games), outfield (12 games), second base (6 games), 
and third base (2 games). In total, Cahill committed 69 errors in 342 total 
chances, giving him a fielding percentage of .930. On the offensive side, 
Cahill batted .253 with 68 runs, 17 doubles, 7 triples, 3 home runs, 44 
RBIs, 38 stolen bases, and 41 bases on balls. Among teammates, Cahill lead 
the Colonels in stolen bases, and stolen bases; was second in doubles; 
and was fourth in hits, bases on balls, and triples (tied with Ollie Beard).[5] 
Cahill was first in the majors in stolen bases amongst fellow rookies (tied 
with Tommy Dowd), and was second in the league (first in the American Association) 
in doubles.[6] On April 21, 1892, Cahill was released by the Colonels.[7] 
After his major league career, Cahill played for the Troy Trojans of the 
Eastern League for two seasons (1892–1893). His final season was 1894, 
before his death. Cahill played with the Troy Washerwomen, which later 
moved to Scranton, Pennsylvania and became the Scranton Indians. He was 
the manager of the Scranton baseball club.[4] Cahill died on December 25, 
1894 in Scranton, Pennsylvania. He died from complications after an injury.[4] 
Cahill was buried in St. John Cemetery in Fall River, Massachusetts.[8]
