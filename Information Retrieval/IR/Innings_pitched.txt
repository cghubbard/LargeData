In baseball, innings pitched (IP) are the number of innings a pitcher has 
completed, measured by the number of batters and baserunners that are put 
out while the pitcher is on the pitching mound in a game. Three outs made 
is equal to one inning pitched. One out counts as one-third of an inning, 
and two outs counts as two-thirds of an inning. Sometimes, the statistic 
is written 34.1, 72.2, or 91.0, for example, to represent 34 1⁄3 innings, 
72 2⁄3 innings, and 91 innings exactly, respectively. Runners left on base 
by a pitcher are not counted in determining innings pitched. It is possible 
for a pitcher to enter a game, give up several hits and possibly even several 
runs, and be removed before achieving any outs, thereby recording a total 
of zero innings pitched. The only active players in the top 100 all-time 
at the end of the 2009 season were Tom Glavine (ranked 30th with 4,413 1⁄3 
IP), Randy Johnson (ranked 38th with 4,135 1⁄3), Jamie Moyer (ranked 45th 
with 3,908 2⁄3) and John Smoltz (ranked 74th with 3473). This is because 
over time, innings pitched has declined. Several factors are responsible
