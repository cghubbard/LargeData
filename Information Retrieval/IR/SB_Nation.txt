SB Nation (Sports Blog Nation)[3] is a sports news website owned and operated 
by Vox Media (formerly SportsBlogs, Inc.). Established in 2005, the site 
comprises 316 blogs covering individual professional and college sports 
teams, and other sports-oriented topics. The site operates from Vox’s offices 
just off Bryant Park in Midtown Manhattan, New York City, as well as Dupont 
Circle in Washington, D.C.[4] SB Nation currently has content-sharing partnerships 
with Yahoo! Sports, CBS Sports, USA Today, Comcast and the National Hockey 
League (NHL).[5][6][7] The concept of SB Nation was rooted in Athletics 
Nation, a blog focused on the Oakland Athletics, which was founded in 2003 
by Tyler Bleszinski. Bleszinski noted that at the time, blogs focused on 
sports were a new concept limited to "mostly baseball sites on Typepad 
and Blogger", and that he was displeased over how the Athletics were being 
covered by these sites. In the spirit of Athletics manager Billy Beane, 
he decided to build his own blog with an aggressive focus on the team. 
Athletics Nation soon became the second-largest site on the advertising 
network Blogads behind the political blog Daily Kos. Its author, Markos 
Moulitsas, was also a friend of Bleszinksi; in 2005, Bleszinksi partnered 
with him to form SB Nation, which would serve as a network of sports blogs 
with a common platform enabling community participation. Athletics Nation 
began hiring additional part-time writers, while the SB Nation network 
would absorb and acquire other sports blogs focusing on major league and 
college teams.[8][9] In 2008, Jim Bankoff, a former AOL executive, joined 
as CEO to expand SB Nation. Comparing it to his previous company's focus 
on publishing content in specific verticals, Bankoff wanted to build a 
topic-based sports media company, explaining that "when you go to Google 
you don't type in 'sports', you search for a specific team or a player. 
As media consumers, we're not sports fans, but we're fans of a given team. 
That's our philosophy here, and our tagline fits it well when it says pro 
quality—in reference to the type of content and commentary, and fan perspective—as 
we speak from a fan voice, which can mean we're sometimes very critical."[9][10] 
In 2009, SBNation.com was re-launched to serve as a nationally-focused 
portal for the network's sites.[9] As of February 2009, there were about 
185 blogs. ComScore, the Reston, Virginia-based tracker of consumer Internet 
habits, tallied 5.8 million unique visitors to SB Nation websites during 
the month of November 2010. That 208 percent increase over the 1.9 million 
unique visitors in November 2009 made SB Nation the fastest growing sports 
website the company tracked at that time.[11] As of December 2010, SB Nation 
had 12 million unique visitors and over 100 million page views monthly; 
the site also announced plans to expand its scope into international sports 
by launching blogs focused on the English Premier League of soccer.[12] 
In 2011, a number of editors from AOL's blog Engadget, including Joshua 
Topolsky, left the site to join SB Nation, where they would begin work 
on launching a new technology website under its ownership known as The 
Verge, with Topolsky as editor-in-chief.[13][14] Following the launch of 
The Verge, SB Nation's parent company was renamed Vox Media.[9][15] In 
November 2011, Vox Media acquired MMAFighting.com from AOL; the site was 
integrated into SB Nation.[16] In December 2011 Time, listed SB Nation 
#1 in Sports, and #15 overall in its "50 Websites That Make the Web Great" 
list.[17] In September 2012, SB Nation unveiled a comprehensive redesign 
of the website codenamed "SB United". The project reconstructed the site 
with a unified format and design, using a responsive, "magazine-style" 
presentation with multimedia and "StoryStreams", and new circular logo 
designs for each one of the site's blogs. The changes came under the direction 
of Spencer Hall, writer of the college football blog Every Day Should Be 
Saturday, who was named as the site's first ever editorial director, and 
stated that he had wanted to "corral some kind of common vision and coordination" 
between the individual blogs on SB Nation.[18][19][20] In March 2013, Vox 
Media acquired Outsports, a blog focusing on sport in the LGBT community. 
It was integrated into SB Nation.[21] On July 18, 2016, Vox Media announced 
a partnership with GOW Media, under which its Yahoo! Sports Radio network 
was re-branded as SB Nation Radio on August 1, 2016. SB Nation and its 
blogs will contribute on-air personalities and co-develop new content for 
the network.[22] In February 2016, the site published a lengthy profile 
of Daniel Holtzclaw, a former police officer convicted of multiple accounts 
of rape and other charges, focusing on his college football career. The 
piece, which was seen as sympathetic to Holtzclaw, was heavily criticized 
and was taken down within hours of publication. SB Nation's editorial director 
Spencer Hall apologized for "a complete breakdown" of SB Nation's editorial 
process, and described the story and its publication as a "complete failure" 
of site standards.[23][24][25] SB Nation subsequently cut ties with the 
story's author, freelance journalist Jeff Arnold, and put its longform 
program on hiatus pending a peer review of the editorial process that led
