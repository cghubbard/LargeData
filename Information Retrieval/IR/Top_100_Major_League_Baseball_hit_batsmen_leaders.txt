In baseball, hit by pitch (HBP) is a situation in which a batter or his 
clothing or equipment (other than his bat) is struck directly by a pitch 
from the pitcher; the batter is called a hit batsman (HB). A hit batsman 
is awarded first base, provided that (in the plate umpire's judgment) he 
made an honest effort to avoid the pitch, although failure to do so is 
rarely called by an umpire. Being hit by a pitch is often caused by a batter 
standing too close to, or "crowding", home plate. This is a list of the 
top 100 Major League Baseball pitchers who have the most hit batsmen of 
all time. Gus Weyhing (277) holds the dubious record of most hit batsmen 
in a career. Chick Fraser (219), Pink Hawley (210), and Walter Johnson 
(205) are the only other pitchers to hit 200 or more batters in their careers.
