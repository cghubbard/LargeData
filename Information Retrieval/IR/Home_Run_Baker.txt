John Franklin "Home Run" Baker (March 13, 1886 – June 28, 1963) was an 
American professional baseball player. A third baseman, Baker played in 
Major League Baseball from 1908 to 1922, for the Philadelphia Athletics 
and the New York Yankees. Baker has been called the "original home run 
king of the majors".[1] Baker was a member of the Athletics' $100,000 infield. 
He helped the Athletics win the 1910, 1911 and 1913 World Series. After 
a contract dispute, the Athletics sold Baker to the Yankees, where he and 
Wally Pipp helped the Yankees' offense. Baker appeared with the Yankees 
in the 1921 and 1922 World Series, though the Yankees lost both series, 
before retiring. Baker led the American League in home runs for four consecutive 
years, from 1911 through 1914. He had a batting average over .300 in six 
seasons, had three seasons with more than 100 runs batted in, and two seasons 
with over 100 runs scored. Baker's legacy has grown over the years, and 
he is regarded by many as one of the best power hitters of the deadball 
era.[2] During his 13 years as a major league player, Baker never played 
a single inning at any position other than third base. Baker was elected 
to the National Baseball Hall of Fame by the Veterans Committee in 1955. 
Baker was born on March 13, 1886, to Franklin Adams Baker and Mary Catherine 
(née Fitzhugh) on their farm in Trappe, Maryland.[3][4] The Bakers, who 
were of English descent, had been farmers in Trappe for six generations. 
His mother, of Scottish descent, was reported to be a distant relative 
of Robert E. Lee.[2][4] Baker enjoyed working on his father's farm, but 
he aspired become a professional baseball player from the age of ten. In 
Trappe, most of the residents attended the local baseball team's games 
on Saturdays.[5] Frank's older brother, Norman, was well known in the town 
for his playing ability. Norman once tried out for the Philadelphia Athletics, 
but he did not like that city and stopped pursuing a baseball career.[4] 
Baker pitched for the local high school baseball team and worked as a clerk 
at a butcher shop and grocery store owned by relatives. He signed with 
a local semi-professional baseball team based in Ridgely, Maryland, in 
1905, at the age of 19. The team, which was managed by Buck Herzog, paid 
him $5 per week ($132 in current dollar terms) and covered his boarding 
costs. Herzog found that Baker could not pitch well, but that he could 
hit. Baker was unable to play the outfield well, but he was able to move 
into the infield as a third baseman for Ridgely.[2][6] In 1906, Baker played 
for Sparrows Point Club in Baltimore, earning $15 per week ($396 in current 
dollar terms). He received an offer to play for a team in the Class C Texas 
League in 1907, which he turned down. He instead signed with an independent 
team based in Cambridge, Maryland.[2] A scout for the New York Giants of 
the National League noticed Baker while he was playing for Sparrows Point. 
They arranged for Baker to receive a tryout with the Baltimore Orioles 
of the Class A Eastern League late in the 1907 season.[7] Playing in five 
games, Baker recorded two hits, both singles, in 15 at-bats. Orioles' manager 
Jack Dunn decided that Baker "could not hit", and Baker was released.[2] 
In 1908, Baker began the season with the Reading Pretzels of the Class 
B Tri-State League. He had a .299 batting average in 119 games played, 
adding six home runs, 65 runs scored, and 23 stolen bases.[2][8] Connie 
Mack, the manager of the Philadelphia Athletics, purchased Baker's contract 
in September 1908. In nine games, Baker batted .290 in 31 at-bats to close 
the 1908 season.[2][8] Mack named Baker his starting third baseman for 
the 1909 season. That year, Mack established his "$100,000 infield", with 
Baker joined by first baseman Stuffy McInnis, second baseman Eddie Collins, 
and shortstop Jack Barry.[9] He hit .305 with a .447 slugging percentage 
and four home runs for Philadelphia in 1909, including the first home run 
to go over the fence in right field of Shibe Park. His slugging percentage 
was fourth best in the American League, while his 85 runs batted in (RBIs) 
were third-best, and his 19 triples led the league. The Athletics improved 
by 27 wins over their 1908 record in 1909, but finished in second place 
behind the Detroit Tigers.[2] In a late season series against the Tigers 
in 1909, Ty Cobb spiked Baker while sliding into third base, lacerating 
Baker's arm. Baker referred to the spiking as "deliberate" on the part 
of Cobb,[10] while Mack called Cobb the dirtiest player he had seen,[2] 
and asked American League president Ban Johnson to investigate. A photograph 
taken for The Detroit News vindicated Cobb, by showing that Baker had to 
reach across the base to reach Cobb.[10] Though Baker remained in the game 
after wrapping his arm, he acquired a reputation for being weak and easily 
intimidated.[2] Joe S. Jackson, a sportswriter for the Detroit Free Press, 
referred to Baker as a "soft-fleshed darling"[10] In the 1910 season, Baker 
led the American League with 11 home runs in 1911, and batted .344.[2] 
Baker helped the Athletics win the 1910 World Series over the Chicago Cubs, 
four games to one, as he batted .409 in the five-game series.[11] In the 
1911 World Series, the Athletics faced off against the Giants. Based on 
Baker's past run-in with Cobb, Giants' players believed they could intimidate 
him. Fred Snodgrass spiked Baker while sliding into third base in Game 
One, knocking the ball loose and requiring Baker to bandage his arm. In 
Game Two, Baker hit a go-ahead home run off Rube Marquard. He hit a ninth-inning 
game-tying home run off Christy Mathewson in Game Three. Later in the game, 
Snodgrass again attempted to spike Baker, but he was able to hold onto 
the ball.[2] A six-day delay between games as a result of rain, which turned 
Shibe Park into a "virtual quagmire", allowed Baker's feats to be magnified 
by the Philadelphia press, during which time, he began to be referred to 
by the nickname "Home Run".[12] The Athletics defeated the Giants in six 
games, as Baker led the Athletics with a .375 batting average, nine hits, 
and five RBIs in the series.[2][8] Baker again led the American League 
in home runs in 1912, and he also led the league with 130 RBIs.[13] The 
Athletics finished in third place.[14] In 1913, Baker led the league with 
12 home runs and 117 RBIs. The Athletics defeated the Giants in the 1913 
World Series, as Baker batted .450 with a home run and seven RBIs in the 
five games. He led the league in home runs for a fourth consecutive season 
in 1914, with nine,[2] despite suffering from pleurisy during the season.[15] 
He also batted .319 and added 90 RBIs, 10 triples, and 19 stolen bases.[16] 
Late in the season, Mack sent Baker, Collins, and Chief Bender to scout 
the Boston Braves, their opponent in the 1914 World Series.[17] Despite 
predictions that Philadelphia would win the series handily,[16] the Braves 
defeated the Athletics four games to none, as Baker batted .250.[18] After 
the 1914 World Series, Mack began to sell off some of his best players.[2] 
However, he had given Collins a multiyear contract during the 1914 season 
to prevent him from jumping to the upstart Federal League.[15] Baker, who 
had just completed the first year of a three-year contract, attempted to 
renegotiate his terms, but Mack refused.[19] Baker sat out the entire 1915 
season as a result of this contract dispute.[20] He remained in baseball, 
playing for a team representing Upland, Pennsylvania, in the semiprofessional 
Delaware County League.[2][21] Pressured by American League president Ban 
Johnson, Mack sold Baker's contract in 1916 to the New York Yankees for 
$35,000 ($762,401 in current dollar terms).[2][8] Even though Baker reported 
to the Yankees with an injured finger, and he injured his knee during a 
game in May, he and Wally Pipp combined to form the center of the Yankees' 
batting order. Pipp led the American League in home runs with 12 in 1916; 
Baker finished second with 10, despite missing almost a third of the Yankees' 
games.[22][23] Pipp hit nine home runs in 1917, again leading the league.[22] 
Baker led the league with 141 games played in the 1919 season. The Yankees 
hit a league-leading 47 home runs that year, of which Baker hit ten.[2] 
Sports cartoonist Robert Ripley, working for the New York Globe coined 
the term "Murderer's Row" to refer to the lineup of Baker, Pipp, Roger 
Peckinpaugh, and Ping Bodie.[24] Baker sat out of baseball during the 1920 
season, as his wife died of scarlet fever. His two daughters were also 
affected, but they were able to recover.[2] Late in the 1920 season, Baker 
again played for Upland, and stated his desire to return to New York. He 
rejoined the Yankees in 1921, as the Yankees reached the World Series for 
the first time in franchise history. Missing the last six weeks of the 
1921 season, Yankees' manager Miller Huggins started Mike McNally in his 
place. In the 1921 World Series, a best-of-nine series, Huggins opted to 
start McNally over Baker, though he wanted to be sure to take advantage 
of Baker's World Series experience.[25] The Giants defeated the Yankees 
five games to three; Baker played in only four of the eight games, though 
McNally struggled to a .200 batting average.[26] In the 1922 season, Baker 
played in 66 games. Overshadowed by Ruth as a home run hitter, Baker complained 
about the "rabbit ball", saying that the ball being used traveled much 
further than the ball used for the majority of his career.[2] The Yankees 
again faced the Giants in the World Series, losing four games to none. 
Baker received only one at bat in the 1922 World Series.[27] He finished 
his career as a Yankee with a .288 batting average, 48 home runs and 375 
RBIs in 676 games.[28] Following his retirement as a player, Baker managed 
the Easton Farmers of the Eastern Shore League during the 1924 and 1925 
seasons. He was credited with discovering Jimmie Foxx and recommending 
him to Mack. After Baker sold Foxx to the Athletics, the Farmers fired 
Baker, because they believed Mack did not pay a high enough price for Foxx.[2] 
Baker was a modest man who never drank, smoked, or swore.[29][30] He returned 
to his Maryland farm every offseason, where he enjoyed duck hunting.[2] 
While playing in Cambridge, Baker met Ottilie Tschantre, the daughter of 
a Swiss jeweler. They were married on November 12, 1909.[7] Baker and his 
wife had twin babies in late January 1914. The babies were reported as 
doing well a couple of days later, but they died before they were two weeks 
old. The twins were initially reported as being a boy and a girl by The 
New York Times, but they were reported as twin girls by the same publication 
a few days later.[31][32] After the 1919 season, his wife contracted scarlet 
fever and died.[2] He remarried, to Margaret Mitchell, after leaving the 
Yankees.[2] In addition to working on his farm, Baker served Trappe as 
a member of the Trappe Town Board, a tax collector, and a volunteer firefighter. 
He was also a director of the State Bank of Trappe.[2] On June 28, 1963, 
Baker suffered a stroke and died. He was interred in Spring Hill Cemetery 
in Easton, Maryland.[2] Though nicknamed "Home Run", Baker hit only 96 
home runs in his career, and never more than 12 in a season as he played 
during the dead ball era .[8] Walter Johnson referred to Baker as "the 
most dangerous batter I ever faced."[8] Baseball historian Bill James rated 
the 1914 edition of the $100,000 infield as the greatest infield of all 
time, and also ranked the 1912 and 1913 editions in the top five of all 
time.[33] In 1955, the Veterans Committee elected Baker into the National 
Baseball Hall of Fame.[34] He was also inducted into the baseball hall 
of fame for Reading, Pennsylvania.[8] Lawrence Ritter and Donald Honig 
included him in their 1981 book The 100 Greatest Baseball Players of All 
Time.[citation needed] In his 2001 book The New Bill James Historical Baseball 
Abstract, Bill James ranked Baker the 70th greatest player of all time 
and the 5th greatest third baseman.[35] Home Run Baker Park in his hometown
