In its 108-year history, the Minnesota Twins baseball franchise of Major 
League Baseball's American League has employed 29 managers.[1] The duties 
of the manager include team strategy and leadership on and off the field.[2] 
Eight of these team managers have been "player-managers", all during the 
Washington Senators era;[1] specifically, they managed the team while still 
playing for it.[3] The Minnesota franchise began its life as the Washington 
Senators in Washington, D. C., where they played from their inception in 
1901 to 1960.[4] In the early twentieth century, the Senators were managed 
consecutively by three future members of the National Baseball Hall of 
Fame, bookended by Bucky Harris, who managed the team from 1924 to 1928 
and again from 1935 to 1942. Walter Johnson managed the team for four seasons 
from 1929 to 1932, and he was followed by Joe Cronin, who led for the next 
two seasons (1933–1934). In 1960, the American League awarded an expansion 
franchise to Minneapolis, Minnesota; however, owner Calvin Griffith moved 
his team to Minnesota,[5][6] and Washington was awarded the expansion team 
instead. Thus, the Minnesota Twins began play at Metropolitan Stadium in 
Bloomington, Minnesota the following year, during the tenure of manager 
Cookie Lavagetto,[7] and played at the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome in 
downtown Minneapolis from 1982 to 2009. Under manager Ron Gardenhire, the 
team moved to Target Field beginning in the 2010 season. Seven managers 
have taken the franchise to the postseason, with Gardenhire leading them 
to five playoff appearances, the most in their franchise history.[8] Two 
managers have won World Series championships with the franchise: Bucky 
Harris, in the 1924 World Series against the New York Giants;[9] and Tom 
Kelly, in the 1987 World Series against the St. Louis Cardinals[10] and 
1991 against the Atlanta Braves.[11] Harris is also the longest-tenured 
manager in their franchise history, with 2,776 games of service in parts 
of 18 seasons between 1924 and 1954;[12] he is followed by Kelly, who managed 
2,386 games over 16 seasons from 1986 to 2001.[13] The manager with the 
highest winning percentage in team history is Billy Martin, who managed 
the team in 1969 and achieved a record of 97–65 (.599). Conversely, the 
manager with the lowest winning percentage is Malachi Kittridge, whose 
winning percentage of .059 was achieved with a record of 1–16 in the first 
half of 1904. Kittridge's tenure is also the shortest in team history.[1]
