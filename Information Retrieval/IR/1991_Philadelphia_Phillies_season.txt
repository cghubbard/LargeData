On April 28, 1991, the Phillies recorded the first triple-play in the history 
of Veterans Stadium.[3] Tony Gwynn lined to second baseman Randy Ready. 
Ready stepped on second, and although he could have tagged the runner, 
threw to first baseman Ricky Jordan.[4] On May 6, 1991, Lenny Dykstra slammed 
his Mercedes-Benz red sports car into two trees while driving home from 
a bachelor party.[5] Dykstra, suffered three broken ribs, a broken right 
collarbone and a broken right cheekbone. A broken rib punctured a lung 
and his heart was bruised, according to doctors.[5] Phillies' catcher Darren 
Daulton was also in the car with Dykstra. Daulton suffered a broken left 
eye socket, a scratched left cornea and a heart bruise, doctors said.[5] 
On May 23, 1991, Tommy Greene threw a no-hitter against the Montreal Expos 
in Montreal. Greene was starting for only the second time in the season 
and 15th time in his major league career. He became the first visiting 
pitcher to hurl a no-hitter in Montreal's history as the Phillies defeated 
the Expos, 2-0 before an Olympic Stadium crowd of 8,833. Greene was pitching 
in place of Danny Cox who had suffered a pulled groin in his last start. 
Greene walked seven batters but also struck out 10.[6] Playing against 
the Cincinnati Reds on June 14, 1991, Von Hayes was hit by a pitch by Tom 
Browning[7] which broke his arm. Hayes returned to action on September 
6, 1991 against Houston. Hayes was traded to the California Angels in the 
off-season but Hayes would later cite Browning's pitch as ending his career, 
"I broke my arm when I was hit by a pitch from Tom Browning... and I was 
finished. I tried to make a comeback (with California) in 1992, but it 
was no good."[8] On October 6, 1991, the most strikeouts were recorded 
against the Phillies in franchise history as David Cone of their division 
rival New York Mets struck out 19,[9] tying a then-National League record 
for most strikeouts in a game, set by Steve Carlton against the Mets in 
their championship season of 1969 and Tom Seaver the following year.[9] 
It was also the most strikeouts ever recorded by a pitcher at Veterans 
Stadium.[9] The Mets won the game 7-0. Infielders Other batters Coaches
