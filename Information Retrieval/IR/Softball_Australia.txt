Australia's softball history began in 1939 when Gordon Young, Director 
of Physical Education in NSW, began to promote the game in schools and 
colleges.[1] In 1942, during World War II, US army sergeant William Duvernet 
organised softball as a recreation for US nurses stationed in Victoria. 
Another American, Mack Gilley, introduced the game to Queensland in 1946.[1] 
Australia's first inter-state championship was played in Brisbane in 1947 
and was won by Victoria. The second national championship was held in Melbourne 
two years later. It was at this championship that the Australian Softball 
Federation was formed with Queensland, Victoria, South Australia and New 
South Wales being the founding members. The other States of Australia have 
since joined. Eight Australian Championships are now conducted each year 
- Women's, Men's, Under 23 Women and Men, Under 19 Women and Men, and Under 
16 Girls and Boys. Softball has been a major sport in the schools program 
for some time now and it is estimated that more than 250,000 children play 
the game each year. Each year the Australian Softball Federation holds 
8 National Championships. These are hosted by the various state bodies
