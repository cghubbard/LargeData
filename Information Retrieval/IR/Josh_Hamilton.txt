Joshua Holt Hamilton (born May 21, 1981) is an American professional baseball 
outfielder who is a free agent. In addition to the Texas Rangers (2008–2012, 
2015), he has also played for the Cincinnati Reds (2007) and Los Angeles 
Angels of Anaheim (2013–2014). He is a five-time MLB All-Star and won the 
American League Most Valuable Player Award (MVP) in 2010. He was the first 
overall pick in the 1999 MLB draft by the Tampa Bay Devil Rays.[1] He was 
considered a blue chip prospect until injuries and a drug addiction derailed 
his career, beginning in 2001. Prior to the 2007 season, Hamilton was selected 
by the Chicago Cubs (picking for the Reds) in the Rule 5 draft.[2] During 
the off-season he was traded to the Rangers. During the 2008 season, Hamilton 
was named to the AL All-Star team. He also participated in the Home Run 
Derby, where he hit a record 28 home runs in the opening round and finished 
with 35 home runs, which was second-most all-time in derby history.[3][4] 
He made the All-Star team the next four seasons as well. In 2012, Hamilton 
received more votes than any other player on the All-Star Game ballot, 
besting by approximately 3.5 million votes the vote count set in 2011 by 
José Bautista.[5] Hamilton won the AL batting title in 2010. On October 
22, 2010, Hamilton was selected as MVP of the 2010 ALCS. On November 23, 
2010, Hamilton was named the 2010 AL MVP, earning 22 of 28 first-place 
votes.[6] On May 8, 2012, Hamilton became the 16th player in MLB history 
to hit four home runs in a game. All 4 home runs were 2-run home runs, 
and he set an AL record for total bases in a game with 18.[7] Hamilton 
was born and grew up in Raleigh, North Carolina, playing little league 
baseball alongside former South Carolina and Oakland Athletics catcher 
Landon Powell.[8] Hamilton attended Athens Drive High School, in Raleigh, 
North Carolina where he starred as both a pitcher and outfielder. As a 
high school senior, Hamilton ran the 60 yard dash in 6.7 seconds and was 
clocked at 97 miles per hour (156 km/h) on the mound. After hitting .529 
in 25 games with 13 home runs, 20 stolen bases, 35 runs batted in (RBIs), 
and 34 runs scored, Hamilton was widely considered one of the top two prospects 
for the 1999 MLB draft, along with Josh Beckett, a Texas high school product.[9] 
The Tampa Bay Devil Rays owned the number one pick and on June 2, selected 
Hamilton with the first overall selection. Hamilton signed with Tampa Bay, 
receiving a $3.96 million signing bonus, and joined their minor league 
system.[1][10] His first stop in the minors was the rookie level Princeton 
Devil Rays of the Appalachian League where he played 56 games. He later 
joined the Hudson Valley Renegades, and helped lead them to their first 
New York–Penn League championship. He spent the 2000 season with the Charleston 
RiverDogs in the South Atlantic League. Hamilton enjoyed a breakout season 
where he hit .301 average in 96 games, with 13 home runs and 61 RBIs. He 
was also selected to the South Atlantic League All Star game and took home 
MVP honors after 2–6 with two triples and two runs scored.[11] In addition, 
Hamilton was named to the 2000 All-Star Futures Game, a game designed to 
showcase minor league prospects. Hamilton was also voted Minor League Player 
of the year by USA Today.[12] At the start of his pro career, Hamilton's 
parents quit their jobs so they could travel with their son.[13] Prior 
to the 2001 season, Hamilton was involved in an automobile accident. His 
mother and father were also injured in the accident, but they recuperated 
from their injuries. This also marked the time Hamilton started hanging 
around a tattoo parlor, which consequently led to his experimenting with 
drugs and alcohol. The 2001 season also marked the beginning of his drug 
and alcohol use, and he made his first attempt at rehabilitation.[13] Hamilton 
only played 45 games in the 2001 season, split between Charleston (A-Ball) 
and the Orlando Rays, a Double-A team in the Southern League. Hamilton 
began the 2002 season with the Bakersfield Blaze, batting .303 with nine 
home runs and 44 RBIs in 56 games before his season came to an end due 
to lingering toe and neck injuries.[12] The Devil Rays noticed a change 
in Hamilton and reacted by sending him to the Betty Ford Center for drug 
rehabilitation. During Spring training of the 2003 season, Hamilton failed 
his first drug test. At the start of the season, Hamilton showed up late 
several times during spring training and was reassigned to the team's minor 
league camp. He left the team and resurfaced several times, but eventually 
took the rest of the season off for personal reasons. Hamilton was hoping 
to return to spring training with the Devil Rays in 2004, but he was suspended 
30 days and fined for violating the drug policy put in place by MLB. Because 
of the length of his suspension, and the terms of the drug policy, Hamilton 
could have failed two or more drug tests after being put into the program. 
A "failed" test is one in which there is a positive result for a drug more 
severe than marijuana.[14] A month later, MLB suspended him for the entire 
season after he failed two more tests.[15][16] Hamilton was out of baseball 
for almost three years. He made several attempts at rehabilitation, and 
started off the 2005 season with hopes of being a star major league outfielder. 
However, he was arrested before the season for smashing the windshield 
of a friend's truck. The Rays placed him on the restricted list, moving 
him off the 40-man roster. After another relapse, MLB suspended him for 
the entire 2006 season.[16] During the days of his most prolific abuse, 
Hamilton met a businessman named Michael Chadwick who made an attempt to 
steer him in the right direction. It was through this relationship that 
he ended up meeting his wife, Katie, who was Chadwick's daughter.[9][17] 
His return to baseball was helped along by former minor league outfielder 
and manager Roy Silver, who owned a baseball academy in Florida. After 
hearing about Hamilton's desire to return to baseball, Silver offered the 
use of his facility if Hamilton agreed to work there. Hamilton first started 
working at Silver's Academy in January 2006. His duties included cleaning 
the bathrooms and raking the infield. He spent his nights sleeping on an 
air mattress in one of the facilities offices. After several months there, 
Hamilton attempted to play with an independent minor league team, but MLB 
stepped in and disallowed it. Hamilton was allowed to work out with the 
Devil Rays minor league players starting on June 2, 2006. By the end of 
the month, he was allowed to participate in minor league games.[10][15] 
In order for this to happen, the Rays had to run Hamilton through waivers, 
making him available for any team for $20,000. No team put a claim in for 
him. He played 15 games with the Hudson Valley Renegades at the end of 
the 2006 season.[12][18] In addition to returning to baseball, Hamilton 
also served as a cautionary tale for his young teammates with the Renegades. 
Left off the Rays' 40-man roster, Hamilton was selected third overall[2] 
in the 2006 Rule 5 draft by the Chicago Cubs, who immediately traded him 
to the Reds for $100,000 ($50,000 for his rights, and $50,000 to cover 
the cost of the Rule 5 selection).[18][19] In their coverage of the draft, 
Chris Kline and John Manuel of Baseball America called Hamilton "the biggest 
name in the Rule 5 in many years."[20] In order to retain the rights to 
Hamilton, the Reds had to keep him on their Major League 25-man roster 
for the entire 2007 season. He was one of the Reds' best hitters in spring 
training, leaving camp with a .403 batting average. The Reds planned to 
use him as a fourth outfielder.[21] Hamilton started most of the time in 
center field after an injury to Ryan Freel. Hamilton made his long-awaited 
Major League debut on April 2 against the Chicago Cubs in a pinch-hit appearance, 
receiving a 22-second standing ovation. As he was waiting to bat, Cubs 
catcher Michael Barrett said, "You deserve it, Josh. Take it all in, brother. 
I'm happy for you."[1][22] After he lined out, Hamilton stayed in the game 
to play left field.[23] He made his first start on April 10 against the 
Arizona Diamondbacks, batting leadoff. In that game, he recorded his first 
Major League hit, a home run off Edgar Gonzalez. The next night, he hit 
another. Hamilton was named the National League Rookie of the Month for 
April. On May 22, the Reds placed Hamilton on the 15-day disabled list 
with gastroenteritis; they activated him on June 5 after he batted .333 
(8-for-24) with four home runs and six RBIs in a six-game Minor League 
rehabilitation assignment.[24] Hamilton went back on the DL on July 12 
with a sprained wrist.[25] He was shut out in the voting for the Rookie 
of the Year, which was won by Ryan Braun.[26] On December 21, 2007, the 
Reds traded Hamilton to the Texas Rangers for Edinson Vólquez and Danny 
Herrera.[27][28] In 2008, Hamilton locked up the Rangers starting center 
fielder job with a stellar spring training.[29] His spring training performance 
continued into the regular season. Hamilton, usually slotted fourth in 
the Texas batting order, led all major league players in RBIs for the month 
of April. He was named AL Player of the Month after hitting .330 with 32 
RBIs during the month. Hamilton then went on to win player of the month 
for the second straight month in May, becoming the first AL player in baseball 
history to be awarded Player of the Month for the first two months of the 
season.[30] Hamilton was featured on the cover of the June 2, 2008 issue 
of Sports Illustrated, in a story chronicling his comeback.[1] On July 
9, 2008, Hamilton hit the first walk-off home run of his career, against 
Francisco Rodríguez.[31][32] Fans selected Hamilton as one of the starting 
outfielders for the AL at the 2008 Major League Baseball All-Star Game 
at Yankee Stadium. He finished first in voting among outfielders.[33] He 
was one of seven first-time starters in the game. Along with Kosuke Fukudome, 
Geovany Soto, and Ryan Braun, he was one of four who had made their MLB 
debut in 2007 or 2008.[34] He was selected to participate in the 2008 Major 
League Baseball Home Run Derby the evening before the game. Hamilton selected 
71-year-old Clay Council to throw to him during the Derby. Council[35] 
was a volunteer who threw batting practice for him as a child in Raleigh, 
North Carolina.[36] In the first round of the event Hamilton hit 28 home 
runs, breaking the single-round record of 24 set by Bobby Abreu in 2005.[4][37] 
Hamilton ended up hitting the most total home runs in the contest with 
35, but lost in the final round to Justin Morneau, as the scores were reset.[38] 
His record-setting first round included 13 straight home runs at one point, 
and 7 that went further than 500 feet (150 m). His longest home run was 
518 feet.[4][38] In 2006, when Hamilton was trying to get back into baseball, 
he had a dream in which he participated in a Home Run Derby at Yankee Stadium, 
but he could not remember how many home runs he had hit. After the Derby, 
Hamilton said: "This was like living the dream out, because like I've said, 
I didn't know the ending to that dream."[39] On August 17, he was intentionally 
walked with the bases loaded against the Rays in the bottom of the ninth, 
with the Rays leading 7–3, to bring Marlon Byrd to the plate. The Rays 
went on to win the game 7–4. Hamilton thus became the sixth player in history, 
and the first American League player in 107 years, to receive an intentional 
walk with the bases loaded.[40] Joe Maddon said after the game, "We didn't 
want Hamilton to hit a home run. He's got 28, and Marlon Byrd's got 8." 
Hamilton finished seventh in the balloting for AL MVP, behind Dustin Pedroia, 
Justin Morneau, Kevin Youkilis, Joe Mauer, Carlos Quentin, and Francisco 
Rodríguez.[41] In spring training, Hamilton led all players in RBIs, with 
27, and total bases, with 59, in 81 at-bats. He hit a 460 ft (140 m) home 
run into the right field home run porch off Angels reliever Shane Loux 
in the bottom of the eighth inning on May 15 in Arlington. Then, in the 
same series against the Angels, on May 17 Hamilton leaped at the wall in 
center field and slammed into it, robbing Howie Kendrick of a possible 
home run.[42] Hamilton spent a portion of 2009 on the disabled list, with 
a bruised rib cage and an abdominal strain. After visiting doctors in Philadelphia 
on June 8, 2009, they found a slight abdominal tear, and he underwent a 
successful surgical operation to repair it the next day. He was expected 
to be out 4–6 weeks. Though injured, he was selected by fan voting to play 
in the 2009 All-Star game,[43][44] where he was joined by teammates Michael 
Young and Nelson Cruz. Hamilton finished batting .268 with 10 home runs 
and 54 RBIs in 2009. A story that brought some controversy was when it 
was revealed Hamilton had got drunk in an Arizona bar earlier in the year. 
Hamilton subsequently apologized about the lapse. In 2010, Hamilton was 
moved to left field to put young outfielder Julio Borbon in center field. 
As in his prior two seasons with the Rangers, Hamilton was again selected 
to start in the 2010 All-Star Game, as one of six members of the Rangers 
to represent the franchise at the All-Star Game. Hamilton entered the All-Star 
Break with a .346 batting average, second in the AL to Miguel Cabrera's 
.346 batting average. On August 27, he set a Ranger record with his 24th 
three-hit game of the season.[45] On September 4, Hamilton bruised his 
rib cage after making a leaping catch into the outfield wall. He was sidelined 
for almost a month and returned to play with only three games left in the 
regular season. He hit a home run the next day. His talent and popularity 
have earned him a litany of nicknames including "The Hammer"; "Hambino", 
referencing to the great Babe Ruth; "The Natural";[46] and "Hambone" his 
high school nickname tattooed on his arm. Hamilton hit for a league-leading 
.359 average in 2010, winning his first batting title. This was the fourth-best 
batting average since the end of the 2004 season. He also finished fourth 
in Major League Baseball in On-Base Percentage (.411), first in Slugging 
Percentage (.633) and On-Base Plus Slugging (1.044), and tied for tenth 
in home runs (32), despite missing 29 games due to an injury. He was also 
one of just 25 players to have 100 RBIs.[47] His performance in 2010 made 
him a front-runner for the AL MVP Award. Hamilton won the AL Players Choice 
Award for Outstanding Player in 2010.[48] On October 22, Hamilton and the 
Rangers won the 2010 ALCS. It was the first time in Rangers history they 
had gone to a World Series. To get there they had to beat the defending 
Champions the New York Yankees.[49] With four home runs, seven RBIs, and 
the recipient of several intentional walks in the AL Championship Series 
win against the Yankees, he won the ALCS MVP Award.[50] On November 23, 
2010 Hamilton was voted the AL MVP.[51] Hamilton avoided arbitration by 
signing for 2 years and $24 million on February 10, 2011, with the Texas 
Rangers. On April 12, in Detroit, he suffered a fracture to his right humerus 
on a play at home plate. On May 18, he began a rehab assignment at the 
Double-A Frisco RoughRiders. He returned to the Rangers' lineup on May 
23, and went 2–4 against Chicago White Sox pitcher John Danks, hitting 
his first home run of the season on the second pitch he saw during his 
first at bat.[52] He was an All Star in 2011.[53] On July 8, during a home 
game at Rangers Ballpark, a 39-year-old firefighter died while catching 
a foul ball tossed into the stands by Hamilton. The fan, Shannon Stone, 
leaned over the rail to catch the ball and fell 20 feet behind the scoreboard. 
He was transported to a hospital, but died on the way. After learning the 
news after the game, Hamilton was said to be distraught. It was the third 
incident in which a fan fell out of the stands at Rangers Ballpark.[54] 
On September 30, the son of the fallen firefighter and his mother returned 
to Rangers Ballpark for the first time after the incident. The son, eight-year-old 
Cooper Stone, threw out the ceremonial first pitch to Hamilton to start 
the American League Division Series. Hamilton proceeded to exchange multiple 
hugs with the family. In 2011, Hamilton batted .298 with 25 home runs.[53] 
He was 3rd in the American League in sacrifice flies (10), 6th in intentional 
walks (13), and 8th in slugging percentage.(.536).[53] Hamilton hit .395 
with 9 home runs and 25 RBI during the month of April and was named the 
league's AL Player of the Month.[55] His home run total for the month tied 
a franchise record for April with four other Rangers. Hamilton was considered 
to be in a break out season, batting for the Triple Crown and MVP.[56] 
On May 8, in a 10–3 win over the Baltimore Orioles at Camden Yards, Hamilton 
registered multiple career highs; he had five hits in five at-bats, hitting 
four two-run home runs and a double for a total of eight runs batted in. 
Incidentally, the only runner on base each time was Elvis Andrus. In doing 
this, he not only became just the 16th player in MLB history to hit four 
home runs in one game and the first to do so since Carlos Delgado in 2003, 
but also now holds the American League Record for most total bases in a 
single game with eighteen. He was one base shy of tying the Major League 
Record.[7][57] Hamilton was selected to appear in his fifth-career All-Star 
Game after accumulating the most number of fan votes by any player in the 
history of the All-Star Game selection process. José Bautista held the 
previous record with 7,454,753 votes in 2011 until Hamilton received 11,073,744 
in 2012.[5] The record stood until 2015, when Josh Donaldson received 14,090,188 
votes.[58] Manager Ron Washington moved Hamilton to fifth in the batting 
order and designated hitter before a game with the White Sox on July 29. 
Since June 1 Hamilton had been hitting .190 with a slugging percentage 
of .374. Washington said he moved Hamilton in hopes of taking some of the 
pressure off him and also gave Hamilton the day off on July 28.[59] Hamilton 
responded quickly—in a game on July 29 he recorded multiple walks for the 
first time in the month of July and did not record a strikeout for the 
first time in seven games. On July 30 he went 3-for-4 with a home run, 
his first game recording greater than 2 hits since May 11. On October 3, 
during the American League West Division Championship Game between the 
Rangers and the Athletics, Hamilton's career went downhill during a crucial 
play. Tied at 5–5 in the 4th inning with two outs and a man on first and 
second base, Yoenis Céspedes hit an easy pop up towards Hamilton that would 
have ended the inning, however, Hamilton misplayed the out as the ball 
landed behind him causing the two runners to score and give Oakland a 7–5 
lead as the A's went on to win that game 12–5 and take the American League 
West Division Title. On October 5, during the American League Wild Card 
Game between the Orioles and the Rangers, Hamilton was booed in what would 
be his final at bat for Texas when he struck out during a rally that would 
eventually fail for Texas as Baltimore defeated the Rangers 5–1 in that 
game. On December 13, 2012, Hamilton agreed in principle to a 5-year contract, 
worth $125 million with the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim.[60] This deal 
became official on December 15.[61] During his first year with the Angels, 
Hamilton played 151 games batting .250 with 32 doubles, 21 home runs, and 
79 RBI. 2014 was a challenging year for Hamilton, going .263 for only 10 
HR and 44 RBIs. Worse, during the ALDS against Kansas City, Hamilton batted 
.000 (going 0–13). At least twice during Game 1 of the ALDS there was a 
runner on 2nd and Hamilton either struck out or grounded out. LA Angels 
fans were frustrated with him, booing him several times during the game. 
In response, Hamilton stated to the Orange County Register that it was 
comical that fans were booing him and that he "didn't ... play for the 
[fans]" in the stands, but for the other players.[62] During February 2015, 
Hamilton underwent shoulder surgery to repair the AC joint. While he was 
recovering, it was revealed that he had a relapse into his drug addiction, 
which he voluntarily reported to MLB. An outside arbitrator ruled that 
his voluntary admission did not violate baseball's drug policy and he could 
not be suspended.[63] Despite the ruling, team owner Arte Moreno ordered 
all Hamilton's merchandise to be removed from the team stores and made 
comments to the media implying that he did not want Hamilton back on the 
team. The players union and several Angels players spoke up in Hamilton's 
defense.[64] The Angels began to layout a rehab plan for him,[65] but shortly 
afterwards reports surfaced that the Angels were looking to trade Hamilton.[66] 
Hamilton was officially traded back to the Rangers on April 27, 2015, for 
cash or a player to be named later.[67] After a short rehab stint to rehabilitate 
his injured shoulder between the Rangers AA and AAA Minor League affiliates, 
Hamilton was called up to the MLB team on May 24, 2015 and was inserted 
to the starting lineup on May 25, 2015 in a Memorial Day match up in Cleveland 
against the Cleveland Indians. He recorded his first hit back with the 
Rangers on May 27. Hamilton had a huge series against the Boston Red Sox 
from May 28–31, 2015. On May 28 of the same year Hamilton returned to Texas 
for the first time in a Rangers uniform since leaving the team after the 
2012 season. He received a standing ovation from the crowd and proceeded 
to hit a double on the first pitch he saw. Hamilton went 2-4 in the game, 
driving in the only run for his own team in a 5-1 loss at the time. On 
May 29, Hamilton hit two home runs in his first multi-homer game with the 
Rangers since 2012, leading the team to a 7-4 victory. Two days later, 
he hit a pinch-hit two RBI double vs. the Red Sox to win the game in walk-off-the-game 
fashion, 4-3. On July 30, 2015, Hamilton recorded 4 RBI, a home run and 
walk off base hit in a 7-6 Rangers' win over the New York Yankees.[68] 
In the ALDS, Hamilton's first hit was a single in Game 3. This ended his 
postseason hitless streak at 31 at-bats, which tied for second all time.[69] 
Hamilton began the 2016 season on the 15-day disabled list. On May 25, 
2016, it was announced that Hamilton would not participate for the entire 
2016 season after undergoing knee surgery for the third time in nine months.[70] 
The Rangers activated Hamilton from the disabled list and released him 
on August 23, as releasing Hamilton before September 1 would allow them 
to play Hamilton in the major leagues before May 15, 2017, if they chose 
to resign him.[71] Hamilton is of Scottish descent and is married to Katie 
(née Chadwick), the daughter of one of the men (Michael Chadwick) who guided 
him in his recovery from drugs and alcohol abuse for several years. They 
started dating in 2002 when he returned to Raleigh, and married in 2004.[72][73] 
In early 2015, shortly after another substance-abuse relapse, Josh Hamilton 
filed for divorce from Katie after 11 years of marriage. Under the terms 
of their divorce, Katie is not allowed to hide their children from him, 
make disparaging remarks about him, or allow another man stay overnight 
in the same home as the children.[74] Hamilton's struggles with drugs and 
alcohol are well documented. He finally got clean after being confronted 
by his grandmother, Mary Holt.[when?][75] In May 2008 Hamilton said he 
had not used drugs or alcohol since October 6, 2005.[1] When giving a brief 
summary of his recovery, Hamilton says simply: "It's a God thing."[22] 
He does not shy away from telling his story, speaking to community groups 
and fans at many functions.[76] He frequently tells stories publicly of 
how he believes that Jesus brought him back from the brink and that faith 
is what keeps him going. Hamilton also wrote an autobiography called Beyond 
Belief which explains how he quit drugs and alcohol and found a relationship 
with God.[73] His wife Katie sometimes accompanies him, offering her perspective 
on his struggles as well.[28] To comply with the provisions of MLB's drug 
policy, Hamilton provides urine samples for drug testing at least three 
times per week.[77] Rangers' coach Johnny Narron says of the frequent testing: 
"I think he looks forward to the tests. He knows he's an addict. He knows 
he has to be accountable. He looks at those tests as a way to reassure 
people around him who had faith."[73] In late 2008 Hamilton, among other 
celebrities such as Brian Welch and Greg Ellis, appeared in testimonial 
videos called "I Am Second", in which he shares his story of recovering 
from drug use with the help of his Christian faith.[78][79] A portion of 
his return to sobriety was shown on The Learning Channel's reality show 
"The Real Deal". "A Home Run for Trademark" aired March 31, 2007, and chronicled 
the renovation of Shoeless Joe Jackson's house during 2006. Richard C. 
Davis, the owner of Trademark Properties, hired Hamilton as the construction 
foreman. Davis was negotiating the purchase of a minor league baseball 
team and entertaining the idea of giving Hamilton a chance to join the 
team.[80] Hamilton's teammates – mindful of his past struggles – have chosen 
to celebrate major events (such as the Rangers wins over the Tampa Bay 
Rays in Game 5 of the 2010 American League Division Series, and again when 
they beat the New York Yankees in Game 6 of the 2010 American League Championship 
Series) with ginger ale instead of champagne.[81] The Rangers repeated 
the celebrations with ginger ale the following postseason when they won 
their second consecutive pennant and reached the 2011 World Series. Hamilton 
confirmed he suffered a relapse in early 2009 after photos were released 
in August 2009. Sports website Deadspin posted photos of Hamilton shirtless 
in a bar in Tempe, Arizona with several women. According to reports, witnesses 
saw Hamilton drinking, heard him asking where he could obtain cocaine, 
and heard him reveal his plans to go to a strip club later that evening. 
The photos do not show Hamilton drinking or taking any illegal drugs.[82] 
Prior to Hamilton's public admission Johnny Narron, a Rangers special assignment 
coach and Hamilton's mentor, said he doubted the validity of the photos, 
telling Deadspin, "I'm sure, in the depths of his drug addiction, he was 
in a lot of bars. He was in and out of bars, "crackhouses", everything. 
There are probably photographs of him in all kinds of places."[83] When 
responding, Narron had not seen the photos and was told they were taken 
during March 2009, not two months prior when the incident took place.[84] 
Although this news did not break until August 2009, Hamilton revealed that 
he had informed his wife, the Texas Rangers, and Major League Baseball 
the day after the incident occurred. Hamilton called a press conference 
on August 8 to discuss the photos.[85] Regarding the incident Hamilton 
said: Obviously it was one of those things that reinforce that I can't 
have alcohol. I got away from the one thing that kept me on the straight 
and narrow and that was my relationship with the Lord. That should always 
come first. Hopefully some good will come out of this. It just crossed 
my mind that night, 'Can I have a drink?' Obviously I can't and this reinforces 
that. Since that night, I have not had another thought like that. I know 
it's something I shouldn't do because it leads to other things. Hamilton 
also admitted he had very little memory of the night after getting drunk, 
and did not know about the contents of the photos. Hamilton did not see 
the photos after their release, but listened on the phone as his wife described 
them to him. After the press conference Rangers general manager Jon Daniels 
said "My first reaction in January was one of concern. Since then I've 
talked to a lot of people and they say it was significant that he came 
forward immediately and was honest about it." Major League Baseball tested 
Hamilton for illegal drugs two days after the incident and he passed that 
test.[86] On February 2, 2012, it was reported that Hamilton had suffered 
a second relapse with alcohol. He claims to have had two or three drinks 
before inviting his friend and then teammate, Ian Kinsler, to talk at the
