James Edward "Jimmy" Key (born April 22, 1961) is a former left-handed 
starting pitcher in Major League Baseball who played for the Toronto Blue 
Jays (1984–1992), New York Yankees (1993–1996), and Baltimore Orioles (1997–1998). 
His best personal years were in 1987, when he posted a 17–8 record with 
a league-leading 2.76 ERA, and in 1993, when he went 18–6 with a 3.00 ERA 
and 173 strikeouts. With the Blue Jays, he won the 1992 World Series and 
with the Yankees, he won the 1996 World Series, both over the Atlanta Braves. 
Key was an outstanding baseball player at S. R. Butler High School in Huntsville, 
Alabama.[1] He compiled a 10–0 record, and had nine shutouts and a 0.30 
ERA in his senior year. Key was also an excellent hitter, batting .410 
with 11 home runs and 35 RBIs in his high school career. Key attended Clemson 
University, where he played college baseball for the Clemson Tigers baseball 
team in the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC). At Clemson, Key posted a 9–3 
record and 2.79 ERA on the mound, and batted .300 with 21 doubles. Key 
is the only Clemson player to be a member of the first-team All-ACC in 
two positions (pitcher and DH) in 1982. He pitched the opening game of 
the 1980 College World Series.[2] Key was drafted by the Toronto Blue Jays 
in the third round of the 1982 amateur draft.[3] He worked his way up the 
Blue Jays' minor league system during 1982 and 1983, putting up respectable 
numbers with the Florence Blue Jays (South Atlantic League), the Medicine 
Hat Blue Jays (Pioneer League), the Knoxville Blue Jays (Southern League), 
and the Syracuse Chiefs (International League) before heading to Toronto. 
Key made his Major League debut on April 6, 1984 and was utilized in relief 
situations through his inaugural year, notching 10 saves and a 4.65 ERA.[4] 
He wore number 27 in his first season and 22 for the duration of his Blue 
Jays career. Key moved into the starting rotation in 1985 and quickly became 
a cornerstone in the rotation, leading the Blue Jays to their first postseason 
appearance that year. More postseason appearances would follow, culminating 
in a World Series championship in 1992. In the 4th game of that series, 
Key made his final start for the Blue Jays,[1] surrendering one run over 
7 2⁄3 innings to earn the win and put the Jays up 3–1. He left the game 
to a tremendous ovation. Key would appear once more in the series, as a 
reliever in the 10th and 11th innings of the 6th and deciding game, earning 
another winning decision in the series.[5] Key signed a four-year contract 
as a free agent with the New York Yankees on December 10, 1992.[6] He posted 
a 49–23 record in 94 games over three seasons with the Yankees. He had 
his career high of 173 strikeouts in the first year with the Yankees in 
1993, and he led the majors with 17 wins in the strike-shortened season 
of 1994.[3] He spent time with the Gulf Coast Yankees (1–0 and 0.00 ERA) 
and Tampa (0–0 and 2.77 ERA) of the Florida State League during rehab assignments 
during his last season with New York in 1996. In his final start as a Yankee, 
he outdueled Greg Maddux of the Atlanta Braves in the deciding game of 
the World Series.[3] Key signed as a free agent with the Baltimore Orioles 
on December 10, 1996[3] and posted a 22–13 record in 59 appearances over 
two seasons. A free agent in his final season, Key retired from the game 
after the 1998 season largely due to injuries. He made US$7.73 million 
with the Orioles over 2 seasons. He wore the number 21 with the Orioles 
(22 having been retired by Baltimore in honor of Hall of Famer Jim Palmer.)[3] 
He was assigned to Fredrick of the Carolina League in 1998 (1–0 3.00 ERA) 
during his final rehab stint. Key was granted free agency for the last 
time on October 27, 1998 by Orioles GM Pat Gillick, the same GM who granted 
him the same conditions in Toronto in 1992. Key was one of the premiere 
control pitchers in the game with a good strikeout-to-walk ratio over most 
of his career. His fastball was not particularly speedy, but was often 
effective as he could spot it on both corners of the plate—although when 
his pitch went high, opponents fared well. He also possessed a fine backdoor 
slider. He had a very good pickoff move to first base, which he notably 
demonstrated in Game 4 of the 1992 World Series by picking off Otis Nixon, 
one of the game's premiere base stealers at the time. (During his windup 
his right knee was bent so that his right foot did not cross the rubber 
and he could throw to first base without incurring a balk). Key tended 
to give up more than his share of home runs even while holding his opponents' 
on-base percentage to a low level. He was injury-prone with significant 
down time in 1988, 1989, 1990, 1995, 1996 and 1998. Contrary to some reports, 
Key never underwent Tommy John surgery. Instead, noted surgeon James Andrews 
removed bone chips, costing Key several months in the middle of the 1988 
season.[7] Following his retirement from baseball, Key found new life as 
an amateur golfer. Now living in Palm Beach Gardens, he has become prominent
