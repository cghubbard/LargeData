Starling Javier Marte (born October 9, 1988) is a Dominican Republic professional 
baseball left fielder for the Pittsburgh Pirates of Major League Baseball

the Altoona Curve, Marte was an Eastern League Mid-Season All-Star [5] 
and Post-Season All-Star, a Baseball America Double-A All-Star,[6] a Topps 
Double-A All-Star,[7] and a Milb.com organization All-Star.[8] On August

On July 2, 2012, Marte was named the International League player of the

Indians to the Pittsburgh Pirates,[17] becoming the first graduate of the 
Pirates' Latin American complex, located in the Dominican Republic, to 
reach the major leagues.[1] He hit a home run on the first pitch he faced 
in his major league career, off Houston Astros pitcher Dallas Keuchel.[18] 
The hit made Marte the third player in Pirates' franchise history to homer 
in his first at-bat and the first to do it since Don Leppert in 1961. He 
also became the first Pirate to homer on the first pitch of his major league 
career since Walter Mueller did so in 1922.[19] Marte and the Pirates finalized 
a 6-year, $31 million deal on March 28, 2014.[20][21] On August 18, 2014, 
Marte had his second career multi-homer game in a 7â€“3 loss to the Atlanta 
Braves. He won his first career Rawlings Gold Glove Award in 2015.[22] 
In November 2011, Larry Broadway, the Pirates' director of Minor League 
operations, said of Marte, "An exciting player to watch, Starling has very 
good athleticism and speed to go along with the ability to hit. The scary 
thing is that he is starting to mature physically and is starting to develop 
power as well. His speed-power-hit combo is going to make him a very fun
