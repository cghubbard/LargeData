Elections to the Baseball Hall of Fame for 1972 followed the system established 
one year earlier. The Baseball Writers Association of America (BBWAA) voted 
by mail to select from recent major league players and elected three: Yogi 
Berra, Sandy Koufax, and Early Wynn. The Veterans Committee met in closed 
sessions to consider executives, managers, umpires, and earlier major league 
players. It also selected three people: Lefty Gomez, Will Harridge, and 
Ross Youngs. The Negro Leagues Committee met for the second time and selected 
Josh Gibson and Buck Leonard. The BBWAA was authorized to elect players 
active in 1952 or later, but not after 1966; the ballot included candidates 
from the 1971 ballot who received at least 5% of the vote but were not 
elected, along with selected players, chosen by a screening committee, 
whose last appearance was in 1966. All 10-year members of the BBWAA were 
eligible to vote. Voters were instructed to cast votes for up to 10 candidates; 
any candidate receiving votes on at least 75% of the ballots would be honored 
with induction to the Hall. The ballot consisted of 46 players; a total 
of 396 ballots were cast, with 297 votes required for election. A total 
of 3,083 individual votes were cast, an average of 7.79 per ballot. Candidates 
who were eligible for the first time are indicated here with a â€ . The three 
candidates who received at least 75% of the vote and were elected are indicated 
in bold italics; candidates who have since been elected in subsequent elections
