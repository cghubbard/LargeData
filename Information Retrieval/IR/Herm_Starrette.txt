Herman Paul Starrette (born November 20, 1938, at Statesville, North Carolina) 
is a retired relief pitcher, pitching and bullpen coach, and farm system 
official in Major League Baseball. Starrette attended Lenoir Rhyne College 
in Hickory, North Carolina. During his playing days, he threw and batted 
right-handed, stood 6'1" (185 cm) tall, and weighed 185 pounds (84 kg). 
Starrette played his nine-year (1958–66) pitching career in the Baltimore 
Orioles organization, and spent parts of three seasons (1963–65) at the 
Major League level. Appearing in 27 MLB games, he pitched in 46 innings 
and split two decisions with an earned run average of 2.54. He allowed 
43 hits and 16 bases on balls, struck out 21 and earned one save. His coaching 
career began with the Orioles' Triple-A farm club, the Rochester Red Wings, 
in 1967, and the following season he succeeded George Bamberger as Baltimore's 
roving minor league pitching instructor. The Orioles' system of the time 
was celebrated for developing young pitching, and after six seasons in 
that job, Starrette became a Major League pitching coach for the 1974 Atlanta 
Braves. He would spend the next 28 years as a pitching coach, bullpen coach, 
minor league instructor, coordinator of instruction, and farm system director 
with the Braves, Orioles, San Francisco Giants, Philadelphia Phillies, 
Milwaukee Brewers, Chicago Cubs, Montreal Expos and Boston Red Sox. He 
was the pitching coach of the 1980 world champion Phillies. Starrette was 
a trusted associate of Dan Duquette, working with him in Milwaukee, Montreal 
and Boston as a farm system official and minor and Major League coach.
