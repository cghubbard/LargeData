Jhonny Antonio Peralta (born May 28, 1982) is a Dominican professional 
baseball shortstop and third baseman for the St. Louis Cardinals of Major 
League Baseball (MLB). The Cleveland Indians signed him as an amateur free 
agent from his native country in 1999. He made his Major League debut for 
the Indians four years later and has also played for the Detroit Tigers. 
Known as a strong offensive and capable defensive shortstop, Peralta is 
a three-time MLB All-Star selection. He was the 2004 Indians Minor League 
Player of the Year as well as the International League Most Valuable Player 
for one of Cleveland's minor leagues affiliates, the Buffalo Bisons, after 
batting .326 with 44 doubles, 15 home runs and 86 runs batted in. Buffalo 
were also the International League champions that same season. Since 2005, 
Peralta has reached double figures in home runs and 27 doubles each year. 
He has set single-season home run records for shortstops for two franchises 
– for the Indians in 2005, and the Cardinals in 2014. While a member of 
the Tigers in 2013, he served a 50-game suspension for his role in the 
Biogenesis performance-enhancing drug scandal. He is signed with the Cardinals 
through the 2017 season. The Cleveland Indians signed Jhonny Peralta as 
an amateur free agent in 1999 and assigned him to the Dominican Summer 
League Indians that season. Peralta batted .303 with a .398 on-base percentage 
(OBP) and a .514 slugging percentage (SLG); 41% of his hits went for extra 
bases. Those figures were boosted by an unsustainable .373 batting average 
on balls in play (BABIP).[a] Nevertheless, the Indians promoted him aggressively.[1] 
In 2000, the 18-year-old Peralta played for the Columbus RedStixx, the 
Class A affiliate of the Indians in the South Atlantic League. He batted 
.241 in 106 games, playing all but one game at shortstop (the other was 
at third base). The following season he advanced to the Kinston Indians, 
the Cleveland Indians High-A affiliate in the Carolina League. In 125 games, 
he batted .240. In 2002, Peralta moved up to the Double-A Akron Aeros, 
where he hit .281. In 2003, he batted .257 in 63 games with the Buffalo 
Bisons. After his 2003 call up to the major leagues, Peralta began to draw 
widespread attention for his hitting with the Aeros and Bisons. In 2004, 
he batted .326 with 15 home runs (HR) and 86 runs batted in (RBI). He also 
scored 109 runs and stroked 44 doubles, the most ever in the Bisons' modern 
era, followed by 39 for Kevin Pillar in 2014.[2] This offensive leap helped 
him win the International League Most Valuable Player Award that year[3] 
and helped Buffalo win the Governors' Cup as the International League champions. 
He also received the Lou Boudreau Award as the Indians' 2004 Minor League 
Player of the Year.[4] Peralta made his Major League debut with Cleveland 
on June 12, 2003, filling in for the injured Gold Glove shortstop Omar 
Vizquel. He finished with a .227 batting average with four HR and 21 RBIs. 
The next season, despite his accomplishments at the Triple-A level, Peralta 
saw just 25 at bats (AB) in eight games at the major league level due to 
the presence of perennial fan-favorite Vizquel, who left the Indians as 
a free agent following the 2004 season. Peralta became Cleveland's full-time 
starting shortstop early in 2005 and batted .292. On July 3, he became 
affixed in the Indians' third slot in the batting order. Cleveland then 
won 23 of their next 33 games to put them one game behind the New York 
Yankees and Oakland Athletics in the Wild Card race late in August. He 
joined Woodie Held as the only shortstops in Indians' history to hit at 
least 20 HR.[5] His 24 HR and 78 RBI set records for an Indians shortstop. 
On March 10, 2006, Peralta agreed to a five-year contract with an option 
for a sixth year to stay with the Indians until the 2011 season. However, 
his 2006 season saw a decline both offensively and defensively from the 
previous season. At the start of spring training in 2007, it was revealed 
that Peralta suffered from vision problems in 2006 and had corrective LASIK 
eye surgery to deal with it.[6] After breaking an 0 for 8 skid on May 1, 
2009, against the Detroit Tigers, Peralta's 86th career home run with the 
Indians broke the team record for shortstops Woodie Held had held. His 
HR was solo, providing the margin of victory for Cleveland in a 6–5 score.[7] 
Peralta hit his first inside-the-park home run on July 18, 2010, against 
Tigers pitcher Andy Oliver on a play in which outfielder Ryan Raburn crashed 
through the bullpen door attempting to catch the ball.[8] Ten days after 
hitting his first inside-the-park-home-run against the Tigers, the Indians 
traded Peralta to the Tigers for minor league pitcher Giovanni Soto and 
cash considerations.[9] Because the club had already retired the number 
2 – Peralta's uniform number as an Indian – in honor of Hall of Famer Charlie 
Gehringer, he chose the number 27 instead.[10] On July 30, Peralta hit 
a home run in his first plate appearance (PA) as a Tiger, and then, another, 
two plate appearances later.[11] After joining the Tigers, he returned 
to primarily playing shortstop. He made 46 appearances shortstop, nine 
at third base, four at designated hitter and two at first base for the 
remainder of the 2010 season. Peralta was named to his first career All-Star 
Game as a replacement for Derek Jeter on July 8, 2011.[12] He finished 
the regular season with a career-high .299 batting average and collected 
21 home runs and 86 RBI. Playing a full season at shortstop for the first 
time since 2008, he committed just seven errors in 608 chances for a career-best 
.988 fielding percentage. Peralta hit his first walk-off home run as a 
Tiger against the Chicago White Sox on May 4, 2012.[13] On June 20, 2013, 
Peralta hit a walkoff two-run home run off Boston Red Sox closer Andrew 
Bailey to secure the Tigers' victory, 4–3. It was the Tigers' first walkoff 
win of the season.[14] That season, Peralta was named to his second AL 
All-Star team as a reserve shortstop. This was his first selection by player 
vote (his previous selection was as an injury replacement). Peralta entered 
the All-Star break with a .303 batting average, eight home runs and 46 
RBIs. However, a cloud overshadowed what was shaping to be one of Peralta's 
best seasons. On August 5, he accepted a 50-game suspension for his role 
in the Biogenesis performance-enhancing drug scandal.[15] On September 
25, the Tigers announced that Peralta would be activated to the 40-man 
roster following his suspension. He returned two days later for the final 
series of the regular season.[16] In his shortened regular season, Peralta 
batted .303 with 11 home runs and 55 RBI in 107 games. Because Detroit 
had acquired rookie shortstop José Iglesias from the Boston Red Sox during 
the suspension, manager Jim Leyland installed Peralta mainly in left field 
for the remainder of the season and playoffs.[17][18] The Tigers, including 
general manager Dave Dombrowski, expressed exoneration of Peralta's breach 
following the suspension.[19] Despite derisive chants from fans and actions 
such as the San Francisco Giants leaving similar violator Melky Cabrera 
off their playoff roster during their World Series-winning season, the 
Tigers saw the 50-game suspension as sufficient punishment.[20] With the 
Tigers down 3–0 and facing elimination against the Athletics in Game 4 
of the American League Division Series (ALDS), Peralta connected for a 
three-run home run in the fifth inning. It was "perhaps the biggest swing 
of the playoffs for the Tigers so far", surmised sportswriter Noah Trister.[21] 
The Tigers eventually won the ALDS but lost to the Red Sox in the American 
League Championship Series. In ten playoff games, Peralta batted .333 with 
four doubles, one home run and six runs batted in.[22] On November 24, 
2013, Peralta signed a four-year contract worth $53 million with the St. 
Louis Cardinals. Featuring a declining salary structure, the contract commenced 
with his salary at $15.5 million in 2014, then $15 million, $12.5 million, 
and finally $10 million in 2017.[23] Without a qualifying offer from the 
Tigers, the Cardinals were not obligated to return a first-round draft 
pick.[24][25] However, the signing drew scrutiny because he had served 
the suspension for his connection to the Biogenesis scandal. Arizona Diamondbacks 
pitcher Brad Ziegler spearheaded a cacophony of complaints that the 50-game 
suspension was not enough of a deterrent, because he viewed that it failed 
to prevent players who violated the collective bargaining agreement's banned 
substances use policy to receive compensation for their performances equal 
to those who had not been found to violate the policy. Cabrera had signed 
with the Toronto Blue Jays for two years and $16 million following his 
suspension in 2012; however, little protest had arisen from those relatively 
modest figures.[26] Cardinals general manager John Mozeliak countered by 
illustrating that the Cardinals were not self-appointed "morality police. 
... Character and makeup are something we weigh into our decision-making. 
In his case, he admitted what he did, he took responsibility for it. I 
feel like he has paid for his mistakes, and obviously if he were to make 
another one, then it would be a huge disappointment."[27] New teammate 
and Cardinals outfielder Matt Holliday, an outspoken critic of performance-enhancing 
drugs (PED), declared indemnity. "I am against PEDs and always will be," 
he said at the Cardinals’ winter fan festival. "But I also am a forgiving 
person and he served his suspension. That's the rules of the game. I’m 
happy to have him as a teammate. ... His teammates in Detroit welcomed 
him back."[28] Manager Mike Matheny echoed a similar averment.[29] On April 
27, 2014, Peralta hit his first multi-homer game in Busch Stadium against 
the Pittsburgh Pirates. It also gave him six home runs for the month, surpassing 
Edgar Rentería's club record of five in April he set for shortstops in 
2000.[30] Peralta surpassed another team record for shortstops Rentería 
set in 2000, hitting his 17th home run of the season on August 20.[31] 
While he produced his usual amount of home runs, his batting average was 
inconsistent early in the season. In each month from April to August, it 
progressed from .196 to .237 to .241 to .252 to .270.[32] With the second-place 
Pirates just a game behind in the standings with two left to play for the 
season, Peralta drove in the go-ahead run in the 10th inning against the 
Diamondbacks as part of a three-RBI night.[33] He ended the season leading 
the Cardinals in home runs with 21.[34] Peralta also led the club in doubles 
(38) and was second in slugging percentage (.443), RBI (75), total bases 
(248) and games played (157). His batting average was .263 and OBP .336.[35] 
In his first season in the National League (NL), Peralta ranked seventh 
in the league in doubles and sixth in games played. According to Baseball-Reference.com's 
advanced metrics, he had his best season defensively, finishing fifth in 
the NL among all players – third among shortstops – with 2.6 defensive 
Wins Above Replacement (dWAR). His combined offensive and defensive WAR 
placed tenth among all NL players at 5.8. In counting and rate defensive 
statistics among NL shortstops, he finished second in double plays turned 
(98), and fifth in fielding percentage (.981), putouts (191), assists (418), 
and range factor per nine innings (4.17).[36] On October 23, The Sporting 
News announced Peralta was selected to their NL All-Star team.[37][38] 
He finished 15th in the NL MVP voting, the first time in his career he 
received consideration for the award.[39] On May 25, 2015, Peralta hit 
a walk-off home run in the tenth inning against the Diamondbacks, his seventh 
home run of the season.[40] In his time with the Cardinals through June 
1, he ranked first in extra-base hits (80) and home runs (29), third in 
RBI (101), second in slugging percentage (.461) and OPS (.804) and fourth 
in on-base percentage (.361) among MLB shortstops. On defense, he did not 
rely heavily on range, but on smart positioning and making the routine 
plays, qualifying him for +1 defensive runs saved after saving 17 the year 
before.[41] He was selected as the National League's starting shortstop 
in the All-Star Game at Great American Ball Park in Cincinnati[42] after 
batting .298 with 13 home runs and 46 RBI over the first 87 games in 2015. 
After the All-Star break, he batted .243, and produced three doubles and 
two home runs over the final two months, or 54 games.[43] Peralta finished 
the season with a .275 batting average, 17 home runs, 71 RBI, 26 doubles 
and 159 hits in 155 games played.[36] Thumb injuries caused Peralta to 
miss significant time in 2016.[44] While fielding a ball during spring 
training on March 7, he damaged an ulnar collateral ligament in his left 
thumb.[45] He underwent surgery to repair the ligament and was expected 
to miss 10 to 12 weeks of play.[46] He began a rehabilitation assignment 
with the Single-A Peoria Chiefs on May 20, 2016,[47] and the club activated 
him for game action before a series against Cincinnati on June 7.[48] The 
Cardinals placed him back on the on DL on July 19 due to swelling in the 
left thumb, although that injury appeared unrelated to the torn ligament 
and an MRI had revealed no structural damage, per Mozeliak.[44] The metrics 
for Peralta's overall career defense show him as an average shortstop. 
However, his numbers have improved to the point where he was once a below-average 
shortstop to being a well above-average defender.[49] Peralta is married 
to Molly Peralta. The couple have three daughters; including, twins named 
Gabriela Rose and Laina Katherine.[50] While the spelling of his first 
name is unusual in the United States, Peralta stated many people use that 
spelling in the Dominican Republic.[51] He also told the Santo Domingo 
Times that his spelling is right and every "Johnny" or "Johnnie" in the
