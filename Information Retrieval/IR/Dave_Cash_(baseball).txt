David Cash, Jr. (born June 11, 1948 in Utica, New York) is a retired Major 
League Baseball second baseman who played in the National League for the 
Pittsburgh Pirates (1969–73), Philadelphia Phillies (1974–76), Montreal 
Expos (1977–79), and San Diego Padres (1980). Cash's MLB career started 
modestly, as he played in only 82 games over his first two seasons, though 
he still hit a very respectable .314 in 271 at-bats. Cash established himself 
as a solid singles hitter and a good defensive second baseman in his time 
in Pittsburgh. He was the Pirates' primary second baseman from 1971 to 
1973, but his playing time was reduced somewhat by military service commitments 
and by the presence on the team of veteran second baseman Bill Mazeroski 
and rising star Rennie Stennett. After the 1973 season, with Stennett ready 
to play regularly and another excellent young second baseman (Willie Randolph) 
in their minor league system, the Pirates traded Cash to the Phillies for 
pitcher Ken Brett. With the Phillies from 1974 to 1976, Cash became a true 
everyday player, missing only two games over three seasons. He made the 
All-Star team each year,[1] and batted .300 or better with over 200 hits 
in both 1974 and 1975. After the 1976 season, Cash signed as a free agent 
with the Expos. He had a good season in 1977 but a disappointing year in 
1978, and by 1979 had lost his job as the Expos' starting second baseman. 
He finished his career as a part-time player with the Padres in 1980. In 
2006, Cash was hired to be first base coach for the Baltimore Orioles. 
In 2007 he was hired to be the Manager of the Utica Brewmasters in the 
New York State League established in 2007 in his hometown of Utica, New 
York. During the team's first game ever, Cash was ejected by the homeplate 
umpire for arguing balls and strikes. In 2008, Cash was hired as the hitting 
coach for the Sussex Skyhawks in the CAN-AM League. The Skyhawks played 
in Augusta, New Jersey and won the 2008 CAN-AM League Championship 3 games 
to 0 over the Quebec Capitales. In 2010, Cash served as the hitting coach
