-73.95972 Manhattan (/mænˈhætən/, /mənˈhætən/) is the most densely populated 
borough of New York City, its economic and administrative center, and the 
city's historical birthplace.[2] The borough is coextensive with New York 
County, founded on November 1, 1683, as one of the original counties of 
the U.S. state of New York. The borough consists mostly of Manhattan Island, 
bounded by the East, Hudson, and Harlem Rivers, and also includes several 
small adjacent islands and Marble Hill, a small neighborhood on the U.S. 
mainland. Manhattan is often described as the cultural and financial capital 
of the world[3][4][5] and hosts the United Nations Headquarters.[6] Anchored 
by Wall Street in the Financial District of Lower Manhattan, New York City 
has been called both the most economically powerful city and the leading 
financial center of the world,[7][8][9][10][11] and Manhattan is home to 
the world's two largest stock exchanges by total market capitalization: 
the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ.[12][13] Many multinational media 
conglomerates are based in the borough. It is historically documented to 
have been purchased by Dutch colonists from Native Americans in 1626, for 
60 guilders or about $24 in 1626[14] and US$1051 today.[15] Manhattan real 
estate has since become among the most expensive in the world, with the 
value of Manhattan Island, including real estate, estimated to exceed US$3 
trillion in 2013;[2][16] residential property sale prices in Manhattan 
typically exceeded US$1,400 per square foot ($15,000/m2) as of 2016.[17] 
New York County is the United States' second-smallest county by land area 
(larger only than Kalawao County, Hawaii), and is also the most densely 
populated U.S. county.[18] It is also one of the most densely populated 
areas in the world, with a census-estimated 2015 population of 1,644,518[1] 
living in a land area of 22.83 square miles (59.13 km2),[19] or 72,033 
residents per square mile (27,812/km2), higher than the density of any 
individual American city.[20] On business days, the influx of commuters 
increases that number to over 3.9 million,[21] or more than 170,000 people 
per square mile (65,600/km2). Manhattan has the third-largest population 
of New York City's five boroughs, after Brooklyn and Queens, and is the 
smallest borough in terms of land area.[22] Many districts and landmarks 
in Manhattan have become well known, as New York City received a record 
of nearly 60 million tourists in 2015,[23] and Manhattan hosts three of 
the world's 10 most-visited tourist attractions in 2013: Times Square, 
Central Park, and Grand Central Terminal.[24] The borough hosts many world-renowned 
bridges, such as the Brooklyn Bridge; skyscrapers such as the Empire State 
Building, one of the tallest skyscrapers in the world;[25] and parks, such 
as Central Park. There are many historically significant places in Manhattan: 
Chinatown incorporates the highest concentration of Chinese people in the 
Western Hemisphere,[26] and the Stonewall Inn in Greenwich Village is considered 
the birthplace of the modern gay rights movement.[27][28] The City of New 
York was founded at the southern tip of Manhattan,[2] and the borough houses 
New York City Hall, the seat of the City's Government.[29] Numerous colleges 
and universities are located in Manhattan,[30] including Columbia University, 
New York University, Weill Cornell Medical College, and Rockefeller University, 
which have been ranked among the top 35 in the world.[31][32] The name 
"Manhattan" derives from the word Manna-hata, as written in the 1609 logbook 
of Robert Juet, an officer on Henry Hudson's yacht Halve Maen (Half Moon).[33] 
A 1610 map depicts the name as Manna-hata, twice, on both the west and 
east sides of the Mauritius River (later named the Hudson River). The word 
"Manhattan" has been translated as "island of many hills" from the Lenape 
language.[34] The United States Postal Service prefers that mail addressed 
to Manhattan use "New York, NY" rather than "Manhattan, NY".[35] The area 
that is now Manhattan was long inhabited by the Lenape Native Americans. 
In 1524, Florentine explorer Giovanni da Verrazzano – sailing in service 
of King Francis I of France – was the first European to visit the area 
that would become New York City. He entered the tidal strait now known 
as The Narrows aboard his ship La Dauphine and named the land around Upper 
New York Harbor "New Angoulême", in reference to the family name of King 
Francis I that was derived from Angoulême in France; he sailed far enough 
into the harbor to sight the Hudson River, which he referred to in his 
report to the French king as a "very big river"; and he named the Bay of 
Santa Margarita – what is now Upper New York Bay – after Marguerite de 
Navarre, the elder sister of the king.[36][37] It was not until the voyage 
of Henry Hudson, an Englishman who worked for the Dutch East India Company, 
that the area was mapped.[38] Hudson came across Manhattan Island and the 
native people living there in 1609, and continued up the river that would 
later bear his name, the Hudson River, until he arrived at the site of 
present day Albany.[39] A permanent European presence in New Netherland 
began in 1624 with the founding of a Dutch fur trading settlement on Governors 
Island. In 1625, construction was started on the citadel of Fort Amsterdam 
on Manhattan Island, later called New Amsterdam (Nieuw Amsterdam), in what 
is now Lower Manhattan.[41][42] The 1625 establishment of Fort Amsterdam 
at the southern tip of Manhattan Island is recognized as the birth of New 
York City.[43] According to a letter by Pieter Janszoon Schagen, Peter 
Minuit and Dutch colonists acquired Manhattan on May 24, 1626, from unnamed 
Native American people, which are believed to have been Canarsee Indians 
of the Lenape,[44] in exchange for trade goods worth 60 guilders,[15] often 
said to be worth US$24, although accounting for inflation, it actually 
amounts to around US$1,050 in 2014.[45] According to the writer Nathaniel 
Benchley, Minuit conducted the transaction with Seyseys, chief of the Canarsees, 
who were only too happy to accept valuable merchandise in exchange for 
the island that was actually mostly controlled by the Weckquaesgeeks.[46] 
In 1647, Peter Stuyvesant was appointed as the last Dutch Director General 
of the colony.[47] New Amsterdam was formally incorporated as a city on 
February 2, 1653.[48] In 1664, the English conquered New Netherland and 
renamed it "New York" after the English Duke of York and Albany, the future 
King James II.[49] The Dutch, under Director General Stuyvesant, successfully 
negotiated with the English to produce 24 articles of provisional transfer, 
which sought to retain for the extant citizens of New Netherland their 
previously attained liberties (including freedom of religion) under new 
colonial English rulers.[50][51] The Dutch Republic regained it in August 
1673 with a fleet of 21 ships, renaming the city "New Orange". New Netherland 
was ceded permanently to the English in November 1674 through the Treaty 
of Westminster,[52] in exchange for Run Island which was the long-coveted 
last link in the Dutch nutmeg trading monopoly in Indonesia.[53] Manhattan 
was at the heart of the New York Campaign, a series of major battles in 
the early American Revolutionary War. The Continental Army was forced to 
abandon Manhattan after the Battle of Fort Washington on November 16, 1776. 
The city, greatly damaged by the Great Fire of New York during the campaign, 
became the British political and military center of operations in North 
America for the remainder of the war.[54] British occupation lasted until 
November 25, 1783, when George Washington returned to Manhattan, as the 
last British forces left the city.[55] From January 11, 1785, to the fall 
of 1788, New York City was the fifth of five capitals of the United States 
under the Articles of Confederation, with the Continental Congress meeting 
at New York City Hall (then at Fraunces Tavern). New York was the first 
capital under the newly enacted Constitution of the United States, from 
March 4, 1789, to August 12, 1790, at Federal Hall.[56] Federal Hall was 
also the site of where the United States Supreme Court met for the first 
time,[57] the United States Bill of Rights were drafted and ratified,[58] 
and where the Northwest Ordinance was adopted, establishing measures for 
adding new states to the Union.[59] New York grew as an economic center, 
first as a result of Alexander Hamilton's policies and practices as the 
first Secretary of the Treasury and, later, with the opening of the Erie 
Canal in 1825, which connected the Atlantic port to the vast agricultural 
markets of the Midwestern United States and Canada.[60][61] By 1810 New 
York City, then confined to Manhattan, had surpassed Philadelphia as the 
largest city in the United States.[62] Tammany Hall, a Democratic Party 
political machine, began to grow in influence with the support of many 
of the immigrant Irish, culminating in the election of the first Tammany 
mayor, Fernando Wood, in 1854. Tammany Hall dominated local politics for 
decades. Central Park, which opened to the public in 1858, became the first 
landscaped public park in an American city.[b] New York City played a complex 
role in the American Civil War. The city's strong commercial ties to the 
American South,[64] its growing immigrant population (prior to then largely 
from Germany and Ireland; beginning in the late 1850s waves of Italian; 
and Central, and Eastern European Jews began flowing in en-masse), anger 
about conscription sizzled and resentment at those who could afford to 
pay $300 to avoid service, led to resentment against Lincoln's war policies, 
plus the racial element, fomented paranoia about free Blacks taking the 
poor immigrants' jobs,[65] culminated in the three-day-long New York Draft 
Riots of July 1863. These intense war-time riots are counted among the 
worst incidents of civil disorder in American history, with an estimated 
119 participants and passersby massacred.[66] The rate of immigration from 
Europe grew steeply after the Civil War, and New York became the first 
stop for millions seeking a new life in the United States, a role acknowledged 
by the dedication of the Statue of Liberty on October 28, 1886, a gift 
from the people of France.[67][68] The new European immigration brought 
further social upheaval. In a city of tenements packed with poorly paid 
laborers from dozens of nations, the city was a hotbed of revolution (including 
anarchists and communists among others), syndicalism, racketeering, and 
unionization. In 1883 the opening of the Brooklyn Bridge established a 
road connection to Brooklyn, across the East River. In 1874 the western 
portion of the present Bronx County was transferred to New York County 
from Westchester County, and in 1895 the remainder of the present Bronx 
County was annexed.[69] In 1898, when New York City consolidated with three 
neighboring counties to form "the City of Greater New York", Manhattan 
and the Bronx, though still one county, were established as two separate 
boroughs. On January 1, 1914, the New York state legislature created Bronx 
County, and New York County was reduced to its present boundaries.[70] 
The construction of the New York City Subway, which opened in 1904, helped 
bind the new city together, as did additional bridges to Brooklyn. In the 
1920s Manhattan experienced large arrivals of African-Americans as part 
of the Great Migration from the southern United States, and the Harlem 
Renaissance, part of a larger boom time in the Prohibition era that included 
new skyscrapers competing for the skyline. New York City became the most 
populous city in the world in 1925, overtaking London, which had reigned 
for a century.[71] Manhattan's majority white ethnic group declined from 
98.7% in 1900 to 58.3% by 1990.[72] On March 25, 1911, the Triangle Shirtwaist 
Factory fire in Greenwich Village killed 146 garment workers. The disaster 
eventually led to overhauls of the city's fire department, building codes, 
and workplace regulations.[73] The period between the World Wars saw the 
election of reformist mayor Fiorello La Guardia and the fall of Tammany 
Hall after 80 years of political dominance.[74] As the city's demographics 
stabilized, labor unionization brought new protections and affluence to 
the working class, the city's government and infrastructure underwent a 
dramatic overhaul under La Guardia. Despite the Great Depression, some 
of the world's tallest skyscrapers were completed in Manhattan during the 
1930s, including numerous Art Deco masterpieces that are still part of 
the city's skyline today, most notably the Empire State Building, the Chrysler 
Building, and the GE Building. Returning World War II veterans created 
a postwar economic boom, which led to the development of huge housing developments 
targeted at returning veterans, the largest being Peter Cooper Village-Stuyvesant 
Town, which opened in 1947.[75] In 1952, the UN relocated from its first 
headquarters near Queens, to the East Side of Manhattan.[76] The Stonewall 
riots were a series of spontaneous, violent demonstrations by members of 
the gay community against a police raid that took place in the early morning 
hours of June 28, 1969, at the Stonewall Inn in the Greenwich Village neighborhood 
of Lower Manhattan. They are widely considered to constitute the single 
most important event leading to the gay liberation movement and the modern 
fight for LGBT rights in the United States.[77][78] In the 1970s job losses 
due to industrial restructuring caused New York City, including Manhattan, 
to suffer from economic problems and rising crime rates.[79] While a resurgence 
in the financial industry greatly improved the city's economic health in 
the 1980s, New York's crime rate continued to increase through the decade 
and into the beginning of the 1990s.[80] The 1980s saw a rebirth of Wall 
Street, and Manhattan reclaimed its role at the center of the worldwide 
financial industry. The 1980s also saw Manhattan at the heart of the AIDS 
crisis, with Greenwich Village at its epicenter. The organizations Gay 
Men's Health Crisis (GMHC) and AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power (ACT UP) 
were founded to advocate on behalf of those stricken with the disease. 
By the 1990s crime rates started to drop dramatically due to revised police 
strategies, improving economic opportunities, gentrification, and new residents, 
both American transplants and new immigrants from Asia and Latin America. 
Murder rates that had reached 2,245 in 1990 plummeted to 537 by 2008, and 
the crack epidemic and its associated drug-related violence came under 
greater control.[81] The outflow of population turned around, as the city 
once again became the destination of immigrants from around the world, 
joining with low interest rates and Wall Street bonuses to fuel the growth 
of the real estate market.[82] Important new sectors, such as Silicon Alley, 
emerged in Manhattan's economy. On September 11, 2001, two of four hijacked 
planes were flown into the Twin Towers of the original World Trade Center, 
and the towers subsequently collapsed. 7 World Trade Center collapsed due 
to fires and structural damage caused by heavy debris falling from the 
collapse of the Twin Towers. The other buildings within the World Trade 
Center complex were damaged beyond repair and soon after demolished. The 
collapse of the Twin Towers caused extensive damage to other surrounding 
buildings and skyscrapers in Lower Manhattan, and resulted in the deaths 
of 2,606 people, in addition to those on the planes. Since 2001, most of 
Lower Manhattan has been restored, but there has been controversy surrounding 
the rebuilding. However, many rescue workers and residents of the area 
developed several life-threatening illnesses that have led to some of their 
subsequent deaths.[85] A memorial at the site was opened to the public 
on September 11, 2011, and the museum opened in 2014. In 2014, the new 
One World Trade Center, at 1,776 feet (541 m) and formerly known as the 
Freedom Tower, became the tallest building in the Western Hemisphere,[86] 
while other skyscrapers were under construction at the site. The Occupy 
Wall Street protests in Zuccotti Park in the Financial District of Lower 
Manhattan began on September 17, 2011, receiving global attention and spawning 
the Occupy movement against social and economic inequality worldwide.[87] 
On October 29 and 30, 2012, Hurricane Sandy caused extensive destruction 
in the borough, ravaging portions of Lower Manhattan with record-high storm 
surge from New York Harbor,[88] severe flooding, and high winds, causing 
power outages for hundreds of thousands of city residents[89] and leading 
to gasoline shortages[90] and disruption of mass transit systems.[91][92][93][94] 
The storm and its profound impacts have prompted the discussion of constructing 
seawalls and other coastal barriers around the shorelines of the borough 
and the metropolitan area to minimize the risk of destructive consequences 
from another such event in the future.[95] The borough consists of Manhattan 
Island, Marble Hill, and several small islands, including Randalls Island 
and Wards Island, and Roosevelt Island in the East River, and Governors 
Island and Liberty Island to the south in New York Harbor.[96] According 
to the U.S. Census Bureau, New York County has a total area of 33.6 square 
miles (87 km2), of which 22.8 square miles (59 km2) is land and 10.8 square 
miles (28 km2) (32%) is water.[97] The northern segment of Upper Manhattan 
represents a geographic panhandle. Manhattan Island is 22.7 square miles 
(59 km2) in area, 13.4 miles (21.6 km) long and 2.3 miles (3.7 km) wide, 
at its widest (near 14th Street).[98] Manhattan Island is loosely divided 
into Downtown (Lower Manhattan), Midtown (Midtown Manhattan), and Uptown 
(Upper Manhattan), with Fifth Avenue dividing Manhattan's east and west 
sides. Manhattan Island is bounded by the Hudson River to the west and 
the East River to the east. To the north, the Harlem River divides Manhattan 
Island from the Bronx and the mainland United States. Early in the 19th 
century, landfill was used to expand Lower Manhattan from the natural Hudson 
shoreline at Greenwich Street to West Street.[99] When building the World 
Trade Center in 1968, 1.2 million cubic yards (917,000 m³) of material 
was excavated from the site.[100] Rather than dumping the spoil at sea 
or in landfills, the fill material was used to expand the Manhattan shoreline 
across West Street, creating Battery Park City.[101] The result was a 700-foot 
(210-m) extension into the river, running six blocks or 1,484 feet (452 m), 
covering 92 acres (37 ha), providing a 1.2-mile (1.9 km) riverfront esplanade 
and over 30 acres (12 ha) of parks.[102] One neighborhood of New York County 
is contiguous with the mainland. Marble Hill at one time was part of Manhattan 
Island, but the Harlem River Ship Canal, dug in 1895 to improve navigation 
on the Harlem River, separated it from the remainder of Manhattan as an 
island between the Bronx and the remainder of Manhattan.[103] Before World 
War I, the section of the original Harlem River channel separating Marble 
Hill from The Bronx was filled in, and Marble Hill became part of the mainland.[104] 
Marble Hill is one example of how Manhattan's land has been considerably 
altered by human intervention. The borough has seen substantial land reclamation 
along its waterfronts since Dutch colonial times, and much of the natural 
variation in its topography has been evened out.[34] In New York Harbor 
there are three smaller islands: Other smaller islands, in the East River, 
include (from north to south): The bedrock underlying much of Manhattan 
is a mica schist known as Manhattan schist.[105] It is a strong, competent 
metamorphic rock created when Pangaea formed. It is well suited for the 
foundations of tall buildings. In Central Park, outcrops of Manhattan Schist 
occur and Rat Rock is one rather large example.[106][107][108] Geologically, 
a predominant feature of the substrata of Manhattan is that the underlying 
bedrock base of the island rises considerably closer to the surface near 
Midtown Manhattan, dips down lower between 29th Street and Canal Street, 
then rises toward the surface again in Lower Manhattan. It has been widely 
believed that the depth to bedrock was the primary underlying reason for 
the clustering of skyscrapers in the Midtown and Financial District areas, 
and their absence over the intervening territory between these two areas.[109][110] 
However, research has shown that economic factors played a bigger part 
in the locations of these skyscrapers.[111][112][113] According to the 
United States Geological Survey, an updated analysis of seismic hazard 
in July 2014 revealed a "slightly lower hazard for tall buildings" in Manhattan 
than previously assessed. Scientists estimated this lessened risk based 
upon a lower likelihood than previously thought of slow shaking near New 
York City, which would be more likely to cause damage to taller structures 
from an earthquake in the vicinity of the city.[114] Manhattan's many neighborhoods 
are not named according to any particular convention. Some are geographical 
(the Upper East Side), or ethnically descriptive (Little Italy). Others 
are acronyms, such as TriBeCa (for "TRIangle BElow CAnal Street") or SoHo 
("SOuth of HOuston"), or the far more recent vintages NoLIta ("NOrth of 
Little ITAly").[115][116] and NoMad ("NOrth of MADison Square Park").[117][118][119] 
Harlem is a name from the Dutch colonial era after Haarlem, a city in the 
Netherlands.[120] Alphabet City comprises Avenues A, B, C, and D, to which 
its name refers. Some have simple folkloric names, such as Hell's Kitchen, 
alongside their more official but lesser used title (in this case, Clinton). 
Some neighborhoods, such as SoHo, are commercial and known for upscale 
shopping. Others, such as Greenwich Village, the Lower East Side, Alphabet 
City and the East Village, have long been associated with the Bohemian 
subculture.[121] Chelsea is a neighborhood with a large gay population, 
and recently a center of New York's art industry and nightlife.[122] Washington 
Heights is a vibrant neighborhood of immigrants from the Dominican Republic. 
Chinatown has a dense population of people of Chinese descent.[123][124] 
Koreatown is roughly bounded by 5th and 6th Avenues, between 31st and 36th 
Streets. Rose Hill features a growing number of Indian restaurants and 
spice shops along a stretch of Lexington Avenue between 25th and 30th Streets 
which has become known as Curry Hill.[125] In Manhattan, uptown means north 
(more precisely north-northeast, which is the direction the island and 
its street grid system are oriented) and downtown means south (south-southwest).[126] 
This usage differs from that of most American cities, where downtown refers 
to the central business district. Manhattan has two central business districts, 
the Financial District at the southern tip of the island, and Midtown Manhattan. 
The term uptown also refers to the northern part of Manhattan above 72nd 
Street and downtown to the southern portion below 14th Street,[127] with 
Midtown covering the area in between, though definitions can be rather 
fluid depending on the situation. Fifth Avenue roughly bisects Manhattan 
Island and acts as the demarcation line for east/west designations (e.g., 
East 27th Street, West 42nd Street); street addresses start at Fifth Avenue 
and increase heading away from Fifth Avenue, at a rate of 100 per block 
on most streets.[127] South of Waverly Place, Fifth Avenue terminates and 
Broadway becomes the east/west demarcation line. Though the grid does start 
with 1st Street, just north of Houston Street (the southernmost street 
divided in west and east portions; pronounced HOW-stin), the grid does 
not fully take hold until north of 14th Street, where nearly all east-west 
streets are numerically identified, which increase from south to north 
to 220th Street, the highest numbered street on the island. Streets in 
Midtown are usually one way with a few exceptions (14th, 23rd, 34th, and 
42nd for example). The rule of thumb is that odd-numbered streets run west, 
while even-numbered streets run east.[98] Under the Köppen climate classification, 
using the 0 °C (32 °F) coldest month (January) isotherm, New York City 
including Manhattan itself experiences a humid subtropical climate (Cfa),[128][129] 
and located at around 40°N latitude, is the northernmost major city on 
the North American continent with this categorization. Winters are cold 
and damp, and prevailing wind patterns that blow offshore minimize the 
moderating effects of the Atlantic Ocean; yet the Atlantic and the partial 
shielding from colder air by the Appalachians keep the city warmer in the 
winter than inland North American cities at similar or lesser latitudes, 
such as Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, and Indianapolis, helping to moderate the 
amount of snow, which averages 25 inches (64 cm) each year.[130] Spring 
and fall in New York City are mild, while summer is very warm and humid, 
with temperatures of 90 °F (32 °C) or higher recorded from 18 to 25 days 
on average during the season.[131] The city's long-term climate patterns 
are affected by the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation, a 70-year-long warming 
and cooling cycle in the Atlantic that influences the frequency and severity 
of hurricanes and coastal storms in the region.[132] Central Park is the 
location of record for the borough's climatic data. Temperature records 
have been set as high as 106 °F (41 °C) on July 9, 1936, and as low as 
−15 °F (−26 °C) on February 9, 1934. Summer evening temperatures are elevated 
by the urban heat island effect, which causes heat absorbed during the 
day to be radiated back at night, raising temperatures by as much as 7 °F 
(4 °C) when winds are slow.[133] See Geography of New York City for additional 
climate information from the outer boroughs. At the 2010 Census, there 
were 1,585,873 people living in Manhattan, an increase of 3.2% since 2000. 
Since 2010, Manhattan's population was estimated by the Census Bureau to 
have increased 3.7% to 1,644,518 as of 2015[update], representing 19.3% 
of New York City's population and 8.3% of New York State's population.[1][142] 
As of the 2000 Census, the population density of New York County was 66,940 
per square mile (25,846/km²), the highest population density of any county 
in the United States.[143] If 2012 census estimates were accurate, the 
population density then approximated 70,518 people per square mile (27,227/km²). 
In 1910, at the height of European immigration to New York, Manhattan's 
population density reached a peak of 101,548 people per square mile (39,208/km²). 
According to 2012 Census estimates, 65.2% of the population was White, 
18.4% Black or African American, 1.2% American Indian and Alaska Native, 
12.0% Asian, and 3.1% of two or more races. 25.8% of Manhattan's population 
was of Hispanic or Latino origin, of any race. Manhattan has the second 
highest percentage of non-Hispanic Whites (48%) of New York City's boroughs, 
after Staten Island (where non-Hispanic Whites make up 64% of residents).[1] 
The New York City Department of City Planning projects that Manhattan's 
population will increase by 289,000 people between 2000 and 2030, an increase 
of 18.8% over the period, second only to Staten Island, while the rest 
of the city is projected to grow by 12.7% over the same period. The school-age 
population is expected to grow 4.4% by 2030, in contrast to a small decline 
in the city as a whole. The elderly population is forecast to grow by 57.9%, 
with the borough adding 108,000 persons ages 65 and over, compared to 44.2% 
growth citywide.[144] According to the 2009 American Community Survey,[145] 
the average household size was 2.11, and the average family size was 3.21. 
Approximately 59.4% of the population over the age of 25 have a bachelor's 
degree or higher. Approximately 27.0% of the population is foreign-born, 
and 61.7% of the population over the age of 5 speak only English at home. 
People of Irish ancestry make up 7.8% of the population, while Italian 
Americans make up 6.8% of the population. German Americans and Russian 
Americans make up 7.2% and 6.2% of the population respectively.[146] In 
2000, 56.4% of people living in Manhattan were White, 17.39% were Black, 
14.14% were from other races, 9.40% were Asian, 0.5% were Native American, 
and 0.07% were Pacific Islander. 4.14% were from two or more races. 27.18% 
were Hispanic of any race. There were 738,644 households. 25.2% were married 
couples living together, 12.6% had a female householder with no husband 
present, and 59.1% were non-families. 17.1% had children under the age 
of 18 living with them. 48% of all households were made up of individuals 
and 10.9% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The 
average household size was two and the average family size was 2.99. Manhattan's 
population was spread out with 16.8% under the age of 18, 10.2% from 18 
to 24, 38.3% from 25 to 44, 22.6% from 45 to 64, and 12.2% who were 65 
years of age or older. The median age was 36 years. For every 100 females, 
there were 90.3 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 
87.9 males. Manhattan is one of the highest-income places in the United 
States with a population greater than one million. As of 2012[update], 
Manhattan's cost of living was the highest in the United States,[147] but 
the borough also contained the country's most profound level of income 
inequality.[148] Manhattan is also the United States county with the highest 
per capita income, being the sole county whose per capita income exceeded 
$100,000 in 2010.[149] In 2012, The New York Times reported that "the income 
gap in Manhattan, already wider than almost anywhere else in the country, 
rivaled disparities in sub-Saharan Africa. ... The wealthiest fifth of 
Manhattanites made more than 40 times what the lowest fifth reported, a 
widening gap (it was 38 times, the year before) surpassed by only a few 
developing countries".[150] Lower Manhattan has been experiencing a baby 
boom, well above the overall birth rate in Manhattan, with the area south 
of Canal Street witnessing 1,086 births in 2010, 12% greater than 2009 
and over twice the number born in 2001.[151] The Financial District alone 
has witnessed growth in its population to approximately 43,000 as of 2014[update], 
nearly double the 23,000 recorded at the 2000 Census.[152] Manhattan is 
religiously diverse. The largest religious affiliation is the Catholic 
Church, whose adherents constitute 564,505 persons (more than 36% of the 
population) and maintain 110 congregations. Jews comprise the second largest 
religious group, with 314,500 persons (20.5%) in 102 congregations. They 
are followed by Protestants, with 139,732 adherents (9.1%) and Muslims, 
with 37,078 (2.4%).[153] As of 2010[update], 59.98% (902,267) of Manhattan 
residents, ages five and older, spoke only English at home, while 23.07% 
(347,033) spoke Spanish, 5.33% (80,240) Chinese, 2.03% (30,567) French, 
0.78% (11,776) Japanese, 0.77% (11,517) Russian, 0.72% (10,788) Korean, 
0.70% (10,496) German, 0.66% (9,868) Italian, 0.64% (9,555) Hebrew, and 
0.48% (7,158) African languages as a main language. In total, 40.02% (602,058) 
of Manhattan's population, ages 5 and older, spoke a language other than 
English at home.[154] The Theater District around Broadway at Times Square, 
New York University, Columbia University, Flatiron Building, the Financial 
District around Wall Street, Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, Little 
Italy, Harlem, the American Museum of Natural History, Chinatown, and Central 
Park are all located on this densely populated island. Manhattan has many 
energy-efficient green office buildings, such as the Hearst Tower, the 
rebuilt 7 World Trade Center,[155] and the Bank of America Tower—the first 
skyscraper designed to attain a Platinum LEED Certification.[156][157] 
The skyscraper, which has shaped Manhattan's distinctive skyline, has been 
closely associated with New York City's identity since the end of the 19th 
century. From 1890 to 1973, the world's tallest building was in Manhattan 
(with a gap between 1901 and 1908, when the title was held by Philadelphia 
City Hall), with nine different buildings holding the title.[158] The New 
York World Building on Park Row, was the first to take the title in 1890, 
standing 309 feet (94 m) until 1955, when it was demolished to construct 
a new ramp to the Brooklyn Bridge.[159] The nearby Park Row Building, with 
its 29 stories standing 391 feet (119 m) high took the title in 1899.[160] 
The 41-story Singer Building, constructed in 1908 as the headquarters of 
the eponymous sewing machine manufacturer, stood 612 feet (187 m) high 
until 1967, when it became the tallest building ever demolished.[161] The 
Metropolitan Life Insurance Company Tower, standing 700 feet (210 m) at 
the foot of Madison Avenue, wrested the title in 1909, with a tower reminiscent 
of St Mark's Campanile in Venice.[162] The Woolworth Building, and its 
distinctive Gothic architecture, took the title in 1913, topping off at 
792 feet (241 m).[163] The Roaring Twenties saw a race to the sky, with 
three separate buildings pursuing the world's tallest title in the span 
of a year. As the stock market soared in the days before the Wall Street 
Crash of 1929, two developers publicly competed for the crown.[164] At 
927 feet (283 m), 40 Wall Street, completed in May 1930 in an astonishing 
eleven months as the headquarters of the Bank of Manhattan, seemed to have 
secured the title.[165] At Lexington Avenue and 42nd Street, auto executive 
Walter Chrysler and his architect William Van Alen developed plans to build 
the structure's trademark 185-foot (56 m) high spire in secret, pushing 
the Chrysler Building to 1,046 feet (319 m) and making it the tallest in 
the world when it was completed in 1929.[166] Both buildings were soon 
surpassed, with the May 1931 completion of the 102-story Empire State Building 
with its Art Deco tower soaring 1,250 feet (380 m) to the top of the building. 
The 203-foot (62 m) high pinnacle was later added bringing the total height 
of the building to 1,453 ft (443 m).[167][168] The former Twin Towers of 
the World Trade Center were located in Lower Manhattan. At 1,368 and 1,362 feet 
(417 and 415 m), the 110-story buildings were the world's tallest from 
1972, until they were surpassed by the construction of the Willis Tower 
in 1974 (formerly known as the Sears Tower, located in Chicago).[169] One 
World Trade Center, a replacement for the Twin Towers of the World Trade 
Center, is currently the tallest building in the Western Hemisphere.[170] 
In 1961, the Pennsylvania Railroad unveiled plans to tear down the old 
Penn Station and replace it with a new Madison Square Garden and office 
building complex. Organized protests were aimed at preserving the McKim, 
Mead & White-designed structure completed in 1910, widely considered a 
masterpiece of the Beaux-Arts style and one of the architectural jewels 
of New York City.[171] Despite these efforts, demolition of the structure 
began in October 1963. The loss of Penn Station—called "an act of irresponsible 
public vandalism" by historian Lewis Mumford—led directly to the enactment 
in 1965 of a local law establishing the New York City Landmarks Preservation 
Commission, which is responsible for preserving the "city's historic, aesthetic, 
and cultural heritage".[172] The historic preservation movement triggered 
by Penn Station's demise has been credited with the retention of some one 
million structures nationwide, including nearly 1,000 in New York City.[173] 
17.8% of the borough, a total of 2,686 acres (10.87 km2), is devoted to 
parkland. Almost 70% of Manhattan's space devoted to parks is located outside 
of Central Park, including 204 playgrounds, 251 Greenstreets, 371 basketball 
courts and many other amenities.[174] Central Park is bordered on the north 
by West 110th Street, on the west by Eighth Avenue, on the south by West 
59th Street, and on the east by Fifth Avenue. Along the park's borders, 
these streets are usually referred to as Central Park North, Central Park 
West, and Central Park South, respectively (Fifth Avenue retains its name 
along the eastern border). The park was designed by Frederick Law Olmsted 
and Calvert Vaux. The 843-acre (3.41 km2) park offers extensive walking 
tracks, two ice-skating rinks, a wildlife sanctuary, and grassy areas used 
for various sporting pursuits, as well as playgrounds for children. The 
park is a popular oasis for migrating birds, and thus is popular with bird 
watchers. The 6-mile (9.7 km) road circling the park is popular with joggers, 
bicyclists and inline skaters, especially on weekends and in the evenings 
after 7:00 pm, when automobile traffic is banned.[175] While much of the 
park looks natural, it is almost entirely landscaped and contains several 
artificial lakes. The construction of Central Park in the 1850s was one 
of the era's most massive public works projects. Some 20,000 workers crafted 
the topography to create the English-style pastoral landscape Olmsted and 
Vaux sought to create. Workers moved nearly 3,000,000 cubic yards (2,300,000 m3) 
of soil and planted more than 270,000 trees and shrubs.[176] The African 
Burial Ground National Monument at Duane Street preserves a site containing 
the remains of over 400 Africans buried during the 17th and 18th centuries. 
The remains were found in 1991 during the construction of the Foley Square 
Federal Office Building. Manhattan is the economic engine of New York City, 
with its 2.3 million workers in 2007 drawn from the entire New York metropolitan 
area accounting for almost two-thirds of all jobs in New York City.[177] 
In the first quarter of 2014, the average weekly wage in Manhattan (New 
York County) was $2,749, representing the highest total among large counties 
in the United States.[178] Manhattan's workforce is overwhelmingly focused 
on white collar professions, with manufacturing nearly extinct. Manhattan 
also has the highest per capita income of any county in the United States. 
In 2010, Manhattan's daytime population was swelling to 3.94 million, with 
commuters adding a net 1.48 million people to the population, along with 
visitors, tourists, and commuting students. The commuter influx of 1.61 million 
workers coming into Manhattan was the largest of any county or city in 
the country,[179] and was more than triple the 480,000 commuters who headed 
into second-ranked Washington, D.C.[180] Manhattan's most important economic 
sector lies in its role as the headquarters for the U.S. financial industry, 
metonymously known as Wall Street. The borough's securities industry, enumerating 
163,400 jobs in August 2013, continues to form the largest segment of the 
city's financial sector and an important economic engine for Manhattan, 
accounting in 2012 for 5 percent of private sector jobs in New York City, 
8.5 percent (US$3.8 billion) of the city's tax revenue, and 22 percent 
of the city's total wages, including an average salary of US$360,700.[181] 
Wall Street investment banking fees in 2012 totaled approximately US$40 
billion,[182] while in 2013, senior New York City bank officers who manage 
risk and compliance functions earned as much as US$324,000 annually.[183] 
Lower Manhattan is home to the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), on Wall 
Street, and the NASDAQ, at 165 Broadway, representing the world's largest 
and second largest stock exchanges, respectively, when measured both by 
overall share trading value and by total market capitalization of their 
listed companies in 2013.[13] The NYSE MKT (formerly the American Stock 
Exchange, AMEX), New York Board of Trade, and the New York Mercantile Exchange 
(NYMEX) are also located downtown. In July 2013, NYSE Euronext, the operator 
of the New York Stock Exchange, took over the administration of the London 
interbank offered rate from the British Bankers Association.[184] New York 
City is home to the most corporate headquarters of any city in the nation, 
the overwhelming majority based in Manhattan.[185] Manhattan contained 
over 500 million square feet (46.5 million m2) of office space in 2015,[186] 
making it the largest office market in the United States,[187] while Midtown 
Manhattan, with nearly 400 million square feet (37.2 million m2) in 2015,[186] 
is the largest central business district in the world.[188] As of 2013[update], 
the global advertising agencies of Omnicom Group and Interpublic Group, 
both based in Manhattan, had combined annual revenues of approximately 
US$21 billion, reflecting New York City's role as the top global center 
for the advertising industry, which is metonymously referred to as "Madison 
Avenue". Silicon Alley, centered in Manhattan, has evolved into a metonym 
for the sphere encompassing the New York City metropolitan region's high 
tech industries[189] including, the Internet, new media, telecommunications, 
digital media, software development, biotechnology, game design, financial 
technology (fintech), and other fields within information technology that 
are supported by the area's entrepreneurship ecosystem and venture capital 
investments. As of 2014[update], New York City hosted 300,000 employees 
in the tech sector.[190][191] In 2015, Silicon Alley generated over US$7.3 
billion in venture capital investment,[192] most based in Manhattan, as 
well as in Brooklyn, Queens, and elsewhere in the region. High technology 
startup companies and employment are growing in Manhattan and across New 
York City, bolstered by the city's emergence as a global node of creativity 
and entrepreneurship,[192] social tolerance,[193] and environmental sustainability,[194][195] 
as well as New York's position as the leading Internet hub and telecommunications 
center in North America, including its vicinity to several transatlantic 
fiber optic trunk lines, the city's intellectual capital, and its extensive 
outdoor wireless connectivity.[196] Verizon Communications, headquartered 
at 140 West Street in Lower Manhattan, was at the final stages in 2014 
of completing a US$3 billion fiberoptic telecommunications upgrade throughout 
New York City.[197] As of October 2014, New York City hosted 300,000 employees 
in the tech sector,[191] with a significant proportion in Manhattan. The 
biotechnology sector is also growing in Manhattan based upon the city's 
strength in academic scientific research and public and commercial financial 
support. By mid-2014, Accelerator, a biotech investment firm, had raised 
more than US$30 million from investors, including Eli Lilly and Company, 
Pfizer, and Johnson & Johnson, for initial funding to create biotechnology 
startups at the Alexandria Center for Life Science, which encompasses more 
than 700,000 square feet (65,000 m2) on East 29th Street and promotes collaboration 
among scientists and entrepreneurs at the center and with nearby academic, 
medical, and research institutions. The New York City Economic Development 
Corporation's Early Stage Life Sciences Funding Initiative and venture 
capital partners, including Celgene, General Electric Ventures, and Eli 
Lilly, committed a minimum of US$100 million to help launch 15 to 20 ventures 
in life sciences and biotechnology.[198] In 2011, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg 
had announced his choice of Cornell University and Technion-Israel Institute 
of Technology to build a US$2 billion graduate school of applied sciences 
on Roosevelt Island, Manhattan, with the goal of transforming New York 
City into the world's premier technology capital.[199][200] Tourism is 
vital to Manhattan's economy, and the landmarks of Manhattan are the focus 
of New York City's tourists, enumerating nearly 60 million visitors in 
2015.[23] According to The Broadway League, shows on Broadway sold approximately 
US$1.27 billion worth of tickets in the 2013–2014 season, an increase of 
11.4% from US$1.139 billion in the 2012–2013 season; attendance in 2013–2014 
stood at 12.21 million, representing a 5.5% increase from the 2012–2013 
season's 11.57 million.[201] Manhattan was on track to have an estimated 
90,000 hotel rooms at the end of 2014, a 10% increase from 2013.[202] Real 
estate is a major force in Manhattan's economy, and indeed the city's, 
as the total value of all New York City property was assessed at US$914.8 
billion for the 2015 fiscal year.[203] Manhattan has perennially been home 
to some of the nation's, as well as the world's, most valuable real estate, 
including the Time Warner Center, which had the highest-listed market value 
in the city in 2006 at US$1.1 billion,[204] to be subsequently surpassed 
in October 2014 by the Waldorf Astoria New York, which became the most 
expensive hotel ever sold after being purchased by the Anbang Insurance 
Group, based in China, for US$1.95 billion.[205] When 450 Park Avenue was 
sold on July 2, 2007, for US$510 million, about US$1,589 per square foot 
(US$17,104/m²), it broke the barely month-old record for an American office 
building of US$1,476 per square foot (US$15,887/m²) based on the sale of 
660 Madison Avenue.[206] In 2014, Manhattan was home to six of the top 
ten zip codes in the United States by median housing price.[207] Manhattan 
had approximately 520 million square feet (48.1 million m²) of office space 
in 2013,[208] making it the largest office market in the United States.[209] 
Midtown Manhattan is the largest central business district in the nation 
based on office space,[210] while Lower Manhattan is the third-largest 
(after Chicago's Loop).[211][212] Manhattan is served by the major New 
York City dailies, including The New York Times, New York Daily News, and 
New York Post, which are all headquartered in the borough. The nation's 
largest newspaper by circulation, The Wall Street Journal, is also based 
there. Other daily newspapers include AM New York and The Villager. The 
New York Amsterdam News, based in Harlem, is one of the leading African 
American weekly newspapers in the United States. The Village Voice is a 
leading alternative weekly based in the borough.[213] The television industry 
developed in New York and is a significant employer in the city's economy. 
The four major American broadcast networks, ABC, NBC, CBS, and Fox, as 
well as Univision, are all headquartered in Manhattan, as are many cable 
channels, including MSNBC, MTV, Fox News, HBO and Comedy Central. In 1971, 
WLIB became New York's first black-owned radio station and the crown jewel 
of Inner City Broadcasting Corporation. A co-founder of Inner City was 
Percy Sutton, a former Manhattan borough president and long one of the 
city's most powerful black leaders.[214] WLIB began broadcasts for the 
African-American community in 1949 and regularly interviewed civil rights 
leaders like Malcolm X and aired live broadcasts from conferences of the 
NAACP. Influential WQHT, also known as Hot 97, claims to be the premier 
hip-hop station in the United States. WNYC, comprising an AM and FM signal, 
has the largest public radio audience in the nation and is the most-listened 
to commercial or non-commercial radio station in Manhattan.[215] WBAI, 
with news and information programming, is one of the few socialist radio 
stations operating in the United States. The oldest public-access television 
cable TV channel in the United States is the Manhattan Neighborhood Network, 
founded in 1971, offers eclectic local programming that ranges from a jazz 
hour to discussion of labor issues to foreign language and religious programming.[216] 
NY1, Time Warner Cable's local news channel, is known for its beat coverage 
of City Hall and state politics. Education in Manhattan is provided by 
a vast number of public and private institutions. Public schools in the 
borough are operated by the New York City Department of Education, the 
largest public school system in the United States.[219] Charter schools 
include Success Academy Harlem 1 through 5, Success Academy Upper West, 
and Public Prep. Some of the best-known New York City public high schools, 
such as Beacon High School, Stuyvesant High School, Fiorello H. LaGuardia 
High School, High School of Fashion Industries, Eleanor Roosevelt High 
School, NYC Lab School, Manhattan Center for Science and Mathematics, Hunter 
College High School and High School for Math, Science and Engineering at 
City College are located in Manhattan. Bard High School Early College, 
a hybrid school created by Bard College, serves students from around the 
city. Many prestigious private prep schools are located in Manhattan, including 
the Upper East Side's Brearley School, Dalton School, Browning School, 
Spence School, Chapin School, Nightingale-Bamford School, Convent of the 
Sacred Heart, Hewitt School, Saint David's School, and Loyola School, along 
with the Upper West Side's Collegiate School and Trinity School. The prestigious 
Regis High School, on the Upper East Side, is the only all-scholarship 
Catholic high school for boys in the country. The borough is also home 
to two private schools that are known as the most diverse in the nation, 
Manhattan Country School and United Nations International School. Manhattan 
has the only official Italian American school in the U.S., La Scuola d'Italia.[220] 
As of 2003[update], 52.3% of Manhattan residents over age 25 have a bachelor's 
degree, the fifth highest of all counties in the country.[221] By 2005, 
about 60% of residents were college graduates and some 25% had earned advanced 
degrees, giving Manhattan one of the nation's densest concentrations of 
highly educated people.[222] Manhattan has various colleges and universities, 
including Columbia University (and its affiliate Barnard College), Cooper 
Union, Marymount Manhattan College, New York Institute of Technology, New 
York University (NYU), The Juilliard School, Pace University, Berkeley 
College, The New School, Yeshiva University, and a campus of Fordham University. 
Other schools include Bank Street College of Education, Boricua College, 
Jewish Theological Seminary of America, Manhattan School of Music, Metropolitan 
College of New York, School of Visual Arts, Touro College and Union Theological 
Seminary. Several other private institutions maintain a Manhattan presence, 
among them St. John's University, The College of New Rochelle and Pratt 
Institute. The City University of New York (CUNY), the municipal college 
system of New York City, is the largest urban university system in the 
United States, serving more than 226,000 degree students and a roughly 
equal number of adult, continuing and professional education students.[223] 
A third of college graduates in New York City graduate from CUNY, with 
the institution enrolling about half of all college students in New York 
City. CUNY senior colleges located in Manhattan include: Baruch College, 
City College of New York, Hunter College, John Jay College of Criminal 
Justice, and the CUNY Graduate Center (graduate studies and doctoral granting 
institution). The only CUNY community college located in Manhattan is the 
Borough of Manhattan Community College. The State University of New York 
is represented by the Fashion Institute of Technology, State University 
of New York State College of Optometry and Stony Brook University – Manhattan. 
Manhattan is a world center for training and education in medicine and 
the life sciences.[224] The city as a whole receives the second-highest 
amount of annual funding from the National Institutes of Health among all 
U.S. cities,[225] the bulk of which goes to Manhattan's research institutions, 
including Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, Rockefeller University, 
Mount Sinai School of Medicine, Columbia University College of Physicians 
and Surgeons, Weill Cornell Medical College and New York University School 
of Medicine. Manhattan is served by the New York Public Library, which 
has the largest collection of any public library system in the country.[226] 
The five units of the Central Library—Mid-Manhattan Library, Donnell Library 
Center, The New York Public Library for the Performing Arts, Andrew Heiskell 
Braille and Talking Book Library and the Science, Industry and Business 
Library—are all located in Manhattan.[227] More than 35 other branch libraries 
are located in the borough.[228] Manhattan has been the scene of many important 
American cultural movements. In 1912, about 20,000 workers, a quarter of 
them women, marched upon Washington Square Park to commemorate the Triangle 
Shirtwaist Factory fire, which killed 146 workers on March 25, 1911. Many 
of the women wore fitted tucked-front blouses like those manufactured by 
the Triangle Shirtwaist Company, a clothing style that became the working 
woman's uniform and a symbol of women's liberation, reflecting the alliance 
of labor and suffrage movements.[229] The Harlem Renaissance in the 1920s 
established the African-American literary canon in the United States and 
introduced writers Langston Hughes and Zora Neale Hurston. Manhattan's 
vibrant visual art scene in the 1950s and 1960s was a center of the American 
pop art movement, which gave birth to such giants as Jasper Johns and Roy 
Lichtenstein. Perhaps no other artist is as associated with the downtown 
pop art movement of the late 1970s as Andy Warhol, who socialized at clubs 
like Serendipity 3 and Studio 54. Broadway theatre is often considered 
the highest professional form of theatre in the United States. Plays and 
musicals are staged in one of the 39 larger professional theatres with 
at least 500 seats, almost all in and around Times Square.[230] Off-Broadway 
theatres feature productions in venues with 100–500 seats.[231] Lincoln 
Center for the Performing Arts, anchoring Lincoln Square on the Upper West 
Side of Manhattan, is home to 12 influential arts organizations, including 
the Metropolitan Opera, New York City Opera, New York Philharmonic, and 
New York City Ballet, as well as the Vivian Beaumont Theater, the Juilliard 
School, Jazz at Lincoln Center, and Alice Tully Hall. Manhattan is also 
home to some of the most extensive art collections in the world, both contemporary 
and historical, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of 
Modern Art (MoMA), the Frick Collection, the Whitney Museum of American 
Art, and the Frank Lloyd Wright-designed Guggenheim Museum. The Upper East 
Side has many art galleries,[232][233] and the downtown neighborhood of 
Chelsea is known for its more than 200 art galleries that are home to modern 
art from both upcoming and established artists.[234][235] Manhattan is 
the borough most closely associated with New York City by non-residents; 
even some natives of New York City's boroughs outside Manhattan will describe 
a trip to Manhattan as "going to the city".[236] The borough has a place 
in several American idioms. The phrase a New York minute is meant to convey 
a very short time, sometimes in hyperbolic form, as in "perhaps faster 
than you would believe is possible". It refers to the rapid pace of life 
in Manhattan.[237] The term "melting pot" was first popularly coined to 
describe the densely populated immigrant neighborhoods on the Lower East 
Side in Israel Zangwill's play The Melting Pot, which was an adaptation 
of William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet set by Zangwill in New York City 
in 1908.[238] The iconic Flatiron Building is said to have been the source 
of the phrase "23 skidoo" or scram, from what cops would shout at men who 
tried to get glimpses of women's dresses being blown up by the winds created 
by the triangular building.[239] The "Big Apple" dates back to the 1920s, 
when a reporter heard the term used by New Orleans stablehands to refer 
to New York City's racetracks and named his racing column "Around The Big 
Apple." Jazz musicians adopted the term to refer to the city as the world's 
jazz capital, and a 1970s ad campaign by the New York Convention and Visitors 
Bureau helped popularize the term.[240] Manhattan is home to the NBA's 
New York Knicks, the NHL's New York Rangers, and the WNBA's New York Liberty, 
who all play their home games at Madison Square Garden, the only major 
professional sports arena in the borough. The New York Jets proposed a 
West Side Stadium for their home field, but the proposal was eventually 
defeated in June 2005, leaving them at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, 
New Jersey. Today, Manhattan is the only borough in New York City that 
does not have a professional baseball franchise. The Bronx has the Yankees 
(American League) and Queens has the Mets (National League) of Major League 
Baseball. The Minor League Baseball Brooklyn Cyclones play in Brooklyn, 
while the Staten Island Yankees play in Staten Island. Yet three of the 
four major league teams to play in New York City played in Manhattan. The 
New York Giants played in the various incarnations of the Polo Grounds 
at 155th Street and Eighth Avenue from their inception in 1883—except for 
1889, when they split their time between Jersey City and Staten Island, 
and when they played in Hilltop Park in 1911—until they headed west with 
the Brooklyn Dodgers after the 1957 season.[241] The New York Yankees began 
their franchise as the Highlanders, named for Hilltop Park, where they 
played from their creation in 1903 until 1912. The team moved to the Polo 
Grounds with the 1913 season, where they were officially christened the 
New York Yankees, remaining there until they moved across the Harlem River 
in 1923 to Yankee Stadium.[242] The New York Mets played in the Polo Grounds 
in 1962 and 1963, their first two seasons, before Shea Stadium was completed 
in 1964.[243] After the Mets departed, the Polo Grounds was demolished 
in April 1964, replaced by public housing.[244][245] The first national 
college-level basketball championship, the National Invitation Tournament, 
was held in New York in 1938 and remains in the city.[246] The New York 
Knicks started play in 1946 as one of the National Basketball Association's 
original teams, playing their first home games at the 69th Regiment Armory, 
before making Madison Square Garden their permanent home.[247] The New 
York Liberty of the WNBA have shared the Garden with the Knicks since their 
creation in 1997 as one of the league's original eight teams.[248] Rucker 
Park in Harlem is a playground court, famed for its streetball style of 
play, where many NBA athletes have played in the summer league.[249] Though 
both of New York City's football teams play today across the Hudson River 
in MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, both teams started out 
playing in the Polo Grounds. The New York Giants played side-by-side with 
their baseball namesakes from the time they entered the National Football 
League in 1925, until crossing over to Yankee Stadium in 1956.[250] The 
New York Jets, originally known as the Titans, started out in 1960 at the 
Polo Grounds, staying there for four seasons before joining the Mets in 
Queens in 1964.[251] The New York Rangers of the National Hockey League 
have played in the various locations of Madison Square Garden since their 
founding in the 1926–1927 season. The Rangers were predated by the New 
York Americans, who started play in the Garden the previous season, lasting 
until the team folded after the 1941–1942 NHL season, a season it played 
in the Garden as the Brooklyn Americans.[252] The New York Cosmos of the 
North American Soccer League played their home games at Downing Stadium 
for two seasons, starting in 1974. In 1975, the team signed Pelé, officially 
recorded by FIFA as the world's greatest soccer player, to a $4.5 million 
contract, drawing a capacity crowd of 22,500 to watch him lead the team 
to a 2–0 victory.[253] The playing pitch and facilities at Downing Stadium 
were in dreadful condition though and as the team's popularity grew they 
too left for Yankee Stadium, and then Giants Stadium. The stadium was demolished 
in 2002 to make way for the $45 million, 4,754-seat Icahn Stadium, which 
includes an Olympic-standard 400-meter running track and, as part of Pele's 
and the Cosmos' legacy, includes a FIFA-approved floodlit soccer stadium 
that hosts matches between the 48 youth teams of a Manhattan soccer club.[254][255] 
Since New York City's consolidation in 1898, Manhattan has been governed 
by the New York City Charter, which has provided for a strong mayor–council 
system since its revision in 1989.[256] The centralized New York City government 
is responsible for public education, correctional institutions, libraries, 
public safety, recreational facilities, sanitation, water supply, and welfare 
services in Manhattan. The office of Borough President was created in the 
consolidation of 1898 to balance centralization with local authority. Each 
borough president had a powerful administrative role derived from having 
a vote on the New York City Board of Estimate, which was responsible for 
creating and approving the city's budget and proposals for land use. In 
1989, the Supreme Court of the United States declared the Board of Estimate 
unconstitutional because Brooklyn, the most populous borough, had no greater 
effective representation on the Board than Staten Island, the least populous 
borough, a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause 
pursuant to the high court's 1964 "one man, one vote" decision.[257] Since 
1990, the largely powerless Borough President has acted as an advocate 
for the borough at the mayoral agencies, the City Council, the New York 
state government, and corporations. Manhattan's current Borough President 
is Gale Brewer, elected as a Democrat in November 2013 with 82.9% of the 
vote.[258] Brewer replaced Scott Stringer, who went on to become New York 
City Comptroller. Cyrus Vance, a Democrat, has been the District Attorney 
of New York County since 2010.[259] Manhattan has ten City Council members, 
the third largest contingent among the five boroughs. It also has twelve 
administrative districts, each served by a local Community Board. Community 
Boards are representative bodies that field complaints and serve as advocates 
for local residents. As the host of the UN, the borough is home to the 
world's largest international consular corps, comprising 105 consulates, 
consulates general and honorary consulates.[260] It is also the home of 
New York City Hall, the seat of New York City government housing the Mayor 
of New York City and the New York City Council. The mayor's staff and thirteen 
municipal agencies are located in the nearby Manhattan Municipal Building, 
completed in 1916, one of the largest governmental buildings in the world.[261] 
The Democratic Party holds most public offices. Registered Republicans 
are a minority in the borough, constituting 9.88% of the electorate as 
of April 2016. Registered Republicans are more than 20% of the electorate 
only in the neighborhoods of the Upper East Side and the Financial District.[when?] 
The Democrats account for 68.41% of those registered to vote, while 17.94% 
of voters are unaffiliated.[263][264] Manhattan is divided between three 
congressional districts, all of which are represented by Democrats. No 
Republican has won the presidential election in Manhattan since 1924, when 
Calvin Coolidge won a plurality of the New York County vote over Democrat 
John W. Davis, 41.20%–39.55%. Warren G. Harding was the most recent Republican 
presidential candidate to win a majority of the Manhattan vote, with 59.22% 
of the 1920 vote.[265] In the 2004 presidential election, Democrat John 
Kerry received 82.1% of the vote in Manhattan and Republican George W. 
Bush received 16.7%.[266] The borough is the most important source of funding 
for presidential campaigns in the United States; in 2004, it was home to 
six of the top seven ZIP codes in the nation for political contributions.[267] 
The top ZIP code, 10021 on the Upper East Side, generated the most money 
for the United States presidential election for all presidential candidates, 
including both Kerry and Bush during the 2004 election.[268] The United 
States Postal Service operates post offices in Manhattan. The James Farley 
Post Office in Midtown Manhattan is New York City's main post office.[269] 
It is located at 421 Eighth Avenue, between 31st Street and 33rd Street. 
The post office stopped 24-hour service on May 9, 2009, due to decreasing 
mail traffic.[270] Both the United States District Court for the Southern 
District of New York and United States Court of Appeals for the Second 
Circuit are located in lower Manhattan's Foley Square, and the U.S. Attorney 
and other federal offices and agencies maintain locations in that area. 
Starting in the mid-19th century, the United States became a magnet for 
immigrants seeking to escape poverty in their home countries. After arriving 
in New York, many new arrivals ended up living in squalor in the slums 
of the Five Points neighborhood, an area between Broadway and the Bowery, 
northeast of New York City Hall. By the 1820s, the area was home to many 
gambling dens and brothels, and was known as a dangerous place to go. In 
1842, Charles Dickens visited the area and was appalled at the horrendous 
living conditions he had seen.[271] The area was so notorious that it even 
caught the attention of Abraham Lincoln, who visited the area before his 
Cooper Union speech in 1860.[272] The predominantly Irish Five Points Gang 
was one of the country's first major organized crime entities. As Italian 
immigration grew in the early 20th century many joined ethnic gangs, including 
Al Capone, who got his start in crime with the Five Points Gang.[273] The 
Mafia (also known as Cosa Nostra) first developed in the mid-19th century 
in Sicily and spread to the East Coast of the United States during the 
late 19th century following waves of Sicilian and Southern Italian emigration. 
Lucky Luciano established Cosa Nostra in Manhattan, forming alliances with 
other criminal enterprises, including the Jewish mob, led by Meyer Lansky, 
the leading Jewish gangster of that period.[274] From 1920–1933, Prohibition 
helped create a thriving black market in liquor, upon which the Mafia was 
quick to capitalize.[274] As in the whole of New York City, Manhattan experienced 
a sharp increase in crime during the 1960s and 1970s.[275] Since 1990, 
crime in Manhattan has plummeted in all categories tracked by the CompStat 
profile. A borough that saw 503 murders in 1990 has seen a drop of nearly 
88% to 62 in 2008. Robbery and burglary are down by more than 80% during 
the period, and auto theft has been reduced by more than 93%. In the seven 
major crime categories tracked by the system, overall crime has declined 
by more than 75% since 1990, and year-to-date statistics through May 2009 
show continuing declines.[276] Based on 2005 data, New York City has the 
lowest crime rate among the ten largest cities in the United States.[277] 
During Manhattan's early history, wood construction and poor access to 
water supplies left the city vulnerable to fires. In 1776, shortly after 
the Continental Army evacuated Manhattan and left it to the British, a 
massive fire broke out destroying one-third of the city and some 500 houses.[278] 
The rise of immigration near the turn of the 20th century left major portions 
of Manhattan, especially the Lower East Side, densely packed with recent 
arrivals, crammed into unhealthy and unsanitary housing. Tenements were 
usually five-stories high, constructed on the then-typical 25x100 lots, 
with "cockroach landlords" exploiting the new immigrants.[279][280] By 
1929, stricter fire codes and the increased use of elevators in residential 
buildings, were the impetus behind a new housing code that effectively 
ended the tenement as a form of new construction, though many tenement 
buildings survive today on the East Side of the borough.[280] Manhattan 
offers a wide array of public and private housing options. There were 852,575 
housing units in 2013[1] at an average density of 37,345 per square mile 
(14,419/km²). As of 2003[update], only 20.3% of Manhattan residents lived 
in owner-occupied housing, the second-lowest rate of all counties in the 
nation, behind the Bronx.[281] Although the city of New York has the highest 
average cost for rent in the United States, it simultaneously hosts a higher 
average of income per capita. Because of this, rent is a lower percentage 
of annual income than in several other American cities.[282] As of 2012[update], 
Manhattan's real estate market for luxury housing was among the most expensive 
in the world.[283] Manhattan is unique in the U.S. for intense use of public 
transportation and lack of private car ownership. While 88% of Americans 
nationwide drive to their jobs, with only 5% using public transport, mass 
transit is the dominant form of travel for residents of Manhattan, with 
72% of borough residents using public transport to get to work, while only 
18% drove.[284][285] According to the 2000 United States Census, 77.5% 
of Manhattan households do not own a car.[286] In 2008, Mayor Bloomberg 
proposed a congestion pricing system to regulate entering Manhattan south 
of 60th Street. The state legislature rejected the proposal in June 2008.[287] 
The New York City Subway, the largest subway system in the world by number 
of stations, is the primary means of travel within the city, linking every 
borough except Staten Island. There are 148 subway stations in Manhattan 
and four under construction, out of the 469 stations. A second subway, 
the Port Authority Trans-Hudson (PATH) system, connects six stations in 
Manhattan to northern New Jersey. Passengers pay fares with pay-per-ride 
MetroCards, which are valid on all city buses and subways, as well as on 
PATH trains.[288][289] There are 7-day and 30-day MetroCards that allow 
unlimited trips on all subways (except PATH) and MTA bus routes (except 
for express buses).[290] The PATH QuickCard is being phased out, having 
been replaced by the SmartLink. The MTA is testing "smart card" payment 
systems to replace the MetroCard.[291] Commuter rail services operating 
to and from Manhattan are the Long Island Rail Road (which connects Manhattan 
and other New York City boroughs to Long Island), the Metro-North Railroad 
(which connects Manhattan to Upstate New York and Southwestern Connecticut) 
and NJ Transit trains to various points in New Jersey. Multibillion-dollar 
heavy-rail transit projects under construction in Manhattan include the 
Second Avenue Subway, the East Side Access project, and the World Trade 
Center Transportation Hub.[292] Two multi-billion-dollar projects were 
completed in the mid-2010s, with the $1.4 billion Fulton Center having 
been completed in November 2014[293] and the $2.4 billion 7 Subway Extension 
having been completed in September 2015.[294] MTA New York City Transit 
offers a wide variety of local buses within Manhattan under the brand New 
York City Bus. An extensive network of express bus routes serves commuters 
and other travelers heading into Manhattan. The bus system served 784 million 
passengers citywide in 2011, placing the bus system's ridership as the 
highest in the nation, and more than double the ridership of the second-place 
Los Angeles system.[295] The Roosevelt Island Tramway, one of two commuter 
cable car systems in North America, whisks commuters between Roosevelt 
Island and Manhattan in less than five minutes, and has been serving the 
island since 1978. (The other system in North America is the Portland Aerial 
Tram.)[296][297] The Staten Island Ferry, which runs 24 hours a day, 365 
days a year, annually carries over 21 million passengers on the 5.2-mile 
(8.4 km) run between Manhattan and Staten Island. Each weekday, five vessels 
transport about 65,000 passengers on 109 boat trips.[298][299] The ferry 
has been fare-free since 1997, when the then-50-cent fare was eliminated.[300] 
The metro region's commuter rail lines converge at Penn Station and Grand 
Central Terminal, on the west and east sides of Midtown Manhattan, respectively. 
They are the two busiest rail stations in the United States. About one-third 
of users of mass transit and two-thirds of railway passengers in the country 
live in New York and its suburbs.[301] Amtrak provides inter-city passenger 
rail service from Penn Station to Boston, Philadelphia, Baltimore, and 
Washington, D.C.; Upstate New York and New England; cross-Canadian border 
service to Toronto and Montreal; and destinations in the Southern and Midwestern 
United States. New York's iconic yellow taxicabs, which number 13,087 city-wide 
and must have the requisite medallion authorizing the pick up of street 
hails, are ubiquitous in the borough.[302] Various private transportation 
network companies compete in Manhattan with each other and with the city's 
taxicabs. Manhattan also has tens of thousands of bicycle commuters. The 
Commissioners' Plan of 1811 called for twelve numbered avenues running 
north and south roughly parallel to the shore of the Hudson River, each 
100 feet (30 m) wide, with First Avenue on the east side and Twelfth Avenue 
on the west side. There are several intermittent avenues east of First 
Avenue, including four additional lettered avenues running from Avenue 
A eastward to Avenue D in an area now known as Alphabet City in Manhattan's 
East Village. The numbered streets in Manhattan run east-west, and are 
generally 60 feet (18 m) wide, with about 200 feet (61 m) between each 
pair of streets. With each combined street and block adding up to about 
260 feet (79 m), there are almost exactly 20 blocks per mile. The typical 
block in Manhattan is 250 by 600 feet (76 by 183 m). According to the original 
Commissioner's Plan, there were 155 numbered crosstown streets,[303] but 
later the grid was extended up to the northernmost corner of Manhattan, 
where the last numbered street is 220th Street (Manhattan). Moreover, the 
numbering system continues even in The Bronx, north of Manhattan, despite 
the fact that the grid plan is not so regular there, and the last numbered 
street is 263rd Street.[304] Fifteen crosstown streets were designated 
as 100 feet (30 m) wide, including 34th, 42nd, 57th and 125th Streets,[305] 
which became some of the borough's most significant transportation and 
shopping venues. Broadway is the most notable of many exceptions to the 
grid, starting at Bowling Green in Lower Manhattan and continuing north 
into the Bronx at Manhattan's northern tip. In much of Midtown Manhattan, 
Broadway runs at a diagonal to the grid, creating major named intersections 
at Union Square (Park Avenue South/Fourth Avenue and 14th Street), Madison 
Square (Fifth Avenue and 23rd Street), Herald Square (Sixth Avenue and 
34th Street), Times Square (Seventh Avenue and 42nd Street), and Columbus 
Circle (Eighth Avenue/Central Park West and 59th Street). "Crosstown traffic" 
refers primarily to vehicular traffic between Manhattan's East Side and 
Manhattan's West Side. The trip is notoriously frustrating for drivers 
because of heavy congestion on narrow local streets laid out by the Commissioners' 
Plan of 1811, absence of express roads other than the Trans-Manhattan Expressway 
at the far north end of Manhattan Island, and only 4 crosstown roads for 
travel through Central Park, which is between 59th Street and 110th Street. 
Proposals in the mid-1900s to build express roads through the city's densest 
neighborhoods, namely the Mid-Manhattan Expressway and Lower Manhattan 
Expressway, did not go forward. The congestion makes Manhattan's crosstown 
buses the perennial "winners" of the "Pokey Awards" for slowest service 
in New York City. Another consequence of the strict grid plan of most of 
Manhattan, and the grid's skew of approximately 28.9 degrees, is a phenomenon 
sometimes referred to as Manhattanhenge (by analogy with Stonehenge).[306] 
On separate occasions in late May and early July, the sunset is aligned 
with the street grid lines, with the result that the sun is visible at 
or near the western horizon from street level.[306][307] A similar phenomenon 
occurs with the sunrise in January and December. The FDR Drive and Harlem 
River Drive, both designed by controversial New York master planner Robert 
Moses,[308] comprise a single, long limited-access parkway skirting the 
east side of Manhattan along the East River and Harlem River south of Dyckman 
Street. The Henry Hudson Parkway is the corresponding parkway on the West 
Side north of 57th Street. Being primarily an island, Manhattan is linked 
to New York City's outer boroughs by numerous bridges, of various sizes. 
Manhattan has fixed highway connections with New Jersey to its west by 
way of the George Washington Bridge, the Holland Tunnel, and the Lincoln 
Tunnel, and to three of the four other New York City boroughs—the Bronx 
to the northeast, and Brooklyn and Queens (both on Long Island) to the 
east and south. Its only direct connection with the fifth New York City 
borough, Staten Island, is the Staten Island Ferry across New York Harbor, 
which is free of charge. The ferry terminal is located near Battery Park 
at Manhattan's southern tip. It is also possible to travel on land to Staten 
Island by way of Brooklyn, via the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge. The George 
Washington Bridge, the world's busiest motor vehicle bridge,[309][310] 
connects Washington Heights, in Upper Manhattan, to Bergen County, in New 
Jersey. There are numerous bridges to the Bronx across the Harlem River, 
and five of those (listed north to south)—the Triborough (known officially 
as the Robert F. Kennedy Bridge), Ed Koch Queensboro (also known as the 
59th Street Bridge), Williamsburg, Manhattan, and Brooklyn Bridges—connect 
Manhattan to Long Island. Several tunnels also link Manhattan Island to 
New York City's outer boroughs and New Jersey. The Lincoln Tunnel, which 
carries 120,000 vehicles a day under the Hudson River between New Jersey 
and Midtown Manhattan, is the busiest vehicular tunnel in the world.[311] 
The tunnel was built instead of a bridge to allow unfettered passage of 
large passenger and cargo ships that sail through New York Harbor and up 
the Hudson River to Manhattan's piers. The Holland Tunnel, connecting Lower 
Manhattan to Jersey City, New Jersey, was the world's first mechanically 
ventilated vehicular tunnel.[312] The Queens-Midtown Tunnel, built to relieve 
congestion on the bridges connecting Manhattan with Queens and Brooklyn, 
was the largest non-federal project in its time when it was completed in 
1940;[313] President Franklin D. Roosevelt was the first person to drive 
through it.[314] The Brooklyn–Battery Tunnel runs underneath Battery Park 
and connects the Financial District at the southern tip of Manhattan to 
Red Hook in Brooklyn. Manhattan has three public heliports: the East 34th 
Street Heliport (also known as the Atlantic Metroport) at East 34th Street, 
owned by New York City and run by the New York City Economic Development 
Corporation ("NYCEDC")); the Port Authority Downtown Manhattan/Wall Street 
Heliport, owned by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and run 
by the NYCEDC; and the West 30th Street Heliport, a privately owned heliport 
that is owned by the Hudson River Park Trust.[315] US Helicopter offered 
regularly scheduled helicopter service connecting the Downtown Manhattan 
Heliport with John F. Kennedy International Airport in Queens and Newark 
Liberty International Airport in New Jersey, before going out of business 
in 2009.[316] Gas and electric service is provided by Consolidated Edison 
to all of Manhattan. Con Edison's electric business traces its roots back 
to Thomas Edison's Edison Electric Illuminating Company, the first investor-owned 
electric utility. The company started service on September 4, 1882, using 
one generator to provide 110 volts direct current (DC) to 59 customers 
with 800 light bulbs, in a one-square-mile area of Lower Manhattan from 
his Pearl Street Station.[317] Con Edison operates the world's largest 
district steam system, which consists of 105 miles (169 km) of steam pipes, 
providing steam for heating, hot water, and air conditioning[318] by some 
1,800 Manhattan customers.[319] Cable service is provided by Time Warner 
Cable and telephone service is provided by Verizon Communications, although 
AT&T is available as well. Manhattan, surrounded by two brackish rivers, 
had a limited supply of fresh water. To satisfy the growing population, 
the city of New York acquired land in Westchester County and constructed 
the old Croton Aqueduct system, which went into service in 1842 and was 
superseded by the new Croton Aqueduct, which opened in 1890, but this was 
interrupted in 2008 for the construction since underway of a US$3.2 billion 
water purification plant that can supply an estimated 290 million gallons 
daily when completed, representing almost a 20% addition to the city's 
availability of water, with this addition going to Manhattan and the Bronx.[320] 
Water comes to Manhattan through New York City Water Tunnel No. 1, Tunnel 
No. 2, and Tunnel No. 3, completed in 1917, 1936, and (Manhattan's supply) 
2013,[321] respectively. Manhattan witnessed the doubling of the natural 
gas supply delivered to the borough when a new gas pipeline opened on November 
1, 2013.[322] The New York City Department of Sanitation is responsible 
for garbage removal.[323] The bulk of the city's trash ultimately is disposed 
at mega-dumps in Pennsylvania, Virginia, South Carolina and Ohio (via transfer 
stations in New Jersey, Brooklyn and Queens) since the 2001 closure of 
the Fresh Kills Landfill on Staten Island.[324] A small amount of trash 
processed at transfer sites in New Jersey is sometimes incinerated at waste-to-energy 
facilities. Like New York City, New Jersey and much of Greater New York 
relies on exporting its trash to far-flung areas. New York City has the 
largest clean-air diesel-hybrid and compressed natural gas bus fleet, which 
also operates in Manhattan, in the country. It also has some of the first 
hybrid taxis, most of which operate in Manhattan.[325] The address algorithm 
of Manhattan is commonly used to find an address on a major street in Manhattan. 
It is commonly found in telephone directories, New York City guide books, 
and MTA Manhattan bus maps. Primary sources Local government and services:
