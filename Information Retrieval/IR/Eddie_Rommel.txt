Edwin Americus Rommel (September 13, 1897 – August 26, 1970) was an American 
right-handed pitcher and umpire in Major League Baseball. He spent his 
entire playing career (1920 to 1932) with the Philadelphia Athletics. He 
is considered to be the "father" of the modern knuckleball. Born in Baltimore, 
Maryland, Rommel pitched for the minor league Newark Bears in 1918 and 
1919.[1] He was picked up by Philadelphia after manager Connie Mack saw 
him start both ends of a doubleheader for Newark. Although he was knocked 
out by the third inning in both contests, Mack purchased his contract after 
noting that Rommel's curveball was breaking on the inside rather than the 
outside.[2] In 1922, Rommel led the American League in wins with 27 despite 
playing for a team that finished seventh in the league and won only 65 
games. Rommel won twenty games twice for the Athletics, in 1922 and 1925. 
Rommel made many relief appearances during his career, leading the AL in 
relief wins in three different seasons. Rommel was reasonably handy with 
the bat for a pitcher, compiling a lifetime batting average of .199—though 
this was in an era where batting averages were generally higher than today. 
In 1931, he was called upon three times by Mack to play the outfield, where 
he made six putouts without error, and once to play second base, where 
he was given no fielding chances. Rommel surrendered ten home runs to Babe 
Ruth, tying him for tenth place. However, fellow Athletics pitchers Rube 
Walberg (17) and Howard Ehmke (13, but nine of them were with other teams) 
surrendered more, and Rommel gave up the same number of Ruth home runs 
as teammate George Earnshaw. Toward the end of his career, he relied mostly 
on the knuckleball. Rommel pitched in relief and earned the win in the 
epic Game 4 of the 1929 World Series; the Athletics overcame an 8–0 deficit 
by scoring ten runs against the Chicago Cubs in the seventh inning to win 
10–8. Sent into the game with the Athletics down 7–0, he pitched one inning, 
gave up one run and was taken out for a pinch hitter. He wound up the winning 
pitcher, thanks to the "Mack Attack". On an intense stretch of four home 
doubleheaders and a single road game in five days, he pitched 17 innings 
in relief on July 10, 1932 against the Cleveland Indians and earned the 
win. Lew Krausse had been the starter; Mack only brought two pitchers to 
Cleveland for the one-game series. Rommel relieved Krausse after one inning 
and finished the game, which was a 15–15 deadlock after nine innings and 
ended 18–17 in favor of the Athletics in 18 innings (and in which Jimmie 
Foxx hit three home runs), despite the Indians setting what remains a league 
record with 33 hits. The game might have been shorter, but Rommel lost 
the lead in the seventh, ninth and sixteenth innings. The 29 hits allowed 
by Rommel remain a major league record, as do Cleveland's Johnny Burnett's 
nine hits. It was Rommel's final major league victory. Rommel was given 
his unconditional release by the Athletics at the end of the 1932 season. 
After retiring as a player, Rommel became an Athletics coach in 1933 and 
1934, and then managed the Richmond Colts of the Piedmont League in 1935, 
capturing the league championship in his only season before leaving in 
a salary dispute.[2] He also pitched eight games for Richmond, posting 
a 6–2 mark. He turned to umpiring in the New York–Penn League in 1936 and 
the International League in 1937, moving up to the American League in 1938, 
and remained on the league staff through the 1959 season.[2] Despite his 
background as a pitcher, Rommel did not tolerate throwing at batters, decrying 
it as dishonest and not to fans' liking. He noted that he only threw at 
a batter once during his own career, on the insistence of catcher Cy Perkins, 
and that the runner (Ray Schalk) eventually scored and cost him the game.[2] 
He worked in the World Series in 1943 and 1947, serving as crew chief the 
first time, and becoming the third man to appear in the Series both as 
a player and as an umpire. He also umpired in the All-Star Game six times: 
1939, 1943, 1946, 1950, 1954 and 1958; he called balls and strikes in the 
1943, '54 and '58 contests. Rommel was the second base umpire for the one-game 
playoff to decide the 1948 AL pennant. He was the first umpire in Major 
League history to wear glasses in a regular season game. Rommel became 
an aide to Maryland governor J. Millard Tawes after retiring as an umpire.
