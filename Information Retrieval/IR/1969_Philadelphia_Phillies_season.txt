The 1969 Philadelphia Phillies season was a season in American baseball. 
The team finished fifth in the newly established National League East with 
a record of 63â€“99, 37 games behind the division champion New York Mets, 
who went on to defeat Baltimore, four games to one, in the World Series. 
It was also the Phillies' penultimate season at Connie Mack Stadium. 1969 
was a year of transition for the organization. Dick Allen was suspended 
by the team for a month after missing a game against the New York Mets. 
Claiming that Allen was undermining him by going directly to owner R. R. 
M. Carpenter, Jr., manager Bob Skinner surprised the club by resigning 
on August 6. Skinner blasted the club for their handling of Allen and blamed 
Allen for the team's losing saying, "Allen has been a big factor in our 
losing and there is very definitely disharmony on the club." Skinner was 
replaced by coach George Myatt.[6] Allen would be traded from the club 
after the season. In addition to the turmoil in the clubhouse, the Phillies 
had expected that 1969 would be their final season at Connie Mack Stadium 
with an April 1970 opening planned for Veterans Stadium. Delays would push 
the Vet's opening to April 1971. At Connie Mack Stadium on April 17, 1969, 
Montreal Expos pitcher Bill Stoneman threw a no-hitter against the Phillies. 
It was Stoneman's fifth major league start and only the ninth game of the 
Expos' existence.[7] In conjunction with Major League Baseball's celebration 
in 1969 of the 100th anniversary of professional baseball, the Phillies 
conducted a fan vote to determine their all-time team. The players were 
honored on August 5, 1969 at Connie Mack Stadium before the Phillies' game 
against the San Francisco Giants. Commissioner Bowie Kuhn was on-hand to 
recognize Robin Roberts as the Phillies' greatest player of all-time.[8] 
The Phillies recorded four straight complete game shutouts from August 
13 to 16, 1969. The Phillies shutout the Atlanta Braves two games in a 
row in Atlanta then returned to Philadelphia where they shutout the Houston 
Astros in the following two games.[9] Infielders Other batters Coaches
