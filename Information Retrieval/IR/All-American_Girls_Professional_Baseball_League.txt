The All-American Girls Professional Baseball League was a women's professional 
baseball league founded by Philip K. Wrigley which existed from 1943 to 
1954. Over 600 women played in the league.[1] In 1948, league attendance 
peaked over 900,000 spectators in attendance. The Rockford Peaches won 
a league-best four championships while playing in the AAGPBL. For most 
of the league's history, manager Bill Allington coached different teams 
and led the league in career wins as a manager. The 1992 motion picture 
A League of Their Own tells a fictionalized account of one of the league's 
teams. Although the name All-American Girls Professional Baseball League, 
or AAGPBL, is commonly used today, it was official for only two seasons. 
The league was founded as the All-American Girls Softball League.[1] In 
1943, the name was changed to the All-American Girls Baseball League.[2] 
In 1949 and 1950 the league was called the All-American Girls Professional 
Baseball League and from 1951 to 1954 the league adopted American Girls' 
Baseball League. The league went through three periods of ownership. The 
League was owned by chewing gum mogul Philip K. Wrigley[1] from 1943 to 
1945, Arthur Meyerhoff from 1945 to 1951, and the teams were individually 
owned from 1951 to 1954. In 1947 and 1948, spring training exhibition games 
were held at the Gran Stadium in Havana, Cuba. The teams generally played 
in second-tier Midwestern cities. The South Bend Blue Sox and the Rockford 
Peaches were the only two teams that stayed in their home cities for the 
full 12-year period of the AAGPBL's existence. With America's entry into 
World War II, several major league baseball executives started a new professional 
league with women players in order to maintain baseball in the public eye 
while the majority of able men were away. The founders included Wrigley, 
Branch Rickey and Paul V. Harper. They feared that Major League Baseball 
would cease, due to the war.[2] Initial tryouts were held at Wrigley Field 
in Chicago. The name of the league is something of a misnomer, as the AAGPBL 
never played regulation baseball. In the first season, the league played 
a game that was a hybrid of baseball and softball. The ball was 12 inches 
in circumference, the size of a regulation softball (regulation baseballs 
are 9 to 9 1⁄4 inches). The pitcher's mound was only forty feet from home 
plate, closer even than in regulation softball and much closer than the 
baseball distance of 60 feet, 6 inches. Pitchers threw underhand windmill, 
like in softball, and the distance between bases was 65 feet, five feet 
longer than in softball but 25 feet shorter than in baseball. Major similarities 
between the AAGPBL and baseball included nine player teams and the use 
of a pitcher's mound (softball pitchers throw from flat ground). By 1948 
the ball had shrunk to 10 3/8 inches, overhand pitching was allowed, and 
the mound was moved back to 50 feet. Over the history of the league, the 
rules continued to gradually approach those of baseball. By the final season 
in 1954, the ball was regulation baseball size, the mound was moved back 
to 60 feet, and the basepaths were extended to 85 feet (still five feet 
shorter than in regulation baseball).[3] Salaries ranged from $45–$85 (or 
$616–$1164 in 2016 dollars[4]) a week during the first years of play to 
as much as $125 (or $1142 in 2016 dollars[4]) per week in later years.[5] 
The uniforms worn by the female ballplayers consisted of a belted, short-sleeved 
tunic dress with a slight flare of the skirt. Rules stated that skirts 
were to be worn no more than six inches above the knee, but the regulation 
was most often ignored in order to facilitate running and fielding. A circular 
team logo was sewn on the front of each dress, and baseball caps featured 
elastic bands in the back so that they were one-size-fits-all[6] Ann Harnett 
became the first girl to sign with the All-Americans, being followed by 
Shirley Jameson, Edythe Perlick and Claire Schillace. During spring training 
the girls were required to attend Helena Rubinstein's evening charm school 
classes. The proper etiquette for every situation was taught, and every 
aspect of personal hygiene, mannerisms and dress code was presented to 
all the players. In an effort to make each player as physically attractive 
as possible, each player received a beauty kit and instructions on how 
to use it. As a part of the leagues 'Rules of Conduct', the girls were 
not permitted to have short hair, smoke or drink in public places, and 
they were required to wear lipstick at all times. Fines for not following 
the leagues rules of conduct were five dollars for the first offense, ten 
for the second, and suspension for the third.[7] During the 1946–1948 seasons 
the league went on the road for spring training. They went to Mississippi 
in 1946, Havana, Cuba in 1947 and to Florida in 1948. The AAGPBL peaked 
in attendance during the 1948 season, when 10 teams attracted 910,000 paid 
fans.[7] The Rockford Peaches won the most league championships with four 
(1945, 1948, 1949, 1950). The Milwaukee/Grand Rapids Chicks were second 
with three (1944 in Milwaukee, 1947 and 1953 in Grand Rapids). The Racine 
Belles (1943 and 1946) and the South Bend Blue Sox (1951 and 1952) each 
won two, and the Kalamazoo Lassies won in the league's final season (1954). 
Bill Allington was the most successful manager in the league's history. 
From 1945 to 1954, he posted a 583-398 record for a .594 winning percentage, 
never had a losing season and is the all-time leader in victories in the 
league. He also was an active talent scout for the league. Allington reached 
the playoff eight times, winning the AAGPBL Championship Title in 1945 
and in consecutive years from 1948 to 1950. The 1992 film A League of Their 
Own, although fictionalized, covers the founding and play of this league. 
Tom Hanks, Geena Davis, Lori Petty, Rosie O'Donnell and Madonna were the 
stars of the film, which was directed by Penny Marshall. Lois Siegel documented 
the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League in her film Baseball 
Girls, which was produced by the National Film Board of Canada. Olive Little 
threw the first no-hitter in team and league history.[8] Several histories 
of the AAGPBL have been published in book form.[9][10] Although the AAGPBL 
was the first recorded professional women's baseball league, women had 
played baseball since the nineteenth century. The first known women's baseball 
team played at Vassar College in 1866,[11] while barnstorming Bloomer Girls 
teams[12] (sometimes including men[13]) flourished from the 1890s to the 
1930s. There were at least three women players in the professional Negro 
Leagues – Toni Stone, Mamie Johnson and Connie Morgan. Baseball Hall of 
Fame members Max Carey[14] and Jimmie Foxx[15] managed teams in the AAGPBL. 
Pitcher Annabelle Lee - who pitched the first perfect game in AAGPBL history 
- was the aunt of Bill Lee, who had a 13-year career with the Boston Red 
Sox and Montreal Expos. AAGPBL player Helen Callaghan was the mother of 
major leaguer Casey Candaele, who played for three different teams in the 
1980s and 1990s. The uniform was a one-piece short-skirted flared tunic. 
It was modeled after the figure skating, field hockey, and tennis outfits 
of the period. The uniforms included satin shorts, knee-high baseball socks, 
and a baseball cap.[16] The theme song made famous in the 1992 film A League 
of Their Own was the official song of the All-American Girls Baseball League, 
co-written by Pepper Paire and Nalda Bird (although in the movie, the word 
"Irishmen" was changed to "Irish ones").[17] Victory Song Batter up! Hear 
that call! The time has come for one and all To play ball. We are the members 
of the All-American League We come from cities near and far We’ve got Canadians, 
Irishmen and Swedes, We’re all for one, we’re one for all We’re all Americans!! 
Each girl stands, her head so proudly high, Her motto ‘Do or Die’ She’s 
not the one to use or need an alibi. Our chaperones are not too soft, They’re 
not too tough, Our managers are on the ball. We’ve got a president who 
really knows his stuff, We’re all for one, we’re one for all, We’re All-Americans! 
In their annual reunions since 1998, it is usual to hear the original AAGPBL 
players singing the song.[18] When the All-American Girls Professional 
Baseball League was unable to continue in 1955, its history and its significance 
was not soon forgotten. Many people in the 1950s thought that women were 
not supposed to play baseball, so most female athletes competed on other 
fields of endeavor. Finally, in 1980, former pitcher June Peppas launched 
a newsletter project to get in touch with friends, teammates and opponents, 
that resulted in the league’s first reunion in Chicago, Illinois in 1982. 
Starting from that reunion, a Players Association was formed five years 
later and many former players of the defunct league continued to enjoy
