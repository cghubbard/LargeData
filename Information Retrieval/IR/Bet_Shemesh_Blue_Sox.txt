Home Away The Beit Shemesh Blue Sox (Hebrew: בית שמש בלו סוקס‎‎) were an 
Israeli baseball team from Bet Shemesh. The Blue Sox was one of the inaugural 
teams in the Israel Baseball League. They had the best regular season record 
(29-12, .707), and won the inaugural championship August 19, 2007, in Petah 
Tikva, shutting out Art Shamsky’s Modi’in Miracle 3-0 in the championship 
game. Californian RHP Rafael Bergstrom pitched a complete game shutout, 
downing Dominican RHP Maximo Nelson (5-3, 3.55 ERA) who pitched for Modi’in. 
On February 26, 2007, it was announced that former Major League Baseball 
player Ron Blomberg would be the manager of the Blue Sox.[1] Team colors 
also reflect Blomberg's stint with the New York Yankees, and hopes that 
IBL officials had of creating a rivalry between Art Shamsky's Modi'in Miracle 
(similar colors to the New York Mets) and the Blue Sox. The first player 
selected by the Blue Sox in the inaugural draft was Canadian right handed 
pitcher Jason Benson.[2] Located at Kibbutz Gezer, Gezer Field was home 
to the Blue Sox as well as the Modi'in Miracle, as neither city has a baseball 
stadium. However, a new field was under construction in Bet Shemesh and 
reportedly would have been reason for the second season in 2008, which 
was never played. The Blue Sox logo is a mixture of the logos of the Chicago 
White Sox and the New York Yankees, and its letters make out the initials 
of the city of Bet Shemesh, written in diagonal from right to left (because 
the Hebrew language reads from right to left), as opposed to the White 
Sox which goes left to right. Bullpen Closer † 15-day disabled list Roster

Coaches Suspended list The Blue Sox jumped off to a good start in the beginning 
of the inaugural 2007 season, winning 9 consecutive game before finally 
losing one to the Tel Aviv Lightning. The team played well for the rest 
of the season, taking first place in the regular season, as well as winning 
the championship game on August 19, 2007, in front of 2,610 fans. The team 
was the best offensive team in the IBL, coming in first in the following 
categories: batting average (.294), runs (286), hits (325), doubles (61), 
home runs (60), RBIs (251), and stolen bases (115). 23-year-old Australian 
right fielder Jason Rees led the league with 17 home runs and 50 RBIs in 
130 at bats. Shortstop Gregg Raymundo, who hit .292 in 7 minor league seasons 
and played for the Texas Rangers' and Pittsburgh Pirates' AAA teams, was 
a close second for the league title in batting, with a .459 batting average. 
Jason Rees was signed to a minor league contract by the New York Yankees 
for the 2008 season. One of the leading pitchers was Juan Feliciano of 
Bet Shemesh, who had pitched for the 2005-06 Hiroshima Carp in Japan. He 
was 7-1, with a 1.97 ERA, and in 50.1 innings gave up only 28 hits while 
striking out 73. Rafael Bergstrom was 7-2, with a 2.44 ERA. The Commissioner's 
Award for Distinguished Service was awarded to shortstop Eric Holtz of 
Bet Shemesh, a player-coach who also filled in as player-manager.[1] Three 
players from the Blue Sox won season awards for outstanding play: Raymundo 
shared the Hank Greenberg MVP award (along with Eladio Rodriguez of the 
Modi'in Miracle), Juan Feliciano was named the best pitcher of the IBL, 
and Jason Rees received two awards: Best Outfielder (shared with Josh Doane 
of the Netanya Tigers) and Home Run Champion (17). The Blue Sox had 11 
players named to the 2007 All-Star Team: Scott Jarmakowicz(C), Gregg Raymundo(SS), 
David Kramer(2B), Sean Slaughter(OF), Jason Reese(OF), Johnny Lopez(DH),
