Keiunta Denard Span[1] (born February 27, 1984) is an American professional 
baseball center fielder for the San Francisco Giants of Major League Baseball 
(MLB). He previously played for the Minnesota Twins and Washington Nationals. 
Span bats and throws left-handed and is known as one of the premier leadoff 
hitters in baseball due to his exceptional on-base percentage.[2] He is 
also one of the top defenders in the MLB for his ability to make difficult 
catches.[3] Span was selected by the Twins with the 20th overall pick in 
the 2002 Major League Baseball draft from Tampa Catholic High School. Span 
turned down just over $2 million from the Colorado Rockies in a predraft 
deal (who instead drafted Jeff Francis with the eighth pick) and his fall 
to the 20th pick cost himself around $800,000.[4] Following his selection, 
Span signed with the Twins on August 15, 2002 which caused him to miss 
all of the 2002 minor league season.[5] He started his minor league career 
in 2003 at Elizabethton, the Twins rookie-league affiliate.[5] In 2004, 
Span was promoted first to the Gulf Coast League Twins in Fort Myers, Florida 
and, after only appearing in 5 games,[5] for the Quad Cities of the Low 
Single A Midwest League. In 2005, he was promoted to Fort Myers Miracle, 
the Twins Advanced A affiliate, and then to the New Britain Rock Cats, 
the Twins Double-A affiliate.[5] In 2006, Span returned to the Rock Cats, 
but was promoted Triple-A Rochester Red Wings in 2007.[5] Throughout the 
2008 spring training, Span was competing with Carlos Gómez to be the Twins' 
starting center fielder, but ultimately lost out to Gomez and was outrighted 
to AAA. However, on April 6, Michael Cuddyer was placed on the 15-day disabled 
list and Span was called up to make his Major League debut against the 
Kansas City Royals. Span failed to impress the Twins (hitting .258/.324/.258) 
and was sent back down to AAA.[6] However, He got hot over the next 40 
games in AAA (.340/.434/.481) and was recalled to the Twins where he spent 
the rest of 2008 season. Span's 2008 season totals were .294/.387/.432 
with 6 HR, 47 RBI, and 7 triples in 93 games.[5] Span was chosen to play 
in the 2008 Beijing Olympics but because he had been promoted, he was forced 
to skip the Olympics. In 2009, Span, unlike in 2008, got the nod to start 
as a left fielder. He also played center field and right field throughout 
the season. His 2009 stats showed some improvement from 2008, hitting .311/.392/.415 
with 8 HR, 68 RBI, and 10 triples in 145 games.[5] He also stole bases 
23 times while getting caught 10 times.[5] Span earned the odd distinction 
of becoming the player to hit both the first regular and post season hits 
at Yankee Stadium in 2009. On March 13, 2010, Span made public a five-year 
deal worth $16.5 million with the Minnesota Twins that included an option 
for the 2015 season worth $9 million with a $500,000 buyout.[7] This contract 
effectively bought out all of Span's arbitration years but did not go beyond 
his available free agency. On March 31, he unintentionally hit his mother, 
who was sitting in the stands, with a foul ball.[8] On April 2, 2010, Span 
collected the first hit (a triple) and the first home run in the Twins' 
new ballpark Target Field in an exhibition game against the St. Louis Cardinals. 
On June 29, Denard Span tied the modern-day Major League Baseball record 
by hitting three triples in one game when he did so against the Detroit 
Tigers in an 11-4 victory. He became the 29th player since 1900 to accomplish 
this feat, the second Minnesota Twin (after Ken Landreaux in 1980), and 
the first player since the Atlanta Brave Rafael Furcal performed the feat 
on April 21, 2002.[9][10] His night also included a single and five runs 
batted in. Overall, Span hit .284/.357/.389 in his Minnesota career, with 
254 walks and 321 strikeouts in 2354 at-bats and stole 90 bases in 118 
attempts. Adding his strong defense gives him an overall wins above replacement 
of 15.9. He also became the first ever player on the 7-Day Disabled List 
in 2012.[6] After being tied with the Nationals in trade rumors as far 
back as 2011, the Twins finally traded Span to the team on November 29, 
2012 for Washington's 2011 first round pick (23rd overall), starting pitcher 
Alex Meyer.[11] After the trade, Span became the team's starting center 
fielder, moving 2012 NL Rookie of the Year Bryce Harper to left field.[12] 
During the 2013 season, Span set a personal and league high with a 29-game 
hit streak (besting the previous 2013 season high of 27 games set by former 
Twins teammate Michael Cuddyer). The streak ended on September 19 following 
an 0-4 performance against the Miami Marlins. During the streak, Span raised 
his season average from .258 to .281 (46 for 128) while hitting 2 HR, 9 
RBI, and scoring 21 runs.[13] On December 3, 2014, Span underwent a sports 
hernia surgery. He claimed that he suffered this injury toward the end 
of the 2014 season but didn’t miss any games.[citation needed] Recovery 
time required 6 weeks, giving him enough time to be ready for 2015 Spring 
training. During March 2015, Span underwent core muscle surgery. He began 
the 2015 season on the 15-day disabled list and made his season debut on 
April 19, 2015. On January 7, 2016, Span signed a three-year, $31 million, 
contract with the San Francisco Giants that included a mutual option for 
2019 and $5 million in performance bonuses.[14] On June 13, 2016 at AT&T 
Park, Span became the first San Francisco Giant to hit a leadoff splash 
hit home run in the first inning into McCovey Cove and joined the San Diego 
Padres' Brian Giles (2008) as the only two players in the history of the
