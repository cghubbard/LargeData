is a former Major League Baseball player. He was a member of the New York 
Yankees' 2000 World Series championship that beat the New York Mets. He 
is an alumnus of Western Kentucky University. Turner played eight seasons 
in the major leagues for four separate teams. He was primarily used as 
a backup catcher, but also played some first base, right field, left field, 
and saw time as a designated hitter.[1] Drafted by the California Angels 
in the 7th round of the 1991 MLB amateur draft, Turner would make his Major 
League Baseball debut with them on August 27, 1993. He played in 25 games 
that year as a backup catcher and hit .280 with one home run and 13 runs 
batted in, his best season. In 1994, he played in a career-high 58 games 
and hit .242 with one home run and 12 runs batted in before the strike 
cancelled the remainder of the season in August. In 1995 he played in just 
five games, going 1-for-10 with an RBI.[2] The next season, he played in 
four games, going 1 for 5 with an RBI and a walk. In 1997, he played in 
13 games, going 6-for-23 with a homer and two runs batted in. On October 
10, 1997, he was granted free agency.[3] He signed with the Twins on December 
5, 1997, but was released on April 20, 1998. Turner signed with the Royals 
on April 20, 1998, only hours after being released by the Twins. He played 
in four games for the Royals and went 0-for-9 with four strikeouts.[4] 
He was granted free agency on October 15. Turner signed with the Indians 
on January 5, 1999. He played in just 12 games, going 4-for-21 with three 
runs, a steal, and a walk while recording eight strikeouts. On October 
4, he was granted free agency. Turner signed with the Yankees on December 
17, 1999 and was viewed as a temporary successor to Joe Girardi, who left 
as a free agent. He played in 37 games, his highest total since 1994 and 
second highest of his career.[5] Turner appeared in his final game on October 
1, 2000 with the New York Yankees and received a World Series ring when 
the Yankees defeated the Mets in the Subway Series. Turner was granted 
free agency on November 21, 2000. On January 4, 2001 he signed with the
