Anthony Francis 'Tony' Cuccinello (November 8, 1907 – September 21, 1995) 
was an American professional baseball player who played for five Major 
League Baseball (MLB) teams from 1930 through 1945: the Cincinnati Reds 
(1930–31), Brooklyn Dodgers (1933–35), Boston Bees/Braves (1936–40, 1941–43), 
New York Giants (1940) and Chicago White Sox (1943–45). Cuccinelo batted 
and threw right-handed. He was the older brother and uncle of former major 
league players Al Cuccinello and Sam Mele. His surname was pronounced "coo-chi-NELL-oh". 
A native of Long Island City, New York, Cuccinello led the National League 
second basemen in assists and double plays three times and hit .300 or 
better five times, with a career high .315 in 1931. He was selected for 
MLB's first All-Star Game, played on July 6, 1933 at Comiskey Park, batting 
as a pinch-hitter for Carl Hubbell in the 9th inning. He also was selected 
for the 1938 All-Star Game. During the 1945 season, Cuccinello hit .308 
for the Chicago White Sox, and just missed winning the American League 
batting title, one point behind Snuffy Stirnweiss' .309. Nevertheless, 
he was released in the offseason. In a 15-season career, Cuccinello was 
a .280 hitter with 94 home runs and 884 RBI in 1704 games. Following his 
playing retirement, in 1947 Cuccinello managed in the Florida International 
League for the Tampa team (named the Smokers, after the city's large cigar 
business), and a year later coached for the Indianapolis Indians of the 
American Association. He returned to the major league to coach with the 
Reds (1949–51), Cleveland Indians (1952–56), White Sox (1957–66; 1969) 
and Detroit Tigers (1967–68). He coached under former teammate Al López 
in Cleveland and Chicago and was a member of Lopez's 1954 and 1959 American 
League championship teams, and the 1968 World Series champions. Cuccinello
