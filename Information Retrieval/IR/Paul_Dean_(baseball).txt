Paul Dee Dean (August 14, 1912 â€“ March 17, 1981), nicknamed "Daffy", was 
an American Major League Baseball right-handed pitcher. Born in Lucas, 
Arkansas, he pitched for the St. Louis Cardinals (from 1934 to 1939), the 
New York Giants (from 1940 to 1941), and the St. Louis Browns (1943). Dean 
played several years of baseball alongside his better-known brother, Jay. 
Because of his brother's nickname, "Dizzy", Dean also had a nickname, Daffy, 
but this did not reflect his personality as he was considered quiet and 
serious. The nickname was mainly a creation of the press.[1] During his 
rookie season (at the age of 22), Dean pitched a no-hitter on September 
21, 1934. He finished the year with a 19-11 record to help St. Louis win 
the National League pennant. In the World Series, he and his brother won 
two games apiece, combining for a 4-1 record, 28 strikeouts and a 1.43 
ERA, as the Cardinals took the series against the Detroit Tigers in seven 
games. The following year, he won 19 games again. He got injured, however, 
and pitched ineffectively for the rest of his career. Dean is featured 
prominently in some versions of Abbott & Costello's Who's on First comedy 
sketch. In the sketch Abbott is explaining to Costello that many ballplayers 
have unusual nicknames including Dizzy Dean, his brother Daffy Dean and 
their "French cousin Goo-fay Dean" The fictitious French cousin's name 
is goofy pronounced with an exaggerated French accent. Dean died at age 
68 in Springdale, Arkansas, from a heart attack. In the 1952 biographical 
film about Dizzy Dean, The Pride of St Louis Paul was portrayed by actor
