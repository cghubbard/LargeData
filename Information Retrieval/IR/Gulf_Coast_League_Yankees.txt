Marc Bombard (Yankees 2) The Gulf Coast League Yankees (or GCL Yankees) 
are the Rookie League affiliate of Major League Baseball's New York Yankees. 
The GCL Yankees play in Tampa, Florida at the Yankee Complex. The team 
is composed mainly of players who are in their first year of professional 
baseball either as draftees or non-drafted free agents from the United 
States, Canada, Dominican Republic, Venezuela, and other countries. The 
GCL Yankees have won the Gulf Coast League championship eleven times. The 
Yankees originally fielded a team who played in the Sarasota Rookie League 
and the Florida Rookie League in 1964 and 1965, which were direct predecessors 
to the Gulf Coast League, before not fielding a team in the market until 
1980. In 2004, the Gulf Coast Yankees swept the Gulf Coast Red Sox to become 
the 2004 Gulf Coast League Champions. In 2005, the GCL Yankees swept the 
Gulf Coast Mets in the best-of-three series to win the Gulf Coast League 
championship again. In 2007, the GCL Yankees defeated the Gulf Coast Dodgers 
to claim the title again. The team defeated the Gulf Coast Marlins in the 
2011 Gulf Coast League championship series. The Yankees began fielding 
two teams in the Gulf Coast League in 2013, named the Gulf Coast League 
Yankees 1 and the Gulf Coast League Yankees 2. (from Baseball Reference
