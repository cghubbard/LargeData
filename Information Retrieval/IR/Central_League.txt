The Central League (セントラル・リーグ, Sentoraru Rīgu?) or Ce League (セリーグ, Se 
Rīgu?) is one of the two professional baseball leagues that constitute 
Nippon Professional Baseball in Japan. The winner of the league championship 
plays against the winner of the Pacific League in the annual Japan Series. 
It currently consists of six teams from around the country. Unlike the 
Pacific League, designated hitters are not used during Central League home 
games. The Central League was founded in 1949 with eight teams: four holdovers 
from the previous Japanese Baseball League — the Chunichi Dragons, the 
Hanshin Tigers, the Yomiuri Giants, and the Shochiku Robins (formerly the 
Taiyō Robins) — and four new teams — the Hiroshima Carp, the Kokutetsu 
Swallows, the Nishi Nippon Pirates, and the Taiyō Whales. The Nishi Nippon 
Pirates existed for one season — they placed sixth in 1950, and the following 
season merged with the also Fukuoka-based Nishitetsu Clippers (a member 
of the Pacific League) to form the Nishitetsu Lions, who joined the Pacific 
League. This brought the number of Central League teams down to an ungainly 
arrangement of seven. Ryuji Suzuki became president of the Central League 
in 1952.[1] In 1952, it was decided that any team ending the season with 
a winning percentage below .300 would be disbanded or merged with other 
teams. The Shochiku Robins fell into this category, and were merged with 
the Taiyō Whales to become the Taiyō Shochiku Robins in January 1953. This 
enabled the Central League to shrink to an even number of six teams. Ryuji 
Suzuki retired as CL president in 1984 after 33 years at the post.[1] In 
2007, a new Climax Series was introduced. This playoff series was inspired 
by the stepladder playoff used in the Pacific League for the top three 
teams of the league to determine which one progressed to the Japan Series. 
Under the previous system, there was no post-season playoff and the winner
