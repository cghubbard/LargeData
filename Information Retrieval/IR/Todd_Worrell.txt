Todd Roland Worrell (born September 28, 1959) is a retired professional 
baseball relief pitcher. He played all or part of eleven seasons in Major 
League Baseball for the St. Louis Cardinals and Los Angeles Dodgers between 
1985 and 1997. Worrell was drafted by the St. Louis Cardinals in the 1st 
round of the 1982 MLB draft out of Biola University. He made his MLB debut 
on August 28, 1985, pitching 1 2/3 scoreless innings in relief against 
the Cincinnati Reds. He picked up his first save on September 13 against 
the Chicago Cubs. Worrell saved five games down the stretch and compiled 
an earned run average of 2.91, then pitched effectively in the postseason 
against the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NLCS and the Kansas City Royals 
in the 1985 World Series. He was still eligible as a rookie the following 
season, and his 9-10 record with 36 saves netted him the 1986 National 
League Rookie of the Year Award, as well as the National League Rolaids 
Relief Man Award. He was on the mound when the winning run in Game 7 of 
the 1987 World Series scored, though he was not tagged with the loss as 
the runner who scored it had been inherited from another pitcher. Worrell 
became the first relief pitcher to save 30 or more games in each of his 
first three full seasons. On September 4, 1989, Worrell was pitching for 
his 125th career save, which would have tied him with Bruce Sutter for 
the Cardinals' career record. While making a pitch, he felt a ligament 
snap. He underwent elbow surgery in December to repair the damage, then 
experienced shoulder pain when attempting to come back for the 1991 season 
and was diagnosed with a rotator cuff tear. As a result, he missed both 
the 1990 and 1991 seasons due to injuries and rehabilitation.[1] Worrell 
came back in 1992 as a set-up man for veteran Lee Smith. Worrell signed 
as a free agent with the Los Angeles Dodgers on December 9, 1992, where 
he struggled for two seasons before regaining his old form and saving 32, 
44, and 35 games in the final three seasons of his career, making two of 
his three career All-Star appearances and becoming the Dodgers career saves 
leader. He retired following the 1997 season.[2] Todd is also the older 
brother of Tim Worrell, himself a major league pitcher between 1993â€“2006, 
and also a distant relative of American swimmer Michael Worrell. Both attended 
Biola University. Todd currently owns and operates Firesteel Creek Hunting 
Lodge north of Plankinton, South Dakota.[3] He has three sons, Josh, Jeremy 
and Jacob who have all played baseball. Josh played at Indiana Wesleyan 
University in Marion, Indiana and was drafted in the 30th round of the 
2009 MLB draft by the Kansas City Royals. He played three seasons in the 
low minors.[4] Jeremy and Jacob also played at Indiana Wesleyan University.[5][6] 
Todd is currently the pitching coach at Westminster Christian Academy in 
St. Louis[7] and also coaches for the River City Rascals of the Frontier
