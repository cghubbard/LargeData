Frank Gibson Selee (October 26, 1859 – July 5, 1909) was an American Major 
League Baseball manager in the National League (NL). In his sixteen-year 
Major League career, he managed the Boston Beaneaters for twelve seasons, 
and the Chicago Orphans/Cubs for four. He was noted for his ability to 
assess and utilize talent, which gave his teams a great opportunity to 
be successful. His success is measurable in that he won five NL titles 
with the Beaneaters, including three years in a row from 1891 to 1893. 
After he left Boston, he went on to manage in Chicago where he built the 
basis for the Cubs' later success by signing and utilizing the talents 
of Frank Chance, Joe Tinker, and Johnny Evers. He was elected to the Baseball 
Hall of Fame in 1999 for his managerial achievements. Selee was born in 
Amherst, New Hampshire.[1] He has been described as a "balding little man 
with a modest demeanor and a formidable mustache that gave his face a melancholy 
cast",[2] and shy and reticent in public. He left a factory job in Waltham, 
Massachusetts, in 1884 to form a minor league team. His was success in 
the minors, which led his eventual move to the Major Leagues in 1890. Noted 
for having a keen ability to assess talent,[3] Selee managed the Boston 
Beaneaters (1890–1901) and the Chicago Cubs (1902–1905). His Beaneaters 
captured five NL pennants during his tenure (1891–93, 1897–98). His 1892 
team, aided by the first 150-game schedule in history, became the first 
team to win 100 games in a season. With the Cubs, he created the famous 
Tinker to Evers to Chance infield combination, by converting Frank Chance 
from catcher to first base, Joe Tinker from third base to shortstop, and 
Johnny Evers from shortstop to second base.[2] In all, twelve of his players 
went on be inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame.[2] In June, 1905, he 
became too ill to manage and surrendered his team to Chance, who went on 
lead the Cubs to four National League titles and two World Series victories.[4] 
The last Cubs' title under Chance in 1910,[4] eight of top thirteen players 
from the 1905 team were still major contributors.[2] In total, he had 1,284 
victories in 2,180 games as manager during his 16-year career, with a winning 
percentage of .598.[1] Selee died of consumption (tuberculosis) at the 
age of 49 in Denver, Colorado,[3] and was interred at Wyoming Cemetery 
in Melrose, Massachusetts.[1] In 1999, he was elected to the Baseball Hall 
of Fame by the Veterans Committee for his achievements as a manager.[5] 
He is one of only two people from New Hampshire to inducted into the Hall 
of Fame.[6] The other was Carlton Fisk, who was enshrined in 2000.[7] Selee 
appeared as a character in the 1991 episode "Batter Up" of the animated 
Back to the Future series, which involved Marty McFly and the Brown children 
traveling back to 1897 to help one of Marty's ancestors, a player for the 
Beaneaters, to improve his game. He was portrayed without his well-known
