Gambling is the wagering of money or something of value (referred to as 
"the stakes") on an event with an uncertain outcome with the primary intent 
of winning additional money and/or material goods. Gambling thus requires 
three elements be present: consideration, chance and prize.[1] The outcome 
of the wager is often immediate, such as a single roll of dice or a spin 
of a roulette wheel, but longer time frames are also common, allowing wagers 
on the outcome of a future sports contest or even an entire sports season. 
The term gaming[2] in this context typically refers to instances in which 
the activity has been specifically permitted by law. The two words are 
not mutually exclusive; i.e., a "gaming" company offers (legal) "gambling" 
activities to the public[3] and may be regulated by one of many gaming 
control boards, for example, the Nevada Gaming Control Board. However, 
this distinction is not universally observed in the English-speaking world. 
For instance, in the UK, the regulator of gambling activities is called 
the Gambling Commission (not the Gaming Commission).[4] The word gaming 
is used more frequently since the rise of computer and video games to describe 
activities that do not necessarily involve wagering, especially online 
gaming, with the new usage still not having displaced the old usage as 
the primary definition in common dictionaries. Gambling is also a major 
international commercial activity, with the legal gambling market totaling 
an estimated $335 billion in 2009.[5] In other forms, gambling can be conducted 
with materials which have a value, but are not real money. For example, 
players of marbles games might wager marbles, and likewise games of Pogs 
or Magic: The Gathering can be played with the collectible game pieces 
(respectively, small discs and trading cards) as stakes, resulting in a 
meta-game regarding the value of a player's collection of pieces. Many 
popular games played in modern casinos originate from Europe and China.[6] 
Games such as craps, baccarat, roulette, and blackjack originate from different 
areas of Europe. A version of keno, an ancient Chinese lottery game, is 
played in casinos around the world. In addition, pai gow poker, a hybrid 
between pai gow and poker is also played.[7] Many jurisdictions, local 
as well as national, either ban gambling or heavily control it by licensing. 
Such regulation generally leads to gambling tourism and illegal gambling 
in the areas where it is not allowed. The involvement of governments, through 
regulation and taxation, has led to a close connection between many governments 
and gaming organizations, where legal gambling provides significant government 
revenue, such as in Monaco or Macau, China. There is generally legislation 
requiring that the odds in gaming devices are statistically random, to 
prevent manufacturers from making some high-payoff results impossible. 
Since these high-payoffs have very low probability, a house bias can quite 
easily be missed unless the odds are checked carefully.[8] Most jurisdictions 
that allow gambling require participants to be above a certain age. In 
some jurisdictions, the gambling age differs depending on the type of gambling. 
For example, in many American states one must be over 21 to enter a casino, 
but may buy a lottery ticket after turning 18. Because contracts of insurance 
have many features in common with wagers, insurance contracts are often 
distinguished under law as agreements in which either party has an interest 
in the "bet-upon" outcome beyond the specific financial terms. e.g.: a 
"bet" with an insurer on whether one's house will burn down is not gambling, 
but rather insurance â€” as the homeowner has an obvious interest in the 
continued existence of his/her home independent of the purely financial 
aspects of the "bet" (i.e., the insurance policy). Nonetheless, both insurance 
and gambling contracts are typically considered aleatory contracts under 
most legal systems, though they are subject to different types of regulation. 
Under common law, particularly English Law (English unjust enrichment), 
a gambling contract may not give a casino bona fide purchaser status, permitting 
the recovery of stolen funds in some situations. In Lipkin Gorman v Karpnale 
Ltd, where a solicitor used stolen funds to gamble at a casino, the House 
of Lords overruled the High Court's previous verdict, adjudicating that 
the casino return the stolen funds less those subject to any change of 
position defence. U.S. Law precedents are somewhat similar.[9] Religious 
perspectives on gambling have been mixed. Ancient Hindu poems like the 
Gambler's Lament and the Mahabharata testify to the popularity of gambling 
among ancient Indians. However, the text Arthashastra (c. 4th century BCE) 
recommends taxation and control of gambling.[10] Ancient Jewish authorities 
frowned on gambling, even disqualifying professional gamblers from testifying 
in court.[11] The Catholic Church holds the position that there is no moral 
impediment to gambling, so long as it is fair, all bettors have a reasonable 
chance of winning, that there is no fraud involved, and the parties involved 
do not have actual knowledge of the outcome of the bet (unless they have 
disclosed this knowledge),[12] Gambling has often been seen as having social 
consequences, as satirized by Balzac. For these social and religious reasons, 
most legal jurisdictions limit gambling, as advocated by Pascal.[13] as 
long as the following conditions are met; the gambler can afford losing 
the bet, stops when the limit is reached, and the motivation is entertainment 
and not personal gain leading to the "love of money"[14] or making a living.[15] 
In general, Catholic bishops have opposed casino gambling on the grounds 
it too often tempts people into problem gambling or addiction, has particularly 
negative effects on poor people; they sometimes also cite secondary effects 
such as increases in loan sharking, prostitution, corruption, and general 
public immorality.[16][17][18] In at least one case, the same bishop opposing 
a casino has sold land to be used for its construction.[19] Some parish 
pastors have also opposed casinos for the additional reason that they would 
take customers away from church bingo and annual festivals where games 
such as blackjack, roulette, craps, and poker are used for fundraising.[20] 
Although different interpretations of sharia law exists in the Muslim world, 
there is a consensus among the ulema that gambling is haraam (sinful). 
In assertions made during its prohibition, Muslim jurists describe gambling 
as being both unquranic and as being generally harmful to the Muslim community. 
The Islamic terminology for gambling is maisar however this also has a 
second definition meaning easy money.[21] In parts of the world that implement 
full sharia law such as Aceh, punishments for Muslim gamblers can range 
up to 12 lashes or a one-year prison term and a fine for those who provide 
a venue for such practises.[22] Some Islamic nations prohibit gambling; 
most other countries regulate it.[23] While almost any game can be played 
for money, and any game typically played for money can also be played just 
for fun, some games are generally offered in a casino setting. Gambling 
games that take place outside of casinos include Bingo (as played in the 
US and UK), dead pool, lotteries, pull-tab games and scratchcards, and 
Mahjong. Other non-casino gambling games include: *Although coin tossing 
isn't usually played in a casino, it has been known to be an official gambling 
game in some Australian casinos[24] Fixed-odds betting and Parimutuel betting 
frequently occur at many types of sporting events, and political elections. 
In addition many bookmakers offer fixed odds on a number of non-sports 
related outcomes, for example the direction and extent of movement of various 
financial indices, the winner of television competitions such as Big Brother, 
and election results.[25] Interactive prediction markets also offer trading 
on these outcomes, with "shares" of results trading on an open market. 
One of the most widespread forms of gambling involves betting on horse 
or greyhound racing. Wagering may take place through parimutuel pools, 
or bookmakers may take bets personally. Parimutuel wagers pay off at prices 
determined by support in the wagering pools, while bookmakers pay off either 
at the odds offered at the time of accepting the bet; or at the median 
odds offered by track bookmakers at the time the race started. Betting 
on team sports has become an important service industry in many countries. 
For example, millions of people play the football pools every week in the 
United Kingdom. In addition to organized sports betting, both legal and 
illegal, there are many side-betting games played by casual groups of spectators, 
such as NCAA Basketball Tournament Bracket Pools, Super Bowl Squares, Fantasy 
Sports Leagues with monetary entry fees and winnings, and in-person spectator 
games like Moundball. Arbitrage betting is a theoretically risk-free betting 
system in which every outcome of an event is bet upon so that a known profit 
will be made by the bettor upon completion of the event, regardless of 
the outcome. Arbitrage betting is a combination of the ancient art of arbitrage 
trading and gambling, which has been made possible by the large numbers 
of bookmakers in the marketplace, creating occasional opportunities for 
arbitrage. One can also bet with another person that a statement is true 
or false, or that a specified event will happen (a "back bet") or will 
not happen (a "lay bet") within a specified time. This occurs in particular 
when two people have opposing but strongly held views on truth or events. 
Not only do the parties hope to gain from the bet, they place the bet also 
to demonstrate their certainty about the issue. Some means of determining 
the issue at stake must exist. Sometimes the amount bet remains nominal, 
demonstrating the outcome as one of principle rather than of financial 
importance. Betting exchanges allow consumers to both back and lay at odds 
of their choice. Similar in some ways to a stock exchange, a bettor may 
want to back a horse (hoping it will win) or lay a horse (hoping it will 
lose, effectively acting as bookmaker). Many betting systems have been 
created in an attempt to "beat the house" but no system can make a mathematically 
unprofitable bet in terms of expected value profitable over time. Widely 
used systems include: Many risk-return choices are sometimes referred to 
colloquially as "gambling." [26] Whether this terminology is acceptable 
is a matter of debate: Investments are also usually not considered gambling, 
although some investments can involve significant risk. Examples of investments 
include stocks, bonds and real estate. Starting a business can also be 
considered a form of investment. Investments are generally not considered 
gambling when they meet the following criteria: Some speculative investment 
activities are particularly risky, but are sometimes perceived to be different 
from gambling: Studies show that though many people participate in gambling 
as a form of recreation or even as a means to gain an income, gambling, 
like any behavior which involves variation in brain chemistry, can become 
a harmful, behavioral addiction. Reinforcement schedules may also make 
gamblers persist in gambling even after repeated losses.[medical citation

portrays in his novella The Gambler the psychological implications of gambling 
and how gambling can affect gamblers. He also associates gambling and the 
idea of "getting rich quick", suggesting that Russians may have a particular 
affinity for gambling. Dostoevsky shows the effect of betting money for 
the chance of gaining more in 19th-century Europe. The association between 
Russians and gambling has fed legends of the origins of Russian roulette. 
Gamblers exhibit a number of cognitive and motivational biases that distort 
the perceived odds of events and that influence their preferences for gambles. 
For example, gambler exhibit a costly aversion to betting against their
