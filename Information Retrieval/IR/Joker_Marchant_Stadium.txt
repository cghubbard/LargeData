Joker Marchant Stadium is a baseball field located in Lakeland, Florida. 
The stadium, opened in 1966, was renovated in 2003, holds 8,500 people, 
and was named after local resident and former Lakeland Parks and Recreation 
Director Marcus "Joker" Marchant. It is the spring training home of the 
Detroit Tigers, as well as the regular season home for the minor league 
affiliates Lakeland Flying Tigers and Gulf Coast Tigers. On March 15, 2011, 
the largest crowd in the stadium's history (10,307 people) watched a spring 
training game between the Detroit Tigers and the Boston Red Sox.[3] The 
stadium's capacity was originally 4,900 in 1966 when it opened. In 1988, 
a bleacher section was added down the left field line, increasing seating 
capacity to 7,027. In 2003, Joker Marchant Stadium was renovated. The State 
of Florida's $4.5 million grant was the biggest financing chuck, while 
the Polk County Tourist Development Council chipped in $2 million. The 
remainder of the renovation's cost was paid for by the Tigers and City 
of Lakeland, increasing capacity to its present figure of 8,500.[1] In 
October 2014 the Lakeland City Commission announced that as part of a new 
agreement with the Detroit Tigers a $37 million renovation and upgrade 
of the 50-year-old stadium will commence starting in April 2016[4][5] following 
the conclusion of the Major League Baseball Spring Training. Funding will 
be provided in part by the Detroit Tigers, the City of Lakeland and Polk 
County. Two construction firms Barton Malow of Southfield, Michigan and 
Rodda Construction of Lakeland were chosen by the City Commission to oversee 
the project. The Detroit Tigers High Class 'A' Minor League club the Lakeland 
Flying Tigers part of the Florida State League played for the duration 
of their season at Henley Field which is located 1Â½ miles from Joker Marchant

rights is 20 years and expires in 2036. Intersection of Kaline and Horton
