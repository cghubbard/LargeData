Huston–Tillotson University (abbreviated as HTU) is a private historically 
black university in Austin, Texas, United States. The school is affiliated 
with the United Methodist Church, the United Church of Christ, and the 
United Negro College Fund. Huston–Tillotson University awards four-year 
degrees in business, education, the humanities, natural sciences, social 
sciences, science and technology. The University also offers alternative 
teacher certification and academic programs for undergraduates interested 
in pursuing post-graduate degrees in Law and Medicine. The history of Huston 
- Tillotson University lies in two schools: Tillotson College and Samuel 
Huston College. Tillotson Collegiate and Normal Institute was chartered 
as a coeducational school in 1877 by the American Missionary Society of 
Congregational churches and its namesake, George Jeffrey Tillotson.[1] 
It opened on January 17, 1881 and had 12 presidents: "William E. Brooks, 
first president (1881-85), was succeeded by John Hershaw (1886), Henry 
L. Lubbell (1886-1889), William M. Brown (1889-93), Winfield S. Goss (1894-95), 
Marshall R. Gaines (1896-1904), Arthur W. Partch (1905-06), Isaac M. Agard 
(1907-18), and Francis W. Fletcher (1919-23). J. T. Hodges, the first African 
American to be president (1924-29), was followed by Mary E. Branch (1930-44) 
and William H. Jones, who became president in 1944."[1] Tillotson College 
was a women's college from 1926-1935.[1] Samuel Huston College developed 
out of an 1876 Methodist Episcopal conference.[2][3] An 1883 agreement 
with the Freedmen's Aid Society led to the development of the college. 
The college was named after Samuel Huston of Marengo, Iowa and the college 
opened in 1900.[2] On October 24, 1952 Tillotson College and Samuel Huston 
College merged to form Huston-Tillotson College.[4] It then became Huston–Tillotson 
University on February 28, 2005.[5] Before the merger, future baseball 
legend Jackie Robinson accepted an offer from his old friend and pastor 
Rev. Karl Downs [6] who was president of the college, to be the athletic 
director at Samuel Huston College, then of the Southwestern Athletic Conference 
(SWAC).[7] Before joining the Kansas City Monarchs, Robinson coached the 
school's basketball team for the 1944–45 season. As a fledgling program, 
few students tried out for the basketball team, and Robinson even resorted 
to inserting himself into the lineup for exhibition games. Although his 
teams were outmatched by opponents, Robinson was respected as a disciplinarian 
coach, and drew the admiration of, among others, Langston University basketball 
player Marques Haynes, a future member of the Harlem Globetrotters.[7] 
Huston–Tillotson University's campus is located at the site of the former 
Tillotson College on a land feature formerly known to local residents as 
Bluebonnet Hill. The 24-acre (9.7 ha) campus is located in East Austin, 
between 7th and 11th streets near I-35 and downtown Austin. Most of the 
buildings on campus follow the same nomenclature as the name of the university, 
with hyphens denoting the importance of the contributions of individuals 
from both colleges before the merger. The Anthony and Louise Viaer Alumni 
Hall (formerly known as the Old Administration Building) is listed on the 
National Register of Historic Places. In Fall 2015, the student body was 
57% female and 43% male. 68% identified as Black, 22% identified as Hispanic, 
6% identified as Non-Hispanic White, and the remaining 4% identified with 
other ethnicity or racial groups.[8] Huston–Tillotson teams, nicknamed 
athletically as the Rams, are part of the National Association of Intercollegiate 
Athletics (NAIA), primarily competing in the Red River Athletic Conference 
(RRAC). Men's sports include baseball, basketball, soccer and track & field; 
while women's sports include basketball,soccer, softball, track & field
