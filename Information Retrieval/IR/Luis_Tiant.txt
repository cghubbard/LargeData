Luis Clemente Tiant Vega (Spanish pronunciation: [ˈlwis ˈtjant]), born 
November 23, 1940, is a former Major League Baseball (MLB) right-handed 
starting pitcher. He pitched 19 years primarily for the Cleveland Indians 
and the Boston Red Sox. He became a member of the Boston Red Sox Hall of 
Fame in 1997. Tiant compiled a 229–172 record with 2416 strikeouts, a 3.30 
ERA, 187 complete games, and 49 shutouts in 3,486.1 innings. He was an 
All-Star for three seasons and 20-game winner for four seasons. He was 
the American League (AL) ERA leader in 1968 and 1972. He also was the AL 
leader in strikeouts for 9-innings in 1967 and the AL leader in shutouts 
in 1966, 68, and 74. In 2014, Tiant appeared for the second time as a candidate 
on the National Baseball Hall of Fame's Golden Era Committee election ballot[1] 
for possible Hall of Fame consideration for 2015 which required 12 votes. 
Tiant and the other candidates including two other former players from 
Cuba, Minnie Miñoso and Tony Oliva, all missed getting elected with three 
(3) votes or less.[2] The Committee meets and votes on ten selected candidates 
from the 1947 to 1972 era every three years.[3] Tiant is the only child 
of Luis Tiant, Sr. and Isabel Vega. From 1926 through 1948, the senior 
Tiant was a great left-handed pitcher for the Negro League's New York Cubans 
during the summer and the Cuban professional league's Cienfuegos in the 
winter, his heroics being followed by hundreds of thousands of Cubans. 
Luis, Jr. followed in his father's footsteps at an early age, joining both 
the local Little and Juvenile baseball leagues until he starred for the 
Havana team and was picked up for the Cuban Juvenile League All-Star team 
in 1957. His talent was recognized by former Cleveland Indians All-Star, 
Bobby Ávila, who was scouting for talent in Cuba. Avila recommended him 
to the Mexico City Tigers of the Mexican League. Tiant was signed for $150 
a month, and for the next three years he divided his time between the Tigers 
and the Havana Sugar Kings in the International League. At the end of the 
summer of 1961, and under Avila's recommendation, Cleveland purchased Tiant's 
contract for $35,000. But with the rise of Fidel Castro's regime in his 
native Cuba—specifically, after heightened tensions following the US-sponsored 
Bay of Pigs invasion in April of that year—it was impossible for Tiant 
to return home. He would not see his parents for 14 years. Tiant progressed 
through the Indians' farm system beginning in 1962 with Charleston of the 
Eastern League, then on to Burlington, N.C., where he was one of the best 
pitchers in the Carolina League in 1963 and Portland, Oregon, in 1964. 
Tiant recalled that at Charleston, "I couldn't speak very good English 
but I understand racism. They treated me like a dog, but when I got to 
Portland, I didn't have any problems " (Oregonian, September 6, 2010). 
After a 15–1 record at Triple-A Portland which included a no-hitter and 
a one-hitter in consecutive starts, Tiant was recalled by the Indians. 
On July 19, 1964, Tiant debuted in the major leagues for the Cleveland 
Indians with a four-single, 11 strikeout, 3–0 shutout victory against the 
defending AL Champion New York Yankees at Yankee Stadium. The losing pitcher 
was Whitey Ford. Tiant finished his rookie season with a 10–4 record, 105 
strikeouts, and a 2.83 ERA in 19 games. Tiant broke through in 1968, after 
he altered his delivery so that he turned away from home plate during his 
motion, in effect creating a hesitation pitch. According to Tiant, the 
new motion was a response to a drop in his velocity due to an shoulder 
blade injury.[4] Twisting and turning his body into unthinkable positions, 
Tiant would spend more time looking at second base than he did the plate 
as he prepared to throw. In that season, he led the league in ERA (1.60), 
shutouts (nine, including four consecutive), hits per nine innings (a still-standing 
franchise record 5.30, which broke Herb Score's 5.85 in 1956 and would 
be a Major-League record low until Nolan Ryan gave up 5.26 hits/9 innings 
in 1972), strikeouts per nine innings (9.22), while finishing with a 21–9 
mark. His four consecutive shutouts are matched by only four other pitchers 
in the 50-year expansion era, with Don Drysdale (six, 1968), Bob Gibson 
(five, 1968), Orel Hershiser (five, 1988) and Gaylord Perry (four, 1970) 
being the others. Beside this, opposing hitters batted just .168 off Tiant, 
a major league record, and on July 3 he struck out 19 Minnesota Twins in 
a ten-inning game, setting an American League record for games of that 
length. His 1.60 ERA in 1968 was the lowest in the American League since 
Walter Johnson's 1.49 mark during the dead-ball era in 1919, and was eclipsed 
that season only by National Leaguer (St. Louis Cardinals) Bob Gibson's 
1.12—the lowest ever during the live-ball era. With Sam McDowell, Sonny 
Siebert, and others, the Indians staff led the AL in strikeouts for five 
consecutive years, including a record 1189 strikeouts in 1967, a record 
that would stand for thirty years. After an injury-plagued season in 1969, 
Tiant was traded to the Minnesota Twins in a multi-player deal that brought 
fellow pitcher Dean Chance and third baseman Graig Nettles to the Indians. 
With Minnesota, Tiant began 1970 with six wins, but then he fractured his 
right scapula, essentially ending his season and, some felt, his career. 
He showed some promise in the 1971 spring training, but he was released. 
The Braves signed him to a minor league contract to play with their Triple-A 
Richmond, where he pitched well, and was acquired by the Louisville Colonels, 
a farm team of the Boston Red Sox. He was quickly called back up to the 
majors, and despite struggling through 1971 with a 1–7 record and 4.88 
ERA, he would soon become one of the greatest and most beloved pitchers 
in Red Sox history and an idol in Boston. Becoming known as El Tiante at 
Fenway Park, in 1972 Tiant regained his old form with a 15–6 record and 
led the league with a 1.91 ERA. He would win 20 games in 1973 and 22 in 
1974. Though hampered by back problems in 1975, he won 18 games for the 
American League Champion Red Sox, then excelled for Boston in the postseason. 
In the playoffs he defeated the three time defending World Champion Oakland 
Athletics, allowing only three hits in a 7–1 complete game victory, then 
opened the World Series against the Cincinnati Reds. His father and mother, 
having been allowed to visit from Cuba under a special visa, were in Fenway 
Park that game to watch their son defeat The Big Red Machine in a 6–0 five-hit 
shutout. This was one of the few times when the Reds were shut out in 1975, 
making Tiant's victory even more special. All six Red Sox runs were scored 
in the seventh inning; Tiant led off that inning (the designated hitter 
was not yet in use in World Series play) with a base hit off Don Gullett 
and eventually scored on Carl Yastrzemski's single for the first of those 
six runs. Tiant won Game 4 as well (throwing 173 pitches in his second 
complete game in the series) and had a no-decision in Game 6, which has 
been called the greatest game ever played, after Carlton Fisk's dramatic 
game-winning walk-off home run in the 12th inning. Tiant went 21–12 in 
1976, 12–8 in 1977, and 13–8 in 1978. At the end of the 1978 season, Tiant 
signed as a free agent with the Yankees.[5] Tiant compiled a 21–17 record 
in New York over two seasons from 1979-80. Just after signing with the 
Yankees, Tiant did a television commercial for Colonial Brand Yankee Franks. 
The commercial ended with Tiant, in his thick Cuban accent saying, "It's 
great to be with a wiener (winner)." It was never made completely clear 
if he meant "wiener" or "winner".[6] He also excelled in the Venezuelan 
Professional Baseball League in parts of five seasons spanning 1966–1982, 
while collecting 37 victories, 29 complete games, a 2.27 ERA, and a no-hitter 
in 1971.[7] He gained induction into the Venezuelan Baseball Hall of Fame 
and Museum in 2009.[8] He finished his career with two brief stints for 
the Pirates and Angels. Tiant appeared in an episode of Cheers, "Now Pitching, 
Sam Malone" (first aired January 6, 1983). Sam Malone (a former relief 
pitcher) agrees to do TV commercials, and, in the first, he co-stars with 
and "relieves" Luis Tiant when the latter begins to fail in the commercial. 
He was inducted to the Boston Red Sox Hall of Fame in 1997. Tiant served 
as the head coach for the baseball team at the Savannah College of Art 
and Design from 1998 to 2001, where he posted a record of 55–97 for a .366 
winning percentage Tiant was on the Baseball Hall of Fame ballot from 1988 
to 2002, but never received more than the 30.9% of the votes he received 
in his first ballot year. According to election rules, players were then 
permitted on the ballot for 15 years. He was selected for the new Golden 
Era Committee ballot in 2011 and 2014, but failed to get enough votes from 
the Committee to be elected to the Hall of Fame in 2012 and 2015. The Golden 
Era covers the 1947 to 72 years in baseball and the committee meets and 
votes for ten candidates selected by the historical committee of the Baseball 
Writers' Association of America every three years. He was inducted into 
the Hispanic Heritage Baseball Museum Hall of Fame on July 23, 2002, in 
a pregame on-field ceremony at Fenway Park. Well known for his pitching, 
unique delivery, charisma, and as an avid cigar smoker, he launched a line 
of cigars that he formulated and designed, branding them with his nickname, 
El Tiante. As of 2007, Luis Tiant resides in Southborough, Massachusetts. 
He also works for the Red Sox as a pitching advisor. Tiant is the subject 
of the documentary film "The Lost Son of Havana", produced by Kris Meyer 
and the Farrelly brothers, and directed by Jonathan Hock. It had its world 
premiere on April 23 at the 2009 Tribeca Film Festival, and was promptly 
acquired by ESPN Films. A grassroots effort to get Tiant inducted into 
the Baseball Hall Of Fame has been started on the social media site Facebook.[9] 
Tiant, along with former battery mate Carlton Fisk threw out the ceremonial 
first pitch at Fenway Park before the decisive Game 6 of the World Series 
on October 30, 2013. He was mentioned in the 1977 film The Bad News Bears 
in Breaking Training as his unique pitching motion was imitated by Carmen
