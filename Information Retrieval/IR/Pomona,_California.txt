Pomona is a city in Los Angeles County, California, United States. Pomona 
is located in the Pomona Valley, between the Inland Empire and the San 
Gabriel Valley. As of the 2010 United States Census, the city's population 
was 149,058.[7] The area was originally occupied by the Tongva or Gabrielino 
Native Americans. The city is named for Pomona, the ancient Roman goddess 
of fruit.[8] For Horticulturist Solomon Gates, "Pomona" was the winning 
entry in a contest to name the city in 1875, before anyone had ever planted 
a fruit tree[9] The city was first settled by Ricardo Vejar and Ygnacio 
Palomares in the 1830s, when California and much of the now-American Southwest 
were part of Mexico. The first Anglo-Americans arrived in prior to 1848 
when the signing of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo resulted in California 
becoming part of the United States.[3] By the 1880s, the arrival of railroads 
and Coachella Valley water had made it the western anchor of the citrus-growing 
region. Pomona was officially incorporated on January 6, 1888.[3] In the 
1920s Pomona was known as the "Queen of the Citrus Belt", with one of the 
highest per-capita levels of income in the United States. In the 1940s 
it was used as a movie-previewing location for major motion picture studios 
to see how their films would play to modally middle class audiences around 
the country (for which Pomona was at that time viewed as an idealized example). 
Religious institutions are deeply embedded in the history of Pomona. There 
are now more than 120 churches, representing most religions in today's 
society. The historical architecture of these churches provide glimpses 
of the European church design and architecture from other eras.[9] In 2005, 
Pomona citizens elected Norma Torres, the first woman of Guatemalan heritage 
to be elected to a mayoral post outside of Guatemala.[10] Pomona is an
