Nickname(s): "The City of Roses", "Automotive Capital of Canada"[1] Windsor 
(i/ˈwɪnzər/) is a city in Ontario and the southernmost city in Canada. 
It is located on the southern shore of the Detroit River, directly across 
the river from Detroit, Michigan. Windsor is a major contributor to Canada's 
automotive industry and has a storied history and diverse culture. Prior 
to European exploration and settlement, the Windsor area was inhabited 
by the First Nations and Native Americans. Windsor was settled by the French 
in 1749 as an agricultural settlement. It is the oldest continually inhabited 
European settlement in Canada west of Montreal. The area was first named 
Petite Côte ("Little Coast" – as opposed to the longer coastline on the 
Detroit side of the river). Later it was called La Côte de Misère ("Poverty 
Coast") because of the sandy soils near LaSalle. Windsor's French Canadian 
heritage is reflected in French street names such as Ouellette, Pelissier, 
François, Pierre, Langlois, Marentette, and Lauzon. The current street 
system of Windsor (a grid with elongated blocks) reflects the Canadien 
method of agricultural land division, where the farms were long and narrow, 
fronting along the river. Today, the north-south street name often indicates 
the name of the family that at one time farmed the land where the street 
is now located. The street system of outlying areas is consistent with 
the British system for granting land concessions. There is a significant 
French-speaking minority in Windsor and the surrounding area, particularly 
in the Lakeshore, Tecumseh and LaSalle areas. In 1794, after the American 
Revolution, the settlement of "Sandwich" was founded. It was later renamed 
Windsor, after the town in Berkshire, England. The Sandwich neighbourhood 
on Windsor's west side is home to some of the oldest buildings in the city, 
including Mackenzie Hall, originally built as the Essex County Courthouse 
in 1855. Today, this building functions as a community centre. The oldest 
building in the city is the Duff-Baby House built in 1792. It is owned 
by Ontario Heritage Trust and houses government offices. The François Baby 
House in downtown Windsor was built in 1812 and houses Windsor's Community 
Museum, dedicated to local history. The City of Windsor was the site of 
the Battle of Windsor during the Upper Canada Rebellion in 1838. It was 
also a part of the Patriot War, later that year. Windsor was established 
as a village in 1854 (the same year the village was connected to the rest 
of Canada by the Grand Trunk Railway/Canadian National Railway), then became 
a town in 1858, and ultimately gained city status in 1892. The Windsor 
Police Service was established on July 1, 1867. A fire consumed much of 
Windsor's downtown core on October 12, 1871, destroying over 100 buildings.[6] 
Sandwich, Ford City and Walkerville were separate legal entities (towns) 
in their own right until 1935. They are now historic neighbourhoods of 
Windsor. Ford City was officially incorporated as a village in 1912; it 
became a town in 1915, and a city in 1929. Walkerville was incorporated 
as a town in 1890. Sandwich was established in 1817 as a town with no municipal 
status. It was incorporated as a town in 1858 (the same year as neighbouring 
Windsor). These three towns were annexed by Windsor in 1935. The nearby 
villages of Ojibway and Riverside were incorporated in 1913 and 1921 respectively. 
Both were annexed by Windsor in 1966.[7] During the 1920s alcohol prohibition 
was enforced in Michigan while alcohol was legal in Ontario. Rum-running 
in Windsor was a common practice during that time. On October 25, 1960, 
a massive gas explosion destroyed the building housing the Metropolitan 
Store on Ouellette Avenue. Ten people were killed and at least one hundred 
injured.[8] The 45th anniversary of the event was commemorated by the Windsor 
Star on October 25, 2005. It was featured on History Television's Disasters 
of the Century. The Windsor Star Centennial Edition in 1992 covered the 
city's past, its success as a railway centre, and its contributions to 
World War I and World War II fighting efforts. It also recalled the naming 
controversy in 1892 when the town of Windsor aimed to become a city. The 
most popular names listed in the naming controversy were "South Detroit", 
"The Ferry" (from the ferries that linked Windsor to Detroit), Windsor, 
and Richmond (the runner-up in popularity). Windsor was chosen to promote 
the heritage of new English settlers in the city and to recognize Windsor 
Castle in Berkshire, England. However, Richmond was a popular name used 
until the Second World War, mainly by the local post office. Windsor has 
a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification Dfa) with four 
distinct seasons.[9][10] The mean annual temperature is 9.9 °C (50 °F), 
among the warmest in Canada primarily due to its hot summers. Some locations 
in coastal and lower mainland British Columbia have a slightly higher mean 
annual temperature due to milder winter conditions there. The coldest month 
is January and the warmest month is July. The coldest temperature ever 
recorded in Windsor was −32.8 °C (−27.0 °F) on January 29, 1873[11] and 
the warmest was 40.2 °C (104.4 °F) on June 25, 1988.[12] Summers are hot 
and humid,[10] with a July mean temperature of 23.0 °C (73 °F) although 
the humidex reaches 30.0 °C (86.0 °F) or above 70 times in an average summer.[13] 
Thunderstorms are common during summer and occur on average 32 days per 
year.[10][13] Winters are generally mild with occasional cold periods.[10] 
The mean temperature in January is −3 °C (27 °F).[13] Windsor is not located 
in the traditional lake-effect snowbelts but does occasionally see lake-effect 
snow that originates over Lake Michigan. Snow cover is intermittent throughout 
the winter; on average there are 53 days each year with snow on the ground. 
There are typically three to five major snowfalls each winter. Windsor 
has the highest number of days per year with lightning, haze, and daily 
maximum temperatures over 30 °C (86 °F) of cities in Canada.[14] Windsor 
is also home to eastern Canada's warmest fall, with the highest mean temperatures 
for the months of September, October and November.[14] Precipitation is 
generally well-distributed throughout the year. There are on average 2,261 
sunshine hours per year in Windsor.[15] As the Canadian city with the highest 
number of days including severe thunderstorms and lightning, Windsor has 
historically been subject to tornadic activity. The strongest and deadliest 
tornado to touch down in Windsor was an F4 in 1946.[23] Windsor was the 
only Canadian city to experience a tornado during the 1974 Super Outbreak, 
an F3 which killed nine people when it destroyed the Windsor Curling Club. 
The city was grazed by the 1997 Southeast Michigan tornado outbreak with 
one tornado (an F1) forming east of the city. Tornadoes have been recorded 
crossing the Detroit River (in 1946 and 1997), and waterspouts are regularly 
seen over Lake St. Clair and Lake Erie especially in autumn. On April 25, 
2009, an F0 tornado briefly touched down in the eastern part of the city, 
causing minor damage to nearby buildings, most notably a CUPE union hall.[24] 
Two tornados (one F1 and one F2) touched down in the evening of August 
24, 2016, causing damage in parts of Windsor as well as Lasalle.[25] Respiratory 
illnesses that are associated with pollution are more prevalent here than 
elsewhere in Canada as Windsor is downwind from several strong polluters, 
notably coal-burning power plants in the United States.[26] The Weather 
Network has designated Windsor as "the smog capital of Canada."[27] Windsor's 
Citizens Environment Alliance holds a yearly art event entitled Smogfest 
to raise awareness of air quality issues.[28] A 2001 article in Environmental 
Health Perspectives stated that the rates of mortality, morbidity as hospitalizations, 
and congenital anomalies in the Windsor Area of Concern ranked among the 
highest of the 17 Areas of Concern on the Canadian side of the Great Lakes 
for selected end points that might be related to pollution.[29] Ouellette 
Avenue is the historic main commercial street in downtown Windsor. It runs 
north-south, perpendicular to the Detroit River, and divides the city into 
east and west sections. Roads that cross Ouellette Avenue include the directional 
components East and West after their names. Address numbers on east-west 
roads in Windsor increase by 100 for each block travelled away from Ouellette 
Avenue and address numbers on north-south roads increase by 100 for each 
block travelled away from the Detroit River. In areas where the river curves, 
some numbers on north-south roads are skipped. For consistency across the 
city, all address numbers on north-south roads reset at either 600, for 
streets west of Walker road, or 800 for those to the east, where the road 
crosses Wyandotte Street (which roughly parallels the Detroit River). Windsor's 
Department of Parks and Recreation[30] maintains 1,200 hectares (3,000 
acres) of green space, 180 parks, 64 km (40 mi) of trails, 35 km (22 mi) 
of sidewalk, 60 parking lots, vacant lands, natural areas and forest cover 
within the city of Windsor. The largest park is Mic Mac Park, which can 
accommodate many different activities including baseball, soccer, biking, 
and sledding. Windsor has numerous bike trails, the largest being the Ganatchio 
Trail on the far east side of the city. In recent years, city council has 
pushed for the addition of bicycle lanes on city streets to provide links 
throughout the existing trail network. The Windsor trail network is linked 
to the LaSalle Trail in the west end, and is to eventually be linked to 
the Chrysler Canada Greenway (part of the Trans Canada Trail). The current 
greenway is a 42 km (26 mi) former railway corridor that has been converted 
into a multi-use recreational trail, underground utility corridor and natural 
green space. The corridor begins south of Oldcastle and continues south 
through McGregor, Harrow, Kingsville, and Ruthven. The Greenway is a fine 
trail for hiking, biking, running, birding, cross country skiing and in 
some areas, horseback riding. It connects natural areas, rich agricultural 
lands, historically and architecturally significant structures, and award 
winning wineries. A separate 5 km (3.1 mi) landscaped traverses the riverfront 
between downtown and the Ambassador Bridge. Part of this trail winds through 
Windsor Sculpture Park displaying various modern and post-modern sculptures. 
Families of elephants (see picture), penguins, horses, and many other themed 
sculptures are found in the park. Windsor's economy is primarily based 
on manufacturing, tourism, education, and government services. The city 
is one of Canada's major automobile manufacturing centres and is home to 
the headquarters of FCA Canada. Automotive facilities include the FCA Canada 
minivan assembly plant, two Ford Motor Company engine plants, and several 
tool and die and automotive parts manufacturers. Windsor has a well-established 
tourism industry. Caesars Windsor, one of the largest casinos in Canada, 
ranks as one of the largest local employers. It has been a major draw for 
U.S. visitors since opening in 1994 (as Casino Windsor). Further, the 1,150-kilometre 
(710 mi) Quebec City – Windsor Corridor contains 18 million people, with 
51% of the Canadian population and three out of the five largest metropolitan 
areas, according to the 2011 Census. The city has an extensive riverfront 
parks system and fine restaurants, such as those on Erie Street in Windsor's 
Little Italy called "Via Italia", another popular tourist destination. 
The Lake Erie North Shore Wine Region in Essex County has enhanced tourism 
in the region. Both the University of Windsor and St. Clair College are 
significant local employers and have enjoyed substantial growth and expansion 
in recent years. The recent addition of a full-program satellite medical 
school of the University of Western Ontario, which opened in 2008 at the 
University of Windsor is further enhancing the region's economy and the 
status of the university. In 2013, the university completed construction 
of a $112 million facility for its Faculty of Engineering. Windsor is the 
headquarters of Hiram Walker & Sons Limited, now owned by Pernod Ricard. 
Its historic distillery was founded by Hiram Walker in 1858 in what was 
then Walkerville, Ontario. The diversifying economy is also represented 
by companies involved in pharmaceuticals, alternative energy, insurance, 
internet and software. Windsor is also home to the Windsor Salt Mine and 
the Great Lakes Regional office of the International Joint Commission.[citation 
needed] In 2011, the population of Windsor was 210,891 and that of the 
Windsor metropolitan area (consisting of Windsor, Tecumseh, Amherstburg, 
LaSalle and Lakeshore) was 319,246.[34] This represents a decrease of 2.6% 
in the city population since 2006 and 1.3% in the metropolitan area population 
since 2006.[35] During the same period, Ontario grew by 5.7% and Canada 
by 5.9%.[36] Windsor attracts many immigrants from around the world. Over 
20% of the population is foreign-born; this is the fourth-highest proportion 
for a Canadian city. Visible minorities make up 21.0% of the population, 
making it the most diverse city in Ontario outside of the Greater Toronto 
Area.[37][38] From the 2001 Canadian census, Windsor's population was 48.9% 
male and 51.1% female. Children under five accounted for 6.3% of the city 
population compared to 5.6% for Canada. Persons of retirement age (65 years 
and over) accounted for 14.1% of the population in Windsor compared to 
13.0% for Canada. The median age in Windsor is 36.0 years compared to 37.6 
years for Canada.[39] The population of Windsor is chiefly English-speaking. 
In 2009, native speakers of French made up 3.7% of the population.[40] 
Despite the fact that Windsor is separated from Detroit by the just 731.5 
metre wide Detroit River, the city has a low violent crime rate and one 
of the lowest murder rates in Canada. In 2011, the crime severity index 
for the Windsor Metropolitan Area was 62.5, compared to the Canadian national 
rate of 77.6.[41] Of the 5 safest communities in Canada, 4 of them are 
located in the Windsor Metropolitan Area (Amherstburg, LaSalle, Tecumseh, 
and Lakeshore).[42] Windsor has made national headlines for its lack of 
homicides.[43] There were no homicides in the city for a 27-month period 
ending in November 2011. Windsor's history as an industrial centre has 
given the New Democrats a dedicated voting base. During federal and provincial 
elections, Windsorites have maintained its local representation in the 
respective legislatures. The Liberal Party of Canada also has a strong 
electoral history in the city. Canada's 21st Prime Minister Paul Martin 
was born in Windsor. His father Paul Martin (Sr.), a federal cabinet minister 
in several portfolios through the Liberal governments of the 1940s, 1950s 
and 1960s, was first elected to the House of Commons from a Windsor riding 
in the 1930s. Martin (Sr.) practiced law in the city and the federal building 
on Ouellette Avenue is named after him. Eugene Whelan was a Liberal cabinet 
minister and one-time Liberal party leadership candidate elected from Essex 
County from the 1960s to the early 1980s, as well as Mark MacGuigan of 
Windsor-Walkerville riding, who also served as External Affairs, and later 
Justice minister in the early 1980s. Deputy Prime Minister Herb Gray represented 
Windsor as an MP from 1962 through 2003, winning thirteen consecutive elections 
making him the longest serving MP in Canadian history.[44] A bust of Herb 
Gray is located at the foot of Ouellette Avenue near Dieppe Park in downtown 
Windsor. Plans are to name the Windsor-Essex Parkway after him.[45] The 
current mayor of Windsor is Drew Dilkens. Windsor is governed under the 
Council-Manager form of local government and includes the elected City 
Council, mayor, and an appointed Chief Administrative Officer. The city 
is divided into ten wards, with one councillor representing each ward. 
The mayor serves as the chief executive officer of the city and functions 
as its ceremonial head. Day-to-day operations of the government are carried 
out by the Chief Administrative Officer. In August 2009, Windsor City Council 
approved a 10-ward electoral system for the 2010 civic election. Under 
the new plan, voters will elect one councillor in each of the ten new wards. 
The new election map will double the number of wards that have existed 
along unchanged boundaries for 30 years.[46] At the provincial and federal 
levels, Windsor is divided into two ridings: Windsor West and Windsor—Tecumseh. 
The city is currently represented in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario 
by NDP MPPs: Lisa Gretzky (Windsor West), and Percy Hatfield (Windsor—Tecumseh). 
Federally, Windsor West was a longtime Liberal stronghold under Herb Gray, 
while Windsor—Tecumseh has traditionally been a Liberal-NDP swing riding. 
Both ridings are currently represented in the federal Parliament by NDP 
MPs: Brian Masse (Windsor West) and Cheryl Hardcastle (Windsor—Tecumseh). 
Windsor tourist attractions include Caesars Windsor, a lively downtown 
club scene, Little Italy, the Windsor Symphony Orchestra, the Art Gallery 
of Windsor, the Odette Sculpture Park, Adventure Bay Water Park, and Ojibway 
Park. As a border settlement, Windsor was a site of conflict during the 
War of 1812, a major entry point into Canada for refugees from slavery 
via the Underground Railroad and a major source of liquor during American 
Prohibition. Two sites in Windsor have been designated as National Historic 
Sites of Canada: the Sandwich First Baptist Church, a church established 
by Underground Railroad refugees, and François Bâby House, an important 
War of 1812 site now serving as Windsor's Community Museum.[47][48] The 
Capitol Theatre in downtown Windsor had been a venue for feature films, 
plays and other attractions since 1929, until it declared bankruptcy in 
2007. Today, the theatre remains open. The Tea Party is an internationally 
famous progressive rock band which has been based in Windsor since its 
foundation in 1990. Windsor's nickname is the "Rose City" or the "City 
of Roses". The Liebeszauber (Love's Magic) rose has been designated as 
the City of Windsor Rose.[49] Windsor is noted for the several large parks 
and gardens found on its waterfront. The Queen Elizabeth II Sunken Garden 
is located at Jackson Park in the central part of the city. A World War 
II era Avro Lancaster was displayed on a stand in the middle of Jackson 
Park for over four decades but has since been removed for restoration. 
This park is now home to a mounted Spitfire replica and a Hurricane replica. 
Of the parks lining Windsor's waterfront, the largest is the 5 km (3.1 mi) 
stretch overlooking the Detroit skyline. It extends from the Ambassador 
Bridge to the Hiram Walker Distillery. The western portion of the park 
contains the Windsor Sculpture Park which features over 30 large-scale 
contemporary sculptures for public viewing, along with the Canadian Vietnam 
Veterans Memorial. The central portion contains Dieppe Gardens, Civic Terrace 
and Festival Plaza, and the eastern portion is home to the Bert Weeks Memorial 
Gardens. Further east along the waterfront is Coventry Gardens, across 
from Detroit's Belle Isle. The focal point of this park is the Charles 
Brooks Memorial Peace Fountain which floats in the Detroit River and has 
a coloured light display at night. The fountain is the largest of its kind 
in North America and symbolizes the peaceful relationship between Canada 
and the United States. Each summer, Windsor co-hosts the two-week-long 
Windsor-Detroit International Freedom Festival, which culminates in a gigantic 
fireworks display that celebrates Canada Day and US Independence Day. The 
fireworks display is among the world's largest and is held on the final 
Monday in June over the Detroit River between the two downtowns. Each year, 
the event attracts over a million spectators to both sides of the riverfront. 
Windsor and Detroit also jointly cohost the annual Detroit Windsor International 
Film Festival, while festivals exclusive to Windsor include Multicultural 
Council of Windsor and Essex County Carrousel by the River and Carrousel 
Around the City, Bluesfest International Windsor and Windsor Pride. Following 
the 2008 Red Bull Air Race World Championship in Detroit, Michigan, Windsor 
successfully put in a bid to become the first Canadian city to host the 
event. Red Bull touted the 2009 race in Windsor as one of the most exciting 
in the seven-year history of the Red Bull Air Race World Championship,[50] 
and on January 22, 2010, it was announced that Windsor will be a host city 
for the 2010 and 2011 circuits,[51] along with a select group of major 
international cities that includes Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, Perth, 
Australia and New York City. The event attracted 200,000 fans to the Detroit 
River waterfront in 2009. The Red Bull air races were cancelled worldwide 
for 2011.[50] Windsor has often been the place where many metro Detroiters 
find what is forbidden in the United States. With a minimum legal drinking 
age of 21 in Michigan and 19 in Ontario, a number of 19 and 20-year-old 
Americans frequent Windsor's bars. The city also became a gambling attraction 
with Caesars Windsor's opening in 1994, five years before casinos opened 
in Detroit. One can also purchase Cuban cigars, Cuban rum, less-costly 
prescription drugs, absinthe, certain imported foods, and other items not 
available in the United States. In addition, some same-sex couples from 
the United States chose to marry in Windsor prior to 2015, when same-sex 
marriage was legalized in all 50 U.S. states.[52] Windsor and its surrounding 
area has been served by the Windsor Star since 1888. The regional newspaper 
is the only daily in Windsor and Essex County and has attracted the highest 
readership per capita in its circulation range of any Canadian metropolitan 
newspaper. The Windsor Independent is an alternative newspaper published 
once per month, featuring reviews, news, politics, arts, culture and entertainment. 
Windsor is considered part of the Detroit television and radio market for 
purposes of territorial rights. Due to this fact, and its proximity to 
Toledo and Cleveland, radio and television broadcasters in Windsor are 
accorded a special status by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications 
Commission, exempting them from many of the Canadian content ("CanCon") 
requirements most broadcasters in Canada are required to follow. The CanCon 
requirements are sometimes blamed in part for the decline in popularity 
of Windsor radio station CKLW, a 50,000 watt AM radio station that in the 
late 1960s (prior to the advent of CanCon) had been the top-rated radio 
station not only in Detroit and Windsor, but also in Toledo and Cleveland. 
Windsor has also been exempt from concentration of media ownership rules. 
Except for Blackburn Radio-owned stations CJWF-FM and a rebroadcaster of 
Chatham's CKUE-FM in Windsor, all other current commercial media outlets 
are owned by a single company, Bell Media. The city is home to one campus 
radio station, CJAM-FM, situated on the University of Windsor campus.[53] 
The University of Windsor is Canada's southernmost university. It is a 
research oriented, comprehensive university with a student population of 
16,000 full-time graduate and undergraduate students. Now entering its 
most ambitious capital expansion since its founding in 1963, the University 
of Windsor recently opened the Anthony P. Toldo Health Education & Learning 
Centre, which houses the Schulich School of Medicine & Dentistry. As well, 
with the help of $40 million in Ontario government funding, the University 
has recently finished construction of a 300,000-square-foot (28,000 m2), 
$112-million Centre for Engineering Innovation; a structure that establishes 
revolutionary design standards across Canada and beyond. The university 
is just east of the Ambassador Bridge, south of the Detroit River. Windsor 
is also home to St. Clair College with a student population of 6500 full-time 
students. Its main campus is in Windsor, and it also has campuses in Chatham 
and Wallaceburg. In 2007, St. Clair College opened a satellite campus in 
downtown Windsor in the former Cleary International Centre. In April 2010, 
St. Clair College added to its downtown Windsor presence with the addition 
of its MediaPlex school. Together, they bring over one thousand students 
into the downtown core every day. The college also opened the TD Student 
Centre on the corner of Victoria Avenue and University Avenue in 2012. 
More recently Collège Boréal opened an access centre and small campus to 
their Ouellette avenue location. This small campus offers access to many 
Collège Boréal programmes as well as immigration and integration assistance 
for francophones in the area. Collège Boréal is Windsor's only francophone 
post-secondary institution, providing service for a small, but notable, 
population of Franco-Ontarians within the Windsor-Tecumseh-Belle River 
area. In Spring 2011, it was announced that the University of Windsor would 
move its music and visual art programs downtown to be housed in the historic 
Armouries building and former Greyhound Bus Depot at Freedom Way and University 
Ave E. The move should bring an additional 500 students into the downtown 
core daily. The University is also bringing its School of Social Work to 
the old Windsor Star buildings on Ferry and Pitt Streets, bringing an additional 
1000 students into the downtown. Windsor is home to two International Baccalaureate 
recognized schools: Assumption College School (a Catholic high school) 
and Académie Ste. Cécile International School (a private school). Kennedy 
Collegiate Institute and Vincent Massey Secondary School are renowned in 
Southern Ontario for their notable accomplishments nationally in mathematics 
and computer science. Kennedy was built in 1929 in the central part of 
the city next to Jackson park and is sometimes called the castle because 
of the unique architecture of the gymnasium located at the rear of the 
school. Windsor youth attend schools in the Greater Essex County District 
School Board (prior to 1998, the Windsor Board of Education), the Windsor-Essex 
Catholic District School Board, Conseil scolaire catholique Providence 
and Conseil scolaire Viamonde. Independent faith-based schools include 
Maranatha Christian Academy (JK-12), Académie Ste. Cécile International 
School (JK-12, including International Baccalaureate), First Lutheran Christian 
Academy (JK-8), and Windsor Adventist Elementary School. The non-denominational 
Lakeview Montessori School is a private school as well. The Windsor Public 
Library offers education, entertainment and community history materials, 
programs and services. The main branch coordinates a literacy program for 
adults needing functional literacy upgrading. The local historical archives 
are located here. The Canada South Science City[54] serves the Elementary 
School Curriculum’s Science and Technology component. There are two hospitals 
in Windsor: Hôtel-Dieu Grace Healthcare, formally Hôtel-Dieu Grace Hospital, 
and Windsor Regional Hospital. Hôtel-Dieu Grace Healthcare is the result 
of an amalgamation of Grace Hospital and Hôtel-Dieu in 1994. The merger 
occurred due to the Government of Ontario's province-wide policy to consolidate 
resources into Local Health Integrated Networks, or LHINs. This was to 
eliminate duplicate services and allocate resources more efficiently across 
the region. The policy resulted in the closure of many community-based 
and historically important hospitals across the province. Windsor hospitals 
have formal and informal agreements with Detroit-area hospitals. For instance, 
pediatric neurosurgery is no longer performed in Windsor. The Windsor Star 
reported in July 2007 that Hôtel-Dieu Grace has formally instituted an 
agreement with Detroit's Harper Hospital to provide this specialty and 
surgery for the dozen patients requiring care annually. Leamington District 
Memorial Hospital in Leamington, Ontario serves much of Essex County and, 
along with the Windsor institutions, share resources with the Chatham-Kent 
Health Alliance. Over five thousand Windsor residents are employed in the 
health care industry alone in Metro Detroit. With more work hours and a 
generally higher rate of pay, there is frustration among Windsor hospital 
administration to attract and retain skilled nurses and doctors to work 
in Ontario. The Essex County Medical Society lists family doctors accepting 
patients.[55] Many people who do not seek a family doctor use the region's 
many walk-in clinics for regular medical conditions. Windsor is the western 
terminus of both Highway 401, Canada's busiest highway, and Via Rail's 
Quebec City–Windsor Corridor. Windsor's Via station is the nation's sixth-busiest 
in terms of passenger volumes. Windsor has a municipal highway, E.C. Row 
Expressway, running east-west through the city. Consisting of 15.7 km (9.8 mi) 
of highway and nine interchanges, the expressway is the fastest way for 
commuters to travel across the city. E.C. Row Expressway is mentioned in 
the Guinness Book of Records as the shortest freeway that took the longest 
time to build as it took more than 15 years to complete[citation needed]. 
The expressway stretches from Windsor's far west end at Ojibway Parkway 
east to Banwell Road on the city's border with Tecumseh. The majority of 
development in the city of Windsor and neighbouring town of Tecumseh stretches 
along the water instead of in-land. As a result, there is a lack of major 
east-west arteries compared to north-south arteries. Only Riverside Drive, 
Wyandotte Street, Tecumseh Road, County Road 42/Cabana Road and the E.C. 
Row Expressway serve the almost 30 kilometres (19 mi) from the west end 
of Windsor eastward. All of these roads, especially the E.C. Row Expressway 
are burdened with east-west commuter traffic from the development in the 
city's east end and suburbs further east. There are eight north-south roads 
interchanging with the expressway: Huron Church Road, Dominion Boulevard, 
Dougall Avenue, Howard Avenue, Walker Road, Central Avenue, Jefferson Boulevard, 
and Lauzon Parkway. Traffic backups on some of these north-south roads 
at the E.C. Row Expressway are common, mainly at Dominion, Dougall, Howard, 
and Walker as the land south of the expressway and east of Walker is occupied 
by Windsor airport and there has been little development. Windsor's many 
rail crossings intersect with these north-south thoroughfares. In October 
2008, the Province of Ontario completed a grade separation at Walker Road 
and the CP Rail line. Another grade separation was completed in November 
2010 at Howard Avenue and the CP Rail line. In both cases, the road travels 
under the rail line and both have below grade intersections with an east-west 
street. These were planned as parts of the "Let's Get Windsor-Essex Moving" 
project funded by the Province of Ontario to improve local transportation 
infrastructure. Windsor is connected to Essex and Leamington via Highway 
3, and is well connected to the other municipalities and communities throughout 
Essex County via the county road network. Nearly 20,000 vehicles travel 
on Highway 3 in Essex County on a daily basis. It is the main route to 
work for many residents of Leamington, Kingsville and Essex. Windsor is 
linked to the United States by the Ambassador Bridge, the Detroit–Windsor 
Tunnel, a Canadian Pacific Railway tunnel, and the Detroit–Windsor Truck 
Ferry. The Ambassador Bridge is North America's No. 1 international border 
crossing in terms of goods volume: 27% of all trade between Canada and 
the United States crosses at the Ambassador Bridge. Windsor has a bike 
trail network including the (Riverfront Bike Trail, Ganatchio Bike Trail, 
and Little River Extension). They have become a blend of parkland and transportation, 
as people use the trails to commute to work or across downtown on their 
bicycles. The city is served by Windsor Airport, a regional airport with 
scheduled commuter air service by Air Canada Jazz, Porter Airlines, Westjet, 
and heavy general aviation traffic. Most flights are within Ontario with 
connections to Calgary and season connection to Cuba. The Detroit Metropolitan 
Wayne County Airport is located approximately 40 km (25 mi) across the 
border in Romulus, Michigan and is the airport of choice for many Windsor 
residents as it has regular flights to a larger variety of destinations 
than Windsor Airport.[56] Shuttle buses and cars are within driving distance 
to larger airports like London International Airport, John C. Munro Hamilton 
International Airport and to Canada's busiest airport and international 
hub Toronto Pearson International Airport. The Port of Windsor, which covers 
21.2 km (13.2 mi) of shoreline along the Detroit River is part of the Great 
Lakes/Saint Lawrence Seaway System. Accessible to both Lake freighters 
and ocean-going vessels, the port is the third largest Canadian Great Lakes 
port in terms of shipments. Cargos include a wide range of products such 
as aggregates, salt, grain, fluorspar, lumber, steel, petroleum, vehicles 
and heavy lift equipment.[57] A public transport bus service is provided 
by Transit Windsor, the city-owned bus company, operating 13 fixed bus 
routes with a fleet of 112 vehicles through the city as well as providing 
transportation for many of the city's secondary school students and a service 
to downtown Detroit. Transit Windsor shares its newly constructed $8-million 
downtown Transit Terminal with Greyhound Lines. The new depot opened in 
2007. Current Fare is $3.00 for all riders except children under 5 on regular 
service routes. Tunnel bus fares are $5.00 and both American and Canadian 
currencies are accepted on the tunnel bus.[58] Intercity passenger railway 
service is provided by Via Rail throughout the region.[59] A major and 
controversial issue is the amount of traffic to and from the Ambassador 
Bridge. The number of vehicles crossing the bridge has doubled since 1990. 
However, the total volume of traffic has been declining since the September 
11, 2001, attacks. Access to the Ambassador Bridge is via two municipal 
roads: Huron Church Road and Wyandotte Street. A large portion of the traffic 
consists of tractor-trailers. There have been at times a wall of trucks 
up to 8 km (5.0 mi) long on Huron Church Road. This road cuts through the 
west end of the city and the trucks are the source of many complaints about 
noise, pollution and pedestrian hazards. In 2003, a single mother of three, 
Jacqueline Bouchard, was struck and killed by a truck at the corner of 
Huron Church and Girardot Avenue in front of Assumption College Catholic 
High School, a tragedy argued to be due to a lack of practical safety precautions.[60] 
Windsor City Council hired traffic consultant Sam Schwartz to produce a 
proposal for a solution to this traffic problem. City councillors overwhelmingly 
endorsed the proposal and it was presented to the federal government as 
a "Made in Windsor" solution. Not all of the surrounding residents supported 
the plan. One problem with the plan is that the proposed road would cut 
through protected green spaces such as the Ojibway Prairie Reserve. In 
2005, the Detroit River International Crossing (DRIC — a joint Canadian-American 
committee studying the options for expanding the border crossing) announced 
that its preferred option was to extend Highway 401 directly westward to 
a new bridge spanning the Detroit River and interchange with Interstate 
75 somewhere between the existing Ambassador Bridge span and Wyandotte. 
On April 9, 2010, the City of Windsor, along with local cabinet ministers 
Dwight Duncan and Sandra Pupatello of the Province of Ontario, announced 
that a final decision had been made in the plans to construct the Windsor-Essex 
Parkway, the new Highway 401 extension leading to a future crossing. The 
announcement indicated that the project will be the most expensive road 
ever built in Canada on a per kilometre basis, and included commitments 
to enhance green space design through the use of berming, landscaping, 
and other aesthetic treatments. As part of negotiations with the City of 
Windsor (who threatened legal action in pursuit of more tunneling and green 
space of the route), the province agreed to additional funding to infrastructure 
projects in Windsor-Essex; this includes money for the improvement to the 
plaza of the Canadian side of the Windsor-Detroit tunnel, the widening 
and other improvements of Walker Rd between Division Rd and E.C. Row Expressway, 
and the environmental assessment and preliminary design of a future extension 
of Lauzon Parkway to Highway 401. Windsor has several sister cities: Windsor's 
sports fans tend to support the major professional sports league teams 
in either Detroit or Toronto, but the city itself is home to one professional 
team The Windsor Express of the NBL, is a Canadian professional basketball 
team based in Windsor, Ontario, Canada. The Express are an expansion team 
of the National Basketball League of Canada that began play in the 2012-13 
season, with home games played at the WFCU Centre. On April 17, 2014, the 
Express won their first championship of NBL-Canada against the Island Storm 
in the 7th game of their final series, 121-106.[72] Windsor is also home 
for the following youth, minor league and post-secondary teams. Windsor 
has hosted a round of the Red Bull Air Race World Championship in each 
of 2009 and 2010 (Detroit hosted the race in 2008). The races take place 
on a course of pylons set up on the Detroit River, right over the border 
between Canada and the USA. The 2016 FINA World Swimming Championships
