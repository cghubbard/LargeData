Ryan Andrew Ludwick (born July 13, 1978) is an American former professional 
baseball outfielder. He has played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the 
Texas Rangers, Cleveland Indians, St. Louis Cardinals, San Diego Padres, 
Pittsburgh Pirates, and Cincinnati Reds. His brother Eric also played four 
MLB seasons as a pitcher. Ludwick attended Durango High School in Las Vegas, 
Nevada. Ludwick then enrolled at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV), 
and played for the UNLV Rebels baseball team for three seasons. He was 
named to the Baseball America all-Freshman team in 1997 after batting .354 
with 46 home runs and 109 runs batted in (RBI) and was All-Western Athletic 
Conference in 1999, hitting .381 with 13 home runs and 69 RBI. Ludwick 
had a .363 career batting average at UNLV.[1] Ludwick was chosen in the 
second-round (60th overall) of the 1999 Major League Baseball draft by 
the Oakland Athletics. He was traded to the Texas Rangers before the 2002 
season, along with Gerald Laird, Jason Hart, and Mario Ramos, for first 
baseman Carlos Peña and pitcher Mike Venafro. Ludwick batted right-handed 
and threw with his left hand. In the entire history of Major League Baseball 
through the 2008 season, and including the National Association of 1871-75 
(not currently counted as a major league by MLB), only 57 players who played 
at least half their games at a position other than pitcher batted right 
and threw left.[2] Ludwick made his major league debut with the Rangers 
in 2002, but his season was cut short when he fractured his hip the same 
year, an injury which significantly hampered his career. In 2003, Ludwick 
was traded by the Rangers to the Cleveland Indians for pitcher Ricardo 
Rodríguez and outfielder Shane Spencer. He was designated for assignment 
and sent to Triple-A in June 2005. Ludwick spent the 2006 season playing 
for the Toledo Mud Hens, the Triple-A affiliate of the Detroit Tigers, 
and was named to the International League team for the 2006 Triple-A All-Star 
Game. Ludwick enjoyed great success in the Detroit organization, but due 
to a surplus of outfielders, Detroit did not offer Ludwick a new contract. 
In 2007, Ludwick was invited to spring training by the Cardinals and started 
in Triple-A Memphis. On May 6, 2007, Ludwick was promoted to the Cardinals 
after Preston Wilson went on the DL. In the 29 games preceding Ludwick's 
promotion, he hit .340 with 0 home runs but had 50 RBI at Memphis. His 
fast start in 2008 earned him an everyday player role. Ludwick was named 
to his first All-Star game on July 6 at Yankee Stadium in New York City. 
He won the National League Player of the Week Award for July 27-August 
2. On August 14, Ludwick hit his 29th home run[3] of the 2008 season; this 
broke the record for the most home runs in a season by a player who throws 
left-handed yet bats right-handed previously held by Rickey Henderson.[4] 
Ludwick would go on to win a Silver Slugger Award at the end of the 2008 
season for his offensive performance along with fellow outfielders Matt 
Holliday and Ryan Braun. That year, Ludwick hit 37 home runs, 40 doubles, 
113 RBIs, 3 triples and a solid .299 batting average.[5] After his breakout 
season of 2008, Ludwick started out 2009 with a solid April, posting similar 
figures to his 2008 season by hitting .297 with five home runs, and 19 
RBIs. He was then slowed by a strained right hamstring which placed him 
on the DL for 15 games. After returning from his injury, Ludwick struggled 
with a .200 average during the month of June. He had a productive July, 
hitting .340, with six home runs and a league-leading 28 RBIs, landing 
him NL Player of the Month honors.[6] This gave the Cardinals 3 out of 
the last 4 NL Player of the Month awards, coupled with Albert Pujols's 
awards in April and June. At the end of the 2009 season Ludwick finished 
batting .265 with 22 home runs and 97 RBIs. Ludwick is primarily a right 
fielder, but also gets playing time in left field and occasionally in center 
field. During the 2010 offseason, Ludwick and the Cardinals were able to 
avoid arbitration, reaching an agreement on a one-year contract worth $5.45 
million for 2010.[7] Through mid-June, he batted .451 with runners in scoring 
position, second-best among all MLB players.[8] Additionally, he batted 
.476 with 11 RBIs with runners in scoring position and two out.[9] His 
strong performance with runners in scoring position lead to him being placed 
in the cleanup role on June 14 against the Seattle Mariners. The move paid 
off as he hit a 3-run home run in his first at bat, and went 2-for-4 in 
the game.[10] Ludwick was traded to the San Diego Padres in a three team 
deal on July 31, 2010, which sent starting pitcher Jake Westbrook and minor 
leaguer Nick Greenwood to the Cardinals and Corey Kluber to the Indians.[11] 
Upon his first at-bat back in St. Louis, he received a standing ovation 
from the St. Louis crowd, and Ludwick tipped his cap to the crowd in return. 
His stats took a hit in 2011 due to lack of production at the Padres home 
field, Petco Park. At the end of his tenure as a Padre, Ludwick was hitting 
.238 with 11 home runs and 64 runs batted in and 42 runs scored. He accounted 
for 25.3 percent of the Padres' runs. By comparison, Adrian Gonzalez accounted 
for 23.6 percent of the Padres' runs in 2010.[12][13] In the final hour 
of the 2011 MLB non-waiver trading deadline on July 31, San Diego traded 
Ludwick to the Pittsburgh Pirates for a player to be named later.[14][15] 
On January 16, 2012 Ludwick agreed to terms with the Cincinnati Reds on 
a one-year contract worth $2.5M with an option for a second year in 2013.[16] 
After initially splitting the left field duties with Chris Heisey, Ludwick 
eventually got most of the starts, often batting cleanup in the lineup 
as a right-handed hitter between lefties Joey Votto and Jay Bruce.[17] 
In 125 games, he hit .275/.346/.531 with 26 HR and 80 RBI. Ludwick started 
all 5 postseason games in the NLDS against the Giants, going 6-18 with 
3 HR and 4 RBI. He declined his option on October 31, and became a free 
agent. He re-signed with the Reds to a two-year, $15 million deal with 
a mutual option for 2015 on December 10, 2012.[18] On Opening Day 2013, 
Ludwick tore cartilage in his right shoulder as well as dislocating it, 
requiring surgery.[19] Ludwick was placed on the 60-day disabled list, 
and returned to the Reds on August 12. In 38 games, he hit .240/.293/.326 
with 2 HR and 12 RBI. In the Wild Card game against the Pirates, Ludwick 
went 3-4 with 2 doubles in the loss. Ludwick signed a minor league deal 
with the Texas Rangers on February 4, 2015.[20][21] On March 29, 2015, 
Ludwick was released by the Rangers.[22] On January 21, 2016, Ludwick announced 
his retirement.[23] Ludwick and his wife, Joanie, reside in Georgetown, 
Texas, and have one son, Stetson Tyler. Ludwick has stated that he chose
