The San Francisco Dons is the nickname of the athletic teams at the University 
of San Francisco (USF).[2] The Dons compete in NCAA Division I of the National 
Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) as members of the West Coast Conference 
(WCC), of which USF is a charter member.[3] Athletics at USF dates back 
to its founding in 1855, when founder Anthony Maraschi, S.J. organized 
ball games as recreation for the first students. However, intercollegiate 
competition only dates back to 1907, when then-Saint Ignatius College began 
playing organized baseball, basketball, and rugby against other local colleges 
and high schools. Rivalries with neighboring Santa Clara University and 
Saint Mary's College of California have their origins in this early period. 
Teams were originally known as the "Grey Fog", and red and blue were Saint 
Ignatius College's colors. However, as the college began to develop an 
identity distinct from the high school—the college became the University 
of San Francisco in 1930—it adopted green and gold as its colors in 1927 
and chose the Don as its mascot in 1932. The old Saint Ignatius High School 
later became Saint Ignatius College Preparatory and retained the red and 
blue colors. Three USF alumni participated in the 2016 Summer Olympics 
- Israeli long distance runner Maor Tiyouri, soccer player John Cox and 
synchronized swimmer Mariya Koroleva.[4] The University of San Francisco 
sponsors teams in eight men's and nine women's NCAA sanctioned sports:[5] 
Men's Intercollegiate Sports Women's Intercollegiate Sports 2005 was a 
banner year for the baseball program, as the Diamond Dons finished with 
a 38–18 record (the best in team history), placed eight players in the 
all-conference team and earned Nino Giarrantano coach of the year honors. 
This was followed in 2006 with a 38–21 record, the WCC conference regular 
season championship, and a Top 25 ranking. However, USF lost in the WCC 
conference championship to Pepperdine but still was given an at large berth 
into their first ever postseason. USF did not advance in the tournament 
as they were beaten by the University of Miami, and Manhattan College. 
Future major leaguer Aaron Poreda pitched for the Diamond Dons, finishing 
his freshman 2005 season with a 2.16 ERA, the fifth-lowest in team history 
and third-best in the WCC, and his hits-per-9-innings ratio of 6.48 was 
second-best in the conference.[7][8][9] In 2006 he posted a WCC-best 2.49 
ERA.[7][9] In the NCAA regional he pitched the team to a 5–1 victory over 
No. 6 national seed Nebraska.[9] Poreda was drafted by the Chicago White 
Sox in the first round (25th overall) in the 2007 Major League Baseball 
Draft; at the time, he was throwing a 97 miles per hour fastball.[10][11] 
Nino Giarrantano became head coach in 1998, previously serving as hitting 
coach at Arizona State University. Giarrantano was named 3-time JC National 
Coach of the Year and 2005–2006 WCC Coach of the Year. Since arriving at 
USF, the team has had its best four-year stretch in its program's history, 
104-69 overall since 2004. The Dons' home field is named after Dante Benedetti, 
USF's head coach from 1962 to 1980. Benedetti attended then-Saint Ignatius 
College from 1937 to 1940, during which he lettered in Baseball, Football, 
and Boxing. During his tenure as head coach, he accumulated 373 career 
wins, and has been inducted into the university's athletic hall of fame. 
Also during his tenure as head coach, the university wanted to cut the 
program for financial reasons. However to keep the program alive Benedetti 
agreed to lower his salary. For the remaining 16 years of his coaching 
career he was paid $1 a year. The field is also named after Max Ulrich, 
a benefactor of the University of San Francisco. Since 2006, USF has played 
one game a season at the San Francisco Giants' Stadium, AT&T Park. The 
proceeds of the game go to the Dante Benedetti Foundation, a charity that 
helps under-privileged youth in San Francisco play and learn the game of 
baseball. Over the years of USF's baseball tradition, a number of players 
have been drafted into professional baseball. Of these players, a few have 
had debuts in the Major Leagues: USF is best known for its basketball program. 
The men's basketball team have won three national titles: the 1949 NIT 
under Pete Newell and the 1955 and 1956 NCAA championships under Phil Woolpert. 
. The latter two were led by future National Collegiate Basketball Hall 
of Fame and Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame members Bill Russell 
and K.C. Jones. USF retained its status as a basketball powerhouse into 
the 1970s and early 80s, holding the distinction of being a "major" program 
in a "mid-major" conference (the WCC having declined somewhat in stature 
since the 1960s). It held the number-one spot in the polls on numerous 
occasions. In 1977, led by All-American center Bill Cartwright, the Dons 
went 29–0 and were regarded as the #1 team in the nation in both major 
polls before dropping their last two games. The Dons' prominence in the 
1970s came at a price, however. The NCAA placed the Dons on probation two 
times in the late 1970s. Head coach Bob Gaillard was fired after the first, 
and an in-house inquiry after the second resulted in the firing of his 
successor, Dan Belluomini. It was also well known that basketball players 
got special treatment; many of them were marginal students at best, and 
at least one instance where a player threatened another student was swept 
under the rug by school officials.[12] It was also common for "tutors" 
to take tests and write papers for players.[13] The situation came to a 
head in December 1981, when All-American guard Quintin Dailey assaulted 
a female student. During the subsequent investigation, Dailey admitted 
taking a no-show job at a business owned by a prominent non-sports USF 
donor. The donor had also paid Dailey $5,000 since 1980. Combined with 
other revelations, school president Rev. John Lo Schiavo announced on July 
29, 1982 that he was suspending the basketball program—the first time a 
school had shut down a major sport under such circumstances. The move was 
applauded by several members of the coaching fraternity,[12] as the Dailey 
matter revealed a program that was, in the words of San Francisco Chronicle 
sportswriter Glenn Dickey, "totally out of control."[13] LoSchiavo resurrected 
the program in 1985 under former star Jim Brovelli, who quickly returned 
the program to respectability. He was not able to reach postseason play, 
however, and resigned in 1995. The program has only reached the postseason 
twice since its revival—an NCAA berth in 1998 under Phil Mathews and a 
2005 NIT berth under former coach Jessie Evans. The program regressed the 
next few years, and Jessie Evans was granted a request for a 'leave of 
absence' on December 27, 2007. Basketball coach Eddie Sutton took over 
on an interim basis, needing two wins for a personal milestone of 800 career 
coaching victories. At the time, Bob Knight was the only other Division 
I men's coach to have accomplished the feat. After months of speculation, 
Evans was finally officially fired by USF on March 20, 2008, and a national 
coaching search was launched, including the use of an executive search 
consultant company, DHR International. Rex Walters was named as the Dons' 
head coach on April 14, 2008. Women's basketball also experienced recent 
successes, including appearances in the NCAA women's tournament in 1995, 
1996, 1997, and 2016 and a WNIT berth in 2002. The 1996 season represented 
their best ever, as the women's team made it into the tournament's Sweet 
Sixteen. The team is presently coached by Molly Goodenbour.[14]   Compared 
to local rivals Santa Clara and Saint Mary's, USF's football teams were 
historically not as strong. However, the 1951 Dons entered college football 
lore by fielding a team that would go undefeated and produce three NFL 
hall of famers (Gino Marchetti, Ollie Matson, and Bob St. Clair). However, 
they did not receive any bowl invitations, as the team turned down any 
suggestions that they leave their two black teammates at home at the expense 
of a much-needed bowl bid. Due to the associated financial burden on the 
school that a bowl bid would have alleviated, USF's finest football team 
ever was to be its last in Division I. Though football made a brief comeback 
as a Division II sport during the 1960s and 1970s, USF has not fielded 
a varsity team since. Kuharich, at times, would delegate recruiting responsibilities 
to his freshman coach, Brad Lynn. Lynn had little to offer prospective 
players in the way of scholarship inducements beyond tuition and room and 
board in an old ROTC barracks. However, Lynn would take recruits to the 
highest hill on campus, and would gesture out towards the sweeping panorama 
of San Francisco saying, "THIS is your campus." Only a handful of players 
from that 1951 team had been considered blue-ribbon prospects in high school. 
Two of the team's best players, Toler and guard Louis (Red) Stephens, had 
not even played high school football. Future Hall of Famer Marchetti was 
a high school dropout who had played only sparingly when he was in school. 
The 1951 Dons were honored during the 2008 Fiesta Bowl. Arenivar • Arnoldy

most successful program, earning five national titles, including a co-championship 
with Penn State in 1949. The program's successes came under alumnus Stephen 
Negoesco, who coached from 1962 to 2000 and led the team to 540 wins and 
four national championships (1966, 1975, 1976, 1980). Under Negoesco's 
successor, alumnus Erik Visser, the men's team earned the 2004, 2005 and 
2008 WCC titles. Alejandro Toledo, the former president of Peru, played 
for USF on a partial scholarship. 1971 • 1973 • 1974 • 1975 • 1976 • 1978

national rankings in both 2011–2012. Israeli Olympian Maor Tiyouri competed 
for the team. The men's tennis team, led by Harry Likas, Harry Roche and 
Arthur Larsen, won the 1949 NCAA Men's Tennis Championship. Likas also 
won the 1948 individual men's title. The women's volleyball team has made 
two NCAA tournament appearances: in 2003, under former coach Jeff Nelson, 
and in 2008 under current coach Gilad Doron. The 2008 season saw the Dons 
finish with a Top 25 national ranking, a 22–8 record, and five all-WCC 
players. USF participates in the following club sports: golf, fencing, 
boxing, rifle, tennis, karate, soccer and lacrosse. Rugby, which was one 
of the first varsity sports in school history, is currently a club sport.
