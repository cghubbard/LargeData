Jon Erich Rauch (born September 27, 1978) is an American former professional 
baseball pitcher. At 6 feet 11 inches (2.11 m), he is the tallest player 
in Major League Baseball history.[1] He is also an Olympic Gold Medalist. 
Rauch attended and graduated from Oldham County High School. He grew up 
in Westport, Kentucky. Rauch played college baseball at Morehead State 
University, where he double majored in physics and business. He was also 
a member of the social fraternity Sigma Phi Epsilon, Kentucky Zeta Chapter. 
Rauch, weighing 290 pounds, was drafted in the third round of the 1999 
amateur draft by the Chicago White Sox. He debuted with the White Sox on 
April 2, 2002. In 2002, Rauch's first stint in the big leagues resulted 
in a 6.59 ERA in eight games and six starts. He did not play in the majors 
in 2003, then returned to the majors in 2004 after a strong Triple-A campaign. 
However, against major league batters he again posted a high ERA of 6.23. 
In July 2004, Rauch was traded to the Montréal Expos along with Triple-A 
reliever Gary Majewski for Carl Everett. On August 13, 2004, Rauch hit 
a home run against the Houston Astros off Roger Clemens, making him the 
tallest man ever to hit a home run in Major League Baseball. Despite a 
strong finish to the season in Montréal, Rauch was sent to the minors when 
the Expos moved to Washington. After putting up better numbers in the minors, 
Rauch finished the 2005 season with the Nationals, used mostly as a reliever, 
and going 2-4 with a 3.60 ERA. In 2006, Rauch had his best season, posted 
a 4-5 record, a 3.35 ERA, and appearing in 85 games, second most in the 
NL. In 2007, Rauch led the Major Leagues in appearances with 88. He finished 
the year with an 8-4 record, four saves, and a 3.61 ERA. His eight victories 
led the team in wins, a rarity in baseball for a relief pitcher. On February 
2, 2008, Rauch signed a two-year contract with the Nationals, worth a total 
of $3.2 million.[2] Before being traded, Rauch spent most of the year as 
the closer in place of injured Chad Cordero.[3] Rauch won the first game 
in the history of Nationals Park. On July 22, 2008, Rauch was traded to 
the Arizona Diamondbacks for second base prospect Emilio Bonifacio.[4] 
On August 28, 2009, Rauch was traded to the Minnesota Twins for RHP Kevin 
Mulvey.[5] He appeared in 17 games for the Twins before the end of the 
season, posting a 5-1 record with a 1.72 ERA.[6] On April 2, 2010, Twins 
manager Ron Gardenhire named Rauch the team's closer, replacing the injured 
Joe Nathan.[7] On April 6, 2010 Rauch earned his first save as a Twin with 
a perfect ninth with two strikeouts versus the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim 
in a 5-3 win. Rauch served as the team's closer through August, when the 
Twins acquired Matt Capps. During his time as closer, he saved 21 games 
in 25 opportunities. After the Twins acquired Capps, Rauch returned to 
his previous role as a set-up man and long reliever. On January 17, 2011 
the Blue Jays signed Rauch to a one-year deal worth $3.5M that included 
a club option for $3.75M in 2012.[8] Blue Jays manager John Farrell suffered 
a dislocated jaw while attempting to restrain Rauch from going after umpire 
Alfonso Marquez during a game on July 2, 2011.[9] Both Rauch and Farrell 
were ejected from the game.[10] After pitching in a game against the Seattle 
Mariners on August 15, 2011, Rauch was taken to a Seattle hospital for 
an emergency appendectomy. He was placed on the 15-day disabled list on 
August 16, 2011. At the time of injury, Rauch led the Blue Jays in appearances 
(with 51), posting a 5-4 record with a 4.47 earned run average and 11 saves.[11] 
On December 6, 2011, Rauch agreed to a one-year 3.5 million contract with 
the New York Mets.[12] On February 5, 2013, Rauch agreed to a one-year 
deal with the Miami Marlins.[13] Rauch was designated for assignment on 
May 18.[14] At the time of his designation, Rauch had a 1–2 record with 
an earned run average of 7.56. He was released on May 23, 2013.[15] On 
June 1, 2013, it was announced that the Orioles had signed Rauch to a minor 
league contract.[16] On July 3, Rauch opted out of his minor league contract. 
He went 1-0 with a 2.89 ERA in 10 appearances over 9.1 innings, striking 
out 10.[17] On January 23, 2014, Rauch signed a minor league deal with 
the Kansas City Royals with an invitation to Spring training.[18] He was
