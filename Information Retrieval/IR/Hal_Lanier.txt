As player As manager Harold Clifton Lanier (born July 4, 1942) is a former 
infielder, coach and manager in Major League Baseball. On November 18, 
2014, he was named the first manager in the history of the Ottawa Champions 
Baseball Club of the independent Can-Am League. From 1964 through 1973, 
Lanier played for the San Francisco Giants (1964–71) and New York Yankees 
(1972–73). He is the son of Max Lanier, a former MLB All-Star pitcher. 
In his rookie season Lanier posted a career-high .274 batting average for 
the San Francisco Giants and was selected for the 1964 Topps All-Star Rookie 
team. In 1968, Lanier led NL shortstops in putouts (282) and fielding average 
(.979). After that, he moved from second base to shortstop, and finally 
to third base. He also played in part of two seasons with the New York 
Yankees. In a 10-season career, Lanier was a .228 hitter with eight home 
runs and 273 RBI in 1196 games played. In each of the three seasons from 
1967 to 1969 he ranked last among NL qualifiers in average, on-base percentage, 
and slugging percentage. Following his playing career, Lanier managed in 
the minors and served as third base coach for the St. Louis Cardinals from 
1981–85, including the 1982 World Series and 1985 National League champion 
teams. He then went on to manage the Houston Astros from 1986–88 and had 
a 254-232 win-loss record. In 1986, he was named NL Manager of the Year 
by the BBWA and TSN for leading the Astros to their first Division Title 
since 1980 and the best record (96-66) in team history up to that point. 
A power struggle between Lanier and Astros' general manager Dick Wagner 
in 1987 eventually lead to Wagner leaving the team. In 1988, the Astros 
lost a home game to the San Francisco Giants. As the team prepared to eat 
the post-game meal, take showers, and go home, they received word they 
were wanted back on the field. Lanier brought out the batting cage and 
ordered the team to take batting practice again. Lanier was fired at the 
end of the season. In recent years, Lanier has managed in the independent 
minor leagues. He managed for the Winnipeg Goldeyes in the Northern League 
for several years, then moved to the Can-Am League to manage the Sussex 
Skyhawks. While with the Skyhawks, Lanier led the team to the league championship 
in 2008 over the Quebec Capitales in the Can-Am League Championship Series. 
He left the Skyhawks following the 2009 season to become manager of the 
Normal CornBelters. On December 12, 2012, the Yuma Desert Rats of the independent 
American West Baseball League, announced they had come to terms with Lanier 
to manage the Desert Rats for the 2013 season, however the team folded 
before playing a game. On November 18, 2014, the Ottawa Champions of the 
Can-Am League announced that Lanier would be their manager for the 2015 
season. On September 17, 2016, his team beat the Rockland Boulders 3-1
