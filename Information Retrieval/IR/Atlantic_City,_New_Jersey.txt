Atlantic City is a resort city in Atlantic County, New Jersey, United States, 
known for its casinos, boardwalk and beach. In 2010, it had a population 
of 39,558.[9][10][11][20][21] Located on Absecon Island, it was incorporated 
on May 1, 1854, from portions of Egg Harbor Township and Galloway Township.[22] 
The city borders Absecon, Brigantine, Pleasantville, Ventnor City, West 
Atlantic City and the Atlantic Ocean. Atlantic City was the inspiration 
for the American version of the board game Monopoly, especially the street 
names. Since 1921, Atlantic City has been the location for the Miss America 
pageant. Because of its location in South Jersey, hugging the Atlantic 
Ocean between marshlands and islands, Atlantic City was viewed by developers 
as prime real estate and a potential resort town. In 1853, the first commercial 
hotel, the Belloe House, was built at the intersection of Massachusetts 
and Atlantic Avenues.[23] The city was incorporated in 1854, the same year 
in which the Camden and Atlantic Railroad train service began.[24] Built 
on the edge of the bay, this served as the direct link of this remote parcel 
of land with Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. That same year, construction of 
the Absecon Lighthouse, designed by George Meade of the Corps of Topographical 
Engineers, was approved, with work initiated the next year.[25] By 1874, 
almost 500,000 passengers a year were coming to Atlantic City by rail. 
In Boardwalk Empire: The Birth, High Times, and Corruption of Atlantic 
City, "Atlantic City's Godfather"[26] Nelson Johnson describes the inspiration 
of Dr. Jonathan Pitney (the "Father of Atlantic City"[27]) to develop Atlantic 
City as a health resort, his efforts to convince the municipal authorities 
that a railroad to the beach would be beneficial, his successful alliance 
with Samuel Richards (entrepreneur and member of the most influential family 
in southern New Jersey at the time) to achieve that goal, the actual building 
of the railroad, and the experience of the first 600 riders, who "were 
chosen carefully by Samuel Richards and Jonathan Pitney":[28] The first 
boardwalk was built in 1870 along a portion of the beach in an effort to 
help hotel owners keep sand out of their lobbies. Businesses were restricted 
and the boardwalk was removed each year at the end of the peak season.[29] 
Because of its effectiveness and popularity, the boardwalk was expanded 
in length and width, and modified several times in subsequent years. The 
historic length of the boardwalk, before the destructive 1944 Great Atlantic 
Hurricane, was about 7 miles (11 km) and it extended from Atlantic City 
to Longport, through Ventnor and Margate.[30] The first road connecting 
the city to the mainland at Pleasantville was completed in 1870 and charged 
a 30-cent toll. Albany Avenue was the first road to the mainland available 
without a toll.[31] By 1878, because of the growing popularity of the city, 
one railroad line could no longer keep up with demand. Soon, the Philadelphia 
and Atlantic City Railway was also constructed to transport tourists to 
Atlantic City. At this point massive hotels like The United States and 
Surf House, as well as smaller rooming houses, had sprung up all over town. 
The United States Hotel took up a full city block between Atlantic, Pacific, 
Delaware, and Maryland Avenues. These hotels were not only impressive in 
size, but featured the most updated amenities, and were considered quite 
luxurious for their time. In the early part of the 20th century, Atlantic 
City went through a radical building boom. Many of the modest boarding 
houses that dotted the boardwalk were replaced with large hotels. Two of 
the city's most distinctive hotels were the Marlborough-Blenheim Hotel 
and the Traymore Hotel. In 1903, Josiah White III bought a parcel of land 
near Ohio Avenue and the boardwalk and built the Queen Anne style Marlborough 
House. The hotel was a hit and, in 1905–06, he chose to expand the hotel 
and bought another parcel of land next door to his Marlborough House. In 
an effort to make his new hotel a source of conversation, White hired the 
architectural firm of Price and McLanahan. The firm made use of reinforced 
concrete, a new building material invented by Jean-Louis Lambot in 1848 
(Joseph Monier received the patent in 1867). The hotel's Spanish and Moorish 
themes, capped off with its signature dome and chimneys, represented a 
step forward from other hotels that had a classically designed influence. 
White named the new hotel the Blenheim and merged the two hotels into the 
Marlborough-Blenheim. Bally's Atlantic City was later constructed at this 
location. The Traymore Hotel was located at the corner of Illinois Avenue 
and the boardwalk. Begun in 1879 as a small boarding house, the hotel grew 
through a series of uncoordinated expansions. By 1914, the hotel's owner, 
Daniel White, taking a hint from the Marlborough-Blenheim, commissioned 
the firm of Price and McLanahan to build an even bigger hotel. Rising 16 
stories, the tan brick and gold-capped hotel would become one of the city's 
best-known landmarks. The hotel made use of ocean-facing hotel rooms by 
jutting its wings farther from the main portion of the hotel along Pacific 
Avenue. One by one, additional large hotels were constructed along the 
boardwalk, including the Brighton, Chelsea, Shelburne, Ambassador, Ritz 
Carlton, Mayflower, Madison House, and the Breakers. The Quaker-owned Chalfonte 
House, opened in 1868, and Haddon House, opened in 1869, flanked North 
Carolina Avenue at the beach end. Over the years, their original wood-frame 
structures would be enlarged, and even moved closer to the beach. The modern 
Chalfonte Hotel, eight stories tall, opened in 1904. The modern Haddon 
Hall was built in stages and was completed in 1929, at eleven stories. 
By this time, they were under the same ownership and merged into the Chalfonte-Haddon 
Hall Hotel, becoming the city's largest hotel with nearly 1,000 rooms. 
By 1930, the Claridge, the city's last large hotel before the casinos, 
opened its doors. The 400-room Claridge was built by a partnership that 
included renowned Philadelphia contractor John McShain. At 24 stories, 
it would become known as the "Skyscraper By The Sea." The city became known 
as the "The World's Playground.[32][33] In 1883, salt water taffy was conceived 
in Atlantic City by David Bradley. The traditional story is that Bradley's 
shop was flooded after a major storm, soaking his taffy with salty Atlantic 
Ocean water. He sold some "salt water taffy" to a girl, who proudly walked 
down to the beach to show her friends. Bradley's mother was in the back 
of the store when the sale was made, and loved the name, and so salt water 
taffy was born.[34][35] The 1920s, with tourism at its peak, are considered 
by many historians as Atlantic City's golden age. During Prohibition, which 
was enacted nationally in 1919 and lasted until 1933, much liquor was consumed 
and gambling regularly took place in the back rooms of nightclubs and restaurants. 
It was during Prohibition that racketeer and political boss Enoch L. "Nucky" 
Johnson rose to power. Prohibition was largely unenforced in Atlantic City, 
and, because alcohol that had been smuggled into the city with the acquiescence 
of local officials could be readily obtained at restaurants and other establishments, 
the resort's popularity grew further.[36] The city then dubbed itself as 
"The World's Playground". Nucky Johnson's income, which reached as much 
as $500,000 annually, came from the kickbacks he took on illegal liquor, 
gambling and prostitution operating in the city, as well as from kickbacks 
on construction projects.[37] During this time, Atlantic City was under 
the mayoral reign of Edward L. Bader, known for his contributions to the 
construction, athletics and aviation of Atlantic City.[38] Despite the 
opposition of many others, he purchased land that became the city's municipal 
airport and high school football stadium, both of which were later named 
Bader Field in his honor.[39] He led the initiative, in 1923, to construct 
the Atlantic City High School at Albany and Atlantic Avenues.[38] Bader, 
in November 1923, initiated a public referendum, during the general election, 
at which time residents approved the construction of a Convention Center. 
The city passed an ordinance approving a bond issue for $1.5 million to 
be used for the purchase of land for Convention Hall, now known as the 
Boardwalk Hall, finalized September 30, 1924.[40] Bader was also a driving 
force behind the creation of the Miss America competition.[41] From May 
13 to May 16 in 1929, Johnson hosted a conference for organized crime figures 
from all across America. The men who called this meeting were Masseria 
family lieutenant Charles "Lucky" Luciano and former Chicago South Side 
Gang boss Johnny "the Fox" Torrio, with heads of the Bugs and Meyer Mob, 
Meyer Lansky and Benjamin Siegel, being used as muscle for the meeting. 
The 1930s through the 1960s were a heyday for nightclub entertainment. 
Popular venues on the white-populated south side included the 500 Club, 
the Clicquot Club, and the Jockey Club. On the south side, home to African 
Americans in the racially segregated city, a black entertainment district 
reigned on Kentucky Avenue. Four major nightclubs – Club Harlem, the Paradise 
Club, Grace's Little Belmont, and Wonder Gardens – drew both black and 
white patrons. During the summer tourist season, jazz and R&B music could 
be heard into the wee hours of the morning. Soul food restaurants and ribs 
joints also lined Kentucky Avenue, including Wash's Restaurant,[42] Jerry's, 
and Sap's.[43] Like many older east coast cities after World War II, Atlantic 
City became plagued with poverty, crime, corruption, and general economic 
decline in the mid-to-late 20th century. The neighborhood known as the 
"Inlet" became particularly impoverished. The reasons for the resort's 
decline were multi-layered. First, the automobile became more readily available 
to many Americans after the war. Atlantic City had initially relied upon 
visitors coming by train and staying for a couple of weeks. The car allowed 
them to come and go as they pleased, and many people would spend only a 
few days, rather than weeks. The advent of suburbia also played a significant 
role. With many families moving to their own private houses, luxuries such 
as home air conditioning and swimming pools diminished their interest in 
flocking to the luxury beach resorts during the hot summer. But perhaps 
the biggest factor in the decline in Atlantic City's popularity came from 
cheap, fast jet service to other premier resorts, such as Miami Beach and 
the Bahamas.[44] The city hosted the 1964 Democratic National Convention 
which nominated Lyndon Johnson for President and Hubert Humphrey as Vice 
President. The convention and the press coverage it generated, however, 
cast a harsh light on Atlantic City, which by then was in the midst of 
a long period of economic decline. Many felt that the friendship between 
Johnson and Governor of New Jersey Richard J. Hughes led Atlantic City 
to host the Democratic Convention.[45] By the late 1960s, many of the resort's 
once great hotels were suffering from embarrassing vacancy rates. Most 
of them were either shut down, converted to cheap apartments, or converted 
to nursing home facilities by the end of the decade. Prior to and during 
the advent of legalized gambling, many of these hotels were demolished. 
The Breakers, the Chelsea, the Brighton, the Shelburne, the Mayflower, 
the Traymore, and the Marlborough-Blenheim were demolished in the 1970s 
and 1980s. Of the many pre-casino resorts that bordered the boardwalk, 
only the Claridge, the Dennis, the Ritz-Carlton, and the Haddon Hall survive 
to this day as parts of Bally's Atlantic City, a condo complex, and Resorts 
Atlantic City. The old Ambassador Hotel was purchased by Ramada in 1978 
and was gutted to become the Tropicana Casino and Resort Atlantic City, 
only reusing the steelwork of the original building.[46] Smaller hotels 
off the boardwalk, such as the Madison also survived. In an effort at revitalizing 
the city, New Jersey voters in 1976 passed a referendum, approving casino 
gambling for Atlantic City; this came after a 1974 referendum on legalized 
gambling failed to pass. Immediately after the legislation passed, the 
owners of the Chalfonte-Haddon Hall Hotel began converting it into the 
Resorts International. It was the first legal casino in the eastern United 
States when it opened on May 26, 1978.[47] Other casinos were soon constructed 
along the Boardwalk and, later, in the marina district for a total of eleven 
today. The introduction of gambling did not, however, quickly eliminate 
many of the urban problems that plagued Atlantic City. Many people have 
suggested that it only served to exacerbate those problems, as attested 
to by the stark contrast between tourism intensive areas and the adjacent 
impoverished working-class neighborhoods.[48] In addition, Atlantic City 
has been less popular than Las Vegas as a gambling city in the United States.[49] 
Donald Trump helped bring big name boxing bouts to the city to attract 
customers to his casinos. The boxer Mike Tyson had most of his fights in 
Atlantic City in the 1980s, which helped Atlantic City achieve nationwide 
attention as a gambling resort.[50] Numerous highrise condominiums were 
built for use as permanent residences or second homes.[51] By end of the 
decade it was one of the most popular tourist destinations in the United 
States.[52] With the redevelopment of Las Vegas and the opening of two 
casinos in Connecticut in the early 1990s, along with newly built casinos 
in the nearby Philadelphia metro area in the 2000s, Atlantic City's tourism 
began to decline due to its failure to diversify away from gaming. Determined 
to expand, in 1999 the Atlantic City Redevelopment Authority partnered 
with Las Vegas casino mogul Steve Wynn to develop a new roadway to a barren 
section of the city near the Marina. Nicknamed "The Tunnel Project", Steve 
Wynn planned the proposed 'Mirage Atlantic City' around the idea that he 
would connect the $330 million tunnel stretching 2.5 miles (4.0 km) from 
the Atlantic City Expressway to his new resort. The roadway was later officially 
named the Atlantic City-Brigantine Connector, and funnels incoming traffic 
off of the expressway into the city's marina district and Brigantine, New 
Jersey.[53] Although Wynn's plans for development in the city were scrapped 
in 2002, the tunnel opened in 2001. The new roadway prompted Boyd Gaming 
in partnership with MGM/Mirage to build Atlantic City's newest casino. 
The Borgata opened in July 2003, and its success brought an influx of developers 
to Atlantic City with plans for building grand Las Vegas style mega casinos 
to revitalize the aging city.[54] Owing to economic conditions and the 
late 2000s recession, many of the proposed mega casinos never went further 
than the initial planning stages. One of these developers was Pinnacle 
Entertainment, who purchased the Sands Atlantic City, only to close it 
permanently November 11, 2006. The following year, the resort was demolished 
in a dramatic, Las Vegas styled implosion, the first of its kind in Atlantic 
City. While Pinnacle Entertainment intended to replace it with a $1.5–2 
billion casino resort, the company canceled its construction plans and 
plans to sell the land. The biggest disappointment was when MGM Resorts 
International announced that it would pull out of all development for Atlantic 
City, effectively ending their plans for the MGM Grand Atlantic City.[55][56] 
In 2006, Morgan Stanley purchased 20 acres (8.1 ha) directly north of the 
Showboat Atlantic City Hotel and Casino for a new $2 billion plus casino 
resort.[57] Revel Entertainment Group was named as the project's developer 
for the Revel Casino. Revel was hindered with many problems, the biggest 
setback occurring in April 2010 when Morgan Stanley, the owner of 90% of 
Revel Entertainment Group, decided to discontinue funding for continued 
construction and put its stake in Revel up for sale. Early in 2010 the 
New Jersey state legislature passed a bill offering tax incentives to attract 
new investors and complete the job, but a poll by Fairleigh Dickinson University's 
PublicMind released in March 2010 showed that 60% of voters opposed the 
legislation, and two of three of those who opposed it "strongly" opposed 
it.[58][59] Ultimately, Governor Chris Christie offered Revel $261 million 
in state tax credits to assist the casino once it opened.[60] As of March 
2011[update], Revel had completed all of the exterior work and had continued 
work on the interior after finally receiving the funding necessary to complete 
construction. It had a soft opening in April 2012, and was fully open by 
May 2012. Ten months later, in February 2013, after serious losses and 
a write-down in the value of the resort from $2.4 billion to $450 million, 
Revel filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. It was restructured but still could 
not carry on and re-entered bankruptcy on June 19, 2014. It was put up 
for sale, however as no suitable bids were received the resort closed its 
doors on September 2, 2014.[61] In the wake of the closures and declining 
revenue from casinos, Governor Christie said in September 2014 that the 
state would consider a 2015 referendum to end the 40-year-old monopoly 
that Atlantic City holds on casino gambling and allowing gambling in other 
municipalities. With casino revenue declining from $5.2 billion in 2006 
to $2.9 billion in 2013, the state saw a drop in money from its 8% tax 
on those earnings, which is used to fund programs for senior citizens and 
the disabled.[62] "Superstorm Sandy" struck Atlantic City on October 29, 
2012, causing flooding and power-outages but left minimal damage to any 
of the tourist areas including the Boardwalk and casino resorts, despite 
widespread belief that the city's boardwalk had been destroyed. The source 
of the misinformation was a widely circulated photograph of a damaged section 
of the Boardwalk that was slated for repairs, prior to the storm, and incorrect 
news reports at the time of the disaster.[63] The storm produced an all-time 
record low barometric pressure reading of 943 mb (27.85") for not only 
Atlantic City, but the state of New Jersey.[64] According to the United 
States Census Bureau, the city had a total area of 17.037 square miles 
(44.125 km2), including 10.747 square miles (27.835 km2) of land and 6.290 
square miles (16.290 km2) of water (36.92%).[2][3] The city is located 
on 8.1-mile (13.0 km) long Absecon Island, along with Ventnor City, Margate 
City and Longport to the southwest.[65] Unincorporated communities, localities 
and place names located partially or completely within the city include 
Chelsea, City Island, Great Island and Venice Park.[66] Atlantic City has 
a humid subtropical climate (Köppen Cfa), with some maritime moderation, 
especially during the summer. Summers are typically warm and humid with 
a July daily average of 75.6 °F (24.2 °C). During this time, the city gets 
a sea breeze off the ocean that often makes daytime temperatures much cooler 
than inland areas, making Atlantic City a prime place for beating the summer 
heat from June through September. Average highs even just a few miles west 
of Atlantic City exceed 85 °F (29 °C) in July. Near the coast, temperatures 
reach or exceed 90 °F (32 °C) on an average of only 6.8 days a year, but 
this reaches 21 days at nearby Atlantic City International Airport.[67][a] 
Winters are cool, with January averaging 35.5 °F (2 °C). Spring and autumn 
are erratic, although they are usually mild with low humidity. The average 
window for freezing temperatures is November 20 to March 25,[67] allowing 
a growing season of 239 days. Extreme temperatures range from −9 °F (−23 °C) 
on February 9, 1934 to 104 °F (40 °C) on August 7, 1918.[b] Annual precipitation 
is 40 inches (1,020 mm) which is fairly spread throughout the year. Owing 
to its proximity to the Atlantic Ocean and its location in South Jersey, 
Atlantic City receives less snow than a good portion of the rest of New 
Jersey. Even at the airport, where low temperatures are often much lower 
than along the coast, snow averages only 16.5 inches (41.9 cm) each winter. 
It is very common for rain to fall in Atlantic City while the northern 
and western parts of the state are receiving snow. At the 2010 United States 
Census, there were 39,558 people, 15,504 households, and 8,558 families 
residing in the city. The population density was 3,680.8 per square mile 
(1,421.2/km2). There were 20,013 housing units at an average density of 
1,862.2 per square mile (719.0/km2). The racial makeup of the city was 
26.65% (10,543) White, 38.29% (15,148) Black or African American, 0.61% 
(242) Native American, 15.55% (6,153) Asian, 0.05% (18) Pacific Islander, 
14.03% (5,549) from other races, and 4.82% (1,905) from two or more races. 
Hispanics or Latinos of any race were 30.45% (12,044) of the population.[9] 
There were 15,504 households, of which 27.3% had children under the age 
of 18 living with them, 25.9% were married couples living together, 22.2% 
had a female householder with no husband present, and 44.8% were non-families. 
37.5% of all households were made up of individuals, and 14.3% had someone 
living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size 
was 2.50 and the average family size was 3.34.[9] In the city, 24.6% of 
the population were under the age of 18, 10.2% from 18 to 24, 26.8% from 
25 to 44, 25.8% from 45 to 64, and 12.7% who were 65 years of age or older. 
The median age was 36.3 years. For every 100 females there were 96.2 males. 
For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 94.4 males.[9] The Census 
Bureau's 2006–10 American Community Survey showed that (in 2010 inflation-adjusted 
dollars) median household income was $30,237 (with a margin of error of 
+/- $2,354) and the median family income was $35,488 (+/- $2,607). Males 
had a median income of $32,207 (+/- $1,641) versus $29,298 (+/- $1,380) 
for females. The per capita income for the city was $20,069 (+/- $2,532). 
About 23.1% of families and 25.3% of the population were below the poverty 
line, including 36.6% of those under age 18 and 16.8% of those age 65 or 
over.[83] As of the 2000 United States Census[17] there were 40,517 people, 
15,848 households, and 8,700 families residing in the city. The population 
density was 3,569.8 people per square mile (1,378.3/km2). There were 20,219 
housing units at an average density of 1,781.4 per square mile (687.8/km2). 
The racial makeup of the city was 44.16% black or African American, 26.68% 
White, 0.48% Native American, 10.40% Asian, 0.06% Pacific Islander, 13.76% 
other races, and 4.47% from two or more races. 24.95% of the population 
were Hispanic or Latino of any race. 19.44% of the population was non-Hispanic 
whites.[81][82] There were 15,848 households out of which 27.7% had children 
under the age of 18 living with them, 24.8% were married couples living 
together, 23.2% had a female householder with no husband present, and 45.1% 
were non-families. 37.2% of all households were made up of individuals 
and 15.4% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The 
average household size was 2.46 and the average family size was 3.26.[81][82] 
In the city the age distribution of the population shows 25.7% under the 
age of 18, 8.9% from 18 to 24, 31.0% from 25 to 44, 20.2% from 45 to 64, 
and 14.2% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 35 years. 
For every 100 females there were 96.1 males. For every 100 females age 
18 and over, there were 93.2 males.[81][82] The median income for a household 
in the city was $26,969, and the median income for a family was $31,997. 
Males had a median income of $25,471 versus $23,863 for females. The per 
capita income for the city was $15,402. About 19.1% of families and 23.6% 
of the population were below the poverty line, including 29.1% of those 
under age 18 and 18.9% of those age 65 or over.[81][82] As of September 
2014, the greater Atlantic City area has one of the highest unemployment 
rates in the country at 13.8%, out of labor force of around 141,000.[84] 
In July 2010, Governor Chris Christie announced that a state takeover of 
the city and local government "was imminent". Comparing regulations in 
Atlantic City to an "antique car", Atlantic City regulatory reform is a 
key piece of Governor Chris Christie's plan, unveiled on July 22, to reinvigorate 
an industry mired in a four-year slump in revenue and hammered by fresh 
competition from casinos in the surrounding states of Delaware, Pennsylvania, 
Connecticut, and more recently, Maryland. In January 2011, Chris Christie 
announced the creation of the Atlantic City Tourism District, a state-run 
district encompassing the boardwalk casinos, the marina casinos, the Atlantic 
City Outlets, and Bader Field.[85][86] Fairleigh Dickinson University's 
PublicMind poll surveyed New Jersey voters' attitudes on the takeover. 
The February 16, 2011 survey showed that 43% opposed the measure while 
29% favored direct state oversight.[87] Interestingly, the poll also found 
that even South Jersey voters expressed opposition to the plan; 40% reported 
they opposed the measure and 37% reported they were in favor of it.[87] 
On April 29, 2011, the boundaries for the state-run tourism district were 
set. The district would include heavier police presence, as well as beautification 
and infrastructure improvements. The CRDA would oversee all functions of 
the district and make changes to attract new businesses and attractions. 
New construction will be ambitious and may resort to eminent domain.[88][89] 
The tourism district would comprise several key areas in the city; the 
Marina District, Ducktown, Chelsea, South Inlet, Bader Field, and Gardner's 
Basin. Also included are 10 roadways that lead into the district, including 
several in the city's northern end, or North Beach. Gardner's Basin, which 
is home to the Atlantic City Aquarium, was initially left out of the tourism 
district, while a residential neighborhood in the Chelsea section was removed 
from the final boundaries, owing to complaints from the city. Also, the 
inclusion of Bader Field in the district was controversial and received 
much scrutiny from mayor Lorenzo Langford, who cast the lone "no" vote 
on the creation of the district citing its inclusion.[90] Atlantic City 
is considered the "Gambling Capital of the East Coast", and currently has 
seven large casinos and several smaller ones. In 2011, New Jersey's then 
12 casinos employed approximately 33,000 employees, had 28.5 million visitors, 
made $3.3 billion in gaming revenue, and paid $278 million in taxes.[91] 
They are regulated by the New Jersey Casino Control Commission[92] and 
the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement.[93] In the wake of the United 
States' economic downturn and the legalization of gambling in adjacent 
and nearby states (including Delaware, Maryland, New York, and Pennsylvania), 
four casino closures took place in 2014: the Atlantic Club on January 13; 
the Showboat on August 31;[94] the Revel, which was Atlantic City's second-newest 
casino, on September 2;[95] and Trump Plaza, which originally opened in 
1984, and was the poorest performing casino in the city, on September 16.[96] 
Executives at Trump Entertainment Resorts, whose sole remaining property 
at the time was the Trump Taj Mahal, said in 2013 that they were considering 
the option of selling the Taj and winding down and exiting the gaming and 
hotel business.[97] Trump Taj Mahal closed October 10, 2016 after failing 
to come to terms with union workers.[98] Caesars Entertainment executives 
have been reconsidering the future of their three remaining Atlantic City 
properties (Bally's, Caesars and Harrah's), in the wake of a Chapter 11 
bankruptcy filing by the company's casino operating unit in January 2015.[99] 
The Atlantic City Boardwalk opened on June 26, 1870,[108] a temporary structure 
erected for the summer season that was the first boardwalk in the United 
States.[109][110] The Boardwalk starts at Absecon Inlet in the north and 
runs along the beach south-west to the city limit 4 miles (6.4 km) away 
then continues 1 1⁄2 miles (2.4 km) into Ventnor City. Casino/hotels front 
the boardwalk, as well as retail stores, restaurants, and amusements. Notable 
attractions include the Boardwalk Hall, House of Blues, and the Ripley's 
Believe It or Not! museum. In October 2012, Hurricane Sandy destroyed the 
northern part of the boardwalk fronting Absecon Inlet, in the residential 
section called South Inlet. The oceanfront boardwalk in front of the Atlantic 
City casinos survived the storm with minimal damage.[111][112] The Boardwalk 
has been home to several piers over the years. The first pier, Ocean Pier, 
was built in 1882.[113] It eventually fell into disrepair and was demolished. 
Another famous pier built during that time was Steel Pier, opened in 1898, 
which once billed itself as "The Showplace of the Nation". It now operates 
as an amusement pier across from the Trump Taj Mahal. Captain John Lake 
Young opened "Young's Million Dollar Pier" as an arcade hall in 1903, and 
on the seaward side "erected a marble mansion", fronted by a formal garden, 
with lighting and landscaping designed by Young's longtime friend Thomas 
Alva Edison. Young's Million Dollar Pier, Atlantic City's largest amusement 
pier during its time",[28] was transformed into a shopping mall in the 
1980s, known as "Shops on Ocean One". In 2006, the Ocean One mall was bought, 
renovated and re-branded as "The Pier Shops at Caesars" and in 2015, it 
was renamed "Playground Pier." Garden Pier, located opposite Revel Atlantic 
City, once housed a movie theater, and is now home to the Atlantic City 
Historical Museum.[114][115] Two other piers, an amusement pier named Steeplechase 
Pier and a Heinz 57-owned pier named Heinz Pier were destroyed in the 1944 
Great Atlantic Hurricane.[116] Steeplechase was rebuilt after the hurricane, 
and survived into the casino era. The "Steeplechase Pier Heliport" on Steel 
Pier is named in its honor.[117] The last of the four piers still standing 
is Schiff's Central Pier, which is the only one still offering the same 
attractions it did when it opened – a few stores, and the playcade, having 
reopened in 1990 after an $8 million renovation.[118] Atlantic City has 
many different shopping districts and malls, many of which are located 
inside or adjacent to the casino resorts. Several smaller themed retail 
and dining areas in casino hotels include the Borgata Shops and The Shoppes 
at Water Club inside the Borgata, the Waterfront Shops inside of Harrah's, 
Spice Road inside the Trump Taj Mahal, while Resorts Casino Hotel has a 
small collection of stores and restaurants. Major shopping malls are also 
located in and around Atlantic City. In Atlantic City, shops include: Boardwalk 
Hall, formally known as the "Historic Atlantic City Convention Hall", is 
an arena in Atlantic City along the boardwalk. Boardwalk Hall was Atlantic 
City's primary convention center until the opening of the Atlantic City 
Convention Center in 1997. The Atlantic City Convention Center includes 
500,000 sq ft (46,000 m2) of showroom space, 5 exhibit halls, 45 meeting 
rooms with 109,000 sq ft (10,100 m2) of space, a garage with 1,400 parking 
spaces, and an adjacent Sheraton hotel. Both the Boardwalk Hall and Convention 
Center are operated by the Atlantic City Convention & Visitors Authority. 
Atlantic City (sometimes referred to as "Monopoly City"[119]) has become 
well-known over the years for its portrayal in the U.S. version of the 
popular board game, Monopoly, in which properties on the board are named 
after locations in and near Atlantic City. While the original incarnation 
of the game did not feature Atlantic City, it was in Indianapolis that 
Ruth Hoskins learned the game, and took it back to Atlantic City.[120] 
After she arrived, Hoskins made a new board with Atlantic City street names, 
and taught it to a group of friends, who ultimately passed in on to Charles 
Darrow, who made some modifications to the game and claimed it as his own 
invention.[121] Marvin Gardens, the leading yellow property on the board, 
is actually a misspelling of the original location name, "Marven Gardens". 
The misspelling was said to have been introduced by Charles Todd and passed 
on when his home-made Monopoly board was copied by Charles Darrow and thence 
Parker Brothers. It was not until 1995 that Parker Brothers acknowledged 
this mistake and formally apologized to the residents of Marven Gardens 
for the misspelling, although the spelling error was not corrected.[122] 
Some of the actual locations that correspond to board elements have changed 
since the game's release. Illinois Avenue was renamed Martin Luther King 
Jr. Blvd. in the 1980s. St. Charles Place no longer exists, as the Showboat 
Casino Hotel was developed where it once ran.[123] The "Short Line" is 
believed to refer to the Shore Fast Line, a streetcar line that served 
Atlantic City.[124] The B&O Railroad did not serve Atlantic City. A booklet 
included with the reprinted 1935 edition states that the four railroads 
that served Atlantic City in the mid-1930s were the Jersey Central, the 
Seashore Lines, the Reading Railroad, and the Pennsylvania Railroad. The 
actual "Electric Company" and "Water Works" serving the city are the Atlantic 
City Electric Company and the Atlantic City Municipal Utilities Authority, 
respectively. Ever since Atlantic City's growth as a resort town, numerous 
attractions and tourist traps have originated in the city. A popular fixture 
in the early 20th century at the Steel Pier was horse diving, which was 
introduced by William "Doc" Carver.[125] The Steel Pier featured several 
other novelty attractions, including the Diving Bell, human high-divers, 
and a water circus.[126][127] Advertisements for the Steel Pier in its 
heyday featured plaster sculptures set upon wooden bases along roads leading 
up to Atlantic City.[128] By the end of World War II, many animal demonstrations 
declined in popularity after criticisms of animal abuse and neglect. Rolling 
chairs, which were introduced in 1876 and in continuous use since 1887, 
have been a boardwalk fixture to this day. While powered carts appeared 
in the 1960s, the original and most common were made of wicker. The wicker 
canopied chairs-on-wheels are manually pushed the length of the boardwalk 
by attendants, much like a Rickshaw.[129] The Absecon Lighthouse is a coastal 
lighthouse located in the South Inlet section of Atlantic City overlooking 
Absecon Inlet.[130] It is the tallest lighthouse in the state of New Jersey 
and is the third tallest masonry lighthouse in the United States. Construction 
began in 1854, with the light first lit on January 15, 1857.[131] The lighthouse 
was deactivated in 1933 and although the light still shines every night, 
it is no longer an active navigational aid.[132] Gardner's Basin, which 
is home to the Atlantic City Aquarium as well as small shops and restaurants, 
is located a short distance north of Absecon Light. Since 2003, Atlantic 
City has hosted Thunder over the Boardwalk, an annual airshow over the 
boardwalk. The yearly event, a joint venture between the New Jersey Air 
National Guard's 177th Fighter Wing along with several casinos, attracts 
over 750,000 visitors each year.[133] While located 2 miles (3.2 km) south 
of Atlantic City in Margate City, Lucy the Elephant has become almost an 
icon for the Atlantic City area. Lucy is a six-story elephant-shaped example 
of novelty architecture, constructed of wood and tin sheeting in 1882 by 
James V. Lafferty in an effort to sell real estate and attract tourism. 
Over the years, Lucy had served as a restaurant, business office, cottage, 
and tavern (the last closed by Prohibition). Lucy had fallen into disrepair 
by the 1960s and was scheduled for demolition. The structure was moved 
and refurbished as a result of a "Save Lucy" campaign in 1970 and received 
designation as a National Historic Landmark in 1976, and is open as a museum.[134] 
Atlantic City is the home of the Miss America competition, however it was 
moved to Las Vegas for seven years before returning. The Miss America competition 
originated on September 7, 1921, as a two-day beauty contest, and it included 
state contestants as well as women from various cities around the country. 
The event that year was called the "Atlantic City Pageant", and the winner 
of the grand prize, Margaret Gorman, took home the 3-foot Golden Mermaid 
trophy. Gorman was not called "Miss America" until 1922, when she re-entered 
the pageant and lost to Mary Campbell.[135] The pageant was initiated to 
extend the tourist season after the Labor Day weekend.[41] The pageant 
has been nationally televised since 1954. It peaked in the early 1960s, 
when it was repeatedly the highest-rated program on American television. 
It was seen as a symbol of the United States, with Miss America often being 
referred to as the female equivalent of the President. The pageant's longtime 
emcee, Bert Parks, hosted the event from 1955 to 1979. At the Atlantic 
City Convention Center, there is an interactive statue of Parks holding 
a crown. When a visitor puts their head inside the crown, sensors activate 
a recorded playback of his "There She Is..." line through speakers hidden 
behind nearby bushes.[136] Since the departure of the Miss America pageant 
from the city, an LGBT event known as the "Miss'd America Pageant" is held 
annually at the Boardwalk Hall. Originally started in 1994 as a fundraiser 
for local LGBT charities, the event features drag queens on the runway 
in a similar manner to the Miss America pageant.[137][138] Since 2010, 
Boardwalk Empire, an American television series from cable network HBO 
set in Atlantic City during the Prohibition era, has cast a new light on 
the city. Starring Steve Buscemi, the show was adapted from a chapter about 
historical criminal kingpin Enoch "Nucky" Johnson (who is renamed "Enoch 
Thompson" in the show) in Nelson Johnson's book, Boardwalk Empire: The 
Birth, High Times, and Corruption of Atlantic City. The series was filmed 
in New York City at various locations that captured Atlantic City's period 
architecture and on a set built to resemble the Atlantic City boardwalk 
in the 1920s.[139] Around the same time of the September 2010 premiere 
of the show, the Press of Atlantic City created Boss of the Boardwalk, 
a 45-minute documentary which premiered on August 21, 2010 on NBC TV-40 
and aired six additional times in the following weeks.[140] After the premiere 
of Boardwalk Empire, interest in Roaring Twenties-era Atlantic City has 
grown. In October 2010, a plan was revealed to renovate the ailing Resorts 
Casino Hotel into a Roaring Twenties theme. The re-branding was proposed 
by current owner Dennis Gomes, and was initiated in December 2010 when 
he took over the casino. The changes accentuate the resort's existing art 
deco design, as well as presenting new 20s-era uniforms for employees and 
music from the time period. The casino also introduced drinks and shows 
reminiscent of the period.[141] The actual building where he lived, The 
Ritz-Carlton, offer tours.[142] In 2011, Academy Bus began a trolley tour 
called "Nucky's Way", a tour bus service that features actors portraying 
Nucky, as well as other characters, as it loops around the city. Nucky's 
Way is the second trolley tour to capitalize off of Boardwalk Empire, after 
The Great American Trolley company started a weekly tour of Atlantic City 
with a Roaring Twenties theme in early June 2011.[143] On August 1, 2011, 
a façade modeled after the set of Boardwalk Empire was unveiled on the 
boardwalk in front of an empty lot at the former site of the Trump World's 
Fair resort. The façade of storefronts, which consists of vinyl tacked 
onto three large sections of plywood, was the brainchild of longtime area 
radio host Pinky Kravitz, who was also a columnist for The Press of Atlantic 
City and host of WMGM Presents Pinky on NBC40.[144] In 2014, it was announced 
that Atlantic City would host two major beach concerts. The two headliners 
were Blake Shelton, which took place on July 31, 2015 and Lady Antebellum, 
which took place on August 3, 2014. On June 22, 2015, it was announced 
that Maroon 5 with special guest Nick Jonas and Matt McAndrew would headline 
on August 16, 2015. A few weeks later, it was announced that Rascal Flatts 
would play the second major beach concert of the summer season on August 
20, 2015, with special guest Ashley Monroe. This concert would be part 
of their Riot Tour. Both concerts charged admission.[145] On November 16, 
2006, Hal Handel, CEO of Greenwood Racing, announced that the Atlantic 
City Race Course in Hamilton Township would increase live racing dates 
from four days per year, to up to 20 days per year. The ShopRite LPGA Classic 
is an LPGA Tour women's golf tournament held near Atlantic City since 1986. 
Atlantic City is one of five municipalities in the state—and the only one 
outside of Cape May County—that offer free public access to oceanfront 
beaches monitored by lifeguards, joining Wildwood, North Wildwood, Wildwood 
Crest and Upper Township's Strathmere section.[146] Atlantic City is governed 
within the Faulkner Act (formally known as the Optional Municipal Charter 
Law) under the Mayor-Council system of municipal government (Plan D), implemented 
by direct petition effective as of July 1, 1982.[7][147] The City Council 
is the governing body of Atlantic City. There are nine Council members, 
who are elected to serve for a term of four years, one from each of six 
wards and three serving at-large. The City Council exercises the legislative 
power of the municipality for the purpose of holding Council meetings to 
introduce ordinances and resolutions to regulate City government. In addition, 
Council members review budgets submitted by the Mayor; provide for an annual 
audit of the City's accounts and financial transactions; organize standing 
committees and hold public hearings to address important issues which impact 
Atlantic City.[148] Former Mayor Bob Levy created the Atlantic City Ethics 
Board in 2007, but the Board was dissolved two years later by vote of the 
Atlantic City Council. As of 2016[update], the Mayor is Don Guardian, whose 
term of office ends on December 31, 2017.[4] Members of the City Council 
are Council President Marty Small Sr. (2nd Ward, 2019), Council Vice President 
Aaron "Sporty" Randolph (1st Ward, 2019), Chuen "Jimmy" Cheng (5th Ward, 
2019), Moisse "Mo" Delgado (At-Large, 2017), Frank M. Gilliam Jr. (At-Large, 
2017), Jesse O. Kurtz (6th Ward, 2019), William "Speedy" Marsh (4th Ward, 
2019), Kaleem Shabazz (3rd Ward, 2019) and George Tibbitt (At-Large, 2017).[149][150][151][152][153] 
Following questions about false claims he had made about his military record, 
Mayor Bob Levy left City Hall in September 2007 in a city-owned vehicle 
for an unknown destination. After a 13-day absence, his lawyer revealed 
that Levy was in Carrier Clinic, a rehabilitation hospital.[154] Levy resigned 
in October 2007 and then-Council President William Marsh assumed the office 
of Mayor[155] and served six weeks until an interim mayor was named. Atlantic 
City is located in the 2nd Congressional district[156] and is part of New 
Jersey's 2nd state legislative district.[10][157][158] New Jersey's Second

state's gaming control board, responsible for administering the Casino 
Control Act and its regulations to assure public trust and confidence in 
the credibility and integrity of the casino industry and casino operations 
in Atlantic City. Casinos operate under licenses granted by the Commission. 
The Commission is headquartered in the Arcade Building at Tennessee Avenue 
and Boardwalk in Atlantic City.[193] The New Jersey Division of Gaming 
Enforcement is a division of the New Jersey Department of Law and Public 
Safety and is responsible for certifying casino gaming revenue, registering 
casino employees and non-gaming vendors, licensing gaming vendors, and 
handling all casino patron complaints.[93] The CRDA was founded in 1984 
and is responsible for directing the spending of casino reinvestment funds 
in public and private projects to benefit Atlantic City and other areas 
of the state. From 1985 through April 2008, CRDA spent US$1.5 billion on 
projects in Atlantic City and US$300 million throughout New Jersey.[194] 
The Convention & Visitors Authority (ACCVA) was in charge of advertising 
and marketing for the city as well as promoting economic growth through 
convention and leisure tourism development. The ACCVA managed the Boardwalk 
Hall and Atlantic City Convention Center, as well as the Boardwalk Welcome 
Center inside Boardwalk Hall and a welcome center on the Atlantic City 
Expressway. In 2011, the ACCVA was absorbed into the CRDA as part of the 
state takeover that created the tourism district.[195] The Atlantic City 
Special Improvement District (SID) was a nonprofit organization created 
in 1992, funded by a special assessment tax on businesses within the improvement 
district. It carried out various activities to improve the city's business 
community, including street cleaning and promotional efforts. In 2011, 
the SID was absorbed by the CRDA; the former SID boundaries would be expanded 
to the include all areas in the newly formed tourism district. Under the 
new structure, established by state legislation, the CRDA assumed responsibility 
for the staff, equipment and programs of the SID. The new SID division 
includes a SID committee made up of CRDA board members and an advisory 
council consisting of the current trustees and others.[196] The Atlantic 
City Fire Department (ACFD) provides fire protection and first responder 
emergency medical services to the city. The ACFD operates out of six fire

of the Philadelphia television market. However, five stations and one repeater 
are licensed in the area. As of May 2010[update], the city had a total 
of 103.67 miles (166.84 km) of roadways, of which 88.26 miles (142.04 km) 
were maintained by the municipality, 1.29 miles (2.08 km) by Atlantic County 
and 5.32 miles (8.56 km) by the New Jersey Department of Transportation 
and 8.80 miles (14.16 km) by the New Jersey Turnpike Authority.[222] The

and the Atlantic City Expressway. Atlantic City is roughly 132 miles (212 km) 
south of New York City by road (via the Garden State Parkway) and 55 miles 
(89 km) southeast of Philadelphia.[223] Atlantic City has an abundance 
of taxi cabs and a local jitney providing continuous service to and from 
the casinos and the rest of the city. Atlantic City is connected to other 
cities in several ways. NJ Transit's Atlantic City Rail Terminal[224] at 
the Atlantic City Convention Center provides service from 30th Street Station 
in Philadelphia through several smaller South Jersey communities via the 
Atlantic City Line.[225] On June 20, 2006, the board of New Jersey Transit 
approved a three-year trial of express train service between New York Penn 
Station and the Atlantic City Rail Terminal. The line, known as ACES (Atlantic 
City Express Service), ran from February 2009 to March 2012. The approximate 
travel time was 2 1⁄2 hours, with a stop at Newark's Penn Station, and 
was part of the casinos' multimillion-dollar investments in Atlantic City. 
Most of the funding for the transit line was provided by Harrah's Entertainment 
(owners of both Harrah's Atlantic City and Caesars Atlantic City) and the 
Borgata.[226] The Atlantic City Bus Terminal is the home to local, intrastate 
and interstate bus companies including New Jersey Transit, Academy and 
Greyhound bus lines. The Greyhound Lucky Streak Express offers service 
to Atlantic City from New York City, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Boston, and 
Washington, D.C.[227] Within the city, public transportation is provided 
by New Jersey Transit along 13 routes, including service between the city 
and the Port Authority Bus Terminal in Midtown Manhattan on the 319 route, 
and service to and from Atlantic City on routes 501 (to Brigantine Beach), 
502 (to Atlantic Cape Community College), 504 (to Ventnor Plaza), 505 (to 
Longport), 507 (to Ocean City), 508 (to the Hamilton Mall), 509 (to Ocean 
City), 551 (to Philadelphia), 552 (to Cape May), 553 (to Upper Deerfield 
Township), 554 (to the Lindenwold PATCO station) and 559 (to Lakewood Township).[228][229] 
The Atlantic City Jitney Association (ACJA) offers service on four fixed-route 
lines and on shuttles to and from the rail terminal.[230] Commercial airlines 
serve Atlantic City via Atlantic City International Airport, located 9 
miles (14 km) northwest of the city in Egg Harbor Township. Many travelers 
also fly into Philadelphia International Airport, Trenton-Mercer Airport, 
or Newark Liberty International Airport, where there are wider selections 
of carriers from which to choose. The historic downtown Bader Field airport 
is now permanently closed and plans are in the works to redevelop the land. 
Atlantic City International Airport is a focus city for Spirit Airlines. 
The airport is also served by Air Canada Express, as well as various scheduled 
chartered flight companies. The AtlantiCare Regional Medical Center is 
a health system based in Atlantic City. Founded in 1898, it includes two 
hospitals; the Atlantic City Campus and the Mainland Campus in Pomona, 
New Jersey. It has Atlantic City's only cancer institute, heart institute, 
and neonatal intensive care unit.[231] South Jersey Industries provides 
natural gas to the city under the South Jersey Gas division. Marina Energy 
and its subsidiary, Energenic, a joint business venture with a long-time 
business partner, operate two thermal power stations in the city. The Marina 
Thermal Plant serves the Borgata while a second plant serves the Resorts 
Hotel and Casino.[232] Another thermal plant is the Midtown Thermal Control 
Center on Atlantic and Ohio Avenues built by Conectiv, which opened in 
1997 and provides chilled water for hotels and other facilities along the 
Boardwalk.[233] Electrical power in Atlantic City as well as the surrounding 
area is primarily served by Atlantic City Electric, which was incorporated 
in 1924 and provides power from the Beesley's Point Generating Station 
in Upper Township, as well as other locations.[234] The Jersey-Atlantic 
Wind Farm, opened in 2005, is the first onshore coastal wind farm in the 
United States.[236] In October 2010, North American Offshore Wind Conference 
was held in the city and included tours of the facility and potential sites 
for further development.[237] In February 2011, the state passed legislation 
permitting the construction of windmills for electricity along pre-existing 
piers, such as the Steel Pier.[238][239] The first phase of the Atlantic 
Wind Connection, a planned electrical transmission backbone along the Jersey 
Shore is planned to be operational in 2013. The development of wind power 
in New Jersey could lead to the construction of the first American wind 
farm using offshore wind power off the coast at Atlantic City as early 
as 2012. In May 2011, Cape May-based Fisherman's Energy gained New Jersey 
approval for a demonstration project to build six wind turbines 2.5 miles 
(4.0 km) off the coast called "Fisherman's Atlantic City Windfarm".[240] 
The project still needs a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers permit before construction 
can begin. Sited in state waters, less than 3 nautical miles (5.6 km) from 
shore, it will not require other federal approval. It will have power generation 
capacity of less than 25 megawatts and will cost between $250 million to 
$300 million. The project may come on line late 2012, making the first 
commercial offshore wind farms in the USA,[241][242][243] earning the city 
the title of "Birthplace of Offshore Wind Energy in the Americas".[240] 
In addition to the city's exposure in the HBO series Boardwalk Empire, 
Atlantic City has been featured in several other aspects of pop culture.
