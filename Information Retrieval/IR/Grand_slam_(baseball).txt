In baseball, a grand slam is a home run hit with all three bases occupied 
by baserunners ("bases loaded"), thereby scoring four runs—the most possible 
in one play. According to The Dickson Baseball Dictionary, the term originated 
in the card game of contract bridge, in which a grand slam involves taking 
all the possible tricks. The word slam, by itself, usually is connected 
with a loud sound, particularly of a door being closed with excess force; 
thus, slamming the door on one's opponent(s), in addition to of course 
the bat slamming the ball into a home run. The most recent grand slam was 
hit on November 1, 2016 (Game 6 World Series) by Addison Russell of the 
Chicago Cubs. Roger Connor is believed to have been the first major league 
player to hit a grand slam, on September 10, 1881, for the Troy Trojans. 
Although Charlie Gould hit one for the Boston Red Stockings (now the Atlanta 
Braves) in the National Association (NA) on September 5, 1871,[1] the NA 
is not recognized by MLB as a major league. Alex Rodriguez has 25 career 
grand slams, the most by any player in Major League Baseball history, passing 
Lou Gehrig's 23 on September 20, 2013. Meanwhile, Don Mattingly set the 
one-season record with six grand slams in 1987 – remarkably, the only grand 
slams of his major league career. Travis Hafner tied Mattingly's Major 
League record in 2006, while in 2009, Albert Pujols tied the one-season 
National League record of five grand slams set by Ernie Banks in 1955.[2] 
Several grand slams, the first being Connor's in 1881, consisted of a player 
hitting a walk-off grand slam for a one-run victory; some baseball observers 
call this an "ultimate grand slam".[3] Ryan Howard was the most recent 
to do so in a 6-5 victory by the Philadelphia Phillies over the Houston 
Astros on August 7, 2014. Roberto Clemente is the only player to have hit 
a walk-off inside-the-park grand slam in a one-run victory;[citation needed] 
the Pittsburgh Pirates defeated the Chicago Cubs 9–8 on July 25, 1956 at 
Forbes Field, a park known for its spacious outfield. During the 2005 major 
league season, grand slams accounted for 132 of the 5017 home runs hit 
(2.6%). On June 13–14, 2006, the Minnesota Twins hit grand slams in consecutive 
games against the Boston Red Sox, including a walk-off grand slam by Jason 
Kubel in the 12th inning on June 13. In 2006, the Chicago White Sox hit 
grand slams in three consecutive games against the Houston Astros (June 
23–25). Scott Podsednik hit the only grand slam of his career in the series 
opener. Joe Crede followed up with a slam of his own on Saturday, and Tadahito 
Iguchi hit a game tying grand slam in the bottom of the ninth with two 
outs in the series finale. (This followed a three run blast by Iguchi in 
the bottom of the eighth.) The White Sox became the first team to accomplish 
this since the Detroit Tigers in 1993. On the other hand, the 2007 Kansas 
City Royals surrendered grand slams in three straight games; two against 
the Baltimore Orioles (April 13–14) and one against the Tigers (April 16). 
Also in 2006, Travis Hafner of the Cleveland Indians set a major league 
record by hitting five grand slams prior to the All-Star break, on his 
way to tying Mattingly for one season (his sixth was on August 13.) On 
July 16, Carlos Beltrán and Cliff Floyd of the New York Mets hit grand 
slams during an 11-run sixth inning against the Chicago Cubs, marking the 
eighth time two grand slams were hit in a team's at-bat (the fourth time 
in National League history). Four players hit a grand slam in their first 
Major League at-bat: Bill Duggleby (1898), Jeremy Hermida (2005), Kevin 
Kouzmanoff (2006), and Daniel Nava (2011). Kouzmanoff, Nava, and Duggleby 
hit theirs on the first pitch; Hermida's grand slam was in a pinch-hit 
at bat. Tony Cloninger is the only pitcher to hit two grand slams in one 
game, for the Atlanta Braves in a 1966 contest against the San Francisco 
Giants. Félix Hernández of the Seattle Mariners became the first American 
League pitcher since the designated hitter rule went into effect in 1973 
to hit a grand slam when he did so on June 23, 2008, off New York Mets 
ace Johan Santana in an interleague game.[4] The only major leaguer to 
hit two grand slams in one inning is Fernando Tatís of the St. Louis Cardinals, 
on April 23, 1999 at Dodger Stadium, with both grand slams coming off Los 
Angeles' Chan Ho Park in the third inning. Tatis was only the second National 
League player to hit two grand slams in one game, joining Cloninger. Park 
was only the second pitcher in major league history to give up two grand 
slams in one inning; Bill Phillips of the Pittsburgh Pirates did it on 
August 16, 1890, one to Tom Burns and one to Malachi Kittridge, but Park 
was the first to give up both to the same batter. Tatis had never hit a 
grand slam before in his career. Bill Mueller is the only player to hit 
grand slams from both sides of the plate in the same game, when he hit 
2 on July 29, 2003 for the Boston Red Sox vs. the Texas Rangers. Robin 
Ventura is the only player to hit a grand slam in both games of a doubleheader, 
when he did so on May 20, 1999 for the New York Mets against the Milwaukee 
Brewers. In Japan's professional league, the feat of multiple grand slams 
in a single inning by a team has been accomplished three times; most recently 
on April 1, 2007 by José Fernández and Takeshi Yamasaki of the Tohoku Rakuten 
Golden Eagles. The Daiei Hawks accomplished the feat in 1999.[5] On August 
25, 2011, the New York Yankees, hosting the Oakland A's, became the first 
team in MLB history to hit three grand slams in one game. Robinson Canó, 
Russell Martin and Curtis Granderson took pitchers Rich Harden, Fautino 
de los Santos, and Bruce Billings deep, with each grand slam being hit 
in a different inning. Coming back from a 7−1 deficit, the second grand 
slam gave the Yankees their first lead of the game; they went on to win 
22–9.[6][7][8] On July 13, 2014, Buster Posey and batterymate Madison Bumgarner 
of the San Francisco Giants hit grand slams against the Arizona Diamondbacks. 
It marked the first time in Major League Baseball history that batterymates 
hit grand slams in the same game.[9] "Get out the rye bread and mustard, 
Grandma, it is grand salami time!"- used by longtime Seattle Mariners lead 
commentator Dave Niehaus from the 1995 season until his death in November 
2010.[10] Currently used by Niehaus' longtime partner Rick Rizzs. Coaching 
visit to mound. Mike Napoli singles on a fly ball to center fielder Austin 
Jackson, loading the bases. Nelson Cruz hits a grand slam (3) to left field. 
Young, Beltre, and Napoli score on the home run. First official (see Grand 
Slam Single) walk-off grand slam in post season history. "[12] October
