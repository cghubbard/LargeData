Fair Lawn is a borough in Bergen County, New Jersey, United States, and 
a suburban municipality in the New York City Metropolitan Area. As of the 
2010 United States Census, the borough's population was 32,457,[10][11][12][21] 
reflecting an increase of 820 (+2.6%) from the 31,637 counted in the 2000 
Census, which had in turn increased by 1,089 (+3.6%) from the 30,548 counted 
in the 1990 Census.[22] Fair Lawn was incorporated as a borough by an act 
of the New Jersey Legislature on March 6, 1924, as "Fairlawn," from portions 
of Saddle River Township.[23] The name was taken from Fairlawn, David Acker's 
estate home, that was built in 1865 and later became the Fair Lawn Municipal 
Building.[24][25] In 1933, the official spelling of the borough's name 
was split into its present two-word form as "Fair Lawn" Borough.[23] Radburn, 
one of the first planned communities in the United States, is an unincorporated 
community located within Fair Lawn and was founded in 1929 as "a town for 
the motor age."[26] Fair Lawn is home to a large number of commuters to 
New York City, to which it is connected by train from two railroad stations 
on NJ Transit's Bergen County Line, the Radburn and Broadway stations. 
Fair Lawn's motto is "A great place to visit and a better place to live."[27] 
Fair Lawn has been rated as one of the top 10 best places to live in New 
Jersey.[28] According to Nerdwallet, Fair Lawn witnessed a 5.3% increase 
in its working-age population between 2009 and 2011.[27] The first settlers 
of Fair Lawn were members of the Lenni Lenape tribe, a peaceful group of 
hunter gatherers who eventually sold their land to incoming Dutch and Irish 
Settlers and migrated to Pennsylvania. The new colonists turned the region, 
part of the New Barbadoes Township, into five large farm lots, conjoined 
by two main roads - Paramus and Saddle River - and named it "slooterdam" 
(after a V-shaped sluice-like fishing weir built in the Passaic by the 
Lenni Lenape). The name stuck until 1791. In the 1800s, these five lots 
became nine smaller lots, and three new roads - Fair Lawn Avenue, Lincoln 
Avenue, and Prospect Street - were constructed to encourage mobility between 
them. Eighty houses were built by 1861, and the renamed Small Lots, now 
a part of the Saddle River Township and home to multiple vegetable and 
fruit farms and dairies, became a clear agricultural community. Berdan 
Avenue, a new road located near five Berdan family farms, was soon added 
and Victorian homes were built alongside it and in nearby areas. The grandest 
of the estates, perched atop a hill by Small Lots Road was David Acker's 
estate "Fairlawn," from which the township gets its name (Images of America, 
Page 7). Rapid suburban development of the town was spurred by the need 
to house workers from the neighboring town of Paterson in the late 1800s, 
and small home construction continued through the 20th century, occurring 
in three sections: the River Road-Fair Lawn Avenue area known as "Memorial 
Park", the area at Lincoln Avenue and Wagaraw Road known as "Columbus Heights", 
and the area east of the railroad and south of Broadway, known as Warren 
Point. The development of this section was catalyzed by the "establishment 
of a post office, a railroad station, and a trolley to the Hudson River" 
(Images of America, Page 8). In the 1900s, Fair Lawn residents were bitter 
about the schooling situation as part of Saddle River Township; the schools 
were either dilapidated or too far away for Fair Lawn residents, and citizens 
felt that they were not getting schools comparable to the tax money they 
were paying. As such, a movement to separate from Saddle River Township 
was born. Fair Lawn residents petitioned to the state, asking to incorporate 
as an independent borough, and in April 1924, the borough of Fair Lawn 
was voted into existence. Fair Lawn, recognized for its rich history today, 
is home to the following eight sites listed on the National Register of 
Historic Places:[29] Other sites, in addition to those listed above, are 
also considered historic by the Historic Sites Survey Committee of the 
Bergen County Historic Sites Advisory Board, including:[30] According to 
the United States Census Bureau, the borough had a total area of 5.201 
square miles (13.472 km2), including 5.139 square miles (13.311 km2) of 
land and 0.062 square miles (0.161 km2) of water (1.20%).[1][2] The borough 
borders Paterson (in Passaic County, across the Passaic River) to the West; 
Hawthorne across Lincoln Avenue to the West; Glen Rock across Harristown 
Road, Maple Avenue, the Northern border of the former Nabisco plant and 
its extension north of Garwood Road and Naugle Drive to the North; Ridgewood 
across the Saddle River to the Northeast; Paramus across the Saddle River 
to the East; Rochelle Park across another point in the Saddle River to 
the Southeast; with Saddle Brook across the two longer portions of South 
Broadway and their extensions through Rosario Court to the South; and Elmwood 
Park across the Bergen County Line, New Jersey Route 4 (Broadway), Cyril 
Avenue, and Willow Street to the South.[31] The hills of Wyckoff are visible 
from much of the northern portion of Fair Lawn. Fair Lawn is an incorporated 
collection of diverse neighborhoods, each with its own distinct character 
and vibe. Unincorporated communities, localities and place names located 
partially or completely within the borough include:[32] There also exist 
more intricate micro-neighborhoods within macro-neighborhoods throughout 
the borough, such as "Fair Lawn Commons" (The Commons) off Route 208, located 
within the Radburn Historical District, yet which has a separate, more 
affluent feel and modern look and subculture; Radburn's El Dorado Village, 
which is known for its Eastern European immigrant residents; and just to 
its west, the "Chandler Houses". Fair Lawn's newest neighborhood is Fair 
Lawn Promenade (The Promenade), a highly engaged mixed-use development 
extending northward from The Commons along Highway 208 North, consisting 
of apartments, shops, offices, and restaurants, with the motto to be able 
to "live, shop, work, and play" in one locale. These distinct communities 
are located throughout the borough, and each has its own flair, making 
Fair Lawn not just ethnically, racially, and religiously diverse, but also 
an experientially diverse borough notable even amidst Bergen County's diversity 
on a larger scale. Fair Lawn has a longstanding tradition of ethnic diversity 
and tolerance for people of different ethnicities and religious faiths. 
Continuing steady immigration from Eurasia, Asia, Europe, and Latin America 
has transformed Fair Lawn into an international melting pot, and over 50 
languages and dialects are spoken in the borough. Fair Lawn has been a 
noted center for Jewish culture over a period spanning several decades. 
Since the early 2000s, the Orthodox Jewish population has been increasing 
significantly and has replaced the earlier decreases in members of the 
non-Orthodox Jewish sects. After the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, 
Russian Jews began to migrate to Fair Lawn.[33] Fair Lawn's Jewish American 
population has therefore maintained an at least one-third presence overall 
for several decades. Russian Jews were then followed by Russian Orthodox 
Christians. Over 10% of the borough's population is of Russian descent, 
the highest of any community in New Jersey, and increasing with continued 
migration of Russian Americans from Brooklyn. The size of Fair Lawn's Russian 
American presence prompted an April Fool's satire titled, "Putin Moves 
Against Fair Lawn".[34] Fair Lawn also has the largest Israeli American 
community in Bergen County.[35] On November 22, 2015, the Jewish Historical 
Society of North Jersey celebrated the grand opening of a permanent home 
at 17-10 River Road in Fair Lawn, after being housed at various locations, 
mostly in neighboring Paterson, for decades.[36] Fair Lawn has historically 
also had a large Italian American population, 19.7% in 2000,[37] but this 
number is decreasing[38] as the descendants of the original Italian immigrants 
are being displaced by immigrants from around the globe. Fair Lawn's reputable 
school district, safe and well-policed neighborhoods, and the borough's 
convenient access to commercial centers and hospitals, a complex network 
of highways, transit lines, New York City, and Newark Liberty International 
Airport, have all made Fair Lawn a magnet for new immigrants from several 
regions around the world. The 2012 American Community Survey conducted 
by the Census Bureau showed a significant increase in the Asian American 
population, including the Asian Indian, Filipino American, Chinese American, 
Korean American, and Vietnamese American populations,[39] and the Polish 
American population is also growing. The public library in Fair Lawn holds 
storytelling programs in Hindi and Hebrew languages,[40] while Mandarin 
Chinese has been taught in the school district since the 2007-08 school 
year.[41] A number of places for congregation cater to different nationalities 
in Fair Lawn, including three Korean churches, one Taiwanese church, Young 
Israel of Fair Lawn, Saint Leon Armenian Church, and the (Italian American) 
Cosmos Club of Fair Lawn. Several Filipino organizations are based in Fair 
Lawn.[42][43][44] Given the established presence of Russian Americans in 
the borough, immigrant nationalities native to other republics of the Former 
Soviet Union,[45] including Ukrainian Americans, Georgian Americans, Armenian 
Americans,[46][47] and Uzbek Americans have also established an increasing 
presence in Fair Lawn. The international ethnic melange that describes 
Paterson, Fair Lawn's western neighbor, has now permeated Fair Lawn itself. 
Muslim immigrants, including Albanian Americans and Macedonian Americans, 
as well as Latino Americans, including Peruvian Americans and Puerto Rican 
Americans, have settled in Fair Lawn's western flank, in the Memorial Park 
neighborhood between the River Road Improvement District and the Passaic 
River, where there is also a small but stable African American minority.

Borough Council. Members of the Borough Council serve four-year terms in 
office and are elected at-large in partisan elections in odd-numbered years 
on a staggered basis, with two or three seats coming up for election every 
other year as part of the November general election. All policy making 
power is concentrated in the council. At an annual reorganization meeting 
held after each election, the council selects a Mayor, a Deputy Mayor, 
and a deputy mayor for Community Affairs from among its members. The mayor 
presides over its meetings with no separate policy-making power. A borough 
manager is appointed by the council to serve as the municipal chief executive 
and administrative official.[7][69] As of 2016[update], the members of 
the Borough Council are Mayor John J. Cosgrove (R, term as mayor ends December 
31, 2017; term on council ends 2019), Deputy Mayor Amy Lefkowitz (R, 2017),

the United States Department of Education, a recognition celebrating excellence 
in academics.[143][144] In December 2014, Fair Lawn voters approved by 
a greater than 2-to-1 margin a $12.8 million expansion and capital improvement 
referendum to be implemented by the Fair Lawn Public Schools. The referendum 
funds the initiation within two years of a full-day kindergarten in the 
district, a program offered by most districts countywide, as well as a 
roof replacement program at six schools. The expenditures will include 
$2.2 million in state aid, with the remaining $10.6 million covered by 
bonds issued by the school system.[145] The full-day kindergarten program 
is slated to begin in September 2016.[146] Public school students from 
the borough, and all of Bergen County, are eligible to attend the secondary 
education programs offered by the Bergen County Technical Schools, which 
include the Bergen County Academies in Hackensack, and the Bergen Tech

York City via the George Washington Bridge, and New Jersey Route 208, which 
links Fair Lawn to the New York City bypass highway Interstate 287. Fair 
Lawn has several main roads crossing through it forming a rough 3x3 grid. 
Running north-south are Saddle River Road, Plaza Road, and River Road (County 
Route 507)[158] while Broadway, Morlot Avenue, and Fair Lawn Avenue run 
east-west, and Route 208 runs northwest-southeast. Running east-west between 
and parallel to Morlot and Fair Lawn Avenues is Berdan Avenue, a residential 
thoroughfare which is bisected by Route 208 into two discontinuous segments, 
the western one of which contains Fair Lawn High School. Broadway becomes 
Route 4 in Elmwood Park to the west and eventually Dr. Martin Luther King 
Boulevard in Paterson. To the East, it becomes Route 4 heading into Paramus 
and is less than 10 miles (16 km) from the George Washington Bridge.[159] 
Fair Lawn Avenue is considered the borough's main street, containing its 
Borough Hall, Police Station, and Public Library. The road goes west over 
the Passaic River into Paterson, and on the east, Fair Lawn Avenue ends 
at Saddle River Road, which through Dunkerhook Park becomes Dunkerhook 
Road, and becomes Century Road once in Paramus, at Paramus Road. The intersection 
of Fair Lawn Avenue and Plaza Road form what could be considered a "town 
center", with several shopping plazas and the Radburn train station all 
within walking distance. In October 2015, a community meeting was held 
to discuss a vision for this corridor.[160] Other commercial areas include 
Broadway and River Road. Route 208 has its southern terminus in Fair Lawn 
and bisects the borough from the northwest to the southeast, where it eventually 
merges with Broadway to become Route 4 just west of Fair Lawn's border 
with Paramus. Taken the other direction, Route 208 flows northwest to Interstate 
287 in Oakland.[161] Numerous commercial establishments and office buildings 
line Route 208 along the northwestern half of this limited access highway's 
trajectory through Fair Lawn. South of Route 4, Saddle River Road goes 
through the eastern side of Fair Lawn and into Saddle Brook, where it provides 
a link to both the Garden State Parkway and Interstate 80. North of Route 
4, Saddle River Road provides a link to Glen Rock. On the opposite side 
of the Passaic River, Route 20 southbound leads to both Route 21 southbound 
and the Garden State Parkway southbound in Clifton, as well as Route 80 
East and Westbound and Route 46 westbound, which is used by people in the 
river neighborhoods to access Downtown Paterson via Route 19 to avoid Broadway 
traffic. Fair Lawn uses a street address numbering system in which most 
Fair Lawn addresses are given hyphenated numbers, such as 10-13 Some Street. 
Less than 1% of addresses in New Jersey use this kind of numbering system 
and Fair Lawn's nearly 10,000 hyphenated addresses account for nearly half 
of them. This numbering system is also used in Queens, New York City. Exceptions 
to this numbering system generally exist on the Glen Rock, Hawthorne, and 
Saddle Brook sides of Fair Lawn and within the Radburn development. The 
system, dating at least as far back as the 1930s, was designed to allow 
emergency personnel to quickly locate addresses.[162] The first numbers 
(before the dash) correspond to block-distances from Broadway (on streets 
that run North-South) and to the numbered streets in the borough (example: 
2nd Street, 17th Street, etc.) on the streets that run East-West; with 
the highest numbers being in the low 40s, and the lowest numbers being 
0-30, etc. Addresses south of Broadway / Route 4 start with a zero and 
a hyphen, which can cause confusion with those unfamiliar with the grid 
system. Most GPS systems and online address entry forms do not accept the 
dash, though addresses entered without the dash are typically handled properly.[162] 
Fair Lawn is served by the Radburn[163] and Broadway[164] train stations 
on the NJ Transit Bergen County Line, which offers service to Lower Manhattan 
via the Hoboken Terminal, and connections at Secaucus Junction to Penn 
Station in Midtown Manhattan and to most other NJ Transit train lines.[165] 
NJ Transit buses include the 144, 145, 148, 160, 164 and 196 routes to 
the Port Authority Bus Terminal in Midtown Manhattan; the 171 and 175 to 
the George Washington Bridge Bus Terminal; and the 746, 758 and 770 lines, 
offering local service.[166][167] Spanish Transportation and its jitney 
buses / guaguas operate out of its terminal located one block from the 
NJ Transit Paterson Terminal on Broadway in downtown Paterson. The two 
lines, the Broadway and Main Street jitneys, begin at its respective Main 
Terminal on Broadway, with the Broadway-Washington Heights line heading 
west on Broadway with frequent local stops then continuing onto Route 4 
before crossing the George Washington Bridge and dropping commuters off 
in front of the George Washington Bridge Bus Terminal with access to the 
A Train.[168] The Main Street-42nd Street route heads south down Main Street 
and makes frequent local stops through Clifton and Passaic, then makes 
sporadic non-local stops until undergoing the Lincoln Tunnel, dropping 
commuters off via 42nd Street in front of the Port Authority Bus Terminal.[169] 
Fair Lawn lies 20 miles (32 km) north of Newark Liberty International Airport, 
approaches to which are directly over Fair Lawn, and 8 miles (13 km) northwest 
of Teterboro Airport. John F. Kennedy International Airport is 30 miles 
(48 km) away and LaGuardia Airport is located 22 miles (35 km) to the east, 
both located in New York City. People who were born in, residents of, or 
otherwise closely associated with Fair Lawn include: A significant historic 
site in Fair Lawn is the Passaic River Fishing Weir, a prominent archaeological 
feature just north of the Fair Lawn Avenue Bridge. It was constructed by 
Lenape tribe members and is the best-preserved of several such weirs on 
the Passaic River.[219] Fair Lawn is home to the following locations on 
the National Register of Historic Places:[220] Fair Lawn also has a close 
association with two historic areas along the Saddle River in Paramus. 
One is the Easton Tower, a Bergen County historic site that consists of 
a stone tower and a small dam which mark the site of the colonial-era Jacob 
Zabriskie mill and the 19th-20th centuries-era Arcola community park. Another 
is the Dunkerhook community, focused around the New Jersey designated historic 
road, Dunkerhook Road. The western section of the community includes the 
Naugle House and the Jacob Vanderbeck Jr. House, and the eastern section 
included a slave and free-African American community that consisted of 
a school, a cemetery, a church, and houses including the now-demolished
