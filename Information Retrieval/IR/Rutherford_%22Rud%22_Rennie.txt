Cecil Rutherford "Rud" Rennie (1897–1956), newspaperman, was a sportswriter 
for the New York Herald Tribune, chiefly assigned to the New York Yankees 
baseball team and the New York Giants football team, for some 36 years.[1][2] 
He was a friend and confidante of many celebrated sports figures such as 
Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Joe DiMaggio, Pepper Martin, and Dizzy Dean, as 
well as his many colleagues in the press box. Much quoted from his writings 
as well as tossed-off quips, Rennie was a member of The Newspaper Guild 
from its founding in 1933. He served on the board of directors of the Baseball 
Writers Association of America, and was frequently on the yearly selection 
committee for Most Valuable Player and the Honor Roll, and was on the executive 
committee of the New York Chapter.[2] He was born Cecil Rutherford Rennie 
on August 8, 1897, in Toronto, the son of Scottish-born parents James Rennie, 
a coachman-driver, and Christina Rutherford, a cook, both in domestic service.[3] 
Later in his life, some media reported that his given first name was "Clare" 
or "Claire," but this is not supported by official records: it was "Cecil." 
When the boy was 2, the family relocated to New York City, and "Rud," as 
he was known his whole life, was raised in the Upper West Side of Manhattan, 
attending Barnard School for Boys, a private boys’ academy, now the Horace 
Mann School.[4] He entered the School of Journalism at Columbia College, 
Columbia University in September 1915. He was a member of Phi Delta Theta 
fraternity and active on the school newspaper.[5] Upon America's declaration 
of war against Germany on 6 April 1917, in his sophomore year, Rennie withdrew 
to enlist. He signed into the New York National Guard on 27 April 1917 
and was mustered in as a Private in the 29th Company, 8th Regiment, of 
the United States Army Coast Artillery Corps on 22 July 1917. After training, 
he was assigned to Battery C, 58th Artillery, of the Coastal Artillery 
Corps at Fort Schuyler, the retired Civil War coastal battery guarding 
the junction of Long Island Sound and the East River. Rennie made Private 
First Class on 1 February 1918. Then, serving overseas between 10 May 1918 
to 27 April 1919, he was promoted to Corporal on 1 October 1918 and Sergeant 
on 24 November 1918.[3][6] Engagements of the American Expeditionary Forces 
in France (Gen. John J. Pershing, commanding) in which he participated 
included St. Mihiel (12-21 September 1918), trench and tank combat against 
German defensive positions in northeast France, hampered by driving rain, 
mounting mud, and overstretched supply lines; Meuse-Argonne (26 September 
1918 – 11 November 1918) frontal assaults village to village on the Western 
Front and through the Argonne Forest; and, post-Armistice, the general 
defense duty recognized as "Defensive Sector." For his service Rennie was 
awarded the Victory Medal with Service Clasps. Even in active duty in an 
artillery crew, Rennie was obsessed by the writing bug. His wartime journals 
contain multiple references to a beginning freelance journalism career, 
with submissions of poems, short stories, and articles to magazines and 
newspapers. Rennie was honorably discharged after return to the U.S. in 
May 1919.[7] In New York City, Rud Rennie briefly worked as a beat reporter 
for the morning edition of The Sun, in 1919-1920.[1] In the latter year 
Rennie was hired at the New York Tribune as a general assignment reporter, 
often covering police cases and ship arrivals of notables such as Hollywood, 
Broadway, or sports stars. He was promoted to assistant city editor in 
1922. Rennie became a naturalized U.S. citizen on 16 June 1922,[3][8] Taking 
a leave of absence from the Tribune in August 1922, Rennie sailed to Europe 
to settle a maternal aunt's estate, thereafter touring Ireland, England, 
Scotland, and France (including places significant to his wartime military 
service) until the end of 1922.[9] Rud Rennie married Mary Cecilia Maloney 
(born in Massachusetts of Canadian parentage) on 18 July 1925 at New York's 
Church of the Transfiguration, Episcopal (Manhattan)[10] —"The Little Church 
Around the Corner"—an Episcopal church known in the 1920s for its many 
connections to entertainment, arts, and sports celebrities for weddings, 
community forums, theatricals, and funerals. There were no children.[3] 
The Rennies lived in Forest Hills, Manhasset, and finally Huntington, New 
York. Cecil Rutherford "Rud" Rennie's wife, who went by the name Cecilia 
M. Rennie, died in August 1954.[11][12] Rennie's father James Rennie died 
in New Jersey, working as driver for Governor George Sebastian Silzer, 
in 1923. His mother Christina Rutherford Rennie's last recorded employer 
was James J. Goodwin, banker and cousin to financier J.P. Morgan, and who 
died in 1915. By 1920 she was an inmate at Central Islip State Hospital 
for the Insane, where she died in 1932.[3][13][14][15] The year he married, 
1925, Rud Rennie became a sports reporter for the newly consolidated Herald 
Tribune, after the two newspapers were merged in 1924.[3] As a sports reporter, 
Rennie's primary assignment was the New York Yankees baseball team, traveling 
with the team from Florida spring training through the entire playing season, 
covering every World Series between 1925 and 1953 and all All-Star Games. 
For the 1936 World Series he was named one of three official scorers, a 
rotating honor within the profession.[16] Each year he then switched to 
the New York Giants football team for its season with similar travel to 
games and bowls. Rennie was a prolific freelance contributor of sports 
and general interest articles as well as short stories and poems to numerous 
magazines, prominently Collier's, The Saturday Evening Post, Sports Illustrated, 
Life, Reader's Digest, Argosy, Cosmopolitan, and American Legion Monthly. 
He also ghost-wrote many articles attributed to players, managers, and 
their wives. Shortly after transfer to the Herald Tribune sports desk, 
while attending the February 1926 New York Baseball Writers’ Dinner, Rennie 
showed his easy, boozy, kidding friendship with Babe Ruth—as well as his 
lifelong musical predilection. According to biographer Kai Wagenheim (Babe 
Ruth: His Life and Legend), Rennie "stood up…and, in a tremulous tenor 
voice, warbled a parody of little [Yankees manager] Miller Huggins (lyrics 
by Bill Slocum) that had the boys dripping tears of laughter into their 
fruit salad: I wonder where my Babe Ruth is tonight? / He grabbed his hat 
and coat and ducked from sight. / He may be at some cozy roadside inn, 
/ Drinking tea—or maybe gin. / He may be at a dance, or may be in a fight. 
/ I know he's with a dame, / I wonder what's her name? / I wonder where 
my Babe Ruth is tonight? "Ruth was there," continues Wagenheim, "and he 
laughed louder and clapped harder than anyone else at the table."[17] Rud 
Rennie served as an honorary pallbearer in Babe Ruth's funeral in 1948.[18] 
In his stories and magazine features, Rennie was an early booster of the 
Yankees’ first baseman and slugger Lou Gehrig, who had joined the team 
in 1923 and enjoyed his breakout season in 1926.[19][20][21] When in 1936 
it was noted in the media that Olympic swimmer Johnny Weismuller was retiring 
from his long screen role as Tarzan the Ape Man in the Hollywood films 
memorializing the hero of Edgar Rice Burroughs’ novels, with urging by 
Gehrig's wife Eleanor (for whom Rennie had ghosted a magazine article),[22] 
as well as his agent, Rennie promoted his friend Lou Gehrig's cause in 
Hollywood as an actor.[23][24] He helped arrange photography shoots (Gehrig 
in a leopard-skin and wielding a cave-man's club) and screen tests of the 
muscular first baseman; he buttonholed agents, producers such as Sol Lesser, 
and Hollywood columnists such as Louella Parsons in a publicity campaign 
to boost Gehrig's chances. The slugger himself was unenthusiastic about 
swinging from jungle vines and wrestling lions, but he told Rennie that 
he wouldn’t say no to a man-of-the-people role in a western or mystery 
picture. The Tarzan effort fell as if from a high height with a thumbs 
down from producer Sol Lesser and a telegram from author Edgar Rice Burroughs 
to Gehrig, care of United Press, so the Yankee could read it in his morning 
newspaper: "Having seen several pictures of you as Tarzan and paid about 
$50 for clippings on the subject, I want to congratulate you on being a 
swell first baseman."[25][26] Gehrig did appear in one 1938 Sol Lesser-produced 
"B-movie," a sodbuster called "Rawhide," with Gehrig playing himself as 
a baseball great retired to run a ranch, who is menaced by bandits.[27] 
With Gehrig's 1939 diagnosis[28] of A.L.S. (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, 
a progressive neurodegenerative disease that causes muscle weakness, paralysis, 
and ultimately, respiratory failure), Rennie remained close to the ballplayer 
and his wife Eleanor through Gehrig's retirement and downhill slide until 
Gehrig's death in 1941.[29] A much-cited interchange occurred when Gehrig 
returned from the consultation and diagnosis at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, 
Minnesota. Rennie met his train in Washington, D.C., where the Yankees 
were to play. A group of Boy Scouts at the station joyfully greeted Gehrig, 
and yelled, "Good luck with the Series!" Gehrig returned their wave, and 
leaned toward friend Rennie. "They’re wishing me luck," he said quietly, 
"and I’m dying."[30][31] Rennie was steps away from Gehrig during his famous 
July 4 Yankee Stadium farewell, with the words, "Today I consider myself 
the luckiest man on the face of the earth."[32][33] The article was reprinted 
in The New York Herald Tribune's commemorative collection of historic sports 
columns, Wake Up the Echoes, published by Hanover House in 1956.[34] In 
May 1946, the 20-year veteran sportswriter on the Herald Tribune was covering 
the NY Giants’ football tour, then in Cincinnati, when informed by wire 
service reporters that he was named in a New York Yankees lawsuit against 
the Mexican Baseball League; it charged the league with conspiring to poach 
its players to walk on their contracts and join players south of the border; 
it aimed to restrain Rennie as an "agent" encouraging such a conspiracy, 
including recruitment of Rennie's friend Phil Rizzuto, the Yankees’ prize 
shortstop. The sportswriter was alleged to have been seen in the Yankees’ 
locker room, influencing Rizzuto and other friends to decamp.[35] Rennie, 
who had been merely sent by the Herald Tribune to cover formation of the 
Mexican League, finding both positive and negative aspects to the effort, 
was surprised to be named in the Yankees’ restraining order, and hastened 
back to New York to defend himself.[36] Despite much media attention to 
the team's action against Rennie, with the possibility looming that it 
would blow up into a first amendment case, the matter quickly deflated 
when the temperamental Yankees president Larry MacPhail withdrew his suit, 
but not before Rennie was pressured by many in his journalistic cohort 
to atone by picking up numerous bar tabs; Rennie regained the Yankees’ 
good graces.[37][38][39][40][41] Rud Rennie was in at the creation of another 
one of baseball's greatest news stories—though he didn’t write it, and 
remained cloaked for decades, past his death.[42] In early 1947, Rennie 
was traveling with the New York Giants football team in St. Louis and met 
with an old friend, Dr. Robert Hyland, physician for the St. Louis Cardinals 
baseball team and a singing partner with Rennie in a boozy amateur barbershop 
quartet. Hyland confided that some Cardinals players objected to African-American 
slugger Jackie Robinson "breaking the color barrier" by signing with the 
Brooklyn Dodgers. On May 21, when the Dodgers were to play St. Louis at 
Sportsman's Park, Cardinals would go on strike and refuse to play against 
a black man. Moreover, the strike leaders were aiming on spreading the 
day's protest throughout the National League, white teams in a general 
strike until Robinson was booted out of his contract.[43][44] "When I heard 
this from Doc Hyland," Rennie later told fellow Trib sportswriter Roger 
Kahn, "one word came into my mind. In large letters. INSANITY. Next, What 
a story! But I couldn’t write it. If I did, people who knew of my friendship 
with Hyland would trace it back to Bob," who would lose his team physician 
job. So Rennie telephoned his fellow veteran Trib sportswriter Stanley 
Woodward, "told him what I had," and asked Woodward to "take it from there." 
Woodward made the tip his own story, contacting many sources—some of whom 
nervously denied the plot existed, others who admitted it but would not 
go on the record. The courageous reaction to Woodward's questions and the 
planned racist action came from National League President Ford Frick. Frick, 
himself a onetime sportswriter, was extensively quoted when he forced a 
meeting with the Cardinals players and their manager in New York. "If you 
do this," Frick warned the strikers, "you will be suspended from the league. 
You will find that the friends that you think you have in the press box 
will not support you, that you will be outcasts. I do not care if half 
the league strikes. Those who do it will encounter quick retribution. All 
will be suspended and I don’t care if it wrecks the National League for 
five years. This is the United States of America and one citizen has as 
much right to play as another."[42][45][46] The episode has now been widely 
cited in books as well as many commemorative articles on anniversaries 
associated with Jackie Robinson's life, such as Red Smith's column in 1977, 
"The Outcasts of Cooperstown," when the year's All-Star baseball game was 
dedicated to the memory of Robinson on the 30th anniversary of his signing 
with the Brooklyn Dodgers. The quashed players’ strike of 1947 deserved 
attention, too, Smith wrote, for its ugliness might have succeeded "…if 
Rud Rennie and Stanley Woodward hadn’t exposed their intentions in the 
New York Herald Tribune."[46] In his elegy-memoir in The American Scholar, 
veteran journalist and author William Zinsser recalled achieving his "boyhood 
dream" after World War Two service when he joined the Herald Tribune sports 
department as an assistant editor. "It was in those pages, as a child baseball 
addict, that I found my first literary influences," Zinsser declared. "The 
Trib sportswriters were my Faulkner and my Hemingway, and now I was in 
the same room with those bylines-come-to-life: Rud Rennie, Jesse Abramson, 
Al Laney….sports editor Stanley Woodward, Red Smith, Joe H. Palmer…."[47] 
Rennie and his fellow Trib men on the sports beat were, according to Red 
Smith, "incomparably the most gifted company ever assembled in one playpen. 
Gifted, yes, and ascerbic, trenchant, iconoclastic and also good." [48] 
When, in 1928, the scrappy Yankees fielder Bob Meusel objected to one of 
Rennie's columns and tried to punch him in a hotel lobby, Rennie's fellow 
writers of the various New York newspapers came to their colleague's rescue 
in person, separating them, and in print, they "put the chill" on Meusel, 
repeating rumors that management had plans to trade Meusel out of New York.[49] 
Meusel's contract was sold to the Cincinnati Reds after the 1929 season.[50] 
Often in his books such as The Boys of Summer (1972), Memories of Summer 
(1993), The Era, 1947-1957 (1993), and Into My Own (2006), the prolific 
and long-lived ex-Trib sportswriter Roger Kahn—an ambitious junior writer 
in Rennie's latter years—paused to mention (and quote from) Rennie, "a 
trim, handsome Canadian" who had "lady friends in several National League 
towns."[51] One such example, quoted often by others, followed the 20-year-old 
Oklahoman Mickey Mantle's stunning World Series win for the Yankees (their 
fourth in a row) against the Brooklyn Dodgers, a truly Olympian battle 
in 1952. The dutiful, modest young Oklahoman seemed to have no idea of 
what his home runs and headlines portended for him. Kahn quoted from the 
interview between Rud Rennie and Mickey Mantle: "Nice Series, young man," 
said Rud Rennie, who covered the Yankees for the Herald Tribune. "What 
are you up to now?" "Headin' back to Oklahoma. I got me a job working with 
the pump crew down in the lead mine." "Work in the mines?" Rennie said. 
"You're the star of the World Series. You don't have to do that any more." 
"Yes, I do," Mantle said. "My dad died, you know." "Yes. Sorry, son." "I 
got seven dependents counting on me." Mantle named three younger brothers, 
a sister, his mother and his wife, Merlyn. "That's six," Rennie said. "The 
baby is due in March," Mantle said. Rennie looked grim. "I can handle it," 
said 20-year-old Mickey Mantle. Then, brightening, "Anyways my father-in-law, 
Giles Johnson, says he's gonna name the baby ‘Homer.’"[52] After the National 
Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum was founded in 1939, celebrating the centennial 
of baseball, in Cooperstown, New York, Westbrook Pegler, columnist of the 
Chicago Tribune and the Scripps-Howard and the Hearst syndicates, complained 
that Cooperstown was studiously ignoring the corps of sports journalists. 
"Baseball has lived as much by publicity as by prowess," he scolded, "for 
the glamorizing prose of the working press has kept the business in the 
public mind in season and out for more than 40 years and clothed it in 
the appeal of a national institution." If "Babe Ruth's bat and the pants 
of John McGraw be relics worth treasuring under glass in the Hall of Fame 
at Cooperstown …then Bill McGeehan's portable typewriter which made McGraw 
the mastermind is not less sacred." Legendary sports writers worthy of 
honors at Cooperstown, he said, should include Ring Lardner, Grantland 
Rice, Damon Runyon, and 12 other writers, including Rud Rennie. "For in 
baseball," wrote Pegler, "the historians help create the history they write 
and are of the game itself." None would look "out of place" in the Hall 
of Fame.[53][54] Bob Considine, another longtime nationally syndicated 
columnist and one-time sportswriter for the New York Daily Mirror, bemoaned 
in a 1969 column the closure of so many of New York City's great newspapers, 
and the passing of generations of reporters, columnists, editors, and publishers. 
He especially cited the vanished Herald Tribune and its bullpen of sportswriters, 
with Rennie as one of the singled out.[55] A lifelong photographer, Rennie's 
hundreds of surviving snapshot subjects included Gehrig, Babe Ruth, Casey 
Stengel, Yogi Berra "He doesn’t even look like a Yankee" was Rennie's oft-quoted 
complaint.[56][57] Joe DiMaggio, Jackie Robinson, Phil Rizzuto, Joe McCarthy, 
George Selkirk, Lefty Gomez, Dizzy Dean, Jacob Ruppert, Tommy Henrich, 
Rogers Hornsby, Grantland Rice, Hank Greenberg, PeeWee Reese, Leo Durocher, 
Red Smith, Al Huggins, Jim Kahn, and numerous others in action, from spring 
training in Florida to a year's Series, and everything in between, on and 
off the diamond. His family photo albums cover more than 50 years of activities 
in New York, Southampton, Florida, New Orleans, St. Louis, Mexico, Cuba, 
and the Dominican Republic. He always kept scrupulous notes as to camera, 
film, exposure, and shutter speed. Rud Rennie suffered a heart attack during 
the Yankees’ Spring Training in 1952, returning to baseball coverage after 
recuperation.[58] His wife Cecilia died in 1954,[59] by which time Rennie's 
own condition of heart failure necessitated an end to the arduous travel 
routine following the Yankees. He then moved to cover thoroughbred horse 
racing in New York.[1][3] Rud Rennie died in Huntington, New York on 6 
October 1956, aged 59.[60][61][62] Numerous sportswriter colleagues attended 
his funeral. He was buried as a veteran at Long Island National Cemetery 
in Farmingdale, New York.[3][63] p&h=2993187&ti=0&indiv=try&gss=pt 7 June
