In May 1977, owner Ted Turner had stunned baseball when—in the midst of 
a 16-game losing streak—he furloughed manager Dave Bristol, sent him on 
a ten-day scouting trip, and took the reins of the team himself; on May 
11, he donned uniform #27 and skippered the Braves to their 17th straight 
loss. National League president Chub Feeney and Commissioner of Baseball 
Bowie Kuhn then stepped in and forbade the owner from managing his own 
ballclub, citing MLB rules that apparently took effect after Connie Mack 
retired as owner-manager of the Philadelphia Athletics in 1950.[3] Veteran 
coach Vern Benson ran the Braves the following night (and broke the losing 
skein), and then Bristol was rehired for the balance of the season. However, 
that chaotic season was followed by one of the most important events in 
Braves' history: the hiring of Bobby Cox, briefly a Braves' farm system 
player, as manager for 1978. Cox was then a 36-year-old, relatively unknown 
former third baseman who had spent the previous ten seasons in the New 
York Yankees' organization, including six years (1971–1976) as a highly 
successful minor league manager and one season as the first-base coach 
on the Yankees' 1977 world championship team. Cox would spend four seasons, 
1978–1981, during this first term in the Braves' dugout. While his first 
two years produced frustrating, last-place seasons in the National League 
West, by Cox' third year, 1980, the Braves posted a winning (81–80) mark 
and rose to fourth place in their division. Attendance began to climb, 
with the team exceeding the one-million mark at Atlanta Fulton County Stadium 
for the first time since 1971.[4] But the strike-shortened 1981 season 
was a major disappointment; the Braves fell to 50–56, and Cox was fired. 
He went 266–323 (.452) during his inaugural tenure. His successor, former 
New York Mets skipper Joe Torre, would lead the Braves to the 1982 National 
League West Division championship. Cox would land with the Toronto Blue 
Jays as their 1982 manager. The Jays were then a five-year-old expansion 
team that had never escaped the basement of the American League East Division, 
nor won more than 67 games in a season. By Cox' second season, the Blue 
Jays broke the .500 mark, and by his fourth, in 1985, they would win 99 
games and the AL East title. Meanwhile, the Braves' front office was in 
flux and owner Turner was seeking a strong hand to take over the team's 
baseball operations as general manager. He lured Cox back to Atlanta with 
a multi-year contract.[5] And, although the team struggled desperately 
on the field in the late 1980s, general manager Cox was assembling a base 
of talent that, when he returned to the dugout to manage the Braves for 
his second term, on June 23, 1990, would ignite a series of first-place 
divisional teams (for 15 out of 16 straight seasons) and five National 
League pennant winners (as well as the 1995 World Series title) that would 
earn Cox a place in the Baseball Hall of Fame by his 2010 retirement. Infielders
