As player As manager William Edwin Burwell (March 27, 1895 – June 11, 1973) 
was an American right-handed relief pitcher in Major League Baseball for 
the St. Louis Browns and Pittsburgh Pirates. Born in Jarbalo, Kansas, Burwell 
won 239 minor league games during a 22-year playing career. He pitched 
for all or parts of 12 straight seasons (1923–34) for the Indianapolis 
Indians of the American Association. He also fashioned a lengthy post-pitching 
career as a minor league manager (including two seasons, 1945–46, as skipper 
of the Indianapolis franchise) and Major League pitching coach. He worked 
in the latter role for the Boston Red Sox (1944) and Pittsburgh Pirates 
(1947–48; 1958–62). Burwell was acting manager of the Pirates for the final 
game of the 1947 season, after player-manager Billy Herman resigned as 
manager with one game remaining.[1] Under Burwell, the Pirates defeated 
the Cincinnati Reds, 7-0.[1] He also was a longtime scout for the Pirates. 
While working as pitching coach for the Class B Davenport Pirates of the 
Illinois–Indiana–Iowa League in 1949, Burwell was instrumental to the development 
of pitcher Vern Law, teaching him how to change speeds and throw the change-up.[1] 
Law later cited Burwell as the coach who most helped him during his time 
in the minor leagues.[1] Burwell died at age 78 in Ormond Beach, Florida
