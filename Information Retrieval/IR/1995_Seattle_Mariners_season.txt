The Seattle Mariners' 1995 season was the 19th in the history of the franchise. 
The team finished with a regular season record of 79–66, tying the California 
Angels for first in the American League West. In a one-game tiebreaker, 
the Mariners defeated the Angels 9–1 to make the postseason for the first 
time in franchise history.[1] In the postseason, the Mariners defeated 
the New York Yankees in the best-of-five American League Division Series 
after being down 2 games to 0, a series notable for Edgar Martínez' 11th-inning 
double that clinched the series for the Mariners. They were subsequently 
defeated in the American League Championship Series by the Cleveland Indians, 
4–2. Infielders Coaches [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12]
