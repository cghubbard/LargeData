degree at the University of Oklahoma. His broadcasting career began at 
age 14 when he broadcast a few innings in several games involving Shawnee's 
Class D baseball team, the Hawks, a Los Angeles Dodgers farm club, over 
KGFF. At age 15, Porter was elevated to play-by-play man of the Shawnee 
Wolves' football and basketball broadcasts and the Hawks when the regular 
announcer resigned. At a high school football game one night, Ross was 
introduced by his father to the legendary Jim Thorpe. After earning his

to give up his NBC assignments when he joined the Dodgers in 1977 due to
