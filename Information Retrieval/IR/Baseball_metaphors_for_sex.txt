Among American adolescents, baseball metaphors for sex are often used as 
euphemisms for the degree of physical intimacy achieved in sexual encounters 
or relationships.[1] In the metaphor, first prevalent in the aftermath 
of World War II, sexual activities are described as if they are actions 
in a game of baseball.[2][3] Among the most commonly used metaphors are 
the bases describing levels of physical intimacy (generally from a heterosexual 
perspective). Definitions vary, but the following are typical usages of 
the terms:[4] Additionally, Additionally, there are two metaphors used 
to refer to men who have sex with men: Other similar metaphors include: 
The metaphors are found variously in popular American culture, with one 
well-known example in the Meat Loaf song "Paradise by the Dashboard Light", 
which describes a young couple "making out", with a voice-over commentary, 
by baseball announcer Phil Rizzuto, of a portion of a baseball game as 
a metaphor for the couple's activities.[5] A similar example can be found 
in Billy Joel's song "Zanzibar" in which he compares himself to Pete Rose 
and sings the lines "Me, I'm trying just to get to second base and I'd 
steal it if she only gave the sign. She's gonna give the go ahead, the 
inning isn't over yet for me."[6] David Letterman chronicled many of these 
in his "Top Ten Baseball Euphemisms for Sex" â€” a recurring theme on the 
Top Ten Lists featured on the late-night talk shows he hosted before retiring 
in May, 2015.[7] Educators have found the baseball metaphor an effective 
instructional tool when providing sex education to middle school students.[8] 
Leman and Bell, in their book A Chicken's Guide to Talking Turkey With 
Your Kids About Sex, make use of it to aid parents in the discussion of 
puberty with their children, dividing the topics into "first base" ("Changes 
from the neck up"), "second base" ("Changes from the neck to the waist"), 
"third base" ("Changes from the waist down"), and "home plate" ("The Big 
'It'").[9] This sequence of "running the bases" is often regarded as a 
script, or pattern, for young people who are experimenting with sexual 
relationships. The script may have slightly changed since the 1960s. Kohl 
and Francoeur state that with the growing emphasis in the 1990s on safe 
sex to expand sex beyond heterosexual penetrative intercourse, the "home 
run" has taken on the additional dimension of oral sex. Richters and Rissel 
conversely state that "third base" is now sometimes considered to comprise 
oral sex as part of the accepted pattern of activities, as a precursor
