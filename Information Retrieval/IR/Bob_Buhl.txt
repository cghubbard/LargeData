Robert Ray Buhl (August 12, 1928 – February 16, 2001) was an American right-handed 
starting pitcher in Major League Baseball who played with the Milwaukee 
Braves, Chicago Cubs, and Philadelphia Phillies. His last name rhymes with 
"fuel". A native of Saginaw, Michigan, in a 15-year career Buhl posted 
a 166–132 record with 1288 strikeouts and a 3.55 ERA in 2587 innings. He 
pitched 111 complete games and compiled 20 shutouts. He was first signed 
to a major league contract in 1953 by Milwaukee Braves scout Earle W. Halstead. 
Buhl compiled an 8–1 record against the National League champion Brooklyn 
Dodgers in 1956, en route to an 18-win season. He repeated as an 18-game 
winner the following year, helping the Braves capture NL pennants in both 
1957 and 1958 as the third starter behind Warren Spahn and Lew Burdette. 
In 1957, Buhl led the National League in winning percentage (.720), with 
an 18–7 record. In 1959, Buhl won 15 games and led the National League 
with four shutouts. His most productive season came in 1960, when he finished 
with a 16–9 record, a 3.09 ERA and an All-Star berth. In 1962, Buhl was 
traded to the Cubs after appearing in just one game for the Braves. He 
had 12 wins against 13 losses, a considerably better percentage than the 
9th-place Cubs (59–103 .364) achieved overall that year. He was traded 
to the Philadelphia Phillies in 1966 in a deal which brought future Hall-of-Famer 
Ferguson Jenkins to Chicago. in 1962, Buhl failed to get a hit in 70 at-bats.
