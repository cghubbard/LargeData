Alvin Jacob Powell (July 15, 1908 – November 4, 1948), was an outfielder 
for the Washington Senators (1930, 1934–36 and 1943–45), New York Yankees 
(1936–40) and Philadelphia Phillies (1945). Powell helped the Yankees win 
the World Series every year from 1936 to 1939 and batted .455 in the 1936 
series. In eleven seasons, he played in 688 games and had 2,540 at bats, 
353 runs, 689 hits, 116 doubles, 26 triples, 22 home runs, 327 RBI, 65 
stolen bases, 173 walks, a .271 batting average, .320 on-base percentage, 
.363 slugging percentage, 923 total bases and 43 sacrifice hits. Asked 
by WGN radio announcer Bob Elson how he stayed in shape during the offseason, 
in a dugout interview in a July 1938 game versus the Chicago White Sox 
at Comiskey Park, Powell replied to Elson that he was a policeman in his 
hometown of Dayton, Ohio (in reality he had only applied), and that he 
"beat n-----s over the head with my blackjack." He was subsequently suspended 
for 10 days by Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis, for making "an uncomplimentary 
reference to a portion of the population."[1] He was later ordered by the 
Yankees to walk through Harlem as an act of apology, accompanied by noted 
Black aviator Hubert Julian.[1] The racist Powell also purposefully collided 
with Jewish star Hank Greenberg, costing Greenberg his season after only 
12 games with a broken wrist. Powell played in 31 games in 1939 and 12 
games in 1940 before the Yankees sold him to the minor leagues.[1] In the 
fall of 1944, during World War II, Powell served as an emergency police 
officer in Montgomery County, Maryland. He returned to baseball at the 
start of the 1945 season. In 1948, Powell tried to make a comeback, playing 
in 31 games for the Gainesville G-Men of the Florida State League, but 
batted just .220. In November 1948, Powell was arrested in Washington, 
D.C. for passing bad checks. He drew a revolver while at a police station
