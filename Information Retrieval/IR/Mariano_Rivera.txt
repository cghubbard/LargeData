Mariano Rivera (born November 29, 1969) is a Panamanian former professional 
baseball pitcher who played 19 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) for 
the New York Yankees, from 1995 to 2013. Nicknamed "Mo"[1] and "Sandman",[2] 
Rivera spent most of his career as a relief pitcher and served as the Yankees' 
closer for 17 seasons. A thirteen-time All-Star and five-time World Series 
champion, he is MLB's career leader in saves (652) and games finished (952). 
Rivera won five American League (AL) Rolaids Relief Man Awards and three 
Delivery Man of the Year Awards, and he finished in the top three in voting 
for the AL Cy Young Award four times. Rivera was signed by the Yankees 
organization in Panama in 1990, and he debuted in the major leagues in 
1995. Initially a starting pitcher, he was converted to a relief pitcher 
late in his rookie year. After a breakthrough season in 1996 as a setup 
man, he became the Yankees' closer in 1997. In the following seasons, he 
established himself as one of baseball's top relievers, leading the major 
leagues in saves in 1999, 2001, and 2004. Rivera primarily threw a sharp-moving, 
mid-90s mile-per-hour cut fastball that frequently broke hitters' bats 
and earned a reputation as one of the league's toughest pitches to hit. 
With his presence at the end of games, signaled by his foreboding entrance 
song "Enter Sandman", Rivera was a key contributor to the Yankees' success 
in the late 1990s and early 2000s. An accomplished postseason performer, 
he was named the 1999 World Series Most Valuable Player (MVP) and the 2003 
AL Championship Series MVP, and he holds several postseason records, including 
lowest earned run average (ERA) (0.70) and most saves (42). Rivera is regarded 
within baseball as one of the most dominant relievers in major league history. 
Pitching with a longevity and consistency uncommon to the closer role, 
he saved at least 25 games in 15 consecutive seasons and posted an ERA 
under 2.00 in 11 seasons, both of which are records. His career 2.21 ERA 
and 1.00 WHIP are the lowest in the live-ball era among qualified pitchers. 
Fellow players credit him with popularizing the cut fastball across the 
major leagues. Along with his signature pitch, Rivera was known for his 
precise control, smooth pitching motion, and for his composure and reserved 
demeanor on the field. In 2013, the Yankees retired his uniform number 
42; he was the last major league player to wear the number full-time, following 
its league-wide retirement in honor of Jackie Robinson. Rivera has been 
involved in philanthropic causes and the Christian community through the 
Mariano Rivera Foundation. He is considered to be a strong candidate for 
the Baseball Hall of Fame once he is eligible.[3] Mariano Rivera was born 
in Panama City, Panama, on November 29, 1969,[4] to Mariano Rivera Palacios 
and Delia Jiron.[5] The couple's second child, Rivera has one older sister, 
Delia, and two younger brothers, Alvaro and Giraldo.[6] Supported by Mariano, 
Sr.'s job as captain of a fishing boat,[7] the family lived in Puerto Caimito, 
a Panamanian fishing village that Rivera described as "poor".[8] As a young 
man, Rivera played soccer and baseball with his friends on the beach during 
low tide.[2] Soccer was his favorite sport, while his favorite athlete 
was Pelé.[9] For baseball games, they substituted cardboard milk cartons 
for gloves and tree branches for bats,[10] and they fashioned balls by 
taping worn-out baseballs and wads of shredded fishing nets.[11][12] Rivera 
used this makeshift equipment until his father bought him his first leather 
glove when he was 12 years old.[13] Speaking about his youth, Rivera said 
that although he stayed out of trouble, he "was hanging with the wrong 
people".[14] Rivera attended Escuela Victoriano Chacón for elementary school 
and La Escuela Secundaria Pedro Pablo Sanchez for his secondary education,[15] 
but he dropped out in ninth grade.[16] At age 16, he began working six-day 
weeks on a commercial boat captained by his father, catching sardines.[11][12] 
The job was "extremely hard" for Rivera, who was more interested in becoming 
a mechanic.[12] He decided to give up fishing as a career after abandoning 
a capsizing 120-short-ton (110 t) commercial boat as a 19-year-old,[10] 
and after his uncle died from injuries suffered on a fishing boat.[5] Rivera 
continued to play sports during his teenage years but eventually quit soccer 
after a series of ankle and knee injuries around age 17. Consequently, 
he shifted his attention to baseball but considered it just a hobby rather 
than a possible profession.[11][17] In 1988, Rivera joined Panamá Oeste, 
a local amateur baseball team, as their shortstop.[7] Scout Herb Raybourn 
watched him play in a baseball tournament but did not project him to be 
a major league shortstop.[18] A year later,[7] Panamá Oeste's pitcher performed 
so poorly in a playoff game that Rivera was asked to replace him, and despite 
no experience at the position, he pitched well.[19] Teammates Claudino 
Hernández and Emilio Gáez consequently contacted Chico Heron, a scout for 
the New York Yankees. Two weeks after his pitching debut, Rivera was invited 
to a Yankees tryout camp run by Heron in Panama City.[7] Raybourn, who 
had returned to Panama to scout as the Yankees' director of Latin American 
operations, received a tip about Rivera. Raybourn was surprised to hear 
he had switched positions but decided to watch him throw.[18] Although 
Rivera had no formal pitching training, weighed just 155 pounds (70 kg), 
and threw only 85–87 miles per hour (137–140 kilometres per hour), Raybourn 
was impressed by his athleticism and smooth, effortless pitching motion.[7] 
Viewing Rivera as a raw talent, Raybourn signed the amateur free agent 
to a contract with the Yankees organization on February 17, 1990;[7] the 
contract included a signing bonus of US$2,500 ($4,536 today), according 
to Major League Baseball (MLB) records.[18] After signing his contract, 
Rivera—who spoke no English and had never left home—flew to the United 
States and reported to the Gulf Coast League (GCL) Yankees, a Rookie level 
minor league affiliate of the New York Yankees.[11] Feeling lonely and 
homesick, he wrote home to his parents often, as they did not have access 
to telephones in Puerto Caimito.[13] At that point in his career, scouts 
considered Rivera to be a "fringe prospect" at best,[20] but he made progress 
with a strong 1990 season for the GCL Yankees. Pitching mostly in relief, 
he allowed only 24 baserunners and one earned run in 52 innings pitched—a 
0.17 earned run average (ERA).[21] The team permitted Rivera to start the 
season's final game in order for him to accumulate enough innings pitched 
to qualify for the league's ERA title (which carried a $500 bonus); his 
subsequent seven-inning no-hitter "put him on the map with the organization", 
according to manager Glenn Sherlock.[22] In the offseason, Rivera returned 
to Panama, where a tip from him to Raybourn led to the Yankees signing 
a promising local 16-year-old player, Rivera's cousin Rubén.[7] In 1991, 
Mariano was promoted to the Class A level Greensboro Hornets of the South 
Atlantic League, where he started 15 of the 29 games he pitched in. Despite 
a 4–9 win–loss record, he recorded a 2.75 ERA in 114 2⁄3 innings pitched 
and struck out 123 batters while walking 36 batters.[21] New York Yankees 
manager Buck Showalter took notice of Rivera's strong strikeout-to-walk 
ratio, calling it "impressive in any league" and saying, "This guy is going 
to make it."[23] In 1992, Rivera was promoted to the Class A-Advanced level 
Fort Lauderdale Yankees of the Florida State League (FSL). He started 10 games 
for Fort Lauderdale, compiling a 5–3 win–loss record and a 2.28 ERA.[21] 
He attempted to improve the movement on his slider pitch by snapping his 
wrist during his throwing motion, but he inadvertently caused damage to 
the ulnar collateral ligament (UCL) in his right elbow.[24] Rivera underwent 
surgery in August 1992 to repair the damage, ending his season and interrupting 
his minor league career.[24] Contrary to popular belief, he did not have 
Tommy John surgery; his surgeon, Dr. Frank Jobe, determined that ligament 
replacement was not necessary and was instead able to repair the frayed 
UCL.[25] Rivera's rehabilitation coincided with MLB's 1992 expansion draft 
to fill the rosters for two expansion teams, the Florida Marlins and Colorado 
Rockies. Rivera was left unprotected by the Yankees but was not drafted.[10] 
He successfully rehabilitated his arm in early 1993 and resumed pitching 
that year. He first joined the Rookie level Yankees to make two abbreviated 
starts, before returning to the Class A level Hornets to start ten more 
games.[21] Witnessing him rehabilitate, the Hornets' official scorer Ogi 
Overman was not optimistic about Rivera's future, saying, "I thought [he] 
was on a one-way trip to nowhere."[26] In 1994, he was promoted from the 
Class A-Advanced level Tampa Yankees of the FSL to the Double-A level Albany-Colonie 
Yankees of the Eastern League, and then to the Triple-A level Columbus 
Clippers of the International League. Rivera finished the year with a 10–2 record 
in 22 starts, although he struggled for Columbus, recording a 5.81 ERA 
in six starts.[21] Beginning the 1995 season with Columbus, he was ranked 
by sports magazine Baseball America as the ninth-best prospect in the Yankees 
organization;[27] by contrast, the publication ranked Rivera's highly touted 
cousin Rubén as the second-best prospect in baseball.[28] Mariano's pitching 
repertoire primarily consisted of fastballs at the time, although he threw 
a slider and changeup as secondary pitches.[24] After being called up to 
the major leagues on May 16, 1995,[29] Rivera made his debut for the New 
York Yankees on May 23 against the California Angels.[4] Starting in place 
of injured pitcher Jimmy Key,[30] Rivera allowed five earned runs in 3 1⁄3 innings 
pitched in a 10–0 loss.[4] He struggled through his first four major league 
starts, posting a 10.20 ERA, and as a result, he was demoted to Columbus 
on June 11.[4] As a 25-year-old rookie just three years removed from major 
arm surgery, his spot on the team was not guaranteed. Management considered 
trading him to the Detroit Tigers for starter David Wells.[31] While recovering 
from a sore shoulder in the minor leagues, Rivera pitched a no-hit shutout 
in a rain-shortened five-inning start.[32] Reports from the game indicated 
that his pitches had reached 95–96 mph (153–154 km/h), about 6 mph (9.7 km/h) 
faster than his previous average velocity; Rivera attributes his inexplicable 
improvement to God. Yankees general manager Gene Michael was skeptical 
of the reports until verifying that Columbus' radar gun was not faulty 
and that another team's scout had taken the same measurements. Afterwards, 
he ended any trade negotiations involving Rivera.[27] On July 4, in his 
first start back in the major leagues, Rivera pitched eight scoreless innings 
against the Chicago White Sox, allowing just two hits while striking out 
11 batters.[33] In five subsequent starts, he was unable to match his success 
from that game.[33] After a brief demotion to Columbus in August, Rivera 
made one last start in the major leagues in September before he was moved 
to the Yankees' bullpen.[27] Overall, he finished his first major league 
season with a 5–3 record and a 5.51 ERA in ten starts and nine relief outings.[34] 
His performance in the 1995 American League Division Series, in which he 
pitched 5 1⁄3 scoreless innings of relief, convinced Yankees management 
to keep him and convert him to a relief pitcher the following season.[35] 
"He needs to pitch in a higher league, if there is one. Ban him from baseball. 
He should be illegal." In 1996, Rivera served primarily as a setup pitcher, 
typically pitching in the seventh and eighth innings of games before closer 
John Wetteland pitched in the ninth.[10] Their effectiveness as a tandem 
helped the Yankees win 70 of 73 games when leading after six innings that 
season.[37] Over a stretch of games between April 19 and May 21, Rivera 
pitched 26 consecutive scoreless innings,[38] including 15 consecutive 
hitless innings.[39] During the streak, he recorded his first career save 
in a May 17 game against the Angels.[40] Rivera finished the regular season 
with a 2.09 ERA in 107 2⁄3 innings pitched and set a Yankees single-season 
record for strikeouts by a reliever (130).[11] In the postseason, he allowed 
just one earned run in 14 1⁄3 innings pitched,[41] helping the Yankees 
advance to and win the 1996 World Series against the Atlanta Braves;[42] 
it was the franchise's first World Series championship since 1978.[42] 
In MLB's annual awards voting by the Baseball Writers' Association of America, 
Rivera finished in twelfth place for the American League (AL) Most Valuable 
Player (MVP) Award and third for the AL Cy Young Award, which is given 
to the league's best pitcher.[43] Commentator and former player Tim McCarver 
wrote that the Yankees "revolutionized baseball" that year with Rivera, 
"a middle reliever who should have been on the All-Star team and who was 
a legitimate MVP candidate."[44] Impressed by Rivera's pitching, Yankees 
management chose not to re-sign Wetteland in the offseason, opting instead 
to replace him as closer with Rivera.[10] In April 1997, MLB retired the 
uniform number 42 league-wide to honor Jackie Robinson for breaking the 
baseball color line, although Rivera was among a dozen players allowed 
to continue wearing the number per a grandfather clause.[45] Rivera's transition 
from setup man to closer in 1997 was not seamless; he blew three of his 
first six save opportunities and indicated that he was initially uncomfortable 
in the role.[46][47] With reassurance from manager Joe Torre, Rivera settled 
into the ninth-inning role,[10] and he earned his first All-Star selection 
with 27 saves and a 1.96 ERA at the midseason break.[48] In the 1997 All-Star 
Game, he pitched a perfect ninth inning to collect his first save in an 
All-Star Game.[48] That summer, he added a cut fastball to his pitching 
repertoire after accidentally discovering how to throw the pitch.[49] Rivera 
finished the regular season with 43 saves in 52 opportunities with a 1.88 ERA.[50] 
His first year as closer ended with a blown save in Game 4 of the 1997 
AL Division Series against the Cleveland Indians; with the Yankees four 
outs from advancing to the next round of the postseason, Rivera allowed 
a game-tying home run to Sandy Alomar, Jr. The Yankees eventually lost 
that game and the next, eliminating them from the postseason.[31] After 
spending two weeks on the disabled list with a groin strain during the 
opening month of the 1998 season,[51] Rivera continued to establish himself 
as one of the major leagues' best closers. Moreover, he became the central 
figure of a Yankees bullpen that, supported by middle relievers Jeff Nelson 
and Mike Stanton, contributed to the team's late-1990s dynasty.[52] That 
year, Rivera made the cutter one of his primary pitches, and it quickly 
became his signature, earning a reputation for breaking hitters' bats with 
its sharp lateral movement.[53][54] He saved 36 games in 41 opportunities 
and had a 1.91 ERA in the regular season.[34] In the 1998 postseason, he 
pitched 13 1⁄3 scoreless innings and saved six games,[41] three of which 
came in the 1998 World Series against the San Diego Padres.[55] Rivera's 
save in Game 4 of the series clinched the Yankees' championship, capping 
off a season in which they won an MLB-record 125 games combined in the 
regular season and the postseason.[55] By season's end, Rivera had allowed 
only two earned runs in 35 career postseason innings pitched—a 0.51 ERA—and 
by passing 30 innings pitched, he qualified for the major league record 
for lowest postseason career ERA;[56] it is a record he still holds after 
141 innings pitched.[41][57] In 1999, Rivera was selected for the All-Star 
team for a second time with 23 saves and a 2.29 ERA in the first half of 
the season.[50][58] That summer, the Yankee Stadium scoreboard production 
staff began playing the song "Enter Sandman" by heavy metal band Metallica 
as Rivera's entrance music. Staff members selected the song after witnessing 
in the previous year's World Series how enthusiastically San Diego fans 
reacted to closer Trevor Hoffman entering games accompanied by AC/DC's 
"Hells Bells". Although Rivera was indifferent about his entrance music, 
"Enter Sandman" soon became as much a part of his identity as a closer 
as his cutter did.[59] After recording three blown saves and a 7.84 ERA 
in July, he allowed just one earned run over his last 30 appearances.[58][60] 
He ended the season with a 1.83 ERA and 45 saves in 49 opportunities, his 
first time leading the major leagues in saves. He received his first AL 
Rolaids Relief Man Award, an annual award for the league's best closer 
based on their statistics.[50] In the 1999 World Series against the Braves, 
Rivera recorded a win and two saves, the second of which clinched the Yankees' 
championship title, his third overall. For his performance against Atlanta, 
he received the World Series MVP Award.[61] Rivera finished 1999 by pitching 
43 consecutive scoreless innings in the regular season and postseason combined,[61] 
and he placed third in voting for the AL Cy Young Award.[62] After the 
season, he revealed tentative plans to retire and become a minister after 
playing four more seasons, though he backed off these plans the following 
year.[63] In the offseason, Rivera lost his salary arbitration case, in 
which he requested an annual salary of $9.25 million, but arbitrators awarded 
him $7.25 million per year, which was at the time the highest arbitration 
award in baseball history.[64] In the 2000 season, Rivera was selected 
as an All-Star for the third time.[50] On July 8, he saved two games played 
in two different ballparks as part of a day-night doubleheader against 
the New York Mets at Shea Stadium and Yankee Stadium.[65] He ended the 
season with 36 saves in 41 opportunities and a 2.85 ERA.[50] In the postseason, 
Rivera saved six games, allowed three earned runs in 15 2⁄3 innings pitched,[41] 
and broke two major league records: he eclipsed Dennis Eckersley's record 
for postseason saves with the 16th of his career;[66] he also broke Whitey 
Ford's record for consecutive scoreless innings pitched in postseason play, 
a streak that ended shortly thereafter at 33 1⁄3 innings.[67] In the 2000 
World Series against the Mets, Rivera clinched a championship for his team 
for the third consecutive year. It was his fourth World Series title overall.[63] 
By this point, he had established a reputation as an exceptional postseason 
performer[31]—journalist Jack Curry called him the "infallible weapon" 
and "the greatest reason the Yankees [were] three-time champions".[63] 
With Rivera's contract set to expire after 2001, the Yankees signed him 
to a four-year, $39.99 million deal prior to the season, marking the first 
long-term contract of his career.[68] In 2001, he was selected for the 
All-Star team for a third consecutive year. His final numbers included 
a 2.34 ERA, a closer career-high 80 2⁄3 innings pitched, and an MLB-leading 
50 saves in 57 opportunities—his second time leading the league.[50] His 
saves total that year surpassed Dave Righetti's 46 saves in 1986 for most 
by a Yankee pitcher in a single season,[69] and made him just the sixth 
MLB pitcher to reach 50 saves in a single season.[70] Rivera's performance 
earned him his second AL Rolaids Relief Man Award.[10] Despite having what 
sportswriters deemed an "aura of invincibility" in the postseason,[71] 
Rivera failed to close out the decisive Game 7 of the 2001 World Series 
against the Arizona Diamondbacks. In one of his most infamous moments, 
he blew a save in the bottom of the ninth inning, in part due to his own 
throwing error, and he lost the Series later in the inning by allowing 
Luis Gonzalez's bloop single with the bases loaded to score the winning 
run.[10] It was Rivera's first and only loss of his postseason career,[72] 
and it snapped his record streak of 23 consecutive postseason saves converted.[73] 
On May 19, 2002, Rivera recorded his 225th career save, surpassing Dave 
Righetti as the Yankees' franchise leader in saves.[74] Over the next few 
months of the season, injuries limited his playing time. He was first placed 
on the disabled list in June due to a groin strain,[75] though his first-half 
numbers, which included a 1.47 ERA and 21 saves,[76] earned him an All-Star 
selection.[50] In a game on July 14, Rivera endured one of his worst outings, 
allowing six earned runs, including a walk-off grand slam. One week later, 
he was placed on the disabled list with a shoulder strain. Rivera was activated 
on August 8 after receiving a cortisone shot but returned to the disabled 
list after a recurrence of shoulder tightness.[77] For the season, Rivera 
recorded a 2.74 ERA and 28 saves in 32 opportunities in just 46 innings 
pitched.[34] To placate the Yankees' concerns about his durability, Rivera 
followed a strength and conditioning program in the offseason, instead 
of throwing.[78] Torre said that he would try to reduce Rivera's workload 
during the 2003 season to minimize the injury risk to his closer.[79] However, 
Rivera suffered a groin injury before the season began, causing him to 
miss the first month.[80] After returning on April 30,[80] he pitched well 
in the season's first half, saving 16 games in 17 opportunities.[81] His 
save on June 12 against the St. Louis Cardinals secured the 300th career 
win for starter Roger Clemens.[82] Rivera slumped early in the second half; 
over one stretch, he blew five of eleven save opportunities,[83] but he 
rebounded to convert his final 15 of the season.[84] He finished the 2003 
regular season with a new career best in ERA (1.66), along with 40 saves 
in 46 opportunities.[84] In the 2003 AL Championship Series against the 
arch-rival Boston Red Sox, Rivera had one of the most memorable postseason 
performances of his career; in the decisive Game 7, he entered in the ninth 
inning with the score tied 5–5 and pitched three scoreless innings, his 
longest outing since 1996. He became the winning pitcher after Aaron Boone 
hit an eleventh-inning walk-off home run that clinched the Yankees' series 
victory and advanced them to the 2003 World Series.[85] Rivera celebrated 
by running to the pitcher's mound and collapsing in joy to thank God, as 
Boone rounded the bases and was met by his teammates at home plate.[86] 
Rivera was named the AL Championship Series MVP for recording two saves 
and a win in the series.[85] The Yankees lost the World Series to the Florida 
Marlins;[87] Rivera saved five games and allowed only one earned run in 
16 innings pitched that postseason.[41] Prior to the 2004 season, with 
a year remaining on his contract, Rivera signed a two-year extension worth 
$21 million, with an option for a third year.[88] That season, Rivera surpassed 
300 career saves and made his sixth All-Star team with 32 saves at the 
midseason break, then an AL record.[50][89][90] His final numbers for the 
year included a 1.94 ERA and a career-high 53 saves in 57 opportunities; 
it was his third time leading the major leagues in saves. Along with winning 
a third AL Rolaids Relief Man Award, he placed third in the AL Cy Young 
Award voting.[50][91] Following the Yankees' victory in the 2004 AL Division 
Series against the Minnesota Twins, Rivera returned home to Panama to mourn 
two relatives who had died in an accident in his swimming pool. Despite 
his status being in doubt for the 2004 AL Championship Series against the 
Red Sox, he returned to New York for Game 1 after attending the funeral 
in Panama earlier in the day. He recorded a save that night, as well as 
in Game 2.[92] Although the Yankees led three-games-to-none in the series, 
Rivera blew saves in Games 4 and 5, and the Red Sox won both games in extra 
innings to avoid elimination. In Game 4, Boston's Dave Roberts pinch ran 
and stole second base against Rivera, eventually scoring on a single to 
tie the game.[93] In Game 5, Rivera entered with a one-run lead with runners 
on base and allowed a sacrifice fly to tie the score.[93] Although he allowed 
just one earned run in the 2004 postseason, he blew three of five save 
opportunities in the two series.[41] Boston's comeback victories helped 
them become the first team in MLB history to win a best-of-seven series 
in which they trailed three-games-to-none.[93] Following a career high 
in appearances in 2004,[94] Rivera did not throw during the offseason, 
unlike previous years.[95] His 2005 season began on a low note. After missing 
time in spring training with elbow bursitis, he blew his first two save 
opportunities of the season against the Red Sox, marking four consecutive 
blown opportunities against Boston dating back to the previous postseason.[95] 
Fans at Yankee Stadium booed Rivera,[96] and baseball journalists speculated 
if his days as a dominant pitcher were over.[95][97] He was subsequently 
cheered by Red Sox fans during pre-game introductions at Fenway Park the 
following week, in recognition of his struggles against the Red Sox. He 
responded to the ovation with a sense of humor by tipping his cap to the 
crowd.[98] Rivera rebounded in dominating fashion and finished 2005 with 
his greatest season to that point.[99] He was selected to the All-Star 
team,[50] converted 31 consecutive save opportunities,[100] and completed 
the season with 43 saves in 47 opportunities. He set new career bests in 
many statistical categories, including ERA (1.38) and walks plus hits per 
inning pitched, or WHIP (0.87). Rivera limited opposing hitters to a batting 
average against of .177, then the best mark of his closer career. In addition 
to winning a fourth AL Rolaids Relief Man Award, he placed second in voting 
for the AL Cy Young Award behind starter Bartolo Colón, and ninth for the 
AL MVP Award—his best finishes in voting for both awards.[50][101] During 
the postseason, MLB announced the Latino Legends Team, a fan-voted all-time 
roster of the greatest Latino players; Rivera was named the team's relief 
pitcher.[102] Rivera began 2006 with a 3.72 ERA and two losses in April, 
but his numbers improved in subsequent months.[103] On June 6, he saved 
his 391st career game, passing Dennis Eckersley for the fourth-most saves 
in major league history.[104] Rivera was selected to his third consecutive 
All-Star team with a 1.76 ERA and 19 saves entering the midseason break.[105] 
He saved the AL's comeback victory in the 2006 All-Star Game for his third 
career All-Star save, tying him with Eckersley for the most ever.[106] 
On July 16, Rivera achieved another milestone by becoming the fourth MLB 
pitcher to reach 400 saves.[107] Although a throwing elbow strain sidelined 
Rivera for most of September,[108] he finished the 2006 season with 34 saves 
in 37 opportunities and an ERA of 1.80—his fourth consecutive season with 
a sub-2.00 ERA.[34] For a second consecutive year, fans voted him the Delivery 
Man of the Year.[109] With his contract set to expire after the 2007 season, 
Rivera sought an extension with the Yankees during spring training. Team 
management refused to negotiate near the start of the season, prompting 
him to respond that he would consider free agency at the end of the year.[110] 
In April, Rivera blew his first two save opportunities, compiled two losses, 
and surrendered nine earned runs in 7 2⁄3 innings pitched.[111] Concerned 
sportswriters attributed his struggles to infrequent use, as the Yankees 
presented him with few situations to enter a game.[112] Rivera saved 30 
of his next 32 opportunities and posted a 2.26 ERA over the final five 
months of the season.[111] In addition, he passed John Franco for third 
place on the all-time saves list with his 425th career save.[113] Still, 
Rivera finished 2007 with closer career worsts in earned runs (25), hits 
(68), and ERA (3.15), and his 30 saves in 34 opportunities were his second-lowest 
total since 1997.[34] After the Yankees were eliminated from the playoffs 
in the opening round, Rivera stated his intentions to test the free agent 
market. He initially indicated that his decision of where to sign would 
be influenced by whether long-time manager Joe Torre was re-signed.[114] 
Although Torre did not return,[115] Rivera remained with the Yankees by 
agreeing to a three-year, $45 million contract, making him the highest-paid 
reliever in baseball history.[116] Rivera rebounded in 2008 and began the 
year with 16 consecutive scoreless innings pitched and 28 consecutive save 
opportunities converted, both personal bests to start a season.[117][118] 
His first-half performance, highlighted by a 1.06 ERA and 23 saves in as 
many opportunities,[119] garnered him his ninth All-Star selection. Leading 
up to the 2008 MLB All-Star Game, which was held at Yankee Stadium in the 
venue's final year of existence, a few sportswriters proposed making Rivera 
the AL's starting pitcher as a tribute to him and his home ballpark.[120][121] 
He instead was used as a reliever in the AL's extra-inning win.[118] In 
the final month of the season, he recorded two milestones: on September 15, 
he recorded his 479th save to pass Lee Smith for second all-time in regular 
season saves;[122] on September 21, in the final game at Yankee Stadium, 
Rivera threw the final pitch in the venue's history, retiring Brian Roberts 
of the Baltimore Orioles on a ground-out.[123] After the Yankees missed 
the postseason for the first time in his career, Rivera disclosed that 
he had suffered from shoulder pain throughout the year. Tests revealed 
calcification of the acromioclavicular joint in his throwing shoulder, 
for which he underwent minor arthroscopic surgery in the offseason.[124] 
Rivera's 2008 season was one of his best individual years. Along with a 
1.40 ERA and 39 saves in 40 opportunities, he set career bests in multiple 
statistical categories, including WHIP (0.67), on-base plus slugging (OPS)-against 
(.422), batting average against (.165), save percentage (97.5%), walks 
(6), earned runs (11), and blown saves (1). He averaged 9.81 strikeouts 
per 9 innings pitched, his best mark as a closer.[50] He pitched with such 
control that his 12.83 strikeout-to-walk ratio made him the second MLB 
pitcher ever to record a figure that high in a season (minimum 50 innings 
pitched).[125] He placed fifth in the AL Cy Young Award voting.[126] In 
his first 12 appearances of 2009, Rivera surrendered four home runs and 
had a 3.97 ERA,[127] leading to speculation about his cutter's effectiveness 
and his shoulder's health at age 39.[128] As the season progressed, his 
numbers improved, and he reached a milestone on June 28 by becoming the 
second pitcher with 500 regular season saves. In the same game, while batting 
against fellow closer Francisco Rodríguez, he collected his first career 
run batted in by walking with the bases loaded.[129] With 23 saves in 24 opportunities 
and a 2.43 ERA in the season's first half, Rivera was selected an All-Star 
for the tenth time.[130] At the 2009 MLB All-Star Game, he set a record 
by saving his fourth career All-Star Game.[131] In the season's second 
half, Rivera allowed earned runs in only two of his final 40 appearances,[132] 
while he set a new personal best for consecutive save opportunities converted 
with 36.[133] He finished the regular season with a 1.76 ERA, 44 saves 
in 46 opportunities, and a 0.90 WHIP.[34] In the postseason, he pitched 
16 innings, allowing one earned run and saving five games,[41] and he clinched 
the Yankees' victory in the 2009 World Series against the Philadelphia 
Phillies—his fifth championship. He was the only closer who did not record 
a loss or blown save that postseason.[134] Rivera collected several awards 
at season's end, including his third Delivery Man Award,[135] his fifth 
AL Rolaids Relief Man Award, and the 2009 Sporting News Pro Athlete of 
the Year Award.[136] Reflecting on the decade's end, ESPN.com's Jerry Crasnick 
called Rivera the most valuable major league pitcher of the previous 10 
years.[137] In 2010, Rivera and two of his "Core Four" teammates, Derek 
Jeter and Jorge Posada, became the first trio in any of the four major 
sports leagues in North America (MLB, NFL, NBA, or NHL) to play together 
on the same team for 16 consecutive seasons.[138] Rivera began with one 
of his best first halves, compiling a 1.05 ERA, 20 saves in 22 opportunities, 
and 0.64 WHIP before the All-Star break,[139] and in June, he set a personal 
best streak with 24 consecutive batters retired.[140] He earned an 11th 
All-Star selection but withdrew from the game due to lingering oblique 
and knee injuries.[141] In the second half, he was less effective—he struck 
out batters half as often, and in September, he compiled three blown saves 
and a 4.76 ERA.[139] Rivera ended 2010 with a 1.80 ERA and 0.83 WHIP, numbers 
that were among his career bests, though his 33 saves in 38 opportunities 
and 6.75 strikeouts per 9 innings ratio were below his career averages.[34] 
In the postseason, he pitched 6 1⁄3 scoreless innings while saving three 
games.[41] After becoming a free agent in the offseason, Rivera agreed 
to a two-year, $30 million contract to remain with the Yankees.[142] That 
same offseason, Trevor Hoffman retired as the all-time regular season saves 
leader with a final tally of 601, leaving Rivera as the active leader in 
saves and 42 behind Hoffman's record to start 2011.[143] Rivera's season 
was marked by several milestones. He broke the all-time record for games 
finished,[144] and in May, he became the 15th pitcher to make 1,000 appearances 
and the first to do so with a single team.[145] He was named an All-Star 
for the 12th time with a 1.85 ERA and 22 saves in 26 opportunities at the 
midseason break,[146] but for the second consecutive year, he skipped the 
game to rest injuries.[147] His pursuit of Hoffman's saves record reached 
a climax in the final month of the season; on September 13, he collected 
his 600th save, making him just the second pitcher to accomplish the feat.[148] 
Four days later, he saved his 601st game, tying him with Hoffman for the 
most in MLB history.[149] Rivera broke the record on September 19 at Yankee 
Stadium by closing out a 6–4 win against the Twins, the final out by strikeout.[150] 
After the game, Panamanian President Ricardo Martinelli called him to offer 
his congratulations.[151] Rivera finished the season with a 1.91 ERA, a 
0.90 WHIP, and 44 saves in 49 opportunities,[50] making him the first pitcher 
over the age of 40 to save at least 40 games in a season.[152] In the offseason, 
he underwent throat surgery to remove polyps from his vocal cords.[153] 
Rivera began the 2012 season by blowing a save on Opening Day but followed 
it with eight scoreless innings and five saves for the remainder of April.[154] 
After just nine appearances, his season was prematurely ended by a freak 
injury; prior to a May 3 game against the Kansas City Royals, Rivera twisted 
his right knee on the field's warning track while shagging balls during 
batting practice, causing him to tear his right anterior cruciate ligament 
(ACL).[154][155] Speculation grew that the injury would end his career, 
as he had hinted at retirement in spring training.[156][157] Rivera put 
those concerns to rest the following day when he announced his intentions 
to return, saying, "Write it down in big letters. I'm not going down like 
this."[158] He successfully underwent ACL reconstructive surgery on June 12, 
while his meniscus, previously thought to have been damaged, did not need 
to be repaired.[159] Rafael Soriano filled in as closer in Rivera's absence 
and saved 42 games in 46 opportunities.[160] Rivera signed a one-year, 
$10 million contract in the offseason to remain with the team.[161] After 
successfully rehabilitating his knee in the offseason, Rivera announced 
on March 9, 2013, that he would retire after the 2013 season, his 19th 
in the major leagues.[155] Throughout his final year, Rivera spent time 
during visits to each ballpark meeting privately with fans and unsung team 
employees to hear their stories and thank them for supporting baseball.[162] 
He explained: "It was important for me to meet the people who make baseball 
what it is, the people who work in the game every day. They have given 
me far more than I have given them."[163] Each opposing team returned the 
favor by honoring Rivera with a gift during his final visit to their city: 
in Cleveland, the Indians teamed up with the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame 
to present Rivera with a gold record of his entrance song "Enter Sandman";[164] 
the Minnesota Twins commissioned a rocking chair made of broken bats, many 
broken personally by Rivera's cutter, called the "Chair of Broken Dreams";[165] 
the rival Boston Red Sox gave him a painting and several artifacts from 
Fenway Park.[166] Many teams made donations to the Mariano Rivera Foundation, 
the pitcher's charitable organization.[166] Corporate sponsors of the Yankees 
paid tribute as well; Delta Air Lines dedicated a Boeing 757 airplane with 
Rivera's signature and uniform number 42 on the exterior,[167] while Hard 
Rock Cafe retired "Enter Sandman" from its song system at all locations 
except for its Yankee Stadium restaurant.[168] Rivera's 10 saves in 10 opportunities 
in April were his highest total for the opening month of a season.[169] 
He converted his first 18 save attempts of the season until blowing a save 
against the Mets on May 28; it was the first time that he blew a save and 
lost a game without recording an out.[170] Rivera entered the midseason 
break with 30 saves in 32 opportunities and a 1.83 ERA,[171] and he was 
named an All-Star for the 13th time in his career, the second-most All-Star 
selections for a pitcher behind Warren Spahn's 17.[172] During the All-Star 
Game, held at Citi Field in New York, Rivera was called upon to pitch in 
the eighth inning for his final All-Star appearance. As he trotted onto 
the field, players from both teams remained near their dugouts and joined 
fans in giving Rivera a standing ovation as he stood alone on the field.[173] 
Rivera retired all three batters he faced, preserving his 0.00 career ERA 
in All-Star Games.[173] He was named the All-Star Game MVP,[174] making 
him the first reliever selected to an All-Star team to ever receive the 
award, as well as the first pitcher since Pedro Martínez in 1999 and the 
second Yankee ever after Derek Jeter in 2000.[174] He became the first 
MLB player to be named the MVP of a World Series, League Championship Series, 
and All-Star Game.[4] Rivera's performance dipped in the second half of 
the season, as he blew five save opportunities in the last two months, 
including three consecutive chances for the first time in his career. In 
a Fox Sports documentary chronicling his final season, entitled Being: 
Mariano, Rivera said that his farewell to baseball had mentally and physically 
drained him and that by September, he had "no desire" left for the sport.[175] 
On September 22, 2013, a day that Mayor of New York City Michael Bloomberg 
declared "Mariano Rivera Day", the Yankees held a 50-minute pre-game tribute 
to Rivera at Yankee Stadium. In a ceremony attended by former teammates, 
Yankees staff, and members of Jackie Robinson's family, Rivera's uniform 
number 42 was retired by the team, making him the first active Yankee to 
receive that honor. Metallica performed "Enter Sandman" live as he walked 
onto the field during the festivities. The team presented a video montage 
and several gifts to Rivera before he addressed the crowd to offer his 
thanks.[176] Four days later against the Tampa Bay Rays, he pitched in 
the final game of his career before a home crowd at Yankee Stadium. Entering 
in the eighth inning to a pre-recorded introduction by late Yankees public 
address announcer Bob Sheppard, Rivera pitched 1 1⁄3 innings without allowing 
a baserunner. In the ninth inning, after retiring Yunel Escobar on a pop 
fly for the second out, Rivera was removed from the game; with permission 
from the umpires, Yankees manager Joe Girardi ceremonially delegated the 
substitution duty to Rivera's long-time teammates Andy Pettitte and Derek 
Jeter. After they reached the mound to make the pitching change, the normally 
reserved Rivera tearfully embraced his teammates for nearly a minute. Walking 
off the field to a standing ovation from fans and players, he saluted the 
crowd and then took a curtain call. After the game, he visited the mound 
for a final time and grabbed a handful of dirt as a memento.[177] Rivera 
finished his final season with a 2.11 ERA, 1.05 WHIP, and 44 saves in 51 opportunities,[34] 
earning him the AL Comeback Player of the Year Award, among several awards.[178] 
During the World Series, he was honored as the 13th recipient of the Commissioner's 
Historic Achievement Award for his accomplished career and for being "a 
great ambassador of the game".[179] Rivera's signature pitch was a cut 
fastball or "cutter", which exhibited lateral movement towards left-handed 
hitters similar to that of a slider but with the velocity of a fastball.[180] 
The sharp, late movement of Rivera's cutter prevented hitters from making 
contact with the ball on the sweet spot of their bats, leading to them 
not only making weak contact on batted balls but also frequently breaking 
their bats;[181] according to a tally by columnist Buster Olney, Rivera 
broke 44 bats during the 2001 regular season.[53] Chipper Jones, who once 
witnessed teammate Ryan Klesko break three bats in one plate appearance 
against Rivera in the 1999 World Series,[61] called the pitch a "buzz saw".[97] 
Rivera's long fingers and loose wrist contributed to the pitch's movement, 
allowing him to impart more spin on the ball.[49][182] Describing his grip 
of the cutter, he said, "it's really a four-seam fastball with pressure 
on the middle finger". By adjusting the pressure that he applied to the 
ball with his fingertips, Rivera could vary the pitch's movement.[49] He 
threw four-seam and two-seam fastballs as complementary pitches but primarily 
used his cutter; according to baseball statistics website Fangraphs, 83.3% 
of his pitches in 2010 were cutters.[183] All three pitches typically reached 
a velocity in the low-to-mid 90s mph.[31][183][184] Early in his major 
league career, Rivera was a "power pitcher" who relied on an overpowering 
four-seam fastball that topped out at 96 mph (154 km/h) to retire hitters.[185][186] 
By enticing them to swing and miss at pitches high in the strike zone, 
he accumulated strikeouts at a high rate.[186] Rivera changed his pitching 
style after accidentally discovering how to throw a cutter in June 1997;[186] 
during his daily warm-up tosses with teammate Ramiro Mendoza, Rivera noticed 
that his fastballs were moving sharply and unpredictably, a problem that 
began to occur in games as well.[49] After unsuccessfully spending a month 
trying to eliminate the movement, Rivera relented and incorporated the 
cutter into his pitching repertoire,[49] eventually making it one of his 
primary pitches in 1998.[54] When asked about the pitch's origin, he explained, 
"It was just from God. I didn't do anything. It was natural."[187] As he 
came to rely on the cutter, Rivera began to record more outs on batted 
balls.[186] Consequently, his strikeout rate decreased in subsequent years, 
dropping from 10.87 strikeouts per 9 innings in 1996 to 5.3 in 1998,[50] 
but at the benefit of more efficiency; his pitches per inning rate dropped 
from 18.7 in 1995 to 14.9 in 1998.[186] Rivera had an impeccable ability 
to accurately locate pitches and consistently throw strikes, particularly 
on the inside and outside edges of the strike zone. This strength offset 
his reliance on one pitch and hitters' anticipation of it.[188][189] His 
former catcher Joe Girardi said, "He was so easy to catch because he always 
put the ball right there. I don't think there's ever been a pitcher that 
great who was so easy to catch."[190] Rivera's 4.10 career strikeout-to-walk 
ratio in the regular season ranks sixth-best in major league history.[191] 
His control was a byproduct of his smooth, easily repeated pitching motion,[49] 
which some opposing hitters found to be deceptive; Darrin Fletcher said 
in 1999 that Rivera "almost kind of lulls you to sleep with his delivery. 
It gives you a false sense of security, and then the ball is on you and 
it's exploding."[181] "You know what's coming, but you know what's coming 
in horror movies too. It still gets you." Rivera's cut fastball was a respected 
pitch among major league hitters.[35][184] Jim Thome called it "the single 
best pitch ever in the game".[192] In 2004, ESPN.com ranked his cutter 
as the best "out pitch" in baseball.[193] Olney described his cut fastball 
as "the most dominant pitch of a generation".[194] Although switch-hitters 
usually bat left-handed against right-handed pitchers to better see the 
ball's release point, switch-hitters occasionally batted right-handed when 
facing the right-handed Rivera to avoid being jammed on their hands by 
his cutter.[195] Similarly, some managers, such as Bruce Bochy in the 1998 
World Series, sent right-handed batters to pinch hit for left-handed batters 
against Rivera, thinking that the cutter would be more difficult for lefties 
to hit.[196] Opposing batters occasionally chose to face Rivera with backup 
or batting practice bats, rather than risk their best bats being shattered 
by his cutter.[49][181] Rivera was considered an exceptional athlete, distinguished 
by his slender physique and durability.[35] His propensity to shag balls 
during batting practice convinced scouts he could be a top AL center fielder. 
Olney compared Rivera's regimen of physical preparation and guidelines 
for staying healthy to Satchel Paige's "Rules for Staying Young".[197] 
Rivera exhibited a reserved demeanor on the field that contrasted with 
the emotional, demonstrative temperament of many of his peers.[49] Hall 
of Fame closer Goose Gossage said that Rivera's composure under stress 
gave him the appearance of having "ice water in his veins".[31][198] Commenting 
on his ability to remain focused in pressure situations, Rivera said, "When 
you start thinking, a lot of things will happen... If you don't control 
your emotions, your emotions will control your acts, and that's not good." 
His ability to compartmentalize his successes and failures impressed fellow 
reliever Joba Chamberlain, who said, "He's won and lost some of the biggest 
games in the history of baseball, and he's no worse for the wear when he 
gives up a home run."[199] Rivera explained the need to quickly forget 
bad performances, saying "the game that you're going to play tomorrow is 
not going to be the same game that you just played."[200] Derek Jeter called 
him the "most mentally tough" teammate with whom he had ever played.[99] 
During his playing career, Rivera was regarded as a team leader within 
the Yankees organization, often mentoring younger pitchers and counseling 
teammates.[201] He had a team-first mindset and deferred most discussions 
about individual accolades to team goals and his teammates, praising them 
for making his presence in games possible.[148] When once asked to describe 
his job, Rivera put it simply, "I get the ball, I throw the ball, and then 
I take a shower."[202] "When you go back and look at his career and what 
he's done with that one pitch, I don't think there's a greater achievement 
in this game than that. To go through major league hitters and dominate 
for all those years, it's one of the greatest feats I'll ever look back 
on... I don't think people realize how incredible it really is. It will 
never be duplicated, ever." Rivera was a dominant reliever throughout his 
career, pitching with a consistency and longevity uncharacteristic of a 
role commonly marked by volatility and high turnover.[112][204] In his 
17-year tenure as the Yankees' closer, Rivera compiled considerable career 
numbers. A 13-time All-Star, he is the major leagues' all-time regular 
season leader in saves (652) and games finished (952).[50] He pitched in 
1,115 regular season games, which is fourth-most in MLB history,[205] the 
most in AL history,[206] and the most by a right-handed pitcher.[4] Rivera 
holds or shares several records for the most seasons of reaching various 
save milestones, including seasons with at least: 20 saves (sixteen);[207] 
25 saves (fifteen consecutive,[208] sixteen non-consecutive[209]); 30 saves 
(nine consecutive,[210] fifteen non-consecutive[211]); 35 saves (twelve);[212] 
40 saves (nine);[213] and 50 saves (two).[213] Rivera's career ERA (2.21) 
and WHIP (1.00) are the lowest of any MLB pitcher in the live-ball era 
(minimum 1,000 innings pitched), making him one of the top pitchers since 
1920 at preventing hitters from reaching base and scoring.[214] He recorded 
an ERA under 2.00 in 11 seasons, tying him with Walter Johnson for the 
most such seasons (minimum 60 innings pitched each).[215] Rivera also ranks 
first in career adjusted ERA+ (205), a statistic that adjusts ERA for league 
and ballpark to allow comparisons of pitchers on the same baseline.[216][217] 
In addition to his strong regular season numbers, Rivera excelled in the 
postseason.[3][218] He had an 8–1 win–loss record and a 0.76 WHIP in the 
postseason,[41] and he holds numerous postseason records, including: lowest 
career ERA, minimum 30 innings pitched (0.70); most saves (42);[57] most 
consecutive scoreless innings pitched ( 33 1⁄3);[67] most consecutive save 
opportunities converted (23);[73] and most games pitched (96).[57] No pitcher 
saved half as many postseason games as Rivera did.[3] Joe Torre, who managed 
him for most of his career, said, "Let's face it. The regular season for 
Mo is great, but that's the cupcakes and the ice cream. What separates 
him from everybody else is what he's done in the postseason."[49] Rivera's 
dominance in the postseason often led to him being utilized for two-inning 
appearances,[3] as he saved a record 14 postseason games in this manner.[218] 
Between 1998 and 2008, he recorded 26 postseason saves of four or more 
outs; the second-highest total by any other pitcher during that time was 
four such saves, and the rest of baseball combined had 33.[49] At the start 
of the 2011 playoffs, Rivera ranked first all-time in win probability added 
in the postseason with 11.62, more than three times the total of the next-closest 
player.[219] In a 2009 ESPN.com poll, Rivera was voted one of the top five 
postseason players in MLB history.[220] Rivera achieved a reputation as 
an all-time great reliever among baseball experts and his peers.[31][221] 
Hall of Fame starter-turned-closer Dennis Eckersley called him "the best 
ever, no doubt",[30] while Trevor Hoffman said he "will go down as the 
best reliever in the game in history".[31] Torre said, "He's the best I've 
ever been around. Not only the ability to pitch and perform under pressure, 
but the calm he puts over the clubhouse."[88] Writer Tom Verducci said, 
"Rivera is definitively the best at his position by a wider margin than 
any player at any position in the history of baseball. There is Rivera, 
a gulf, and then every other closer."[156] He compared Rivera's reputation 
for being the best at his position to that of Michael Jordan and Wayne 
Gretzky.[222] MLB Commissioner Bud Selig said, "Clearly unequivocally, 
he's the greatest relief pitcher of all time, and did it in a way that 
was remarkable."[223] Speaking about Rivera's looming presence at the end 
of games, Alex Rodriguez said, "He's the only guy in baseball who can change 
the game from a seat in the clubhouse or the bullpen. He would start affecting 
teams as early as the fifth inning, because they knew he was out there. 
I've never seen anyone who could affect a game like that."[224] Gossage 
said that Rivera "might be the greatest closer of all-time" but suggested 
that the modern closer's job has become too specialized and easy compared 
to multiple-inning "firemen" from Gossage's era;[225][226] Rivera had only 
one regular season save of seven-plus outs in his career, whereas Gossage 
logged 53.[227] Although the Baseball Writers' Association of America has 
historically been reluctant to elect relievers into the Baseball Hall of 
Fame, sportswriters anticipate that Rivera will be elected in his first 
year of eligibility.[3][228] In 2016, ESPN.com ranked Rivera 49th on its 
list of the greatest MLB players.[229] Rivera is well respected throughout 
baseball for his professionalism. Fellow closer Joe Nathan said, "I look 
up to how he's handled himself on and off the field... You never see him 
show up anyone and he respects the game. I've always looked up to him and 
it's always a compliment to be just mentioned in the same sentence as him."[230] 
Michael Young said of Rivera, "I respect Mo more than anybody in the game. 
The guy goes out there, gets three outs and shakes [Jorge] Posada's hand. 
You appreciate someone who respects the game like he does, respects the 
people he plays with and against, and obviously his results speak for themselves."[231] 
In a Sports Illustrated cover story about Rivera that was published in 
the final week of his career, Verducci said of the pitcher, "Few players 
in any sport have retired with more reverence from his peers."[190] Rivera 
was the last MLB player to wear the uniform number 42 on a regular basis; 
at the time of his retirement, he was the only player still grandfathered 
by the league to wear Jackie Robinson's retired number.[45] Speaking about 
Rivera's connection to her husband, Robinson's widow Rachel said, "[Rivera] 
carried himself with dignity and grace, and that made carrying the number 
a tribute to Jack... I've always been proud and pleased that Mariano was 
the one chosen to wear that number because I think he brought something 
special to it."[232] Presenting him with the Commissioner's Historic Achievement 
Award, Selig said: "Throughout his illustrious career, he has represented 
his family, his country, the Yankees and all of Major League Baseball with 
the utmost class and dignity. It is wholly appropriate that Mariano was 
the last Major League player to wear Jackie Robinson's sacred number 42. 
I am pleased that our entire sport can pause on our greatest stage to thank 
him and his family for all of his contributions to our national pastime."[179] 
Several of Rivera's colleagues credit him with popularizing the cutter 
among major league pitchers. Fellow closer Jason Isringhausen, who adopted 
the pitch later in his career, said, "I think he's been an influence on 
everybody that throws it. Everybody saw what [Rivera] could do, basically 
with one pitch. Nobody could throw it like he did, but now, you talk about 
the evolution of the cutter—just ask hitters about it and they tell you 
everybody's throwing one. And they hate it."[180] Al Leiter, whose signature 
pitch was a cutter, echoed Isringhausen's sentiments: "Now, everybody throws 
it and Mo has had a huge influence on that. Pitchers watched him and marveled 
at what he did with one pitch."[180] Rivera and his wife Clara have known 
each other since elementary school,[35] and they were married on November 
9, 1991.[233] They have three sons: Mariano III, Jafet, and Jaziel. The 
family lived in Panama until 2000, when they relocated to Westchester County, 
New York;[234] they currently reside in Rye, New York.[235] Mariano III 
pitched for Iona College in New Rochelle, not far from his home. He was 
drafted by the Yankees with the 872nd pick in the 2014 MLB draft,[236] 
but decided to return to Iona for his junior year.[237] In the following 
year's draft, Mariano III was selected by the Washington Nationals in the 
4th round with the 134th overall pick.[237] Over the course of his professional 
career, Rivera learned English, beginning in 1991 with the Greensboro Hornets, 
when he realized none of his teammates spoke his native Spanish.[238] He 
is now a proponent of Latino players learning English and of American press 
members learning Spanish, in order to bridge the cultural gap.[239] Rivera 
is a devout Christian. During his childhood, neither he nor his family 
attended church, but after a born-again experience around the age of 21, 
Rivera became religious and converted from Catholicism to a Pentecostal 
faith.[14][35] His parents followed his lead after seeing the difference 
it made in him.[14] Rivera believes that God has a reason for everything 
that happens. For example, he found his failure in Game 7 of the 2001 World 
Series easier to deal with when he learned of the consequences it had for 
teammate Enrique Wilson. Had the Yankees won the series, Wilson would have 
remained in New York for the championship parade and would have departed 
for his native Dominican Republic on American Airlines Flight 587, which 
crashed shortly after takeoff and killed all 260 people aboard. Rivera 
told Wilson, "I am glad we lost the World Series, because it means that 
I still have a friend."[240] Rivera's pitching glove was inscribed "Phil. 
4:13", in reference to the Bible verse Philippians 4:13 ("I can do all 
things through Christ, who strengthens me").[241] Rivera is involved with 
philanthropic contributions in his native Panama, which include building 
an elementary school, providing Christmas gifts to children, and developing 
a program that provides computer access and adult mentors to youths.[242] 
The Mariano Rivera Foundation, which helps provide underprivileged children 
with an education,[243] distributes more than $500,000 annually in the 
US and Panama through church-based institutions.[35] In addition to funding 
church start-ups in Panama, Mexico, the Dominican Republic, California, 
and Florida, Rivera opened a church in New Rochelle in March 2014 that 
his foundation renovated at a cost of $3 million. The church, named Refugio 
de Esperanza ("Refuge of Hope"), has Rivera's wife Clara as its pastor 
and hosts a Pentecostal congregation that previously met at the Rivera 
home.[244][245] Since retiring from baseball, Rivera has dedicated himself 
to philanthropy and his churches.[35][244][246] He and Clara have twice 
awarded a scholarship in their names to a student at the local College 
of New Rochelle.[246] In 2012, the Giving Back Fund estimated that Rivera 
donated $627,500 to charity in 2010, ranking him as the 25th-most generous 
celebrity on a list that the fund compiled.[247] He won the 2013 Marvin 
Miller Man of the Year Award, which is given to the MLB player "who inspires 
others through his on-field performances and contributions to his community".[178] 
Rivera was an investor in two New York area restaurants: "Clubhouse Grill", 
which opened in New Rochelle in 2006 as "Mo's New York Grill";[1][248] 
and Siro's, which opened in Manhattan in 2012.[249] Both restaurants have 
since closed.[250][251] In 2015, he opened a Toyota and Scion car dealership 
in Mount Kisco, New York.[252] Rivera has been a celebrity spokesman for 
several companies, including: Nike sports apparel;[253] Canali, a premium 
men's clothing company, as their first athlete spokesperson;[254] Skechers 
footwear;[255] and Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.[256] A 2011 
list by the marketing firm Nielsen ranked Rivera as the second-most marketable 
player in baseball; the list accounted for personal attributes such as 
sincerity, approachability, experience, and influence.[257] Based on sales 
figures from Majestic Athletic, he had the 18th-best-selling MLB jersey 
in 2011,[258] and the top-selling jersey in the second half of 2013.[259] 
Rivera earned approximately $169.6 million in salary during his baseball 
career.[260] In March 2014, Rivera was twice recognized for his philanthropic 
efforts, receiving the ROBIE Humanitarian Award from the Jackie Robinson 
Foundation,[261] as well as a Jefferson Award for Public Service.[262] 
Later that month, the "Legends Series", comprising two MLB exhibition games 
between the Yankees and Miami Marlins, was played in Rivera's native Panama 
to "honor [his] legacy"; he helped promote the games, which were supplemented 
by charitable events and a gala benefiting his foundation.[263] On April 
9, 2014, MLB announced that a new annual award for relief pitchers, the 
Reliever of the Year Award, would replace the existing Delivery Man of 
the Year Award, and that the AL honor would be named after Rivera.[264] 
The following month, a section of River Avenue bordering Yankee Stadium 
at 161st Street was renamed "Rivera Avenue" in the pitcher's honor.[265] 
This coincided with the release of his autobiography, The Closer: My Story, 
co-authored with Wayne Coffey.[266] New York University bestowed an honorary 
Doctor of Humane Letters degree upon Rivera during its commencement ceremony 
at Yankee Stadium on May 21, 2014.[267] During the 2015 Little League World 
Series, he was inducted into the Little League Hall of Excellence.[268]
