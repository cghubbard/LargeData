Jackson Heights is a neighborhood in the northwestern portion of the borough 
of Queens in New York City. The neighborhood is part of Queens Community 
Board 3.[3] Jackson Heights is neighbored by North Corona to the east, 
Elmhurst to the south, Woodside to the west, northern Astoria (Ditmars-Steinway) 
to the northwest, and East Elmhurst to the northeast. The main ZIP code 
of Jackson Heights is 11372. According to the 2010 United States Census, 
the neighborhood has a population of 108,152.[1] The Jackson Heights name 
comes from Jackson Avenue, the former name for Northern Boulevard, a major 
thoroughfare that bisects the neighborhood. John C. Jackson built the road 
across what is now Jackson Heights in 1859. The Jackson Avenue name is 
retained by this major road in a short stretch between Queens Plaza and 
Queens–Midtown Tunnel in Long Island City.[4] The place was not particularly 
high, but the name "heights" showed that the place was originally meant 
to be exclusive.[5] Until 1916, the area was called "Trains Meadow", but 
contrary to the name, there were very few trains in the area. It is suspected 
that it was corrupted from "drain".[4] The first land purchase of 128 acres 
(52 ha) was completed in 1910, and Edward A. MacDougall's Queensboro Corporation 
had bought about 325 acres (132 ha) by 1914.[6] At first, the area could 
most easily be reached via a ferry from Manhattan or the Brooklyn bridges,[5] 
but the Queensboro Bridge opened in 1909,[7] followed by the elevated IRT 
Flushing Line—the present-day 7 train, just 20 minutes from Manhattan—came 
in 1917,[8] and Fifth Avenue Coach Company double-decker coaches came in 
1922.[7] Jackson Heights was a planned development laid out by the Queensboro 
Corporation beginning in about 1916, and residents came after the arrival 
of the Flushing Line into Jackson Heights in 1917. The community was initially 
planned as a place for middle- to upper-middle income workers from Manhattan 
to raise their families.[9] The Queensboro Corporation coined the name 
"garden apartment" to convey the concept of apartments surrounded by a 
green environment. The apartments, built around private parks during this 
time, contributed to Jackson Heights' being the first garden city community 
built in the United States, as part of the international garden city movement 
at the turn of the 20th century.[9] Most of the buildings in Jackson Heights 
are the Queensboro Corporation apartments, built within a few blocks of 
the Flushing Line, which are typically five or six stories tall and are 
located between Northern Boulevard and 37th Avenue as part of that planned 
community.[10] Targeted toward the middle class,[11] the Queensboro Corporation-based 
the new apartments off of similar ones in Berlin.[12] These new apartments 
were to share garden spaces,[13] have ornate exteriors and features such 
as fireplaces, parquet floors, sun rooms, and built-in bathtubs with showers;[14] 
and be cooperatively owned.[13] In addition, the corporation divided the 
land into blocks and building lots, as well as installed streets, sidewalks, 
and power, water, and sewage lines.[15] Although land for churches was 
provided, the apartments themselves were limited to white Anglo-Saxon Protestants,[8] 
while excluding Jews, Blacks, and perhaps Greeks and Italians.[16] The 
Laurel apartment building on 82nd Street at Northern Boulevard was the 
first of the Queensboro Corporation buildings in Jackson Heights, completed 
in 1914 with a small courtyard. The Greystones on either side of 80th Street 
between 37th and 35th Avenues were completed in 1918 with a design by architect 
George H. Wells. There was leftover unused space, which was converted to 
parks, gardens, and recreational areas, including a golf course; much of 
this leftover space, including the golf course, no longer exists.[17] This 
was followed by the 1919 construction of the Andrew J. Thomas-designed 
Linden Court, a 10-building complex between 84th Street, 85th Streets, 
37th Avenue, and Roosevelt Avenue.[18][19] The two sets of 5 buildings 
each, separated by a gated garden with linden trees and two pathways, included 
parking spaces with single-story garages accessed via narrow driveways, 
the first Jackson Heights development to do so; gaps at regular intervals 
in the perimeter wall; a layout that provided light and ventilation to 
the apartments, as well as fostered a sense of belonging to a community;[20] 
the area's first co-op;[21] and now-prevalent private gardens surrounded 
by the building blocks.[22] The Hampton Gardens, the Château, and the Towers 
followed in the 1920s.[23] The Château and the Towers, both co-ops on 34th 
Avenue, had large, airy apartments and were served by elevators.[18] The 
elegant Château cooperative apartment complex, with twelve buildings surrounding 
a shared garden, was built in the French Renaissance style and have slate 
mansard roofs pierced by dormer windows, and diaperwork brick walls.[24] 
At first purely decorative, the shared gardens in later developments included 
paved spaces where people could meet or sit.[25] The Queensboro Corporation 
started the Ivy Court, Cedar Court, and Spanish Gardens projects, all designed 
by Thomas, in 1924.[26] The Queensboro Corporation advertised their apartments 
from 1922 on.[23] On August 28, 1922, the Queensboro Corporation paid $50 
to the WEAF radio station to broadcast a ten-minute sales pitch for apartments 
in Jackson Heights,[27] in what may have been the first "infomercial", 
opening with a few words about Nathaniel Hawthorne before promoting the 
corporation's Nathaniel Hawthorne apartments.[28] The ad wanted viewers 
to: seek the recreation and the daily comfort of the home removed from 
the congested part of the city, right at the boundaries of God's great 
outdoors, and within a few minutes by subway from the business section 
of Manhattan ... The cry of the heart is for more living room, more chance 
to unfold, more opportunity to get near Mother Earth, to play, to romp, 
to plant and to dig ... Let me enjoin upon you as you value your health 
and your hopes and your home happiness, get away from the solid masses 
of brick ... where your children grow up starved for a run over a patch 
of grass and the sight of a tree...[29] Built in 1928, the English Gables 
line 82nd Street, the main shopping area of Jackson Heights' Hispanic community. 
There are two developments, called English Gables I and II; they were meant 
to provide a gateway to the neighborhood for commercial traffic and for 
passengers from the 82nd Street – Jackson Heights station.[4] A year later, 
the Robert Morris Apartments, on 37th Avenue between 79th and 80th Streets, 
were constructed. Named after Robert Morris, a signer of the United States 
Declaration of Independence, the apartments have ample green spaces, original 
high ceilings, and fireplaces, and are relatively expensive.[4][30] Until 
the Great Depression, these apartments were only half-filled due to the 
paucity of residents who could pay; after the Depression, the apartments 
became more affordable. During the Depression, two new buildings were built: 
Ravenna Court on 37th Avenue between 80th and 81st Streets, built in 1929; 
and Georgian Court three blocks east, between 83rd and 84th Streets, built 
in 1930.[4] The Queensboro Corporation began to build on land that until 
then had been kept open for community use, including the tennis courts, 
community garden,[31] and the former golf course—located between 76th and 
78th Streets and 34th and 37th Avenues—all of which were built upon during 
the 1940s and 1950s.[23] The corporation also began erecting traditional 
six-story apartment buildings. Dunolly Gardens, the last garden apartment 
complex that Thomas built, was an exception, a modernistic building completed 
in 1939.[32] The corner windows, considered very innovative in the 1930s, 
gave the apartments a more spacious feeling.[33] After the 1940s, Jackson 
Heights's real estate was diversified, and more apartment buildings and 
cooperatives were built with elevators; some new transportation infrastructure 
were also built.[23] Primarily during the 1930s, Holmes Airport operated 
on 220 acres (0.89 km2) adjacent to the community, and later, its land 
became veterans' housing and the Bulova watch factory site.[34] By 1930, 
about 44,500 people lived in Jackson heights, an increase from 3,800 residents 
in 1910. The community was close-knit. Gay people from Broadway theaters 
started to move into the area. However, Jewish and black people were still 
excluded until Jews were allowed to move in by the 1940s and blacks by 
1968.[6] Beginning in the 1960s, an influx of newly immigrated residents 
came into Jackson Heights, at the same time that existing residents were 
leaving for suburbs due to white flight.[10] Hispanic immigrants moved 
in by the 1970s. By then, white residents who remained in the neighborhood 
wished to eliminate the stigma of Jackson Heights being an ethnically diverse 
neighborhood, often defining its border as Roosevelt Avenue, because crime 
had started to increase in the area.[6] By the mid-1970s, South American 
organized crime groups in Jackson Heights, often peddling drugs, gained 
national attention. A 1978 article in New York Magazine stated that 27 
people were killed in Jackson Heights in the three years preceding.[35] 
Most of the original neighborhood, comprising the garden city apartment 
buildings, was made a National Register Historic District and a New York 
State Historic Register District. The Jackson Heights New York State and 
National Register Districts range from 93rd Street through 69th Street 
between Northern Boulevard and Roosevelt Avenue. Some property fronting 
on Northern Boulevard and Roosevelt Avenue, as well as some "cut-outs", 
are not inside the Register Districts. The national historic district called 
the Jackson Heights Historic District, includes 2,203 contributing buildings, 
19 contributing sites, and three contributing objects. Among the landmarked 
buildings, over 200 original Queensboro Corporation apartment buildings 
still exist in Jackson Heights.[37] It was listed on the National Register 
of Historic Places in 1999.[36] About half of the neighborhood—a rectangle 
stretching roughly from 76th Street to 88th Street and from Roosevelt Avenue 
almost up to Northern Boulevard—was designated as a New York City Historic 
District by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission on October 
19, 1993.[38] It comprises large apartment buildings with private communal 
gardens, as well as many groupings of private homes and many stores on 
the streets surrounding Roosevelt Avenue.[39][40] Unlike the State and 
National Districts, the local designation comes with aesthetic protections. 
In addition to the Jackson Heights Historic District, the Lent Homestead 
and Cemetery and United States Post Office are listed on the National Register 
of Historic Places.[36] Based on data from the 2010 United States Census, 
the population of Jackson Heights was 108,152, a decrease of 5,175 (4.6%) 
from the 113,327 counted in 2000. Covering an area of 1,101.36 acres (445.70 ha), 
the neighborhood had a population density of 98.2 inhabitants per acre 
(62,800/sq mi; 24,300/km2).[1] The racial makeup of the neighborhood was 
17.2% (18,567) White, 2.0% (2,210) African American, 0.1% (145) Native 
American, 22.0% (23,781) Asian, 0.0% (9) Pacific Islander, 0.5% (583) from 
other races, and 1.6% (1,736) from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino 
of any race were 56.5% (61,121) of the population.[2] The neighborhood 
is the location of the Roosevelt Avenue / 74th Street transportation hub, 
where the New York City Subway's IRT Flushing Line (7 train) and IND Queens 
Boulevard Line (E F M R trains), as well as MTA Regional Bus Operations' 
Q32, Q33, Q47, Q49, Q53, Q70, converge. The Q32 goes to Pennsylvania Station 
in Midtown Manhattan. The Q70 LTD bus goes to LaGuardia Airport's main 
terminals and operates 24 hours a day, replacing the Q33 bus, which used 
to go to LaGuardia Airport until September 2014; the Q33 and Q49 go to 
East Elmhurst, while the Q70 LTD goes nonstop to LaGuardia Airport from 
the station. The Q47 bus goes to the Marine Air Terminal and The Shops 
at Atlas Park. The Q53 LTD bus goes to Rockaway Beach, Queens and Woodside 
LIRR station.[41] The MTA spent over $100 million on renovations to the 
facility, which were completed in 2005.[42] It includes one of the first 
green buildings in the MTA system, the Victor A. Moore Bus Terminal, which 
is partially powered by solar panels built into the roof. These are located 
along the length of the sheds above the Flushing Line platforms.[42][43] 
The former Victor Moore Arcade was demolished and rebuilt from 1998 to 
2005 and became the bus terminal. It was named after Jackson Heights resident 
Victor Moore, a Broadway and film actor from the era of silent film to 
the 1950s. Interstate 278 (Brooklyn Queens Expressway), New York State 
Route 25A (Northern Boulevard), and the Grand Central Parkway are major 
roads in the area. LaGuardia Airport, in neighboring East Elmhurst, is 
nearby. As part of the city's bikeway system, bike lanes exist on 34th 
Avenue, as well as on 74th and 75th Streets between 34th Avenue and 37th 
Road. There is also a short one-block bike lane connector on 37th Road 
between 74th and 75th Streets.[44] Jackson Heights, the original portion 
of which is only about 350 acres (140 ha), is bounded by Astoria Boulevard, 
Grand Central Parkway, or Northern Boulevard to the north, the Brooklyn-Queens 
Expressway to the west, Roosevelt Avenue to the south, and Junction Boulevard 
or 90th Street to the east.[45] East Elmhurst, the area immediately to 
the north that extends from Northern Boulevard to the Grand Central Parkway 
and between 81st and 111th Streets, is sometimes regarded as a northward 
extension of the neighborhood; however, it was not part of the original 
planned development, built in 1916. In addition, a section between Hazen 
and 81st Streets, and between 19th Avenue and Grand Central Parkway, overlaps 
with Astoria; it is sometimes called Ditmars or Steinway.[4] The historic 
section of Jackson Heights is the more affluent part of the neighborhood. 
Most housing units in Jackson Heights are apartments in multi-unit buildings, 
many of which are five or six stories. Many of these buildings are co-ops, 
some are rentals, and a few are condominiums. There are also a number of 
one- to three-family houses, most of which are attached row houses.[10] 
The original Queensboro Corporation apartments were designed in the Colonial 
Revival and neo-Tudor styles. There are many private parks—historically 
called "gardens" by the residents—within walking distance of each other, 
tucked into the mid-blocks between the Queensboro Corporation apartments, 
mostly hidden from view by the buildings surrounding them. Unless given 
an invitation, entry is restricted to those who own a co-op around its 
perimeter. The basis for the private ownership of the parks of Jackson 
Heights is derived from its founding principle as a privately owned neighborhood 
built largely under the oversight of one person.[23] A section of 90th 
Street between 30th Avenue and Northern Boulevard was privately developed, 
separate from the Queensboro Corporation. The structures on that stretch 
of 90th Street are mostly Tudor buildings.[4] The main retail thoroughfare 
is 37th Avenue from 72nd Street to Junction Boulevard, with more retail 
on 73rd, 74th, and 82nd Streets between 37th and Roosevelt Avenues.[46] 
Stores and restaurants on and near 74th Street tend to cater to the large 
South Asian population in the neighborhood, with sari and jewelry stores, 
Indian and Bengali music and movie retailers and many restaurants. [47]37th 
Avenue contains a wide mix of retailers, including many grocery stores, 
and 82ndSstreet contains many national chain stores located in Tudor-style 
buildings in the Jackson Heights Historic District.[4] South American retailers 
and eateries, predominantly from Colombia and Peru dominate Northern Boulevard 
from 80th Street east to the border of neighboring Corona at Junction Boulevard. 
Roosevelt Avenue is also lined with various mainly Hispanic retail stores. 
The majority of 35th and 34th Avenues and most side streets between 37th 
Avenue and Northern Boulevard are residential.[4] There were five historical 
movie theaters in Jackson Heights, which are all currently either repurposed 
or closed.[4] The Art Deco Earle Theater, opened in 1936 on 37th Road between 
73rd and 74th Streets, was a neighborhood movie theater before becoming 
a porn theater and then, with the name changed to "Eagle," a Bollywood 
theater, before a strike in the Bollywood industry caused the theater to 
close permanently in 2009;[4] it is now a food court selling South Asian 
food.[48] The Fair Theatre, opened in 1939 at Astoria Boulevard and 90th 
Street, became a porn theater.[4] The Polk Theater, on 37th (formerly Polk) 
Avenue and 93rd Street, opened in 1938 and closed in 2006, also was a porn 
theater during its later years, before it was demolished in 2008.[4][49] 
The Colony Theater, afterwards an Indian-owned theater under the name of 
the Jackson Heights Cinema, on 82nd Street south of Roosevelt Avenue, closed 
in January 2014 due to rent disputes.[50] Finally, the Boulevard Theater, 
on Northern Boulevard and 83rd Street, is now a Latin-American restaurant 
of the same name. Most of Jackson Heights is on a grid, with the major 
exceptions of streets surrounding Astoria Boulevard, Junction Boulevard, 
the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway, and Grand Central Parkway. However, there 
are a few side streets of note in Jackson Heights. Jackson Mill Road, which 
is actually two roads in Jackson Heights and East Elmhurst, was formerly 
a streetcar line, and was one of several "Bowery Bay Roads" leading to 
Bowery Bay. The rest of the original Jackson Mill Road was destroyed by 
the construction of the LaGuardia Airport, but sections exist between 94th 
and 95th Streets near 24th Avenue; between 96th and 97th Streets near Astoria 
Boulevard; and from 93rd to 97th Streets between 32nd and 31st Avenues.[4] 
In addition, a vestige of "Trains Meadow Road", named when the area was 
called "Trains Meadow", still exists near 35th Avenue, 69th Street, and 
Leverich Street; it formerly went all the way to Flushing Bay.[4] Jackson 
Heights is among the most diverse neighborhoods in New York City and the 
nation. Half of the population was foreign born by the 2000s.[6] Jackson 
Heights is home to large numbers of South Americans (particularly Colombian, 
Ecuadorean and Argentinian), Indians, Pakistanis, Tibetans, Nepalese, and 
Bangladeshis. Most businesses are Asian- and Latino-owned, and there are 
restaurants, bakeries, specialty shops, legal offices, bars, and beauty 
salons. There is a Little India on 74th Street and a Little Pakistan and 
Little Bangladesh on 73rd Street.[51] There is also a large concentration 
of South Americans east of 77th Street, especially a Little Colombia along 
37th Avenue.[51] Jackson Heights was heavily Colombian during the 1980s, 
but other immigrant groups have settled in the area, notably Mexicans. 
Many of the displaced Colombians have moved to adjacent areas such as Elmhurst, 
East Elmhurst, Corona, College Point and Flushing. Queens County still 
has the largest concentration of Colombians in the United States of any 
county (roughly 75,000). The demographics of Jackson Heights were affected 
by three events: the 1965 Immigration Reform Act, which allowed working-class 
immigrants to be with their families in the U.S.;[43] the 1968 Fair Housing 
Act, which upheld fair housing;[43] and an event in 1990 where Julio Rivera, 
a gay man, was stabbed to death, which gave way to the Gay and Lesbian 
Anti-Violence Project.[52] The population is composed of over 60% foreign-born 
residents as of 2010 United States Census.[10][43] The Latino demographics 
caused controversy in the 1970s, when many drug cartels were selling drugs, 
even though most people were not actually affected by it. While some media 
sources placed culpability on the wire transfer stores along Roosevelt 
Avenue as vestiges of the drug-selling, these stores were actually useful 
to the community.[53] Latino clubs and bars on the avenue were also pointed 
to as another trace of evidence, even though most were actually just places 
for typical Latino immigrants to hang out.[53] Little India was also controversial. 
Although Indians are a minority in Jackson Heights, a vibrant commercial 
area developed on 74th Street in the 1990s,[53] and by 1993, it was the 
largest Asian Indian shopping area in the country.[47] As of a 2010 Furman 
Center report, 60% of the estimated 170,161 residents were Hispanic, 15% 
white, 10% black, and 15% Asian.[54] However, 2013 estimates by the website 
City-Data place the population at 133,464, with mainly white or Hispanic 
residents, due to a disparity in neighborhood boundaries.[55] Nevertheless, 
there is significant Latino and South Asian culture in Jackson Heights.[10] 
As of 2015[update], one out of two residents identify as Latino, and 20% 
of the non-Latino residents identify as Asian, within the "traditional" 
borders of Northern Boulevard, Brooklyn-Queens Expressway, Roosevelt Avenue, 
and Junction Boulevard.[56] The community is home to various houses of 
worship from a wide array of religions The Community United Methodist Church 
is on 82nd Street.[30] Saint Joan of Arc Catholic Church is located between 
82nd and 83rd Street on 35th Avenue. The Jackson Heights Jewish Center 
is located on the corner of 77th Street and 37th Avenue. St Mark's Episcopal 
Church is on 34th Avenue between 81st and 82nd Streets. The Jackson Heights 
Garden City Society is a historical society, whose founders include local 
historians, the Queens Borough Historian and local activists. They created 
and oversee the Jackson Heights Garden City Trail and publish a walking 
guidebook to Jackson Heights. They also collect artifacts of the community. 
Periodically, the Society testifies before the New York City Landmarks 
Preservation Commission on issues of concern to the community. In addition, 
Colombian broadcaster RCN TV has its US-American headquarters in the neighborhood, 
reflecting the sizable Colombian population in the area. There is a year-round 
greenmarket every Sunday morning at Travers Park, as well as various family-oriented 
spring and summer concerts. The word game Scrabble was co-invented by former 
architect Alfred Mosher Butts, who lived in Jackson Heights.[57][58] There 
is a street sign at 35th Avenue and 81st Street that is stylized using 
letters, with their values in Scrabble as a subscript; it was originally 
erected in 1995 but disappeared in 2008,[59] and a new sign was subsequently 
put up in 2011.[60] Jackson Heights has followed the general crime patterns 
of New York City. After crime spikes in the 1970s into the 1990s, crime 
has declined significantly. According to New York City Police Department 
CompStat statistics, measured crime has declined more than 74% in the last 
21 years (1993 to 2014). As of December 2014[update], the murder rate is 
down over 70% and grand larceny auto is down 93% from 1990. In 2013, there 
were 3 murders, 34 rapes, 325 felony assaults, 332 robberies, 275 burglaries, 
612 grand larcenies, and 141 grand larcenies auto.[61] New York City Department 
of Education operates public schools. Schools in Jackson Heights include 
P.S. 69 Jackson Heights School,[62] P.S. 149 Christa McAuliffe School,[63] 
P.S. 212,[64] P.S 222 FF Christopher A. Santora School,[65] I.S.145 Joseph 
Pulitzer School,[66] P.S. 152, and I.S. 230. Charter schools include the 
Pre-K–12 school Renaissance Charter School.[67] Private schools in the 
neighborhood include Saint Joan of Arc School, a National Blue Ribbon School 
of Excellence (Pre-K3 to 8 grade), Monsignor McClancy Memorial High School, 
a school which turned co-ed by the end of the 2012 school year, though 
technically located in East Elmhurst. Garden School, a non-profit 501(c)(3) 
independent school within Jackson Heights, enrolls 300 students from grades 
Nursery–Grade 12. 82nd Street Academics, a non-profit 501(c)(3) educational 
institution, is housed at the Community United Methodist Church of Jackson 
Heights. Since 2003, it has been a community-based Universal Pre-Kindergarten 
provider under contract with the New York Department of Education.[68][69] 
Queens Library operates the Jackson Heights Library, located on 81st Street 
and 37th Avenue.[70] Travers Park is the main local playground. It has 
a variety of sports, including basketball, tennis, baseball, soccer, and 
handball.[30] There is also a park named "One Room Schoolhouse Park", named 
after the last one-room schoolhouse in Queens.[4] The school was at Astoria 
Boulevard and 90th Street from 1879 to 1934; it became a playground in 
1935 and a garden in 1992.[71] Prior to expansion, the P.S. 69 school yard 
offered baseball fields, a stickball field, a handball court and three 
tennis courts. Con Edison sponsored several summer tennis camps at P.S. 
69's school yard from 1982-1992. In 1998, P.S. 69 built an annex to compensate 
for the booming population of children in Jackson Heights and the public 
access to the school yard was removed. However, on November 30, 2011, then-Mayor 
Michael Bloomberg and other city officials opened the 200th “Schoolyard 
to Playground” at P.S. 69 as a part of the PlaNYC initiative to ensure 
all New Yorkers live within a 10-minute walk of a park or playground; the 
program is turning schoolyards into playgrounds in neighborhoods across
