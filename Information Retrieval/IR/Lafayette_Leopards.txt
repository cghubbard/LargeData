The Lafayette Leopards represent the 23 Division I varsity athletic teams 
of Lafayette College and compete in the Patriot League. There are 11 men's 
teams, 11 women's teams, and one co-ed team. The club teams also compete 
as the Leopards. Though not a varsity sport, crew and ice hockey are very 
competitive at Lafayette and play in intercollegiate club leagues. Lafayette's 
primary rival in every sport is the Lehigh Mountain Hawks of nearby Lehigh 
University. Bucknell University is also a major rival and other league 
and school rivalries exist on an individual sport level. Lafayette's student-athletes 
generally lead the NCAA in academic performance. In 2011, 16 of Lafayette's 
23 teams academic performance scored within the top ten percent of their 
respective sport. Lafayette led the Patriot League, which placed second 
behind the Ivy League.[2] Lafayette's first recorded athletic event outside 
of the student body was a baseball game against Easton amateurs, a 44-11 
win on November 8, 1865. The first recorded intercollegiate match was a 
45-45 tie in a baseball game against Lehigh in October 1869.[3] The first 
athletic teams at Lafayette were nicknamed the 'Maroon' as a result of 
the maroon sweaters worn by the players. Though the team continued to wear 
maroon, a new nickname was bestowed on Lafayette. The Lafayette Student 
Council voted on the nickname "Leopards" since many other rival schools, 
such as Princeton, Pittsburgh, and Bucknell, had animal nicknames. It is 
not clear why the nickname "Leopards" was selected, although it is reasonable 
to speculate that an 'L' nickname was ideal since other schools had animal 
nicknames that started with the school's first letter (Pittsburgh Panthers, 
Bucknell Bison). The leopard was also selected because its 'cunning and 
physical strength, combined with the fact that it is irresistible when 
aroused, seemed to be typical of a Lafayette team.' The Leopard mascot 
made its debut against Washington & Jefferson University at Yankee Stadium 
on October 25, 1924, a 20-6 Leopard victory.[4] It was previously believed 
that the nickname Leopards first appeared on November 24, 1924, when a 
writer at the Easton Express-Times referred to the team as the 'Leopards.' 
The name was first used on campus when Lafayette sports editor George Parkman 
referred to the team as the 'Leopards' on October 7, 1927. Parkman noticed 
that other competitors were selecting animal nicknames and decided Lafayette 
should have one.[5] Given the two different accounts of the nickname 'Leopard', 
it seems the nickname was slow to resonate with students and alumni. Baseball 
was the first organized sport on campus, with a club formally organized 
in March 1860. Games would be played amongst the students until Lafayette 
teams began playing amateur clubs from the region. Lafayette met Lehigh 
in its first intercollegiate game in October 1869, a 45-45 tie in Easton, 
and earned its first win against Lehigh, a 31-24 decision in Bethlehem. 
Lafayette's first non-Lehigh college game was a 26-11 loss to Princeton 
University in May 1874. Football appeared on campus in 1878, and did not 
become fully organized until 1880. The first games took place in 1882, 
when Lafayette lost to Rutgers University. The team earned its first win 
ever against Rutgers the following year. Interest in football became so 
great that by 1889, a field was needed to handle the crowds and earn revenue 
for the team to compete against a schedule. The Alumni Advisory Committee 
was formed to handle all aspects of facilities, management, and equipment 
fundraising, although players were still largely responsible for their 
own equipment and health. By 1894, March Field was complete and featured 
a track meet at the dedication. Football quickly became the marquis sport 
at Lafayette as students, alumni, and citizens of Easton packed March Field 
through 1925. Lafayette became the first non-Ivy League school to win a 
national football championship in 1896. The team continued to enjoy success 
through the 1920s by winning two national championships and becoming one 
of the top football teams in the East and the United States. In 1926, Fisher 
Field was built to capitalize upon the excitement of football, as well 
as Alumni Gymnasium in order to house other athletic programs and provide 
general training for the student body. Lafayette was independent in football 
until 1929, when it joined the Middle Three Conference with Lehigh University 
and Rutgers University. With the decline of football as a national power 
in the 1950s, basketball became a popular sport. The Leopards made appearances 
in the NCAA Tournament and the more noted NIT Tournament. Also, Lafayette 
baseball made several trips to the College World Series in the 1950s and 
1960s. In 1958, Lafayette helped form the Middle America Conference (MAC), 
which soon became known as the more recognized East Coast Conference. All 
Leopard teams aside from football competed in the conference. The Leopards 
continued to play "major" college football through the 1970s, until the 
NCAA reclassified the divisions. Lafayette soon found itself as a member 
in Division I-AA, where Lafayette remains a member today (now known as 
the FCS Subdivision. At this time, Lafayette's major rivalry with Rutgers 
ended, also due to Rutgers' increasing size and competitiveness in football. 
In search of an athletic league with more like-minded institutions focused 
on academic scholarship and non-athletic scholarship financing for student-athletes, 
Lafayette co-founded the Patriot League in 1986. A major objective of the 
league was to serve as non-conference football opponents for the Ivy League. 
As women matriculated at Lafayette in 1974, teams were quickly established 
in basketball and field hockey. Lafayette quickly became a mid-major power 
in women's lacrosse and field hockey, which continued into the 21st century. 
The field hockey team currently ranks in the top 20 for all-time victories. 
Lafayette continued offering non-scholarship athletic financial aid through 
the 1990s, when Holy Cross started offering athletic scholarships for their 
basketball teams. Other schools followed suit except Lafayette, which held 
out until 2006, three years longer than the last holdout (Bucknell). At 
the time, Lafayette was the lone school in Division I aside from the Ivy 
League not offer athletic scholarships in any sports. Along with basketball 
athletic scholarships, Lafayette offers scholarships in field hockey and 
men's soccer. In 2012, Lafayette, along with the rest of the Patriot League, 
elected to award football scholarships starting with the class of 2017. 
Scholarships in other sports will follow suit. Lafayette sponsors 23 Division 
I sports, the highest level of competition in college athletics. All sports 
compete in the Patriot League. Men's sports Women's sports Co-ed sports 
Baseball is the oldest sport at the College, with a club team competing 
on a College Hill since March 1860. The team's first official game was 
a 44-11 win on November 8, 1865 against amateurs from Easton. The first 
recorded intercollegiate match was a 45-45 tie in a baseball game against 
Lehigh in October 1869 and its first win against Lehigh 31-24 shortly thereafter. 
Aside from its traditional Ivy League and local rivals, Lafayette developed 
a rivalry with the University of North Carolina and the University of South 
Carolina in the late 19th and early 20th century. Games were played on 
March Field, and were later played at Fisher Stadium. Once the Metzgar 
Athletic Complex was built in the late 1960s, the team moved its field 
to what is now known as Kamine Stadium. Lafayette has made four appearances 
in the College World Series in the 1950s and 1960s, the final round of 
the NCAA Division I Baseball Championship. Coached by former major leaguer 
Charlie Gelbert, the Leopards made it the semi-finals in 1953 before bowing 
to the University of Texas, finishing third. Lafayette eliminated Stanford 
and Boston College, with their only losses coming against Texas. Lafayette 
did not win a game in its other trips in 1954, 1958, and 1965. Lafayette 
won the East Coast Conference in 1990 and Patriot League title 2007 to 
earn a trip to the NCAA Regionals. The most noted Lafayette baseball player 
is current Chicago Cubs manager Joe Maddon, who played on the team in the 
early 1970s. Lafayette is 1755-1563-32 all-time. Lafayette has a storied 
basketball tradition that entails multiple NCAA and NIT bids, conference 
championships, and legendary college basketball players and coaches. Lafayette 
was independent until 1958, when it joined the East Coast Conference. The 
Leopards were members until 1990, when they left as a founding member of 
the Patriot League, their current affiliation. Basketball gained popularity 
at Lafayette following World War II. Up until that point, Lafayette's team's 
were competitive but did not achieve much national or regional distinction. 
Pete Carril, the legendary hall of fame coach of the Princeton Tigers, 
played for the Leopards in the late 1940s and early 1950s. Lafayette was 
coached during the era by Butch Van Breda Kolff, the first coaching job 
of the future Princeton Final Four and Los Angeles Lakers coach. Van Breda 
Kolff led the Leopards to their first postseason appearance, the 1955 National 
Invitation Tournament. The NIT was considered the more prestigious postseason 
tournament at the time, possibly because all games were played at Madison 
Square Garden. The Leopards fell to Niagara University in the first round. 
Under new head coach George Davidson, the Leopards returned to the NIT 
in 1956, where they fell to St. Francis (NY).[6] The Leopards qualified 
for their third straight postseason tournament the following year, but 
were invited to the 1957 NCAA Tournament instead. Lafayette received the 
first seed in the seven team Eastern Regional, but fell to Syracuse University 
75-71 in the semifinals at the Palestra. Lafayette basketball re-emerged 
as a power in the late 1960s under Hal Wissel, a future NBA and Division 
II national championship coach. Wissel was responsible for recruiting the 
best player in Lafayette history, Tracy Tripucka. Tracy went on to score 
1,973 points, the most in Lafayette history, while leading the Leopards 
to its first postseason victory. In the 1972 NIT, Jay Mottola sunk a free 
throw with three seconds left to upset the University of Virginia. Lafayette 
was eliminated in the next round by Jacksonville University. Aside from 
being the all-time leading scorer, Tracy was profiled in a Sports Illustrated 
article.[7] Following the season, he was selected in the 1972 NBA Draft 
by the New York Knicks.[8] The 1972 squad was coached by Tom Davis, a future 
longtime coach of the University of Iowa. Future national champion head 
coach Gary Williams of the University of Maryland was an assistant on Davis' 
Lafayette staff.[6] Another Tripucka, Tracy's younger brother Todd, led 
the Leopards to the 1975 NIT, where Lafayette lost to St. John's University 
(New York). Todd Tripucka was second in all-time leading scoring behind 
his brother before being surpassed by Phil Ness in 1978. Todd Tripucka 
ranks sixth all-time in scoring as of 2012. The Leopards returned to the 
NIT in 1980, but were defeated by the University of Virginia.[6] Legendary 
coach van Breda Kolff returned to coach the Leopards in 1984 and orchestrated 
one of the most dynamic upsets in Lafayette basketball history. In an unusual 
decision, the University of Notre Dame, coached by Digger Phelps and coming 
off of a sweet sixteen appearance in 1987, traveled to the Kirby Sports 
Center for a nationally televised game. The Leopards dominated 83-68 as 
Otis Ellis, Lafayette's second all-time leading scorer behind Tracy Tripucka, 
scored a career high 35 points. Notre Dame qualified for 1988 NCAA Tournament.[6] 
The Leopards returned to the NCAA Tournament under current coach Fran O'Hanlon 
in 1999 and 2000. The Leopards were the first basketball team to ever return 
two conference players of the year from two different seasons (Stefan Ciocisi 
and Brian Ehlers). The Leopards were seeded 15 both seasons and fell to 
Miami and Temple. The 2000 season was the subject of The Last Amateurs, 
a book by nationally acclaimed author John Feinstein.[6] Up until 2006, 
Lafayette was the only team outside of the Ivy League that did not award 
athletic scholarships in men's basketball. Other Patriot League teams did 
not award scholarships, but the policy was gradually dropped by fellow 
Patriot League schools, leaving Lafayette the lone hold out. With a full 
scholarship team, the Leopards returned the Patriot League Championship 
in 2010 for the first time since 2000 and fell to Lehigh. Lafayette lost 
the 2011 championship game to Bucknell, but the Leopards' double overtime 
buzzer-beater by Jim Mower against American University in the semifinals 
was highlighted as a top ten play on ESPN. The Leopards finally won the 
2015 Patriot League Men's Basketball Tournament, and reached the NCAA Tournament 
for the first time since 2000. Lafayette is 1249-1134 all-time in 102 seasons. 
The Lafayette women's basketball team has a strong tradition and has played 
intercollegiate competition since 1973, two seasons after women were first 
admitted on campus. For the first half of its history until the Patriot 
League era in the early 1990s, women's basketball had a winning tradition 
that entailed five 20-win seasons and five appearances in the ECC Championship 
game in seven seasons of league play. Additionally, the women had 17 winning 
seasons in 22 years of play. Since 1993-94, the Leopards have had only 
one winning season. During that span, they have had two double-digit wins 
seasons: 2007-08 and 2010-11. Lafayette quickly established a winning tradition. 
In their fourth season, the Leopards went 10-1, followed by a 15-3 season 
in 1976-77. Led by head coach Barbara Young, the Leopards received their 
first postseason bid to the Eastern Association of Intercollegiate Athletics 
for Women (EAIAW) playoffs (NCAA predecessor). The Leopards defeated Kutztown 
University before bowing out to Princeton University in their second loss 
to the Tigers that season. Lafayette qualified again in 1978 and defeated 
Loyola University (MD) before losing to Monmouth University by one point. 
Pat Fisher took over the squad in 1980–81 and would coach the Leopards 
for the next 20 seasons. She quickly established strong squads. Her first 
season entailed another AIAW bid, but the Leopards lost at home to Saint 
Peter's University, then Saint Peter's College. In 1982–83, the Leopards 
started ECC play and quickly established their dominance in the league. 
Lafayette won 20 or more games for five straight seasons, including their 
best record ever of 24–6 in 1984-85 and 1986-87. Lafayette won the 1985 
ECC Tournament Championship by crushing Lehigh by 20 and defeated the Mountain 
Hawks for the second title in 1987. Lafayette made the championship game 
in 1984, 1986, and 1988, but lost to Drexel University and the University 
of Delaware twice by a combined 11 points. During the 1980s, the Leopards 
were led by their best players in history. Maureen McManus and Stacey Cagnello, 
who played together from 1983–1987, finished first and second on the all-time 
career scoring list with 1,813 and 1,520 points respectively. McManus also 
led the team in rebounding for two seasons. The squad was also led by Beth 
Mowins, who finished her career as the all-time leader in assists with 
703, more than 400 ahead of the current second place leader, and is also 
ranked 11th in all-time scoring. Mowins later went on to serve as a sportscaster 
at ESPN and serves a color commentator for many major college basketball 
and football games. The Leopards entered Patriot League play in 1990-91 
and posted two 19-win seasons in 1992 and 1993. In December 1992, Heidi 
Caruso tied the all-time women's NCAA individual record for steals in a 
game against Kansas State University with 14.[9] She still holds the record 
and led the nation in steals in 1992, 1993, and 1994, with her 1993 and 
1994 mark being the third and fourth best individual marks to date. She 
is the NCAA women's third all-time steals leader. After going 7-5 in Patriot 
League play and 15-13 overall in 1997-98, the Leopards have not had a winning 
record in Patriot League play or in a season. Pat Fisher stepped down following 
2001 with a 295-284 career mark in 21 years. Tammy Smith promptly took 
over the program, but the Leopards won only 55 games in nine seasons, including 
27 wins in the Patriot League. However, the Leopards made a miracle run 
to the 2009 Patriot League Championship game. After a 6-21 season and only 
two league wins, the Leopards knocked off American University and Navy 
to reach the championship game, where the fell by eight to Lehigh.[10] 
Diane Nolan took over the program in 2010 and led the Leopards to their 
second double-digit win total in 13 years. The Leopards are currently led 
by phenom shot-blocker Danielle Fiacco, who despite missing a portion of 
the 2010-11 season to injury, managed to finish with 71 blocks as a freshman. 
Halfway through her sophomore campaign, she set a new Lafayette record 
with 161 blocks and counting. She finished the season ranked second in 
the NCAA with 3.73 blocks per game behind Baylor's Brittney Griner.[11] 
Lafayette is 440-556 all-time in 40 seasons. Cross Country has been run 
at Lafayette since there has been a track and field program in the 19th 
century. The current course is at the Metzger Athletics Complex on Sullivan 
Trail in Forks Township. In the Patriot League era, the men's team had 
their best team finish in 1997 and 1998, both third-place finishes. The 
team has finished higher seventh in the championship only once since 2000, 
when the league had six teams. David Robinson is the most prolific runner 
in Lafayette's recent history, earning three all-Patriot League selections 
in 1995, 1996, and 1997. Lafayette has had ten all-league selections, seventh 
most in the league. The women had their best season in history in 1993, 
when they won the Patriot League Championship by one point over Lehigh. 
Three runners placed on the all-league team and coach Julio Piazza won 
coach of the year accolades. Megan Smith placed in the meet, and would 
do so again in 1995 and 1996. She currently holds the 17th best time at 
the Patriot League meet. Lafayette has had 86 women place on the all-league 
team, fourth most all-time and 24 ahead of Lehigh. Since 2000, Lafayette 
has placed higher than sixth only once. Neither the men's or women's team 
has ever appeared at the NCAA Championship meet, which dates to the 1930s. 
A men and women's individual runner has never qualified for the meet. All 
Lafyette Home games for basketball, football, and baseball are broadcast 
onto RCN4. RCN runs the Lafayette Sports Network. Lafayette field hockey 
has been one of the most successful teams in Lafayette athletics history. 
The squad has won numerous Patriot League Championships, ECAC Championships, 
two NCAA play-in games, and one NCAA Tournament appearance. The team has 
also had numerous All-Americans and U.S. national team selections. Overall, 
Lafayette is currently ranked 12th in all-time NCAA winning percentage 
with .607 and is tied with Ohio State University at 15th with 416 all-time 
victories. Former head coach Ann Gold is ranked 12th in career victories 
with 294 and 22nd in winning percentage with .607. The Leopards have had 
28 winning seasons in 40 years and play their home games at Rappolt Field.[12] 
Lafayette quickly established regional dominance upon the start of women's 
athletics in 1972. In their second season of play, Lafayette went 8-0-1 
for their only undefeated season. The Leopards finished 11-1-2 in 1976 
before making 14 straight postseason appearances in the EAWIW and ECC. 
The Patriot League did not host a tournament until 1994. Ann Gold guided 
the Leopards to each appearance since her first season in 1982, breaking 
through for her first ECC Championship in 1987 with a 15-2-5 team. The 
University of Delaware entered their meeting with the Leopards on a 17-game 
ECC unbeaten streak, which ended with tie. In the league tournament, Delaware 
had won the six previous league championships and never lost to Lafayette 
until the Leopards prevailed 2-1 after three overtimes and two sets of 
flickoffs. Lafayette won the championship again in 1989 with an 18-4-0 
mark. Lafayette won the inaugural Patriot League Championship with a 19-3-0 
record and qualified for the ECAC Division I Championships, a regional 
post-season tournament. Lafayette defeated Princeton and Harvard to capture 
the title. Lafayette made return trips in 1992, where they fell to Rider 
University, and defeated Rider and West Chester University in 1993 to claim 
the title. Early Patriot League Champions did not receive a bid to the 
NCAA Tournament until 1996. During the era, Suzi Farrell finished her career 
with 79 goals, which currently rank 24th most in NCAA history. Anne Russell 
ranks sixth all-time in save percentage with .900, with teammate Eileen 
Quigley ranked sixth at .899.[12][13] In 1999, Lafayette had its best season 
to date. The team finished 19-2 and qualified for the NCAA Tournament as 
the Patriot League champion. Lafayette fell to eventual national champion 
Maryland 6-0 and finished the season ranked 19 in the top 20. Lafayette 
repeated their dominant performance in 2002, going 19-3 and winning the 
Patriot League championship. The Leopards lost in an NCAA play-in game 
to the University of California, Berkley 1-0 in overtime, but finished 
the season ranked 18. Goaltender Casey Devlin had one of the most prolific 
single seasons in NCAA history, posting a 19-3 mark. Her 19 wins are tied 
for 11th most in NCAA history and her .864 winning percentage is tied for 
18th for a single season, while her career winning percentage ranks 16th 
all-time. Megan Monahan, Jen Stone, and Meredith Hahn led the Leopard attack 
and established program marks for goals and assists in a season.[12][13] 
In the mid-2000s, the Leopards faced the most challenging era in their 
history. From 2004 to 2007, the team had four straight losing seasons. 
In their previous 31 years, Lafayette never had back-to-back losing seasons. 
As the rest of the Patriot League instituted athletic scholarships, the 
Leopards were at a competitive disadvantage recruiting top players. The 
Board of Trustees finally decided to award scholarships in early 2006. 
But after 24 years, Ann Gold retired following the 2006 season. American 
University also established a dominant position in the league as carried 
in a full scholarship team upon joining the league. The program plotted 
a new trajectory under current head coach Andrew Griffiths. With scholarships, 
the Leopards returned to a winning season in 2008 and 2009. Megan Cicchi 
established a dominant presence on defense to become one of only seven 
players to be named to the All-Patriot League team four times. Goaltender 
Kelsey Anderson was named third-team All-American, the first Lafayette 
selection since Jen Stone in 2003. In 2010, Lafayette established several 
NCAA records in a dominant win over Holy Cross. The Leopards' 11 assists 
rank tied for fifth all-time for most in one game, while their 27 points 
in one game is tied for 27th all-time. Deanna DiCroce is tied for second 
all-time in NCAA history with six assists in one game, while Emily Valeo 
is in a multi-way tie at 24 with four assists.[12][13] In 2011, the Leopards 
won their first Patriot League championship since 2002 over Bucknell, ending 
American University's string of eight consecutive titles. Since the Leopards 
title run in 2002, Bucknell was the only Patriot League team to defeat 
American in the tournament. The championship avenged defeats to American 
in the final in 2009 and 2010. Lafayette fell to Ohio University 2-1 in 
overtime.[13] Lafayette has the most Patriot League team selections and 
tournament appearances. Lafayette is 416-260-45 all-time in 39 years. Lafayette 
football is one of the oldest collegiate football programs in the nation. 
Founded in 1882, the football team has won three national championships, 
six Patriot League championships, six undefeated seasons, and four undefeated, 
untied seasons. For most of its history, Lafayette played an independent 
schedule until joining the Patriot League in 1986. Between 1929 and 1975, 
the Leopards were a part of an unofficial conference, the “Middle Three 
Conference,” which consisted of Rutgers University and Lehigh University. 
Today, Lafayette football is most noted for its fierce arch-rivalry with 
Lehigh, which is the most played rivalry in college football (150 games) 
and the most consecutive years played (since 1897). ESPN considers "The 
Rivalry" to be among the top ten in college football,[14] and was the subject 
of a PBS documentary narrated by NFL Films voice and Philadelphia Phillies 
broadcaster Harry Kalas. Aside from Lehigh and Rutgers, Lafayette’s primary 
rivals are Bucknell University and the University of Pennsylvania. Lafayette 
has produced four consensus All-Americans (FBS),[15] 11 FCS All-Americans, 
four College Football Hall of Fame players,[15] and three College Football 
Hall of Fame coaches. Lafayette football has produced and nurtured several 
legendary football personalities, such as George Barclay, inventor of the 
football helmet, and Jock Sutherland, legendary coach of the Pittsburgh 
Panthers and Pittsburgh Steelers. Lafayette is also credited with inventing 
the huddle during a game in which Pennsylvania was stealing hand signals.[16] 
Lafayette is all-time 654–559–39 in 130 seasons. Lafayette’s golf program 
began in 1963. Since the inception of the Patriot League in 1991, six Leopards 
have been recognized with All-Patriot League status. The Leopards posted 
one of their best finishes in 2003 when Jim Hutnik was recognized as Coach 
of the Year for guiding the team to fourth place in the final standings.[17] 
In 2010, the Leopards won their first Patriot League Championship by defeating 
Lehigh in the league tournament. Rob Robertson placed first in the tournament 
by posting a 221 over three days of competition. The Leopards subsequently 
qualified for their first NCAA Tournament and finished 14th and last place 
at the Eastern Regional. Cheerleaders at Lafayette are among the College's 
most visible students. They cheer for the Leopards' Division I men's and 
women's basketball teams, and the Division I FCS football team. Cheerleading 
at Lafayette is an athletic activity and is supported by the athletic department, 
which provides a host of services, including sports medicine, strength 
and conditioning, uniforms, warm-ups and travel. Being a member of the 
squad requires dedication and time management to balance academics, conditioning, 
practices, cheerleading at football and basketball games, and performances 
at various events. The season is nearly year-round, beginning with tryouts 
in the spring before the squad attends camp and begins practice in August. 
They cheer for the football team through November before turning to basketball 
season for both the men's and women's teams, which continues until March. 
The squad usually practices three to four days a week, depending on the 
upcoming schedule. The team is led by seniors Allie DeMoncada, Mikee Swick,
