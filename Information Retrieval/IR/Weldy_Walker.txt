Weldy Wilberforce Walker (July 27, 1860 – November 23, 1937), sometimes 
known as Welday Walker and W. W. Walker, was an American baseball player. 
In 1884, he became the second African American to play Major League Baseball. 
Walker played college baseball at Oberlin College and the University of 
Michigan. In July 1884, he joined the Toledo Blue Stockings of the American 
Association which was then part of Major League Baseball. His brother Moses 
Fleetwood Walker, commonly known as Fleetwood (or "Fleet") Walker, was 
the first African American to play Major League Baseball, making his debut 
two months before Weldy. In 1887, as racial segregation took hold in professional 
baseball, Weldy joined the Pittsburgh Keystones of the short-lived National 
Colored Base Ball League. His March 1888 open letter to The Sporting Life 
protesting the racial segregation of baseball has been described as "perhaps 
the most passionate cry for justice ever voiced by a Negro athlete."[1] 
After retiring from baseball, Walker operated restaurants and a hotel in 
eastern Ohio. In 1897, he served on the Executive Committee of the Negro 
Protective Party, a newly formed political party established in Ohio in 
protest of the failure of the Republican governor to investigate the lynching 
of an African American in June 1897 at Urbana, Ohio. In the 1900s, Weldy 
and his brother Fleetwood became active in the Back-to-Africa movement 
and promoted emigration to Liberia. The brothers also established and edited 
The Equator, a black issues newspaper. Walker was born in 1860 in Steubenville, 
Ohio, an industrial city in the eastern part of the state with a reputation 
for racial tolerance.[2] Weldy's name was a combination of the biblical 
word for wealthy ("weldy") and the surname of English abolitionist William 
Wilberforce.[3] His parents, Moses W. Walker and Caroline (O'Hara) Walker, 
moved to Steubenville from Mount Pleasant, Ohio.[2] His father was a minister 
in the Methodist Episcopal Church, a physician, and a leader in Steubenville's 
African-American community.[4][5][6] In June 1870, at the time of the 1870 
United States Census, the Walker family was living in Steubenville's First 
Ward. Walker's father was identified as a minister who had been born in 
Virginia. The couple had four children listed in the Census: William (age 
25), Mary (age 21), Sarah (age 19), Moses F. (age 11) and Weldy W. (age 
9).[7] In June 1880, at the time of the 1880 United States Census, the 
family was still living in Steubenville and consisted of Moses (age 59, 
clergyman), Caroline (age 57), William (age 35, teamster), Sarah (age 22), 
Moses (age 21, at school), Weldan (age 19, at school), and Mary Alexander 
(age 13, adopted).[8] Weldy attended Steubenville's integrated public high 
school in the 1870s.[9] While Weldy was still in high school, his older 
brother, Fleetwood Walker, enrolled at Oberlin College, which was among 
the first colleges in the United States to become racially integrated.[2][10] 
In 1881, Weldy joined his brother at Oberlin College, enrolling as a student 
in the Oberlin's preparatory school.[5][11] In the spring of 1881, the 
Walker brothers played on Oberlin College's first varsity inter-collegiate 
baseball team. Weldy, a freshman, played right field while Fleetwood, a 
junior, was the catcher.[2][10][12] According to one account, Weldy played 
second base and finished the 1881 season as Oberlin's second leading batter.[13] 
After the 1881 baseball season, Weldy's brother Fleetwood transferred to 
the University of Michigan and played as a catcher for the Michigan Wolverines 
baseball team in 1882. Fleetwood became the first African American to play 
on a varsity sports team at Michigan and helped lead the Wolverines to 
a 10–3 record, a conference championship, and the best record for a Michigan 
baseball team up to that time.[14] Weldy initially remained at Oberlin, 
but he transferred to Michigan in the fall of 1882 as a student in the 
homeopathic medical school.[15] In the fall of 1882, the Oberlin Review 
reported: "Weldy Walker, '85 leaves to assist his brother in making the 
'Ann Harbor' [sic] nine a little more able to compete with Oberlin."[16] 
Two weeks later, a writer for an Ann Arbor newspaper noted that "we have 
added to the list Weldy Walker, a magnificent fielder, safe batter, and 
phenomenal base runner."[17] Before the 1883 baseball season began, Fleetwood 
left Michigan to play professional baseball for a team from New Castle, 
Pennsylvania.[14] During the 1883 season, Weldy became the second African 
American to play for the Michigan baseball team. He played third base for 
Michigan and also served on the Board of Directors of the University Base-Ball 
Association.[10][18] Weldy also played for Michigan as a catcher during 
part of the 1884 baseball season.[15][19] Weldy scored four runs and had 
four hits in five at-bats to help Michigan defeat Michigan Agricultural 
College (later known as Michigan State University) on June 14, 1884.[20] 
According to Rich Adler's book Baseball at the University of Michigan, 
each of the Walker brothers was "accepted as a member of the student body," 
although neither received a degree from the university.[21] At the start 
of the 1884 baseball season, Weldy continued to study homeopathic medicine 
and play baseball at Michigan. Meanwhile, Fleetwood was playing for the 
Toledo Blue Stockings of the American Association, which was considered 
to be part of Major League Baseball. On May 1, 1884,[22] Fleetwood became 
the first African American to play in Major League Baseball.[10][23][24][25] 
As the 1884 baseball season progressed, the roster of the Toledo Blue Stockings 
was depleted by injuries. In need of additional players, the team recruited 
Weldy to join his brother in Toledo. Weldy appeared in his first game for 
the Blue Stockings on July 15, 1884,[26] becoming the second African American 
to play Major League Baseball.[5][27][28][29][30] Weldy appeared in five 
games as an outfielder for the Blue Stockings between July 15 and August 
6, 1884. He had four hits, two runs batted in, and one run scored in 18 
at-bats for a .222 batting average.[26][31] After a series in Indianapolis, 
an article in The Sporting Life noted that "the Toledos were short-handed 
and played Weldy Walker, a brother of the catcher; he played well."[32] 
The Walker brothers in 1884 were the last African Americans to play Major 
League Baseball for more than 60 years until Jackie Robinson joined the 
Brooklyn Dodgers in 1947.[33][34] Weldy blamed Chicago White Stockings 
player-manager Cap Anson for the fact that neither he, his brother, nor 
any other African Americans were allowed to play in the major leagues after 
1884.[35] During the 1884 season, Anson refused to play against Toledo 
until the Walker brothers were benched. In 1887, Anson again refused to 
play against the Newark team on which Fleetwood played.[36] Anson biographer 
David L. Fleitz shared Weldy's belief that Anson was responsible for the 
game's segregation: "Cap Anson, more than anyone else, was the man who 
wielded the infamous pen."[29] Following his time with the Blue Stockings, 
Weldy played for the Cleveland team in the Western League.[19][37] During 
the 1885 season, Weldy compiled a .375 batting average for the Cleveland 
Forest Cities.[38] In 1886, Weldy played third base for the Excelsior Club 
in Cleveland.[39] By early 1887, 13 African Americans were playing in the 
"white" minor leagues, including four in the Ohio State League.[33] Weldy 
began the season with the Akron Acorns of the Ohio State League. However, 
he appeared in only four games for the Acorns.[38] During the 1887 season, 
racial segregation began to become the official policy in certain minor 
leagues.[1] Weldy was outraged by a report that the Tri-State League (successor 
to the Ohio State League) had abandoned racial integration. In March 1888, 
he wrote a letter to the league's president protesting the decision. In 
his 1970 history of racial segregation in baseball, Robert Peterson described 
Weldy's letter as "perhaps the most passionate cry for justice ever voiced 
by a Negro athlete."[1] In the letter, Walker wrote: The law is a disgrace 
to the present age, and reflects very much upon the intelligence of your 
last meeting, and casts derision at the laws of Ohio – the voice of the 
people – that say all men are equal. I would suggest that your honorable 
body, in case that black law is not repealed, pass one making it criminal 
for a colored man or woman to be found on a ball ground ... There should 
be some broader cause – such as lack of ability, behavior and intelligence – 
for barring a player, rather than his color. It is for these reasons and 
because I think ability and intelligence should be recognized first and 
last – at all times and by everyone – I ask the question again, 'Why was 
the law permitting colored men to sign repealed, etc.?'[1][40] On March 
14, 1888, and at Weldy's request, his letter was published in The Sporting 
Life under the headline "Why Discriminate?"[41][42] In his book on baseball's 
segregation, Robert Peterson wrote that Weldy's question "went unanswered, 
because it was unanswerable . . . but the truth was plain for all who wished 
to see it: Jim Crow was warming up."[43] In 1887, Weldy joined the Pittsburgh 
Keystones in the newly formed National Colored Base Ball League and compiled 
a .360 batting average in five games as a player.[38][44][45] Although 
the National Colored Base Ball League disbanded after a short time, the 
Keystones continued to play as an independent team. Weldy took over as 
the team's manager in 1888 and led the Keystones to a 9–1 record in the 
first ten games of the season. The Keystones' lineup in 1888 also included 
Sol White. In early June 1888, The Cleveland Gazette wrote that Weldy was 
"making quite a success of the Keystone Base Ball Club."[44] Walker became 
involved in a civil rights lawsuit in 1884 after a roller-skating rink 
in Steubenville denied entry to Walker and his friend, Hannibal Lyons. 
The Cleveland Gazette, an African-American weekly newspaper, described 
the circumstances as follows: Steubenville, like many other places, is 
suffering now from the roller skate craze. There are now three in full 
blast and prospects for more. Discrimination on account of color never 
was carried on in Steubenville until these strangers starting rinks here 
issued the edict "No Negroes need apply except for positions of menials." 
On the 16th there was an opening night at the South Side Rink, and two 
of our young men of gentlemanly deportment and honest reputation applied 
for admission. The proprietor of the rink flatly told them, "You are colored 
and you can't skate."[46] Walker and Lyons filed a civil rights lawsuit 
accusing the operator, Massey & Son, of racial discrimination.[47][48] 
Some local newspaper accounts of the suit suggested that "Walker and Lyons 
were troublemakers stirring a 'political and social racket.'"[49] Following 
a trial in January 1885, the presiding judge, Justice May, ruled that the 
skating rink operator had violated the rights of Walker and Lyons "under 
the civil rights law, and a special law of the Ohio Legislature giving 
the colored man certain privileges."[47] The court awarded them each fifteen 
dollars each in damages, with costs.[47] However, the court declined to 
enter an order requiring the rink operator to admit African Americans. 
In his biography of Fleetwood Walker, David Zang called the court's ruling 
"a judgment that nominally supported integration while doing nothing to 
promote it in everyday reality."[49] During the 1890s, Walker became active 
in politics. Walker's activism was heightened by an incident in June 1897 
in which residents of Urbana, Ohio, formed a lynch mob, removed a black 
man named "Click" Mitchell from the town jail, and publicly killed him 
by hanging.[50][51] Believing that Ohio's Republican Governor Asa Bushnell 
had failed to conduct an appropriate investigation into the lynching, Walker 
and other African Americans in Ohio left the Republican Party and formed 
the Negro Protective Party.[52][53][54] As a member of the party's Executive 
Committee, Walker helped organize the party's convention at Columbus, Ohio 
in September 1897.[50] The party adopted a platform demanding "an immediate 
recognition of our rights as citizens such as have been repeatedly pledged 
and as often violated," and declaring an intention "to take immediate political 
action that we may show to the world that we are no longer the plaything 
of politicians or chattels for sale to the highest bidder."[55] The party 
also began publishing "The Negro Protector" as its official organ.[56] 
When former slave and Republican Party official, Nelson T. Gant, attacked 
Walker and the Negro Protective Party, Walker responded with an open letter 
that was published in Ohio newspapers. In the letter, Walker wrote: Notwithstanding 
N. T. Gant there are many "intelligent Negroes" who will support the Negro 
protective ticket and will hurl back at him with contempt his insults to 
their manhood that they are not free to leave the republican party without 
being branded as "betrayers of their party" and "ungrateful to their Creator 
and their race." Such fumings are manifestly the strongest evidence of 
an enslaved mind ... Republicans ... believe, or make pretense of believing, 
that the Negro owes eternal allegiance to the G. O. P. no matter what the 
issue ... We shall not trespass further upon your valuable space, except 
to say that the Negro Protective party will live and its supporters hope 
never to regret the stand taken for free and independent manhood as a protest 
against every disregard, from whatever source, of the rights and privileges 
of the Negro as an American citizen.[50] When Ohio's Republican Secretary 
of State Charles Kinney refused to print the Negro Protective Party's emblem 
(an image of Abraham Lincoln) on the state ballot,[57] the party filed 
a mandamus action to compel him to do so.[58] When the party's gubernatorial 
candidate, S. J. Lewis, received 4,276 votes in the official vote count, 
The Cleveland Gazette opined that Governor Bushnell's narrow plurality 
victory was "a direct result of the governor's failure to do his duty during 
the life of the mob that lynched innocent Afro-American, 'Click" Mitchell, 
at Urbana."[59] Even before retiring from baseball, Weldy became active 
in business. In October 1884, Weldy and a partner went into business operating 
Delmonico Dining Rooms in Mingo Junction, Ohio, near Steubenville.[60] 
In 1897, Weldy and Joe Jetters opened an oyster and fish store on North 
Sixth Street in Steubenville.[61] The 1890s were a turbulent decade for 
Weldy's older brother Fleetwood. In 1891, Fleetwood stabbed a man to death 
outside a saloon, but was acquitted on grounds of self-defense. In 1898, 
while employed as a railroad postal clerk, Fleetwood was charged with embezzling 
the contents of registered letters addressed to a dozen different persons 
and served a year in jail.[62][63] In 1899, while Fleetwood was still in 
jail, Weldy began operating the Union Hotel at 105 Market Street in downtown 
Steubenville.[64] Following Fleetwood's release from jail, the hotel/boarding 
house was jointly operated by Fleetwood and Weldy. In June 1900, at the 
time of the 1900 United States Census, Walker was living at the Union Hotel 
with Fleetwood, Fleetwood's second wife Ednah, and their three children. 
The family also had a live-in servant, Sarah Richmond (age 45). Fleetwood 
was identified in the 1900 Census as the operator of a boarding house, 
and Weldy as a "porter."[65] A 1902 city directory listed Fleetwood as 
the hotel's proprietor and Weldy as the clerk, but a 1904–05 directory 
listed Weldy as the proprietor and Fleetwood and Ednah as residents.[66] 
By 1906, Weldy had temporarily relocated several miles downriver to Wheeling, 
West Virginia, and rumors circulated that the Union Hotel would be sold 
and turned into "a first class house for the accommodation of Afro-American 
visitors."[67] In the 1900s, the Walker brothers became active in the Back-to-Africa 
movement. In 1902, Fleetwood and Weldy established and edited a black-issues 
newspaper called The Equator.[37][68] Six years later, Fleetwood and Weldy 
published a 47-page book titled Our Home Colony: A Treatise on the Past, 
Present, and Future of the Negro Race in America. Fleetwood's biographer, 
David Zang, has written that Fleetwood "was effected by the political vigilance 
which his younger brother, Weldy, had brought to the black cause."[69] 
In the credits to Our Home Colony, Fleetwood was identified as the author, 
and Weldy was identified as "General Agent," though much of the book is 
written in the first-person plural.[70] In the book, the Walkers wrote: 
"The only practical and permanent solution of the present and future race 
troubles in the United States is entire separation by Emigration of the 
Negro from America."[71] They added: "The Negro race will be a menace and 
the source of discontent as long as it remains in large numbers in the 
United States. The time is growing very near when the whites of the United 
States must either settle this problem by deportation, or else be willing 
to accept a reign of terror such as the world has never seen in a civilized 
country."[72] The Walker brothers also opened an office to begin the work 
of resettlement to Africa at the time Our Home Colony was published.[37][69] 
In his 1908 response to an Oberlin College alumni questionnaire, Weldy 
listed his occupation as "General Agent" for Our Home Colony and Liberian 
emigration.[37][64][73] By 1910, Fleetwood had moved to Cadiz, Ohio, where 
he operated an 800-seat vaudeville theater.[37] In April 1910, at the time 
of the 1910 United States Census, Weldy was still living at 105 Market 
Street in Steubenville, and the property was being operated as a boarding 
house. The proprietor and head of the household was identified as Thomas 
F. Walker, Weldy's nephew and Fleetwood's son. Weldy was listed as a "waiter."[74] 
In January 1920, at the time of the 1920 United States Census, Walker was 
living at 100 Market Street in Steubenville with nephew Thomas and Thomas's 
wife, Jeanette. Thomas was listed as the "keeper" of the hotel, and Weldy 
(identified as "Welda") was listed as having no employment.[75] Weldy remained 
politically active in his later years and was a friend of Harry C. Smith, 
the owner and editor of The Cleveland Gazette, the longest-publishing African-American 
weekly in the United States.[76] After Smith helped the Republican Party 
elect President Warren Harding in 1920, Weldy sent Smith a congratulatory 
letter noting that the Negro vote played a role in Harding's victory. Still 
focused on the practice of lynching in the Southern states, Weldy added: 
"The North would not have known there had been an election in Florida unless 
that old game of killing six or more Negroes for wanting to vote had been 
pulled off. When will 'Uncle Sam' allow the poor southern Negro 'life, 
liberty and the pursuit of happiness.'"[77] When Fleetwood died in Cleveland 
in May 1924, Weldy and Thomas traveled to Cleveland and returned Fleetwood's 
remains to Steubenville in a casket costing $525.[78] According to Fleetwood 
biographer, David Zang, Weldy became a bootlegger during Prohibition, and 
nephew Thomas was a numbers bookie.[63] In April 1930, at the time of the 
1930 United States Census, Walker was a "roomer" in an all-black boarding 
house at 117 South 6th Street in Steubenville operated by Eugene Williams. 
His occupation was listed as a clerk.[79] Walker never married.[75][79][80] 
In November 1937, he died from pneumonia at his home at 100 Market Street 
in Steubenville. His occupation was listed as a retired hotel manager at
