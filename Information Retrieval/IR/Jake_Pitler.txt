Jacob Albert Pitler (April 22, 1894 – February 3, 1968) was an American 
second baseman and longtime coach in Major League Baseball. Born in New 
York City, of Jewish descent,[1] he stood 5 ft 8 in (1.73 m) (173 cm) tall, 
weighed 150 pounds (68 kg), and batted and threw right-handed. Pitler began 
his professional playing career in 1913 at Jackson of the Class C Southern 
Michigan Association. When that league disbanded in 1915, Pitler was picked 
up by the Chattanooga Lookouts of the Class A Southern Association. He 
was batting a healthy .364 in 42 games when his contract was purchased 
by the Pittsburgh Pirates in the midseason of 1917 during the World War 
I manpower crisis. He played in 109 games for Pittsburgh that season, and 
two contests in 1918, compiling a .232 average in 383 at bats with no home 
runs and 23 runs batted in. He then joined the war effort. During much 
of the 1920s, Pitler was out of "organized" minor league baseball, playing 
in semi-professional or "outlaw" leagues. But in 1928, he joined the Binghamton 
Triplets of the New York–Pennsylvania League and became a fixture in that 
circuit, playing also for Elmira and Hazleton, and beginning his managing 
career in 1934 with Scranton. In 1939, Pitler joined the Brooklyn Dodgers 
as a minor league manager, winning back-to-back pennants with the Olean 
Oilers of the PONY League in 1939–40. He was promoted to the Dodger coaching 
staff in 1947 and served through the end of the team's stay in Brooklyn 
in 1957 — through six National League championships and Brooklyn's lone 
world title, which came in 1955. Pitler usually served as Brooklyn's first-base 
coach, and worked under Dodgers' managers Leo Durocher, Burt Shotton, Chuck 
Dressen and Walter Alston. He appeared in Roger Kahn's memoir The Boys 
of Summer as a somewhat obsequious aide to Dressen. But with his minor 
league managing background, he was also hailed as a fatherly figure to 
Dodger rookies and young players. He was cited for that role in poet Marianne 
Moore's paean to the 1955 champions, Hometown Piece for Messrs. Alston 
and Reese. After retiring as a coach after the 1957 season rather than 
moving with the Dodgers to Los Angeles, Pitler continued his association 
with the team as a scout. He died in Binghamton, New York, in 1968 at the 
age of 73.[2] In 1991, he was inducted into the Jewish Sports Hall of Fame 
in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Pitler holds the record for most putouts in 
a game by a second baseman, with 15, made in a 22 inning game on August
