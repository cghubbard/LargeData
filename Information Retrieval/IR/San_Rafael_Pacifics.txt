The San Rafael Pacifics is a professional baseball team based in San Rafael, 
California, United States and are a charter franchise of the four-team 
Pacific Association of Professional Baseball Clubs, an independent professional 
baseball circuit not affiliated with Major League Baseball. The Pacifics 
franchise was launched by Centerfield Partners LLC of Dublin, California. 
Along with a sister team owned and operated by Centerfield Partners, the 
Sonoma County Grapes, the Pacifics made their debut in the 2012 baseball 
season at 1,000-seat Albert Park in San Rafael.[1] The team is now owned 
by Redwood Sports and Entertainment. The president of the Pacifics is Mike 
Shapiro, a 25-year baseball veteran with previous front-office stints at 
the San Francisco Giants (general counsel), Atlanta Braves (senior counsel), 
Turner Sports (VP), and Washington Nationals (SVP). The North American 
Baseball League was a nine-year-old, ten-team, professional, independent 
minor league formed from teams of the former Golden Baseball and United 
Baseball leagues. Play is typically described as A- to AA- caliber baseball, 
with players primarily coming from previous stints in the major league-affiliated 
AAA-, AA-, and A- leagues. The North American Baseball League folded in 
2012. The Pacifics were the final champions of the league. The Pacifics' 
ownership, Redwood Sports and Entertainment, took the four former Northern 
Division teams from the NAL and created a new league, the Pacific Association 
of Professional Baseball Clubs. The league initially consisted of the Pacifics, 
Na Koa Ikaika Maui (also formerly of the GBL), Hawaii Stars and Sonoma 
County Grapes. However, the Grapes folded and were replaced by the Vallejo 
Admirals. In 2014 both Hawaii teams folded and the Sonoma Stompers and 
the Pittsburg Diamonds were added to the league. Pitchers Catchers Infielders
