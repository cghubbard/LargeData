ERA setting the North Carolina State University freshman record with 135

6–7 with a 2.01 ERA and 117 strikeouts in 98 2⁄3 innings.[12] After his 
freshman year, Rodon earned a spot on USA Baseball's Collegiate National 
Team. Originally, he almost turned down the offer because his coach at 
North Carolina State University, Elliott Avent had intentions of shutting 
him down for the summer. However, the offer was too good to refuse because 
Rodon would have had the opportunity to play in Cuba, where his family 
is from.[13] After his sophomore year, Team USA once again had him listed 
as a top prospect and Rodon spent the summer of 2013 playing for the team 
(USA). Over the past two seasons on Team USA, Rodon allowed only three 
earned runs over thirty-six innings (0.75 ERA) and contributed forty-two 
strikeouts for the team.[14] The Chicago White Sox selected Rodon in the 
first round, third overall, in the 2014 Major League Baseball Draft.[15] 
He signed with the White Sox on July 11.[16] He made his pro debut on July 
22 with the Arizona League White Sox. After pitching for the Winston-Salem 
Dash of the Class A-Advanced Carolina League, the White Sox promoted Rodon 
to the Charlotte Knights of the Class AAA International League, where he 
debuted on August 19.[17] On April 20, 2015, Rodon was called up to the 
Sox major league roster.[18] The initial plan was to work Rodon out of 
the bullpen in the same way the team first used starter Chris Sale. Rodon 
made his Major League debut on April 21. He pitched 2.1 innings, giving 
up 2 runs, walked 3 batters, and struck out one.[19] He recorded his first 
start, and his first win, in the second game of a May 9 doubleheader against 
the Cincinnati Reds at US Cellular Field, giving up two earned runs in 
six innings on four hits, four walks and eight strikeouts.[20] In 26 games 
(23 starts), Rodon finished 9-6 with a 3.75 ERA. On July 9, 2016, Rodon 
was placed on the 15-day disabled list due to a left wrist sprain.[21]
