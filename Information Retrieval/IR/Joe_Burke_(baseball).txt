Joseph Roy Burke (December 8, 1923 â€“ May 12, 1992) was an American front 
office executive in Major League Baseball who served as general manager 
or club president of the Kansas City Royals for almost 18 years during 
the most successful period in that expansion team's early history. Burke 
was executive vice president and general manager of the Royals from the 
middle of the 1974 season through October 1981. He then served as club 
president until his death on May 12, 1992. During his tenure, Burke was 
general manager of the Royals' first American League championship team, 
the 1980 edition, then was president of the 1985 Royals, which won the 
franchise's first World Series title. In addition to those two pennant-winners, 
the Royals won American League West Division championships in 1976, 1977, 
1978, 1981 (second half of a split season) and 1984. In 1976, he was named 
Major League Executive of the Year by The Sporting News after his first 
division title. Before coming to Kansas City, Burke had been a member of 
the front office of the Texas Rangers and its predecessor, the second Washington 
Senators franchise. He had begun his baseball career in 1948 with the Louisville 
Colonels of the Triple-A American Association, where he worked under general 
manager Ed Doherty. After rising to the post of GM of the Colonels in 1960, 
Burke joined the expansion Senators in their debut 1961 season as business 
manager, again working for Doherty, the team's first general manager. He 
later was named the Senators' vice president and treasurer, and was retained 
when Bob Short purchased the Senators in 1968. He accompanied the franchise 
to Dallas-Fort Worth when it relocated after the 1971 season and became 
the Rangers' general manager in their first season in North Texas. In June 
1974, Burke became the second general manager in the Royals' six-year history. 
One of his first major moves was the hiring of Whitey Herzog as manager 
during the middle of the 1975 season on July 25. Herzog would be elected 
to the Baseball Hall of Fame as a manager in 2010, but he had failed dismally 
as the Rangers' pilot, working under Burke, during 1973. In Kansas City, 
he would turn the Royals into consistent contenders in the AL West. Burke 
also appointed Jim Frey and Dick Howser as managers after Herzog's exit, 
and each man would lead Kansas City to an American League pennant (and, 
in Howser's case, the 1985 World Series title as well). Burke became the 
Royals' second club president after the 1981 season, succeeding owner Ewing 
Kauffman, and his top assistant, John Schuerholz, was promoted to general 
manager. Burke died of lymphatic cancer in Kansas City, Kansas, at age
