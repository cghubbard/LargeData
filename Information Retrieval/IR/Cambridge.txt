Cambridge (/ˈkeɪmbrɪdʒ/[3] KAYM-brij) is a university city and the county 
town of Cambridgeshire, England, on the River Cam about 50 miles (80 km) 
north of London. At the United Kingdom Census 2011, its population was 
123,867, including 24,488 students.[4][5] There is archaeological evidence 
of settlement in the area in the Bronze Age and in Roman Britain; under 
Viking rule, Cambridge became an important trading centre. The first town 
charters were granted in the 12th century, although city status was not 
conferred until 1951. The skyline is dominated by the last two buildings, 
along with the spire of the Our Lady and the English Martyrs Church, the 
chimney of Addenbrooke's Hospital and St John's College Chapel tower. The 
University of Cambridge, founded in 1209, is one of the top five universities 
in the world.[6] The university includes the Cavendish Laboratory, King's 
College Chapel, and the Cambridge University Library. Anglia Ruskin University, 
formed from the Cambridge School of Art and the Cambridgeshire College 
of Arts and Technology, also has its main campus in the city. Cambridge 
is at the heart of the high-technology Silicon Fen with industries such 
as software and bioscience and many start-up companies spun out of the 
university. More than 40% of the workforce has a higher education qualification, 
more than twice the national average. The Cambridge Biomedical Campus, 
one of the largest biomedical research clusters in the world, is soon to 
be home to AstraZeneca, a hotel and the relocated Papworth Hospital.[7] 
Parker's Piece hosted the first ever game of Association football. The 
Strawberry Fair music and arts festival and Midsummer Fairs are held on 
Midsummer Common, and the annual Cambridge Beer Festival takes place on 
Jesus Green. The city is adjacent to the M11 and A14 roads, and Cambridge 
station is less than an hour from London King's Cross railway station. 
Settlements have existed around the Cambridge area since prehistoric times. 
The earliest clear evidence of occupation is the remains of a 3,500-year-old 
farmstead discovered at the site of Fitzwilliam College.[8] Archaeological 
evidence of occupation through the Iron Age is a settlement on Castle Hill 
from the 1st century BC, perhaps relating to wider cultural changes occurring 
in southeastern Britain linked to the arrival of the Belgae.[9] The principal 
Roman site is a small fort (castrum) Duroliponte on Castle Hill, just northwest 
of the city centre around the location of the earlier British village. 
The fort was bounded on two sides by the lines formed by the present Mount 
Pleasant, continuing across Huntingdon Road into Clare Street. The eastern 
side followed Magrath Avenue, with the southern side running near to Chesterton 
Lane and Kettle's Yard before turning northwest at Honey Hill.[10] It was 
constructed around AD 70 and converted to civilian use around 50 years 
later. Evidence of more widespread Roman settlement has been discovered 
including numerous farmsteads[11] and a village in the Cambridge district 
of Newnham.[12] Following the Roman withdrawal from Britain around 410, 
the location may have been abandoned by the Britons, although the site 
is usually identified as Cair Grauth[13] listed among the 28 cities of 
Britain by the History of the Britons.[14][16] Evidence exists that the 
invading Anglo-Saxons had begun occupying the area by the end of the century.[17] 
Their settlement—also on and around Castle Hill—became known as Grantebrycge[19] 
("Granta-bridge"). (By Middle English, the settlement's name had changed 
to "Cambridge" and the lower stretches of the Granta changed their name 
to match.[20]) Anglo-Saxon grave goods have been found in the area. During 
this period, Cambridge benefited from good trade links across the hard-to-travel 
fenlands. By the 7th century, the town was less significant and described 
by Bede as a "little ruined city" containing the burial site of Etheldreda.[18] 
Cambridge was on the border between the East and Middle Anglian kingdoms 
and the settlement slowly expanded on both sides of the river.[18] The 
arrival of the Vikings was recorded in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle in 875. 
Viking rule, the Danelaw, had been imposed by 878[22] Their vigorous trading 
habits caused the town to grow rapidly. During this period the centre of 
the town shifted from Castle Hill on the left bank of the river to the 
area now known as the Quayside on the right bank.[22] After the Viking 
period, the Saxons enjoyed a return to power, building churches such as 
St Bene't's Church, wharves, merchant houses and a mint, which produced 
coins with the town's name abbreviated to "Grant".[22] In 1068, two years 
after his conquest of England, William of Normandy built a castle on Castle 
Hill.[18] Like the rest of the newly conquered kingdom, Cambridge fell 
under the control of the King and his deputies. The first town charter 
was granted by Henry I between 1120 and 1131. It gave Cambridge monopoly 
of waterborne traffic and hithe tolls and recognised the borough court.[23] 
The distinctive Round Church dates from this period.[24] In 1209, Cambridge 
University was founded by students escaping from hostile townspeople in 
Oxford.[25] The oldest existing college, Peterhouse, was founded in 1284.[26] 
In 1349 Cambridge was affected by the Black Death. Few records survive 
but 16 of 40 scholars at Kings Hall died.[27] The town north of the river 
was severely affected being almost wiped out.[28] Following further depopulation 
after a second national epidemic in 1361, a letter from the Bishop of Ely 
suggested that two parishes in Cambridge be merged as there were not enough 
people to fill even one church.[27] With more than a third of English clergy 
dying in the Black Death, four new colleges were established at the university 
over the following years to train new clergymen, namely Gonville Hall, 
Trinity Hall, Corpus Christi and Clare.[29] In 1382 a revised town charter 
effects a "diminution of the liberties that the community had enjoyed", 
due to Cambridge's participation in the Peasants' Revolt. The charter transfers 
supervision of baking and brewing, weights and measures, and forestalling 
and regrating, from the town to the university.[23] King's College Chapel, 
was begun in 1446 by King Henry VI.[30] The chapel was built in phases 
by a succession of kings of England from 1446 to 1515, its history intertwined 
with the Wars of the Roses, and completed during the reign of King Henry 
VIII.[30] The building would become synonymous with Cambridge, and currently 
is used in the logo for the City Council.[31] Following repeated outbreaks 
of pestilence throughout the 16th Century,[32] sanitation and fresh water 
were brought to Cambridge by the construction of Hobson's Conduit in the 
early 1600s. Water was brought from Nine Wells, at the foot of the Gog 
Magog Hills, into the centre of the town.[33] Cambridge played a significant 
role in the early part of the English Civil War as it was the headquarters 
of the Eastern Counties Association, an organisation administering a regional 
East Anglian army, which became the mainstay of the Parliamentarian military 
effort before the formation of the New Model Army.[34] In 1643 control 
of the town was given by Parliament to Oliver Cromwell, who had been educated 
at Sidney Sussex College. The town's castle was fortified and garrisoned 
with troops and some bridges were destroyed to aid its defence. Although 
Royalist forces came within 2 miles (3 km) of the town in 1644, the defences 
were never used and the garrison was stood down the following year.[34] 
In the 19th century, in common with many other English towns, Cambridge 
expanded rapidly, due in part to increased life expectancy and improved 
agricultural production leading to increased trade in town markets.[35] 
The Inclosure Acts of 1801 and 1807 enabled the town to expand over surrounding 
open fields and in 1912 and again in 1935 its boundaries were extended 
to include Chesterton, Cherry Hinton, Fen Ditton, Trumpington, and Grantchester.[34] 
The railway came to Cambridge in 1845 after initial resistance, with the 
opening of the Great Eastern Railway's London to Norwich line. The station 
was outside the town centre following pressure from the university to restrict 
travel by undergraduates.[36] With the arrival of the railway and associated 
employment came development of areas around the station, such as Romsey 
Town.[37] The rail link to London stimulated heavier industries, such as 
the production of brick, cement and malt.[35] From the 1930s to the 1980s, 
the size of the city was increased by several large council estates.[38] 
The biggest impact has been on the area north of the river, which are now 
the estates of East Chesterton, King's Hedges, and Arbury where Archbishop 
Rowan Williams lived and worked as an assistant priest in the early 1980s.[39] 
During the Second World War, Cambridge was an important centre for defence 
of the east coast. The town became a military centre, with an R.A.F. training 
centre and the regional headquarters for Norfolk, Suffolk, Essex, Cambridgeshire, 
Huntingdonshire, Hertfordshire, and Bedfordshire established during the 
conflict.[34] The town itself escaped relatively lightly from German bombing 
raids, which were mainly targeted at the railway. 29 people were killed 
and no historic buildings were damaged. In 1944, a secret meeting of military 
leaders held in Trinity College laid the foundation for the allied invasion 
of Europe.[35] During the war Cambridge served as an evacuation centre 
for over 7,000 people from London, as well as for parts of the University 
of London.[34] Cambridge was granted its city charter in 1951 in recognition 
of its history, administrative importance and economic success.[34] Cambridge 
does not have a cathedral, traditionally a prerequisite for city status, 
instead falling within the Church of England Diocese of Ely. In 1962 Cambridge's 
first shopping arcade, Bradwell's Court, opened on Drummer Street, though 
this was demolished in 2006.[40] Other shopping arcades followed at Lion 
Yard, which housed a relocated Central Library for the city, and the Grafton 
Centre which replaced Victorian housing stock which had fallen into disrepair 
in the Kite area of the city. This latter project was controversial at 
the time.[41] The city gained its second University in 1992 when Anglia 
Polytechnic became Anglia Polytechnic University. Renamed Anglia Ruskin 
University in 2005, the institution has its origins in the Cambridge School 
of Art opened in 1858 by John Ruskin. The Open University also has a presence 
in the city, with an office operating on Hills Road.[citation needed] Cambridge 
is a non-metropolitan district served by Cambridge City Council. Cambridge 
Local Authority District covers most of the City's urban area but some 
extends outside this into South Cambridgeshire District. Cambridge is one 
of five districts within the county of Cambridgeshire, and is bordered 
on all sides by the mainly rural South Cambridgeshire district. The city 
council's headquarters are in the Guildhall, a large building in the market 
square. Cambridge was granted a Royal Charter by King John in 1207, which 
permitted the appointment of a Mayor,[42] although the first recorded Mayor, 
Harvey FitzEustace, served in 1213.[43] City councillors now elect a mayor 
annually. For electoral purposes the city is divided into 14 wards: Abbey, 
Arbury, Castle, Cherry Hinton, Coleridge, East Chesterton, King's Hedges, 
Market, Newnham, Petersfield, Queen Edith's, Romsey, Trumpington, and West 
Chesterton. The political composition of the city council is currently: 
25 Labour councillors, 14 Liberal Democrat, 2 independent and one Conservative.[44] 
Each of the 14 wards also elects councillors to Cambridgeshire County Council. 
Responsible for services including school education, social care and highways, 
since 2013 the County Council has had No Overall Control.[citation needed] 
The parliamentary constituency of Cambridge covers most of the city. Daniel 
Zeichner (Labour) was elected Member of Parliament (MP) at the 2015 general 
election, replacing Julian Huppert, a Liberal Democrat. One area of the 
city, Queen Edith's ward,[45] lies in the South Cambridgeshire constituency, 
whose MP is Heidi Allen (Conservative). Allen was also elected in 2015, 
and succeeded Andrew Lansley. The city had previously elected a Labour 
MP from 1992 to 2005 and prior to this, usually elected a Conservative 
after the Second World War. However, the Conservatives have seen their 
share of the vote fall over the past 20 years.[citation needed] The University 
of Cambridge used to have a seat in the House of Commons, Sir Isaac Newton 
being one of the most notable holders. The Cambridge University constituency 
was abolished under 1948 legislation, and ceased at the dissolution of 
Parliament for the 1950 general election, along with the other university 
constituencies. Cambridge is situated about 50 miles (80 km) north-by-east 
of London. The city is located in an area of level and relatively low-lying 
terrain just south of the Fens, which varies between 6 and 24 metres (20 
and 79 ft) above sea level.[46] The town was thus historically surrounded 
by low lying wetlands that have been drained as the town has expanded.[47] 
The underlying geology of Cambridge consists of gault clay and Chalk Marl, 
known locally as Cambridge Greensand,[48] partly overlaid by terrace gravel.[47] 
A layer of phosphatic nodules (coprolites) under the marl were mined in 
the 19th century for fertiliser. It became a major industry in the county, 
and its profits yielded buildings such as the Corn Exchange, Fulbourn Hospital 
and St. John's Chapel until the Quarries Act 1894 and competition from 
America ended production.[48] The River Cam flows through the city from 
the village of Grantchester, to the southwest. It is bordered by water 
meadows within the city such as Sheep's Green as well as residential development.[47] 
Like most cities, modern-day Cambridge has many suburbs and areas of high-density 
housing. The city centre of Cambridge is mostly commercial, historic buildings, 
and large green areas such as Jesus Green, Parker's Piece and Midsummer 
Common. Many of the roads in the centre are pedestrianised. Population 
growth has seen new housing developments in the 21st century, with estates 
such as the CB1[49] and Accordia schemes near the station,[50] and developments 
such as Great Kneighton, formally known as Clay Farm,[51] and Trumpington 
Meadows[52] currently under construction in the south of the city. Other 
major developments currently being constructed in the city are Darwin Green 
(formerly NIAB), and University-led developments at West Cambridge and 
North West Cambridge. The entire city centre, as well as parts of Chesterton, 
Petersfield, West Cambridge, Newnham, and Abbey, are covered by an Air 
Quality Management Area, implemented to counter high levels of nitrogen 
dioxide in the atmosphere.[53] Cambridge currently has two official weather 
observing stations, the National Institute of Agricultural Botany (NIAB), 
about 2 miles (3 km) north of the city centre, and the Cambridge University 
Botanic Garden, about 1 mile south of the city centre. In addition, the 
Digital Technology Group of the University's Computer Laboratory[54] maintains 
a weather station on the West Cambridge site, displaying current weather 
conditions online via web browsers or an app, and also an archive dating 
back to 1995.[55] The city, like most of the UK, has a maritime climate 
highly influenced by the Gulf Stream. Located in the driest region of Britain,[56][57] 
Cambridge's rainfall averages around 570 mm (22.44 in) per year, around 
half the national average,[58] with some years occasionally falling into 
the semi-arid (under 500 mm (19.69 in) of rain per year) category. The 
last time this occurred was in 2011 with 380.4 mm (14.98 in)[59] of rain 
at the Botanic Gardens and 347.2 mm (13.67 in) at the NIAB site.[60] Conversely, 
2012 was the wettest year on record, with 812.7 mm (32.00 in) reported.[61] 
Snowfall accumulations are usually small, in part because of Cambridge's 
low elevation, and low precipitation tendency during transitional snow 
events. Owing to its low lying, inland, and easterly position within the 
British Isles, summer temperatures tend to be somewhat higher than areas 
further west, and often rival or even exceed those recorded in the London 
area. July 2006 for example recorded the highest official mean monthly 
maximum (i.e. averaged over the entire month) of any month at any location 
in the UK since records began; 28.3 °C (82.9 °F), at both the NIAB[62] 
and Botanic Garden[63] observing stations. Cambridge also often records 
the annual highest national temperature in any given year – 30.2 °C (86.4 °F) 
in July 2008 at NIAB[64] and 30.1 °C (86.2 °F) in August 2007 at the Botanic 
Garden[65] are two recent examples. The absolute maximum stands at 36.9 °C 
(98.4 °F)[66] set on 10 August 2003, although a temperature of 37.5 °C 
(99.5 °F)[67] was recorded on the same day at the Guildhall rooftop weather 
station in the city centre and is acknowledged by the Met Office. Before 
this, the absolute maximum was 36.5 °C (97.7 °F) set at the Botanic Garden[68] 
in August 1990. The last time the temperature exceeded 35 °C (95 °F) was 
July 2006 when the maximum reached 35.6 °C (96.1 °F) at the Botanic Garden[63] 
and 35.8 °C (96.4 °F) at NIAB.[69] Typically the temperature will reach 
25.1 °C (77.2 °F) or higher on over 25 days of the year over the 1981–2010 
period,[70] with the annual warmest day averaging 31.5 °C (88.7 °F)[71] 
over the same period. The absolute minimum temperature recorded at the 
Botanic Garden site was −17.2 °C (1.0 °F), recorded in February 1947,[72] 
although a minimum of −17.8 °C (0.0 °F) was recorded at the now defunct 
observatory site in December 1879.[73] More recently the temperature fell 
to −15.3 °C (4.5 °F) on 11 February 2012,[74] −12.2 °C (10.0 °F) on 22 
January 2013[75] and −10.9 °C (12.4 °F)[76] on 20 December 2010. The average 
frequency of air frosts ranges from 42.8 days at the NIAB site,[77] to 
48.3 days at the Botanic Garden[78] per year over the 1981–2010 period. 
Typically the coldest night of the year at the Botanic Garden will fall 
to −8.0 °C (17.6 °F).[79] Such minimum temperatures and frost averages 
are typical for inland areas across much of southern and central England. 
Sunshine averages around 1,500 hours a year or around 35% of possible, 
a level typical of most locations in inland central England. The city contains 
three Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs), at Cherry Hinton East 
Pit, Cherry Hinton West Pit, and Travellers Pit,[84] and ten Local Nature 
Reserves (LNRs): Sheep’s Green and Coe Fen, Coldhams Common, Stourbridge 
Common, Nine Wells, Byron’s Pool, West Pit, Paradise, Barnwell West, Barnwell 
East, and Logan’s Meadow.[85] The demography in Cambridge changes considerably 
in and out of University term times, so can be hard to measure. In the 
2001 Census held during University term, 89.44% of Cambridge residents 
identified themselves as white, compared with a national average of 92.12%.[86] 
Within the University, 84% of undergraduates and 80% of post-graduates 
identify as white (including overseas students).[87] Cambridge has a much 
higher than average proportion of people in the highest paid professional, 
managerial or administrative jobs (32.6% vs. 23.5%)[88] and a much lower 
than average proportion of manual workers (27.6% vs. 40.2%).[88] In addition, 
a much higher than average proportion of people have a high level qualification 
(e.g. degree, Higher National Diploma, Master's or PhD), (41.2% vs. 19.7%).[89] 
Local census 1749[90] Census: Regional District 1801–1901[91] Civil Parish 
1911–1961[92] District 1971–2011[93] The town's river link to the surrounding 
agricultural land, and good road connections to London in the south meant 
Cambridge has historically served as an important regional trading post. 
King Henry I granted Cambridge a monopoly on river trade, enabling this 
area of the economy to flourish.[94] The town market provided for trade 
in a wide variety of goods and annual trading fairs such as Stourbridge 
Fair and Midsummer Fair were visited by merchants from across the country. 
The river was described in an account of 1748 as being "often so full of 
[merchant boats] that the navigation thereof is stopped for some time".[95] 
For example, 2000 firkins of butter were brought up the river every Monday 
from the agricultural lands to the North East, particularity Norfolk, to 
be unloaded in the town for road transportation to London.[95] Changing 
patterns of retail distribution and the advent of the railways led to a 
decline in Cambridge's importance as a market town.[96] Today Cambridge 
has a diverse economy with strength in sectors such as research & development, 
software consultancy, high value engineering, creative industries, pharmaceuticals 
and tourism.[97] Described as one of the "most beautiful cities in the 
world" by Forbes in 2010,[98] tourism generates over £300 million for the 
city's economy.[99] Cambridge and its surrounds are sometimes referred 
to as Silicon Fen, an allusion to Silicon Valley, because of the density 
of high-tech businesses and technology incubators that have developed on 
science parks around the city. Many of these parks and buildings are owned 
or leased by university colleges, and the companies often have been spun 
out of the university.[100] Cambridge Science Park, which is the largest 
commercial R&D centre in Europe, is owned by Trinity College;[101][102] 
St John's is the landlord of St John's Innovation Centre.[103] Technology 
companies include Abcam, CSR, ARM Limited, CamSemi, Jagex and Sinclair.[104] 
Microsoft has located its Microsoft Research UK offices in West Cambridge, 
separate from the main Microsoft UK campus in Reading, and also has an 
office on Station Road. Cambridge was also the home of Pye Ltd., founded 
in 1898 by W. G. Pye, who worked in the Cavendish Laboratory; it began 
by supplying the University and later specialised in wireless telegraphy 
equipment, radios, televisions and also defence equipment.[35] Pye Ltd 
evolved into several other companies including TETRA radio equipment manufacturer 
Sepura. Another major business is Marshall Aerospace located on the eastern 
edge of the city. The Cambridge Network keeps businesses in touch with 
each other. The software company Autonomy Corporation is located at the 
Business Park on Cowley Road. Because of its rapid growth in the 20th century, 
Cambridge has a congested road network.[105] The M11 motorway from east 
London terminates to the north-west of the city where it joins the A14, 
a major freight route which connects the port of Felixstowe on the east 
coast with the Midlands. The A428 connects the city with Bedford and St 
Neots, and the A10 connects the city to King's Lynn to the north via Ely, 
and to central London to the south. As a university town lying on fairly 
flat ground and with traffic congestion, Cambridge has the highest level 
of cycle use in the UK.[106] According to the 2001 census, 25% of residents 
travelled to work by bicycle. Furthermore, a survey in 2013 found that 
47% of residents travel by bike at least once a week.[107] In recognition 
of this, the 3rd stage of the 2014 Tour de France started in the city, 
adjacent to Parker's Piece. Cambridge has several bus services including 
routes linking five Park and Ride sites all of which operate seven days 
a week and are aimed at encouraging motorists to park near the city's edge.[108] 
Since 2011, the Cambridgeshire Guided Busway has carried bus services into 
the centre of Cambridge from St Ives, Huntingdon, Peterborough and other 
towns and villages along the routes, operated by Stagecoach and Go Whippet.[109] 
The A service continues on to the railway station and Addenbrookes, before 
terminating at a new Park and Ride in Trumpington. Cambridge railway station 
has direct rail links to London with termini at London King's Cross (via 
the Cambridge Line and the East Coast Main Line) and Liverpool Street (on 
the West Anglia Main Line). There is a non-stop train to King's Cross every 
half-hour during off-peak hours, with a journey time of 45 minutes.[110] 
Trains also run to King's Lynn and Ely (via the Fen Line), Norwich (via 
the Breckland Line), Leicester, Birmingham, Peterborough, Stevenage, Ipswich 
and London Stansted Airport. A second station, Cambridge North, is under 
construction and is due to open in December 2016, having originally planned 
to open in March 2015.[111][112] The guided busway is currently being extended 
to cross Milton Road and join the new station. Direct trains linking Cambridge 
with Brighton and Gatwick Airport, via London St. Pancras, are due to start 
running in 2018.[113] Cambridge also has its own airport; Cambridge Airport 
was used mainly by charter and training flights as well as to fly in aircraft 
for maintenance.[114][115][116] Regular flights to Jersey and European 
destinations such as Gothenburg operated until the end of January 2016 
when all scheduled and charter traffic from the airport was halted.[117] 
Cambridge's two universities,[118] the collegiate University of Cambridge 
and the local campus of Anglia Ruskin University, serve around 30,000 students, 
by some estimates.[119] Cambridge University estimated its 2007/08 student 
population at 17,662,[120] and Anglia Ruskin reports 24,000 students across 
its two campuses (one of which is outside Cambridge, in Chelmsford) for 
the same period.[121] State provision in the further education sector includes 
Hills Road Sixth Form College, Long Road Sixth Form College, and Cambridge 
Regional College. Both state and independent schools serve Cambridge pupils 
from nursery to secondary school age. State schools are administered by 
Cambridgeshire County Council, which maintains 251 schools in total,[122] 
35 of them in Cambridge city.[123] Netherhall School, Chesterton Community 
College, the Parkside Federation (comprising Parkside Community College 
and Coleridge Community College), North Cambridge Academy and the Christian 
inter-denominational St. Bede's School provide comprehensive secondary 
education.[124] Many other pupils from the Cambridge area attend Village 
Colleges, an educational institution unique to Cambridgeshire, which serve 
as secondary schools during the day and adult education centres outside 
of school hours.[125] Independent schools in the city include The Perse 
School, Sancton Wood School, St Mary's School, Heritage School and The 
Leys School.[126] The city has one University Technical College, UTC Cambridge, 
opened September 2014. Cambridge played a unique role in the invention 
of modern football: the game's first set of rules were drawn up by members 
of the University in 1848. The Cambridge Rules were first played on Parker's 
Piece and had a "defining influence on the 1863 Football Association rules." 
which again were first played on Parker's Piece.[127] The city is home 
to Cambridge United F.C., who play at the Abbey Stadium. They were elected 
to the Football League in 1970 and reached the Football League Second Division 
in 1978, although a serious decline in them in the mid 1980s saw them drop 
back down to the Football League Fourth Division and almost go out of business. 
Success returned to the club in the early 1990s when they won two successive 
promotions and reached the FA Cup quarter finals in both of those seasons, 
and in 1992 they came close to becoming the first English team to win three 
successive Football League promotions which would have taken them into 
the newly created FA Premier League. But they were beaten in the playoffs 
and another decline set in, which was completed in 2005 when they were 
relegated from the Football League and for the second time in 20 years 
narrowly avoided going out of business. After nine years of non league 
football they returned to the Football League in 2014 by winning the Conference 
National playoffs. Cambridge City F.C. of the Southern Football League 
Premier Division now play in the adjoining village of Histon. Formed in 
Cambridge in 1908 as Cambridge Town, the club were Southern Premier League 
champions in 1962-63, the highest they have finished in the English football 
pyramid. After a legal dispute with their landlords,[128] the club left 
their home ground in Cambridge in order to groundshare with fellow Southern 
League Premier club Histon F.C. in 2013-14 and intend to construct a new 
ground outside the city, in Sawston. As well as being the home of the Cambridge 
Rules in football, Parker's Piece was used for first-class cricket matches 
from 1817 to 1864.[129] The University of Cambridge's Cricket ground, Fenner's, 
is located in the city and is one of the home grounds for minor counties 
team Cambridgeshire CCC.[130] There are seven amateur cricket clubs within 
the city: Cambridge Granta, Camden, Cambridge St Giles, New Chesterton 
Institute, Fen Ditton, Romsey Town and Cherry Hinton.[131] The city is 
represented in both codes of Rugby football. Rugby Union club Cambridge 
R.U.F.C. were founded in 1923,[132] and play in National League One[133]
