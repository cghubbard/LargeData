Elmer Harrison Flick (January 11, 1876 – January 9, 1971) was an American 
major league baseball outfielder who played from 1898 to 1910 for the Philadelphia 
Phillies, Philadelphia Athletics, and Cleveland Bronchos/Naps. In 1,483 
career games Flick recorded a .313 batting average while accumulating 164 
triples, 1,752 hits, 330 stolen bases, and 756 runs batted in. He was elected 
to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1963. Flick began his career in semi-professional 
baseball and played in minor league baseball for two years. He was noticed 
by George Stallings, the manager of the Phillies, who signed Flick as a 
reserve outfielder. Flick was pressed into a starting role in 1898 when 
an injury forced another player to retire. He excelled as a starter. Flick 
jumped to the Athletics in 1902, but an court injunction prevented him 
from playing in Pennsylvania. He joined the Naps, where he continued to 
play for the remainder of his major league career, which was curtailed 
by a stomach ailment. Flick was known predominantly for his solid batting 
and speed. He led the National League in RBIs in 1900, and led the American 
League in stolen bases in 1904 and 1906, and in batting average in 1905. 
Flick was born on January 11, 1876, the third of five children of Zachary 
and Mary Flick, on the family farm in Bedford, Ohio.[1] His father was 
a farmer and mechanic who had served in the American Civil War.[2] Flick 
attended Bedford High School, where he played catcher on the school's baseball 
team.[3] He also played American football, wrestled, and boxed.[2] Flick 
entered semi-professional baseball by chance. When he was 15 years old, 
he was at a train station to support the local baseball team as it left 
for a road trip. Only eight of the team's players showed up at the station, 
so Flick was recruited to go on the trip with the team.[1] Though Flick 
did not have a uniform or shoes, he hit well in both games of the doubleheader, 
though Bedford lost both games. He joined the Bedford team on a regular 
basis, and he continued to play semi-pro baseball throughout his teenage 
years.[2] In 1896, the manager of the Youngstown Puddlers of the Interstate 
League signed Flick. Because the team had an established catcher, Flick 
played in the outfield, where he struggled to learn the position. In 31 
games, Flick had a .826 fielding percentage. However, Flick had a strong 
performance offensively. Using his father's lathe, Flick crafted his own 
baseball bat, which he used to hit for a .438 batting average.[2] The next 
year, Flick played for the Dayton Old Soldiers, also in the Interstate 
League, as their regular left fielder. His defense improved, as he compiled 
a .921 fielding percentage, and he batted .386. He also led the league 
with 20 triples and 295 total bases.[2] George Stallings, the manager of 
the Philadelphia Phillies of the National League (NL), noticed Flick while 
he played for Dayton. Stallings signed Flick to the Phillies to serve as 
a reserve outfielder for the team in the 1898 season. Starting outfielder 
Sam Thompson injured his back after six games, forcing Stallings to play 
Flick. In his debut game, Flick went 2-for-3 with two singles against Fred 
Klobedanz. Thompson returned to the team briefly, but reinjured his back 
and announced his retirement in May, allowing Flick to play regularly.[4] 
Flick proved himself a capable big leaguer, batting .302 with eight home 
runs, 13 triples and 81 runs batted in (RBIs). In the 1899 season, he batted 
.342, with 98 runs scored and 98 RBIs.[2] However, he suffered a serious 
knee injury in August, and reinjured the knee when he returned to the game 
too quickly.[5] Before the 1900 season, Philadelphia stars Napoleon Lajoie 
and Ed Delahanty held out of renewing their contracts with the team. Other 
members of the team had grown disgruntled. Amid talk of a revival of the 
American Association, Flick and several other players began to talk about 
not returning to the team the next year. The Philadelphia Inquirer reported 
that Flick's father was in the chair business in Cleveland and that he 
might require Flick's help with the business. Flick agreed to a contract 
extension before the season started.[6] That year, he led the NL with 110 
RBIs. He finished second in the NL with a .367 batting average, a .545 
slugging percentage, 11 home runs, 59 extra-base hits, and 297 total bases.[2] 
He also engaged in a fistfight with Lajoie that caused Lajoie to miss five 
weeks due to a broken thumb.[7] The race for the batting title came down 
to the end of the season. The title winner, Honus Wagner, later said, "I've 
had a lot of thrills, but don't think I was ever happier than in 1900 when 
I won after battling Elmer Flick to the last day of the season for the 
title."[8] Flick was one of many star NL players who jumped to the fledgling 
American League (AL) after the 1901 season, playing for the crosstown Philadelphia 
Athletics. Flick played in 11 games for the Athletics,[2] before the Phillies 
obtained an injunction from the Pennsylvania Supreme Court prohibiting 
any player under contract with the Phillies from playing for another team. 
Though this injunction named Lajoie, Bill Bernhard, and Chick Fraser only, 
it still applied to Flick as well.[9] As a recourse, Flick and teammate 
Lajoie signed instead with the Cleveland Naps, as the Pennsylvania injunction 
could not be enforced in Ohio.[2] The two players often traveled separately 
from their teammates for the next year, never setting foot in Pennsylvania 
in order to avoid a subpoena. Flick spent the remainder of his career in 
Cleveland, and the contract dispute was resolved when the leagues made 
peace in September 1903 with the National Agreement. On July 6, 1902, Flick 
hit three triples in one game.[2] Between 1900 and 2010, 49 players accomplished 
that feat.[10] By early 1904, Flick did not want to re-sign with Cleveland 
for the offered $2,500 ($65,954 in current dollar terms). Plans were being 
made to run a railroad through a corner of Flick's farm and Flick hoped 
to hire some of his horses to the construction team. "After July 4, my 
farm work will be along so that I will be able to give considerable attention 
to independent ball", he said.[11] Flick did return to Cleveland for the 
1904 season. That year, Flick tied teammate Harry Bay for the league lead 
with 38 stolen bases.[12] Flick was the AL batting champion in the 1905 
season with a .308 average. Only Carl Yastrzemski, who won the batting 
title with a .301 average in the 1968 season, led the league with a lower 
average.[13] Flick also led the league with a .462 slugging percentage 
and 18 triples in 1905. His .383 on-base percentage trailed only Topsy 
Hartsel.[14] During a 1905 game, Cleveland fielders were charged with seven 
errors in a single inning, but Flick committed only one of the errors.[15] 
In the 1906 season, Flick played a league-leading 157 games. He led the 
league with 700 plate appearances, 624 at-bats, 98 runs scored, 22 triples, 
and 39 stolen bases (tied with John Anderson).[16] However, Flick was "said 
to be dissatisfied with the team", and the Naps considered trading him 
to the Detroit Tigers for Matty McIntyre.[17] Before the 1907 season, the 
Naps turned down a trade with the Tigers which would have exchanged Flick 
for the 21-year-old Ty Cobb. Hughie Jennings, the Tigers' manager, was 
tired of dealing with Cobb's abrasive behavior. The Naps refused to part 
with Flick, even in exchange for Cobb. They countered with Bunk Congalton, 
but the Tigers declined.[2] Flick had been holding out but he signed a 
few days after the proposed trade. After Cobb was nearly traded away, Jennings 
attempted to repair the difficult relationships between Cobb and the other 
Detroit players. "Cobb is too good a hitter to let get away, when a little 
diplomacy will get the boys together", Jennings said.[18] In the 1907 season, 
Flick again led the league with 18 triples.[19] However, baseball took 
its toll on Flick. Before the 1907 season, he considered retiring to pursue 
other business opportunities.[20] By 1908, he developed stomach problems. 
Cleveland personnel initially said that the illness was related to Flick's 
overeating.[21] He left training camp that year, complaining of "train 
sickness", and returned home to Cleveland.[22] He missed the majority of 
the 1908 season, playing in only nine games.[23] He missed the beginning 
of the 1909 season as well, as a doctor recommended Flick have his appendix 
removed. Now weighing 130 pounds (59 kg), Flick was afraid of a bad outcome 
from the surgery, which was a significant risk at the time. He kept his 
appendix and played in 66 games, batting .255. He played in another 24 
games in the 1910 season before he was again sidelined by his stomach ailment.[24] 
The Naps acquired Shoeless Joe Jackson from the Athletics in a trade and 
had him replace Flick in the lineup.[24] In July 1910, the Naps sold Flick 
to the Kansas City Blues of the American Association, but Flick refused 
to report to Kansas City, which cancelled the transaction.[2][25] In 1911, 
Flick looked to continue his career. Unable to find a major league team 
willing to sign him, he returned to the minor leagues. The Toledo Mud Hens 
of the American Association purchased him from Cleveland.[26] Flick played 
for Toledo in 1911 and 1912. He batted .326 in the 1911 season and .262 
in the 1912 season, but did not hit for power.[24] The Mud Hens released 
him at the end of the 1912 season.[27] He retired from professional baseball 
after being released by Toledo,[2] though he briefly played as a second 
baseman for a local amateur team in Bedford in 1914.[24] Flick retired 
without playing in a World Series. As of 2003, there were six Hall of Famers 
without a World Series appearance who played most of their careers after 
1903; three of them – Flick, Lajoie and Addie Joss – played together with 
Cleveland from 1902 to 1910.[28] Returning to Bedford, Flick hunted, raised 
horses, built buildings, and became involved in selling real estate. He 
also scouted for Cleveland.[2] Only four 19th century baseball players, 
including Flick, were still alive in 1970. In his later years, Flick still 
answered requests for autographs from his fans. Proud of his longevity, 
Flick often completed autographs by writing the date and his age above 
or underneath his signature.[29] Flick was married to Rosa Ella (née Gates). 
The couple had five daughters.[2] Flick died of congestive heart failure 
in 1971, at the age of 94, in his hometown of Bedford. He had also suffered 
from mycosis fungoides.[2] When Cobb died in 1961, stories written about 
him mentioned the attempted trade between Cleveland and Detroit, which 
revived interest in Flick.[2] Flick was inducted into the Baseball Hall 
of Fame in 1963 after being unanimously elected by the Veterans Committee 
(VC).[30] When he received the call from Branch Rickey that he had been 
selected, Flick did not believe Rickey at first. He said that he did not 
even realize that he was being considered for election at the time.[31] 
Flick's family had to convince him that the call was real. He was the oldest 
living inductee in Hall of Fame history. At his induction, the 87-year-old 
Flick said, "This is a bigger day than I've ever had before. I'm not going 
to find the words to explain how I feel."[32] Subsequent to his induction, 
writers have questioned the validity of Flick's Hall of Fame membership. 
James Vail characterized Flick and three other Hall of Famers as "some 
of the most dubious VC choices ever".[33] David Fleitz wrote that Rickey's 
influence on the Veterans Committee led to Flick's election, as Rickey 
was the only committee member who had seen Flick play.[32] Author Robert 
E. Kelly pointed out that Flick's career was relatively short and that 
stronger candidates from Flick's era (such as Sherry Magee) had not been 
inducted.[34] Flick was enshrined in the Greater Cleveland Sports Hall 
of Fame in 1977, and the Ohio Baseball Hall of Fame in 1987. A statue of 
Flick's likeness was created to be placed in Bedford;[35] it was funded 
by donations and was ultimately dedicated in September 2013. Mike Hargrove 
was among the baseball figures who attended the dedication ceremony.[36]
