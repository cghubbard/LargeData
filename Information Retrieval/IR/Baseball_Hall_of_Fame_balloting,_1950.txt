Elections to the Baseball Hall of Fame for 1950 were subject to one rules 
change, the elimination of a runoff election by the baseball writers in 
case of no winner. The runoff had been invoked in 1949 and it would have 
been useful again. For the first time except years without any election 
activity, there was no one living or deceased to induct. The Baseball Writers 
Association of America (BBWAA) voted once by mail to select from major

the Old-Timers Committee, with jurisdiction over earlier players and other 
figures, did not meet. The 10-year members of the BBWAA had the authority 
to select any players active in 1925 or later, provided they had not been 
active in 1949. The year before, a 25-year moving boundary regarding player 
activity had been established which would remain in the years to come. 
Voters were instructed to cast votes for 10 candidates; any candidate receiving 
votes on at least 75% of the ballots would be honored with induction to 
the Hall. A new rule had been added for the 1950 ballot. Writers could 
not vote for anyone currently wearing a baseball uniform, which included 
some qualified players who were now coaches on teams. This rule would be 
dropped after a few years. A total of 168 ballots were cast, with 1,481 
individual votes for 100 specific candidates, an average of 8.82 per ballot; 
126 votes were required for election. Once again, no candidate received 
75% of the vote and the Hall of Fame would not elect any new players in 
1950. Candidates who have since been selected in subsequent elections are
