The University of Arizona (also referred to as U of A, UA, or Arizona) 
is a public research university in Tucson, Arizona, United States. Founded 
in 1885, the UA was the first university in the Arizona Territory. The 
university operates two medical schools (University of Arizona College 
of Medicine - Tucson and the University of Arizona College of Medicine 
- Phoenix) and is affiliated with the region's only academic medical centers 
(Banner - University Medical Center Tucson and Banner - University Medical 
Center Phoenix). The university is also home to the James E. Rogers College 
of Law and numerous other nationally ranked graduate and professional schools. 
As of Fall 2015, enrollment was more than 42,100 students, with the largest 
freshmen class ever at 8,100 students.[8] The University of Arizona is 
governed by the Arizona Board of Regents. The mission of the University 
of Arizona is, "To improve the prospects and enrich the lives of the people 
of Arizona and the world through education, research, creative expression, 
and community and business partnerships."[9] Arizona is one of the elected 
members of the Association of American Universities (an organization of 
North America's premier research institutions) and is the only representative 
from the state of Arizona to this group. Known as the Arizona Wildcats 
(often shortened to "Cats"), the athletic teams are members of the Pac-12 
Conference of the NCAA. UA athletes have won national titles in several 
sports, most notably men's basketball, baseball, and softball. The official 
colors of the university and its athletic teams are UA Red and Arizona 
Blue. After the passage of the Morrill Land-Grant Act of 1862, the push 
for a University in Arizona grew. The University of Arizona was approved 
by the Arizona Territory's "Thieving Thirteenth" Legislature in 1885, who 
also selected the city of Tucson to receive the appropriation to build 
the university. Tucson had hoped to receive the appropriation for the territory's 
mental hospital, which carried a $100,000 allocation instead of the $25,000 
allotted to the territory's only university (Arizona State University was 
also chartered in 1885, but at the time it was created as Arizona's normal 
school, and not a university). Tucson's contingent of legislators was delayed 
in reaching Prescott due to flooding on the Salt River and by the time 
they arrived back-room deals allocating the most desirable territorial 
institutions had been made. Tucson was largely disappointed at receiving 
what was viewed as an inferior prize. With no parties willing to provide 
land for the new institution, the citizens of Tucson prepared to return 
the money to the Territorial Legislature until two gamblers and a saloon 
keeper decided to donate the land to build the school. Construction of 
Old Main, the first building on campus, began on October 27, 1887, and 
classes met for the first time in 1891 with 32 students in Old Main, which 
is still in use today.[10] Because there were no high schools in Arizona 
Territory, the university maintained separate preparatory classes for the 
first 23 years of operation. The University of Arizona offers 334 fields 
of study leading to bachelor's, master's, doctoral, and professional degrees. 
Academic departments and programs are organized into colleges and schools. 
Currently, grades are given on a strict 4-point scale with "A" worth 4, 
"B" worth 3, "C" worth 2, "D" worth 1 and "E" worth zero points. In 2004, 
there were discussions with students and faculty that may lead the UA towards 
eventual usage of the plus-minus grading system in future years.[11] As 
of December 2015[update], the university still uses the 4-points scale. 
The Center for World University Rankings in 2015 ranked Arizona 68th in 
the world and 42nd in the U.S.[20] The 2015–16 Times Higher Education World 
University Rankings rated University of Arizona 163rd in the world and 
the 2016/17 QS World University Rankings ranked it 233rd. The University 
of Arizona was ranked tied for 124th in the "National Universities" category 
by U.S. News & World Report for 2017, and 60th among "Top Public Schools."[21] 
The James E. Rogers College of Law was ranked tied for 42nd nationally, 
and the University of Arizona College of Medicine - Tucson was tied for 
74th nationally in primary care and tied for 63rd for research by U.S. 
News & World Report for 2016.[21] The College of Medicine was also rated 
No. 7 among the nation's medical schools for Hispanic students, according 
to Hispanic Business Magazine.[22] In 2016, the Eller MBA program was ranked 
56th by U.S. News & World Report, which placed the school's Information 
Systems program tied for 3rd best in the U.S., the Entrepreneurship program 
tied for 11th and the Part-time MBA tied for 33rd.[21] U.S. News & World 
Report also rated UA as tied for 41st for online MBA programs, tied for 
23rd for best online graduate nursing programs, and tied for 44th for best 
online graduate engineering programs.[21] UA graduate programs ranked in 
the top 25 in the nation by U.S. News & World Report for 2016 include Social 
Psychology (5th), Speech Pathology (5th), Rehabilitation Counseling (6th), 
Earth Sciences (7th), Analytical Chemistry (9th), Latin American history 
(9th), Atomic Physics (9th), Pharmacy (10th), Audiology (12th), Public 
Management Administration (13th), Photography (17th), and Nonprofit Management 
(21st).[21] The Council for Aid to Education ranked UA 12th among public 
universities and 24th overall in financial support and gifts.[23][not in 
citation given] Campaign Arizona, an effort to raise over $1 billion for 
the school, exceeded that goal by $200 million a year earlier than projected.[24] 
In April 2014, the "Arizona Now" campaign launched with a target of $1.5 
billion. As of January 31, 2016, the campaign has raised $1.37 Billion, 
91% of its goal.[25] In 2015, the College of Architecture and Landscape 
Architecture's (CALA) undergraduate program in architecture was rated 10th 
in the nation for all universities, public and private, as reported in 
Design Intelligence. UA ranked 20th in overall undergraduate architecture 
programs by the same publication.[26] The School of Middle Eastern and 
North African Studies[27] at the University of Arizona is one of the most 
highly ranked area studies programs focusing on the Middle East in the 
United States.[28] In addition to offering language training in Arabic, 
Hebrew, Persian, and Turkish (both Modern and Ottoman), it is collocated 
with the Middle East Studies Association.[29] The UA is considered a "selective" 
university by U.S. News & World Report.[33] In the 2014-2015 academic year, 
68 freshman students were National Merit Scholars.[34] UA students hail 
from all states in the U.S. While nearly 69% of students are from Arizona, 
nearly 11% are from California, and 8% are international, followed by a 
significant student presence from Texas, Illinois, Washington, Colorado 
and New York. (Fall 2013).[35] Tuition at the University of Arizona is 
$11,591 for full-time undergraduate residents and $30,745 for non-residents.[36] 
As in other states, the cost of tuition has been rising due to the decrease 
in government support.[37] Undergraduate students who enrolled in the UA's 
optional tuition guarantee program in 2015 will remain at $11,591 for residents 
and $30,745 for non-residents through the 2018-19 academic year. Incoming 
students enrolled in a bachelor's degree program are automatically eligible 
for the Guaranteed Tuition Program and will not be subject to tuition increases 
for 8 continuous semesters (four years).[36] The Guaranteed Tuition Program 
does not apply to rates for summer and winter sessions. The University 
of Arizona Honors College provides a program for over 4,500 students that 
creates a smaller community feel, like that of a liberal arts college, 
within a large research institution. It started in 1962 with an acceptance 
of seventy-five students and has grown to 4,546 in the academic year 2014–2015.[38] 
The main offices for the University of Arizona Honors College are near 
Park Ave. and 2nd Street, near the Harvill Lecture Hall building. These 
offices are known as the Slonaker House. The University of Arizona Honors 
College is in affiliation with the University of Arizona and is headed 
by Dean Dr. Patricia MacCorquodale and Associate Dean Dr. Laura Berry. 
Under the Dean and Vice Dean are the offices of the Academic Advising Coordinator, 
Director of Nationally Competitive Scholarships, Director of Recruitment 
and Outreach, Director of Development, Program Coordinator for Career and 
Development and Community Engagement, Honors Professors, and Honors advisors. 
The University of Arizona Honors College has a strong first-year program 
for its students that includes common reading materials and Colloquium/Paladin 
classes everyone must take as a freshman. The program's requirements entail 
that each honors student must complete 30 credit hours of honors credit 
by graduation time and maintain a cumulative GPA of 3.5. To complete these 
credit hours, students may take courses designated as honors at the University 
of Arizona or may turn a regular course into an honors course through an 
honors contract. In addition, they must collaborate with a faculty member 
and write an honors thesis before graduating with honors from the University 
of Arizona. The University of Arizona Honors College provides two on-campus 
dorms for their students, Yuma Hall and Árbol de la Vida. Yuma houses 184 
men and women [39] and is located near the Slonaker House on East North 
Campus Drive, in the Historic District. Árbol de la Vida houses 719 men 
and women and is in the Park District, on the edge of campus on 6th street 
and Tyndall Avenue near the Park Student Union. Yuma was renovated and 
turned into an honors dorm in 1988, whereas Árbol de la Vida first opened 
to students in the Fall of 2011.[40] There are additional resources available 
to honors students in the University of Arizona Honors College. Such resources 
include: longer library check-out dates, cheaper printing options at the 
Slonaker House, priority registration, additional honors advising, smaller 
class sizes taught by Honors faculty, clubs and organizations specifically 
available to only honors students such as the Honors Student Council and 
the Honors College Ambassadors, and additional scholarship opportunities. 
However, there is also a fee for participating in honors and an additional 
honors thesis is required of its students before graduation.[40] Arizona 
is classified as a Carnegie Foundation "RU/VH: Research Universities (very 
high research activity)" university (formerly "Research 1" university). 
The university receives approximately $587 million USD annually in research 
funding.[41] Arizona is awarded more NASA grants for space exploration 
than any other university nationally.[42] The UA was awarded over $325 
million USD for its Lunar and Planetary Laboratory (LPL) to lead NASA's 
2007–08 mission to Mars to explore the Martian Arctic. The LPL's work in 
the Cassini spacecraft orbit around Saturn is larger than that of any other 
university globally. The U of A laboratory designed and operated the atmospheric 
radiation investigations and imaging on the probe.[43] The UA operates 
the HiRISE camera, a part of the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. While using 
the HiRISE camera in 2011, UA alumnus Lujendra Ojha and his team discovered 
proof of liquid water on the surface of Mars—a discovery that was confirmed 
by NASA in 2015.[44] UA receives more NASA grants annually than the next 
nine top NASA-Jet Propulsion Laboratory-funded universities combined.[24] 
As of March 2016, the UA's Lunar and Planetary Laboratory is actively involved 
in ten spacecraft missions: Cassini VIMS; Grail; the HiRISE camera orbiting 
Mars; the Juno mission orbiting Jupiter; Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO); 
Maven, which will explore Mars' upper atmosphere and interactions with 
the sun; Solar Probe Plus, a historic mission into the Sun's atmosphere 
for the first time; Rosetta's VIRTIS; WISE; and OSIRIS-REx, the first U.S. 
sample-return mission to a near-earth asteroid, which will launch in September, 
2016.[45] UA students have been selected as Truman, Rhodes, Goldwater, 
and Fulbright Scholars."Student Honors". Highlights and Rankings. University 
of Arizona. Retrieved March 29, 2006.  According to The Chronicle of Higher 
Education, UA is among the top 25 producers of Fulbright awards in the 
U.S.[46] UA is a member of the Association of Universities for Research 
in Astronomy, a consortium of institutions pursuing research in astronomy. 
The association operates observatories and telescopes, notably Kitt Peak 
National Observatory located just outside Tucson. UA is a member of the 
Association of American Universities, and the sole representative from 
Arizona to this group. Led by Roger Angel, researchers in the Steward Observatory 
Mirror Lab at UA are working in concert to build the world's most advanced 
telescope. Known as the Giant Magellan Telescope, the instrument will produce 
images 10 times sharper than those from the Earth-orbiting Hubble Telescope. 
The telescope is set to be completed in 2021. GMT will ultimately cost 
$1 billion USD.[47][48] Researchers from at least nine institutions are 
working to secure the funding for the project. The telescope will include 
seven 18-ton mirrors capable of providing clear images of volcanoes and 
riverbeds on Mars and mountains on the moon at a rate 40 times faster than 
the world's current large telescopes. The mirrors of the Giant Magellan 
Telescope will be built at the U of A and transported to a permanent mountaintop 
site in the Chilean Andes where the telescope will be constructed.[49] 
Reaching Mars in March 2006, the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter contained 
the HiRISE camera, with Primary Investigator is scientist Alfred McEwen 
as the lead on the project. This NASA mission to Mars carried a UA-designed 
camera is capturing the highest-resolution images of the planet ever seen. 
The journey of the orbiter was 300 million miles. In August 2007, the UA, 
under the charge of Scientist Peter Smith, led the Phoenix Mars Mission, 
the first mission completely controlled by a university.[50] Reaching the 
planet's surface in May 2008, the mission's purpose was to improve knowledge 
of the Martian Arctic. The Arizona Radio Observatory, a part of Steward 
Observatory, operates the Submillimeter Telescope on Mount Graham. The 
National Science Foundation funded the iPlant Collaborative in 2008.[51] 
In 2013, iPlant Collaborative received a $50 million renewal grant.[52] 
Rebranded in late 2015 as "CyVerse", the collaborative cloud-based data 
management platform is moving beyond life sciences to provide cloud-computing 
access across all scientific disciplines.[53] In June 2011, the university 
announced that it would assume full ownership of the Biosphere 2 scientific 
research facility in Oracle, Arizona, north of Tucson, effective July 1.[54] 
Biosphere 2 was constructed by private developers (funded mainly by Texas 
businessman and philanthropist Ed Bass) with its first closed system experiment 
commencing in 1991. The university had been the official management partner 
of the facility for research purposes since 2007. According to the 2012-2013 
Association of Research Libraries' "Spending by University Research Libraries" 
report, UA libraries are ranked as the 41st overall university library 
in North America (out of 115) for university investment.[55] As of 2012, 
the UA's library system contains over six million print volumes, 1,100,000 
electronic books, and 74,000 electronic journals.[56] The Main Library, 
opened in 1976, serves as the library system's reference, periodical, and 
administrative center; most of the main collections and special collections 
are housed here as well. The Main Library is located on the southeast quadrant 
of campus near McKale Center and Arizona Stadium. In 2002, the Integrated 
Learning Center (ILC) was completed as a $20 million, 100,000-square-foot 
(10,000 m2) computer facility intended for use by incoming students.[57] 
The ILC features classrooms, auditoriums, a courtyard with vending machines, 
and an expanded computer lab with several dozen workstations and 3D printing. 
Computers and 3D printing are available for use by the general public (with 
some restrictions) as well as by UA students, faculty and staff. Much of 
the ILC was constructed underground, underneath the east end of the Mall. 
The ILC connects to the basement floor of the Main Library. As part of 
the project, additional new office space for the Library was constructed 
on the existing fifth floor. The Science and Engineering Library is in 
a nearby building from the 1960s that houses volumes and periodicals from 
those fields. The Music Building (on the northwest quadrant of campus where 
many of the fine arts disciplines are clustered) houses the Fine Arts Library, 
including reference collections for architecture, music (including sheet 
music, recordings and listening stations), and photography. There is a 
small library at the Center for Creative Photography, also in the fine 
arts complex, devoted to the art and science of photography. The Law Library 
is in the law building (James E. Rogers College of Law), located at the 
intersection of Speedway Boulevard and Mountain Avenue. The Arizona Health 
Sciences Library, built in 1996, is located on the Health Sciences Center 
on the north end of campus and in Phoenix on the Phoenix Biomedical Campus. 
The library serves the Colleges of Medicine, Nursing, Pharmacy and Public 
Health, the University of Arizona Health Network, and is a resource for 
health professionals and citizens across the state. The University of Arizona 
Poetry Center houses an extensive collection of contemporary poetry. It 
is a large "open shelf" collection. The main campus sits on 380 acres (1.5 km2) 
in central Tucson, about one mile (1.6 km) northeast of downtown. There 
are 179 buildings on the main campus. Many of the early buildings, including 
the Arizona State Museum buildings (one of them the 1927 main library) 
and Centennial Hall, were designed by Roy Place, a prominent Tucson architect. 
It was Place's use of red brick that set the tone for the red brick facades 
that are a basic and ubiquitous part of nearly all UA buildings, even those 
built in recent decades. Indeed, almost every UA building has red brick 
as a major component of the design, or at the very least, a stylistic accent 
to harmonize it with the other buildings on campus.[58][59] The campus 
is roughly divided into quadrants. The north and south sides of campus 
are delineated by a grassy expanse called the Mall, which stretches from 
Old Main eastward to the campus' eastern border at Campbell Avenue (a major 
north-south arterial street). The west and east sides of campus are separated 
roughly by Highland Avenue and the Student Union Memorial Center (see below). 
The science and mathematics buildings tend to be clustered in the southwest 
quadrant; the intercollegiate athletics facilities to the southeast; the 
arts and humanities buildings to the northwest (with the dance department 
being a major exception as its main facilities are far to the east end 
of campus), with the engineering buildings in the north central area. The 
optical and space sciences buildings are clustered on the east side of 
campus near the sports stadiums and the (1976) main library. Speedway Boulevard, 
one of Tucson's primary east-west arterial streets, traditionally defined 
the northern boundary of campus but since the 1980s, several university 
buildings have been constructed north of this street, expanding into a 
neighborhood traditionally filled with apartment complexes and single-family 
homes. The university has purchased a handful of these apartment complexes 
for student housing in recent years. Sixth Street typically defines the 
southern boundary, with single-family homes (many of which are rented out 
to students) south of this street. Park Avenue has traditionally defined 
the western boundary of campus, and there is a stone wall which runs along 
a large portion of the east side of the street, leading to the old Main 
Gate, and into the driveway leading to Old Main. Along or adjacent to all 
of these major streets are a wide variety of retail facilities serving 
the student, faculty and staff population (as is the case in other similar 
university neighborhoods throughout the United States): shops, bookstores, 
bars, banks, credit unions, coffeehouses and major chain fast-food restaurants 
such as Chipotle, Panera Bread and Pei Wei. The area near University Boulevard 
and Park Avenue, near the Main Gate, has been a major center of such retail 
activity going back to the university's early decades; many shops dating 
from the 1920s have been renovated since the late 1990s, other new retail 
shops have been built in recent years, and a nine-story Marriott hotel 
was built in this immediate district in 1996. The Stevie Eller Dance Theater, 
opened in 2003 (across the Mall from McKale Center) as a 28,600-square-foot 
(2,660 m2) dedicated performance venue for the UA's dance program, one 
of the most highly regarded university dance departments in the United 
States. Designed by Gould Evans, a Phoenix-based architectural firm, the 
theater was awarded the 2003 Citation Award from the American Institute 
of Architects, Arizona Chapter.[60] The Computer Science department has 
set up a webcam that provides a live feed of the campus as seen from the 
top of the Gould Simpson building.[61] The Berger Memorial Fountain at 
the west entrance of Old Main honors the UA students who lost their lives 
in World War I, and dates back to 1919.[62] The University of Arizona generates 
renewable energy with solar panels (photo voltaic)that have been installed 
on campus buildings. In 2011, the Sustainable Endowments Institute gave 
the university a College Sustainability Report Card grade of "B."[63] In 
2015, the university opened the ENR2, set to be one of its "greenest" buildings 
on campus with features like a cutting edge air conditioning system and 
55,000-gallon water-harvesting tank. Designed to resemble a slot canyon 
in the Sonoran Desert, the 150,000 sq. ft. building focuses on adaptation 
and reducing our carbon footprint.[64] The oldest campus buildings are 
located west of Old Main. Most of the buildings east of Old Main date from 
the 1940s to the 1980s, with a few recent buildings constructed in the 
years since 1990. The Student Union Memorial Center, located on the north 
side of the Mall east of Old Main, was completely reconstructed between 
2000 and 2003, replacing a 270,000-square-foot (25,000 m2) structure originally 
opened in 1951 (with additions in the 1960s). The new $60 million student 
union has 405,000 square feet (37,600 m2) of space on four levels, including 
14 restaurants (including a food court with such national chains as Burger 
King, Panda Express, Papa John's Pizza and Chick-fil-A), a new two-level 
bookstore (that includes a counter for Clinique merchandise as well as 
an office supplies section sponsored by Staples with many of the same Staples-branded 
items found in their regular stores), 23 meeting rooms, eight lounge areas 
(including one dedicated to the USS Arizona), a computer lab, a U.S. Post 
Office, a Pinkberry Frozen Yogurt, and a copy center named Fast Copy. The 
building was designed to mirror the USS Arizona (BB-39). A variety of sculptures 
pepper the premises, decorating the air with the chimes of dog tags or 
the colors of refracted light in honor of those who have served. A bell 
housed on the USS Arizona, one of the two bells rescued from the ship after 
the attack on Pearl Harbor, has a permanent home in the clock tower of 
the Student Union Memorial Center on campus. The bell first arrived on 
campus in July 1946. The bell is rung seven times on the third Wednesday 
of every month at 12:07 pm – symbolic of the battleship's sinking on December 
7, 1941 – to honor individuals at the UA, as well as after home football 
games.[65][66] The University of Arizona BookStores (UA Bookstore or UA 
BookStores) is a self-financed auxiliary unit within The University of 
Arizona Division of Student Affairs, meaning the BookStores operates without 
the aid of monies allocated from state tax, student tuition, or any other 
campus subsidies.[67] UA BookStores serves an imperative role in the provision 
of financial support for student scholarships, student-led clubs and organizations 
(including UAs student government, ASUA), for several UA academic departments, 
campus media (including the campus daily paper, the Arizona Daily Wildcat), 
several performance arts venues around campus, and more.[68] UA BookStores 
operates three store locations on campus: the Main store in the Student 
Union Memorial Center (SUMC), the Medical store in Arizona Health Sciences 
Center, and the McKale Sports Stop located in the McKale Memorial Center. 
The organization also operates gift shops in the Flandrau Science Center, 
the UA Poetry Center, and the Biosphere2 located north of Tucson. Off-campus 
locations include remote campus stores on the UA South campus in Sierra 
Vista located south of Tucson, and the new UA Downtown campus located in 
the historic Montgomery Ward building, designed by Roy Place (during the 
period he also served as the official UA campus architect) in Downtown 
Tucson. Much of the main campus has been designated an arboretum. Plants 
from around the world are labeled along a self-guided plant walk. The Krutch 
Cactus Garden includes the tallest Boojum tree in the state of Arizona.[69] 
(The university also manages Boyce Thompson Arboretum State Park, located 
in rural Pinal County about 85 miles (137 km) north of the main campus.) 
Two herbaria are located on the university campus and both are referred 
to as "ARIZ" in the Index Herbariorum The campus also boasts hundreds of 
olive trees many of which were planted by Prof. Robert H. Forbes. Many 
of these trees are over a hundred years old.[70] The University of Arizona, 
like its sister institutions Arizona State University and Northern Arizona 
University, is governed by the Arizona Board of Regents or the ABOR, a 
12-member body. According to information published by the ABOR office and 
available on their Web site, eight volunteer members are appointed by the 
Governor to staggered eight-year terms; two students serve on the board 
for two-year appointments, with the first year being a nonvoting apprentice 
year. The Governor and the Superintendent of Public Instruction serve as 
voting ex-officio members. The ABOR provides "policy guidance" and oversight 
to the three major degree-granting universities, as provided for by Title 
15 of the Arizona Revised Statutes. The immediate past interim president 
is Eugene G. Sander, who had been UA vice provost and dean of the College 
of Agriculture and Life Sciences; Sander began his service as president 
in August 2011.[71][72] Ann Weaver Hart, formerly president of Temple University, 
was named the 21st president of the UA on February 17, 2012. Dr. Hart is 
the first female president of the UA. She began her term on July 1, 2012, 
replacing Eugene Sander, who retired from the university after 25 years 
of service as an educator and administrator.[73][74] Hart has announced 
that she will not seek to extend to her contract past its June 30, 2018 
end date.[75] The previous president, Robert N. Shelton, began his tenure 
in 2006 and resigned in the summer of 2011 to accept the presidency of 
the Fiesta Bowl, (a BCS college football tournament played annually in 
the Phoenix area).[76] Shelton's predecessor, Peter Likins, vacated his 
post at the conclusion of the 2005–06 academic term.[77] Notable past UA 
presidents include Likins, Manuel Pacheco (the first person of Hispanic 
descent to lead the university and for whom the Integrated Learning Center 
is named), Homer L. Shantz, Kendric C. Babcock,[78] Henry Koffler,[79] 
John Schaefer, Richard Harvill[80] and Rufus B. von KleinSmid.[81] Like 
many large public universities in the U.S., sports are a major activity 
on campus, and receive a large operating budget. Arizona's athletic teams 
are nicknamed the Wildcats, a name derived from a 1914 football game with 
then California champions Occidental College, where the L.A. Times asserted 
that, "the Arizona men showed the fight of wildcats."[82] The University 
of Arizona participates in the NCAA's Division I-A in the Pac-12 Conference, 
which it joined in 1978. The men's basketball team has been one of the 
nation's most successful programs since Lute Olson was hired as head coach 
in 1983, and is still known as a national powerhouse in Division I men's 
basketball.[83] Between 1985 and 2009, the team reached the NCAA Tournament 
25 consecutive years, which is the second-longest streak in NCAA history, 
2nd only to North Carolina's record of 27 consecutive appearances from 
1975 to 2001.[84] The Wildcats have reached the Final Four of the NCAA 
tournament in 1988, 1994, 1997, and 2001. In 1997, Arizona defeated the 
University of Kentucky, the then defending national champions, to win the 
NCAA National Championship (NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship) 
by a score of 84–79 in overtime; Arizona's first national championship 
victory. The 1997 championship team became the first and only in NCAA history 
to defeat three number-one seeds en route to a national title (Kansas, 
North Carolina, and Kentucky—the North Carolina game being the final game 
for longtime UNC head coach Dean Smith). Point guard Miles Simon was chosen 
as 1997 Final Four MVP (Simon was also an assistant coach under Olson from 
2005 to 2008). The Cats also boast the third highest winning percentage 
in the nation over the last twenty years. Arizona has won a total of 27 
regular season conference championships in its programs history, and 5 
PAC-12 tournaments. Since 2005, Arizona has produced 11 NBA draft picks.[85] 
The Wildcats play their home games at the McKale Center in Tucson. A number 
of former Wildcats have gone on to pursue successful professional NBA careers 
(especially during the Lute Olson era), including Gilbert Arenas, Richard 
Jefferson, Mike Bibby, Jason Terry, Sean Elliott, Damon Stoudamire, Khalid 
Reeves, Luke Walton, Hassan Adams, Salim Stoudamire, Andre Iguodala, Channing 
Frye, Brian Williams (later known as Bison Dele), Sean Rooks, Jud Buechler, 
Michael Dickerson, Chase Budinger, Jordan Hill, Jerryd Bayless, Derrick 
Williams and Steve Kerr. Kenny Lofton, now best known as a former Major 
League Baseball star, was a four-year letter winner as a Wildcat basketball 
player (and was on the 1988 Final Four team), before one year on the Arizona 
baseball team. Another notable former Wildcat basketball player is Eugene 
Edgerson, who played on the 1997 and 2001 Final Four squads, and is currently 
one of the primary stars of the Harlem Globetrotters as "Wildkat" Edgerson. 
Before Lute Olson's hire in 1983, Arizona was the first major Division 
I school to hire an African American head coach in Fred Snowden, in 1972. 
After a 25-year tenure as Arizona head coach, Olson announced his retirement 
from the Arizona basketball program in October 2008. After two seasons 
of using interim coaches, Arizona named Sean Miller, head coach at Xavier 
University, as its new head basketball coach in April 2009. The football 
team began at The University of Arizona in 1899 under the nickname "Varsity" 
(a name kept until the 1914 season when the team was deemed the "Wildcats").[86] 
The football team was notably successful in the 1990s, under head coach 
Dick Tomey; his "Desert Swarm" defense was characterized by tough, hard-nosed 
tactics. In 1993, the team had its first 10-win season and beat the University 
of Miami Hurricanes in the Fiesta Bowl by a score of 29–0. It was the bowl 
game's only shutout in its then 23-year history. In 1998, the team posted 
a school-record 12–1 season and made the Holiday Bowl in which it defeated 
the Nebraska Cornhuskers. Arizona ended that season ranked 4th nationally 
in the coaches and API poll. The 1998 Holiday Bowl was televised on ESPN 
and set the now-surpassed record of being the most watched of any bowl 
game in that network's history. From November 2003 until October 2011, 
the program was led by Mike Stoops, brother of Bob Stoops, the head football 
coach at the University of Oklahoma (the 2000 BCS national champions); 
Stoops was fired on October 10, 2011. Former Michigan and West Virginia 
head coach Rich Rodriguez was hired on November 21, 2011 to lead the Wildcats. 
The announcement was made by UA athletic director Greg Byrne via Twitter. 
In his first season, Rodriguez took the Wildcats to the 2012 New Mexico 
Bowl, where they defeated the University of Nevada Wolf Pack. In his third 
season, the Wildcats won the Pac-12 South and played in the 2014 Fiesta 
Bowl.[87] In 2015, the Wildcats played in their fourth consecutive bowl 
game, defeating the University of Nevada in the New Mexico Bowl.[88] The 
baseball team had its first season in 1904. The baseball team has captured 
four national championship titles in 1976, 1980, 1986 and 2012, with the 
first three coached by Jerry Kindall and the most recent by Andy Lopez. 
Arizona baseball teams have appeared in the NCAA National Championship 
title series a total of 34 times,[89] including 1956, 1959, 1963, 1976, 
1980, 1986, 2004, 2012, and 2016. Arizona baseball has appeared in the 
College World Series 17 times. (College World Series). Arizona is 7th all-time 
in games won in the regular season with 2,347 wins. Home games are played 
at Hi Corbett Field. Jay Johnson, previously head coach of the University 
of Nevada baseball program, succeeded Andy Lopez who retired after the 
2015 season.[90] In his first season as head coach, Johnson guided his 
team to the programs 17th College World Series appearance and 8th championship 
series appearance. Arizona baseball also has a student section named The 
Hot Corner. Famous UA baseball alums include Terry Francona, Kenny Lofton, 
Shelley Duncan, Trevor Hoffman, Mark Melancon, Chip Hale, Craig Lefferts, 
J. T. Snow, Don Lee, Carl Thomas, Mike Paul, Dan Schneider, Rich Hinton, 
Ed Vosberg, Hank Leiber, Ron Hassey, Brad Mills, and Joe Magrane. The Arizona 
softball team is among the top programs in the country. The softball team 
has won eight NCAA Women's College World Series titles, in 1991, 1993, 
1994, 1996, 1997, 2001, 2006 and 2007 under head coach Mike Candrea (NCAA 
Softball Championship). The team has appeared in the NCAA National Championship 
in 1991, 1992, 1993, 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997 1998, 2001, 2002, 2006, 2007 
and 2010 (a feat second only to UCLA), and has reached the College World 
Series 19 of the past 20 years. Coach Candrea, along with former Arizona 
pitcher Jennie Finch, led the 2004 U.S. Olympic softball team to a gold 
medal in Athens, Greece. The Wildcat softball team plays at Rita Hillenbrand 
Memorial Stadium. The university's golf teams have also been notably successful. 
The men's team won a national championship in 1992 (NCAA Division I Men's 
Golf Championships), and has produced a number of successful professionals, 
most notably Jim Furyk. The women's team won national championships in 
1996 and 2000 (NCAA Women's Golf Championship). The women's golf program 
has produced professionals Annika Sörenstam and Lorena Ochoa. The lacrosse 
team is a club team, not a varsity sport at Arizona, affectionately known 
as the "Laxcats". Its existence, since the mid-1960s, is saturated with 
a rich tradition of success. In the 1960s, Arizona was a Division I Varsity 
program, coached by the legendary Carl Runk, an Arizona graduate and football 
player. In 1998 Carl retired after twenty-eight years at Towson University 
in Maryland. Many other Wildcats have met with success at the university. 
Alix Creek and Michelle Oldham won the NCAA Women's Doubles Tennis title 
in 1993, defeating Texas in the Final. Although surprising to some, the 
University of Arizona has a noteworthy history in ice hockey. The school's 
club hockey team, formerly known as the Icecats, has won over 600 games 
since its inception in 1978. The Icecats defeated Penn State for the National 
Collegiate Club Hockey National Championship in 1985. They are now part 
of ACHA Division I, and are known formally as the Arizona Wildcats hockey 
team. Robert M. Tanita was a nationally ranked collegiate wrestler who 
reached the NCAA finals tournament as WAC champion in 1963. Three national 
championships for synchronized swimming were won in 1980, 1981, and 1984, 
though these championships were in the Association of Intercollegiate Athletics 
for Women, and not the NCAA. Along with winning three national championships 
in the pool for synchronized swimming, the Wildcats have also won their 
first NCAA Championship in men and women's swimming and diving for the 
seasons of 2007–2008. Topping off these weekends Frank Busch, the men and 
women's head coach, was named NCAA Swimming Coach of the Year. Arizona 
men became the first team to claim a first-time title since UCLA's win 
in 1982. Also, the men ended Texas and Auburn's winning streak since 1998. 
At the end of the meet, the Texas Longhorns took second while 2007's champion, 
the Auburn Tigers, took fifth. For the women, Arizona worked on the disappointment 
of 2007's defeat. The women were winning until the last day when Auburn 
grasped the title. Unlike 2007, Arizona's women did not let anyone come 
close. The Wildcats won with 484 team points while the Auburn Tigers came 
in second with 348 and the Stanford Cardinal in third with 343. Student-athletes 
from the women's swimming and diving team have been particularly heralded 
by the NCAA. The NCAA Woman of the Year Award was won by UA swimmers Whitney 
Myers, Lacey Nymeyer and Justine Schluntz in 2007, 2009 and 2010 respectively. 
The three awards and the 1994 award won by track and field athlete Tanya 
Hughes are the highest number of Woman of the Year awards won by a single 
university. A number of notable individuals have also won national championships 
in the NCAA. These include Amanda Beard in 2001 for swimming and Annika 
Sörenstam in 1991 in golf. The men's cross country has also produced two 
individual national titles in 1986 (Aaron Ramirez) and 1994 (Martin Keino) 
(NCAA Men's Cross Country Champions). The women's cross country also produced 
two individual national titles in 1996 (Amy Skieresz) and 2001 (Tara Chaplin) 
(NCAA Women's Cross Country Championship). Another notable individual was 
football standout Vance Johnson who won the NCAA long jump in 1982. Arizona's 
first NCAA Individual Champion in the sport of Men's Swimming came in 1981 
when Doug Towne won the 500 yard freestyle at the NCAA championships. Another 
individual champion occurred in 1989 when Mariusz Podkoscielny swimming 
won the 1650-yard (mile) at the NCAA National Championships held at the 
IUPUI Natatorium. A strong athletic rivalry exists between the University 
of Arizona and Arizona State University located in Tempe. UA leads the 
all-time record against ASU in men's basketball (148–82), as well as in 
football (48–40–1). The football rivalry game between the schools is known 
as "The Duel in the Desert." The trophy awarded after each game, the Territorial 
Cup, is the nation's oldest rivalry trophy, distinguished by the NCAA. 
Rivalries have also been created with other Pac-12 teams, especially University 
of California, Los Angeles which has provided a worthy softball rival and 
was Arizona's main basketball rival in the early and mid-1990s. The university's 
mascots are a pair of anthropomorphized wildcats named Wilbur and Wilma. 
The identities of Wilbur and Wilma are kept secret through the year as 
the mascots appear only in costume. In 1986, Wilbur married his longtime 
wildcat girlfriend, Wilma. Together, Wilbur and Wilma appear along with 
the cheerleading squad at most Wildcat sporting events.[91] Arizona's first 
mascot was a real desert bobcat named "Rufus Arizona", introduced in 1915.[92] 
Wilbur was originally created by Bob White as a cartoon character in the 
university's humor magazine, Kitty Kat. From 1915 through the 1950s the 
school mascot was a live bobcat, a species known locally as a wildcat. 
This succession of live mascots were known by the common name of Rufus 
Arizona, originally named after Rufus von Kleinsmid, president of the university 
from 1914 to 1921. 1959 marked the creation of the first incarnated Wilbur, 
when University student John Paquette and his roommate, Dick Heller, came 
up with idea of creating a costume for a student to wear. Ed Stuckenhoff 
was chosen to wear the costume at the homecoming game in 1959 against Texas 
Tech and since then it has become a long-standing tradition. Wilbur celebrated 
his 50th birthday in November 2009. In 1952 Jack K. Lee, an applicant for 
the UA's band directorship, departed Tucson by air following an interview 
with UA administration. From his airplane window, Lee observed the huge 
letters on the roof of the UA gymnasium reading "BEAR DOWN." Inspired, 
Lee scribbled down the music and lyrics to an up-tempo song. By the time 
his plane landed, he had virtually finished it. A few weeks later Lee was 
named the UA band director, and in September 1952, the UA band performed 
"Bear Down, Arizona!" in public for the first time. Soon thereafter, "Bear 
Down, Arizona!" became accepted as UA's fight song (Bear Down).[62] Officially 
implemented in 2003, ZonaZoo is the official student section and student 
ticketing program for the University of Arizona Athletics. The ZonaZoo 
program is co-owned by the Associated Students of the University of Arizona 
(ASUA) and Arizona Athletics yet run by a team of individuals called the 
ZonaZoo Crew. ZonaZoo is one of the largest and most spirited in NCAA Division 
I Athletics. The McKale Center, which opened in 1973, is currently used 
by men's and women's basketball, women's gymnastics, and women's volleyball. 
The official capacity has changed often. The largest crowd to see a game 
in McKale was 15,176 in 1976 for a game against the University of New Mexico, 
a main rival during that period. In 2000, the floor in McKale was dubbed 
Lute Olson Court, for the basketball program's winningest coach. During 
a memorial service in 2001 for Lute's wife, Bobbi, who died after a battle 
with ovarian cancer, the floor was renamed Lute and Bobbi Olson Court. 
In addition to the playing surface, McKale Center is host to the offices 
of the UA athletic department. McKale Center is named after J.F. Pop McKale, 
who was athletic director and coach from 1914 through 1957. Joe Cavaleri 
("The Ooh-Aah Man") made his dramatic and inspiring appearances there. 
Arizona Stadium, built in 1928 and last expanded in 2013, seats 56,037 
patrons. It hosts American football games and has also been used for university 
graduations. The turf is bermuda grass, taken from the local Tucson National 
Golf Club. Arizona football's home record is 258–139–12. The largest crowd 
ever in Arizona Stadium was 59,920 in 1996 for a game against Arizona State 
University. Rita Hillenbrand Memorial Stadium hosts softball games. Jerry 
Kindall Field at Frank Sancet Stadium hosted baseball games until the 2012 
season, when the baseball program began playing home games at Hi Corbett 
Field, a former Cactus League spring training facility located three miles 
southeast of campus. As of 2015[update], there are 49 fraternity and sorority 
chapters that are recognized by the University of Arizona.[93] As of 2006, 
approximately 10.3% of male UA students were members of campus fraternities, 
and 10.8% of female students were members of sororities. The fraternities 
and sororities are governed by 4 governing councils. The Interfraternity 
Council (IFC) represents 25 fraternities, the National Pan-Hellenic Council 
(NPHC) represents 6 historically African-American fraternities and sororities, 
the Panhellenic Association (PHC) represents 20 sororities and the United 
Sorority and Fraternity Council (USFC) represents 10 multicultural and 
multi-interest Greek organizations.[94] Delta Chi Lambda is an Asian American 
sorority that was established at the University of Arizona in 2000.[95] 
The Lambda chapter of Phrateres, a non-exclusive, non-profit social-service 
club, was installed in 1937. A new and expansive Student Union building 
opened in 2003; it is the largest student union in the U.S. not affiliated 
with a hotel.[citation needed] The University of Arizona is home to more 
than 500 philanthropic, multi-cultural, social, athletic, academic, and 
student clubs and campus organizations. A listing is found at Associated 
Students of The University of Arizona (ASUA)[96] through the Student Union. 
CSIL also houses the Arizona Blue Chip Program[97] one of the largest collegiate-level 
leadership development programs in the United States, with over 500 active 
students at any one time throughout the 4 years of the program. Blue Chip 
was founded in 1999 and has formed a partnership with the University of 
Wollongong, in Wollongong, Australia where a sister program, the Black 
Opal Leadership Development Program[98] began in February 2005. Structure, 
curriculum, students and even staff are exchanged between the two institutions 
in a unique international leadership development initiative. Also located 
in the CSIL is the office of Camp Wildcat, a student-run non-profit service 
organization that serves local disadvantaged youth. Through funding from 
the CSIL and the Associated Students of the University of Arizona, clubs 
are given the resources and encouragement to explore unusual interests. 
In 2008 University of Arizona students started their own branch (reinstated 
as of April 21, 2010[99]) of the Arizona Students for Life (ASFL) pro-life 
association, whose goal is to help pregnant college women and raise awareness 
about elective abortion.[100] In 2015, The U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency recognized the University of Arizona for its food diversion efforts, 
giving particular recognition to the student-formed Compost Cats, a nationally 
unique organization.[101] The University of Arizona is also home to one 
of the oldest Model United Nations organizations in the United States, 
which each year hosts several hundred students high school students in 
a bilingual simulation of the United Nations and other international bodies.[102] 
In 2008, the Office of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Questioning 
Student Affairs was created to provide services to LGBTQ students and staff 
on campus[103] and serve opposite an existing student group called "Pride 
Alliance,"[104] a recognized LGBTQ student group that has been active since 
the 1990s in providing support and visibility to LGBTQ students on campus. 
The Strategic Alternative Learning Techniques (SALT) Center[105] helps 
students with learning and attention challenges to succeed in a higher 
education. Founded during the 1980-1981 academic year as a program within 
the Student Resource Center. At the time, SALT had provided academic services 
and accommodations up to three students with learning disabilities.[106] 
During the 1990s, The SALT Center was located in the basement of Old Main, 
the oldest building at the university. During the time, SALT staff was 
located in tight offices while tutors conducted tutoring sessions around 
Old Main, often sitting outside, immersed in the sounds of everyday university 
life. In 2000, the SALT Center moved out of Old Main and into a 16,000 
square-foot (4.9 cm2) building with the help of 500 individual donors, 
families, and parents in order to help serve better for the student population 
at the university. As of 2013, the SALT Center has more than 550 students 
at the University of Arizona with learning disabilities, Attention deficit 
hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and a range of other learning and attention 
challenges.[106] At the beginning of each school year, freshmen repaint 
the "A" on "A" Mountain, and since 1914 the "A" remains a Tucson and Wildcat 
landmark.[107] The "A" is now painted Red, White and Blue until all troops 
in foreign wars stemming from the September 11 attacks return home. This 
was passed by the ASUA student government body shortly after the war in 
Afghanistan began in 2001. As of 2016 the "A" on A mountain has returned 
to white. Later in the school year, Spring Fling, an ASUA Student Government 
program, and the largest student-run carnival in the U.S., has been held 
annually by UA students since 1965, under a different name: The Rites of 
Spring. The event occurs every April, and brings together the U of A community 
and the Tucson community. The UA club, Camp Wildcat, initially began the 
festival as a fundraiser and continued to do so until the event was taken 
over by ASUA in 1975.[108] The University of Arizona marching band, named 
The Pride of Arizona, played at the halftime of the first Super Bowl. Most 
recently, the Pride was named one of the top five marching bands in the 
nation. They are directed by UA alumnus and former Pride of Arizona member, 
Chad Shoopman.[109] Instrumentation includes woodwinds, brass, and a marching 
percussion section, as well as a pomline, twirling line, and color guard. 
The current school colors are UA Red and Arizona Blue,[110] recognized 
in the Pantone Matching System, with the PMS number 200C and 281, respectively. 
In CMYK system, process color for UA Red is C: 18 M:100 Y:83 K:8, and C:100 
M:71 Y:0 K:58 for Arizona Blue. Before 1900, the colors were sage green 
and silver. The switch was made when a lucrative discount on red and blue 
jerseys became available.[111] Overall, students at the University of Arizona 
have been represented by the Associated Students of the University of Arizona 
(ASUA) since 1913. Every year (usually in March), the students elect a 
Senator to represent each of the respective undergraduate colleges, three 
at large senators, an Administrative Vice President, an Executive Vice 
President and President to 1-year terms. The ASUA oversees the ZonaZoo 
and UA Spring Fling programs, while holding administrative oversight for 
the nearly 600 student clubs on campus. Each of the Senators and all Administrative 
Officers also are appointed to serve on the various University of Arizona 
Faculty and Administrative Committees. In 1997, the Graduate and Professional 
Student Council (GPSC) split from the ASUA and has since become the de 
facto body to represent issues specific to graduate and professional students. 
Each year (usually in late March or early April), the graduate and professional 
students elect 30 representatives by constituency in accordance to college 
graduate and/or professional student population, with three of those representatives 
elected at large. The Vice President and President are also elected at 
large by the graduate and professional student body. Much like ASUA, the 
GPSC appoints representatives to serve on various University of Arizona 
Faculty and Administrative Committees and 1 Director to serve on the Arizona 
Students' Association. On-campus residents also have their own Student 
Leadership Organization known as the "Residence Hall Association".[112] 
Anyone who lives on campus is automatically a member of RHA. The individual 
subunits of RHA consist of the hall councils of all 23 residence halls. 
Each Hall Council is one of three structures, Traditional, Hybrid and Open. 
Additionally each hall council has an EcoRep for Sustainability, and two 
RHA Representatives who are sent to represent their hall at RHA General 
Body Meetings and one ACT Rep for Social Justice. At these meetings, the 
gathered representatives and RHA Executive Board, elected from within the 
RHA General Body, discuss issues and make decisions concerning all 6,000 
on campus residents. Members of the RHA Executive Board are elected to 
one-year terms during the spring semester and are sworn into office at 
the RHA Banquet usually held during the later part of April. Hall council 
members and RHA representatives are usually elected by the residents of 
their respective residence halls during the first 2 weeks of the Fall semester 
in late August and early September with their term running through the 
end of the Spring semester in early May. The RHA Executive Board consists 
of 8 different elected positions (President, Director of Public Relations, 
National Communications Coordinator, Director of Business Administration, 
Director of Equipment Services, Director of Training and Development, and 
Director of Programming) along with two ex-officio members, the appointed 
Parliamentarian position and the NRHH President as well as an advisor who 
holds the role of Coordinator for Student Leadership within Residence Life. 
In 2011, the Residence Hall Association revamped its Executive Board in 
effort to make the EBoard more parallel to the IACURH Regional Board and 
NACURH National Board.[113] The University of Arizona Residence Hall Association 
has hosted 3 regional IACURH Residence Hall Conferences, which were hosted 
in 1961, 1997, and 2004 and a "No Frills" Business meeting in 2013.[114] 
In 2005 and 2012 the University of Arizona's Residence Hall Association 
was voted by NACURH (National Association of College and University Residence 
Halls) as the National School of the Year out of over 400 schools across 
the United States. In May 2009, the University of Arizona hosted the NACURH 
National Residence Hall Conference (also hosted in 1963), bringing more 
than 2,200 on-campus residents from over 250 schools across the United 
States and Canada for 3 days of school spirit and learning how to become 
more sustainable and socially just. The conference theme (Our Place in 
Time) focused on sustainability and social justice within the residence 
halls.[115] The university has made itself known through many films and 
television appearances. The film Revenge of the Nerds (1984) was filmed 
at the University of Arizona. In the movie, the Alpha Beta "jock" house 
was the real-life home to the UA chapter of the Phi Delta Theta Fraternity 
until purchased by the Alpha Gamma Rho fraternity in the late 1980s. The 
dorm room (with the balcony) seen in the film is located on the third floor 
of historic Cochise Hall on campus. When the characters are moving in at 
the beginning of the movie, the dorm behind the post office drop is Yuma 
Hall. In the 1994 film Speed, Dennis Hopper refers to Sandra Bullock's 
character as a Wildcat because of the emblem on her sweater. In the 1989 
film "Leviathan", Peter Weller's character, Steven Beck, frequently wears 
an Arizona Wildcats hat. In the 2006 film You, Me and Dupree, produced 
by Arizona Alum Scott Stuber, several characters are watching the Arizona 
Wildcats play football against Washington State University. While playing 
in their blue uniforms, Arizona scores on a fumble recovery. The film Eating 
Out was shot around the University of Arizona campus in Tucson. An episode 
of Little House on the Prairie, entitled "A Wiser Heart," used Old Main 
as a prominent backdrop throughout. The film Night of the Lepus (1972) 
features a short shot of Old Main in the first few minutes. The university 
appears at the end of the film as well. Portions of David Foster Wallace's 
novel Infinite Jest take place at the University of Arizona campus, including 
a scene in the administration building satirizing the school's bureaucracy. 
Wallace was an alumnus of UA. Notable alumni include U.S. Representative 
Raúl M. Grijalva; the creator of the television series Sesame Street and 
founder of the Children's Television Workshop Joan Ganz Cooney; NFL quarterback 
for the Los Angeles Rams Nick Foles; Triple Crown winner Bob Baffert; Jerry

Sciences: Nicolaas Bloembergen (Physics, 1981) and Willis E. Lamb (Physics, 
1955). The University of Arizona has eight Pulitzer Prize winners (alumni 
and faculty), and more than 50 faculty as elected members of exclusive 
academies including Britain's Royal Society, and the American Academy of 
Arts and Sciences.[citation needed] Coordinates: 32°13′54″N 110°57′07″W﻿
