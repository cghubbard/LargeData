As player As manager Felipe Rojas Alou (born May 12, 1935), is a former 
Major League Baseball outfielder, first baseman, and manager. He managed 
the Montreal Expos (1992–2001) and the San Francisco Giants (2003–06). 
The first Dominican to play regularly in the major leagues, he is the most 
prominent member of one of the sport's most notable families of the late 
20th century: he was the oldest of the trio of baseball-playing brothers 
that included Matty and Jesús, who were both primarily outfielders, and 
his son Moisés was also primarily an outfielder; all but Jesús have been 
named All-Stars at least twice. The family name in the Dominican Republic 
is Rojas, but Felipe Alou and his brothers became known by the name Alou 
when the Giants' scout who signed Felipe mistakenly thought his matronymic 
was his father's name. During his 17-year career spent with the Giants, 
Milwaukee & Atlanta Braves, Oakland Athletics, New York Yankees, Montreal 
Expos, and Milwaukee Brewers, Alou played all three outfield positions 
regularly (736 games in right field, 483 in center, 433 in left), and led 
the National League in hits twice and runs once. Batting regularly in the 
leadoff spot, he hit a home run to begin a game on 20 occasions. He later 
became the most successful manager in Expos history, leading the team from 
1992 to 2001 before rejoining the Giants in 2003. On February 4, 2015, 
Alou was elected to the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame.[1] Then in 2016, 
he was enshrined in the Caribbean Baseball Hall of Fame. Alou lived in 
poverty in the Dominican Republic and dreamed of escaping it by becoming 
a doctor.[citation needed] But switching from track and field to baseball 
at the Pan-American Games revealed talent for the latter as the Dominican 
team took gold. He still pursued a university career a while longer, but 
was finally forced to sign with the Giants in November 1955 for only $200 
due to family financial problems.[citation needed] He made his major league 
debut in 1958 and was an All-Star in 1962, when he batted .316 with 25 
home runs and 98 RBI. Felipe was joined by his brothers, Matty in 1960, 
and Jesús in 1963, who, on September 15 of that year became the first, 
and as of today only, all-brother outfield.[2] He was traded to the Braves 
before the 1964 season with Ed Bailey, Billy Hoeft and a player to be named 
later (Ernie Bowman) for Del Crandall, Bob Hendley and Bob Shaw. Two years 
later he enjoyed his best season, when he batted .327 with 31 home runs 
and led the league in runs (122), hits (218), at bats (666) and total bases 
(355); he finished second in the batting race to his brother Matty. He 
also had a good year in 1968, batting .317 and leading the league in hits 
(210) and at bats (662); he made the All-Star team both years. After the 
1969 season, the Braves traded him to the Athletics for Jim Nash. In April 
1971, he was traded by the Athletics to the Yankees for Rob Gardner and 
Ron Klimkowski. In September 1973, he was selected off waivers by the Expos 
from the Yankees, and was purchased by the Brewers from the Expos after 
the season. After the end of his playing career, Alou joined the Montreal 
Expos organization in 1976, becoming a batting coach and a minor league 
manager. The Giants offered him the manager's spot in 1985, but he remained 
with the Expos out of loyalty. On May 22, 1992, he was promoted from bench 
coach to field manager of the Expos, becoming the first Dominican-born 
manager in MLB history.[3] The team was developing a core of young talent 
during this period, including Larry Walker, John Wetteland, Delino DeShields 
and Alou's own son, Moisés. In 1994 the Expos had the best record in the 
major leagues until the mid-August strike that ended up cancelling the 
entire postseason, thereby denying them a chance to get to their first 
World Series, and ownership soon began dealing all their young talent to 
cut payroll. Alou was named the NL Manager of the Year. The Los Angeles 
Dodgers tried to lure him away in 1998, but he declined to leave Montreal 
and eventually became the most successful manager in team history. Despite 
Alou's popularity in Montreal, the Expos' lackluster record after 1994 
eventually led to his dismissal by new owner Jeffrey Loria, who replaced 
him with Jeff Torborg during the 2001 season. Several teams tried to lure 
him out of retirement, including the Boston Red Sox, but he would not budge. 
He finally agreed to serve a single year as the bench coach for Detroit 
Tigers rookie manager Luis Pujols (2002). Prior to the 2003 season, Alou 
was named manager of the Giants, the team where he began his professional 
baseball career, replacing Dusty Baker who had left to manage the Chicago 
Cubs. In his first season in San Francisco, he won a hundred games and 
managed the Giants into the playoffs, who fell to the Florida Marlins in 
the NL Division Series in 4 games; the Marlins went on to win their second 
World Series in seven years. In 2005, the Giants signed Moisés Alou to 
a one-year contract with an option for the 2006 season, reuniting him professionally 
with his father after seven seasons apart, but Felipe retired as Giants' 
manager after the 2006 season.[4] Since 2007, he has remained with the
