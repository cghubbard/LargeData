In baseball statistics, games started (denoted by GS) indicates the number 
of games that a pitcher has started for his team. A pitcher is credited 
with starting the game if he throws the first pitch to the first opposing 
batter. If a player is listed in the starting lineup as the team's pitcher, 
but is replaced before facing an opposing batter, the player is credited 
with a game pitched but not a game started; there have been instances in 
major league history in which a starting pitcher was removed before his 
first pitch due to an injury, perhaps suffered while batting or running 
the bases during the top half of the first inning. The all-time leader 
for games started is Cy Young with 815 over a 22-year career. The current 
leader among active players is Jamie Moyer. The players with the most starts 
in a single season are Pud Galvin and Will White, each with 75 games started.[1] 
For position players, games started is also used to denote the number of 
times their names appear in a team's starting lineup during the season.
