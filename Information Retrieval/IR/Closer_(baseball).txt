In baseball, a closing pitcher, more frequently referred to as a closer 
(abbreviated CL), is a relief pitcher who specializes in getting the final 
outs in a close game when his team is leading. The role is often assigned 
to a team's best reliever. Before the 1990s, pitchers in similar roles 
were referred to as a fireman, short reliever, and stopper. A small number 
of closers have won the Cy Young Award. Dennis Eckersley, Rollie Fingers, 
Goose Gossage, Bruce Sutter and Hoyt Wilhelm are closers who have been 
elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame. A closer is generally a team's best 
reliever and designated to pitch the last few outs of games when their 
team is leading by a margin of three runs or fewer. Rarely does a closer 
enter with their team losing or in a tie game.[1] A closer's effectiveness 
has traditionally been measured by the save, an official Major League Baseball 
(MLB) statistic since 1969.[2][3] Over time, closers have become one-inning 
specialists typically brought in at the beginning of the ninth inning in 
save situations. The pressure of the last three outs of the game is often 
cited for the importance attributed to the ninth inning.[2][4] Closers 
are often the highest paid relievers on their teams, making money on par 
with starting pitchers.[2][5] In the rare cases where a team does not have 
one primary pitcher dedicated to this role, the team is said to have a 
closer by committee.[6] New York Giants manager John McGraw in 1905 was 
one of the first to use a relief pitcher to save games. He pitched Claude 
Elliott in relief eight times in his ten appearances. Though saves were 
not an official statistic until 1969, Elliot was retroactively credited 
with six saves that season, a record at that time.[7][8] In 1977, Chicago 
Cubs manager Herman Franks used Bruce Sutter almost exclusively in the 
eighth or ninth innings in save situations.[6][9] While relievers such 
as Rollie Fingers and Goose Gossage were already being used mostly in save 
situations, Franks's use of Sutter represented an incremental change.[9] 
Sutter was the first pitcher to start the ninth inning in 20 percent of 
his career appearances. Clay Carroll in 1972 was the first pitcher to make 
a third of his season's appearances in the beginning of the ninth inning, 
which would not be repeated until Fingers in 1982. John Franco in 1987 
was the first to be used over 50 percent of the time in the beginning of 
the ninth in a season;[10] he had a then-record 24 one-inning saves.[11] 
Lee Smith in 1994 was the first to be used over 75 percent of the time 
in that situation.[10] Using the save leader from each team in the league, 
the average closer made his appearances in the beginning of the ninth inning 
10 percent of the time in the 1970s to almost 2⁄3 of the time by 2004.[12] 
Tony La Russa while with the Oakland A's is frequently named as the innovator 
of the position, making Dennis Eckersley the first player to be used almost 
exclusively in ninth inning situations.[1][13] La Russa explained that 
"[the Oakland A's would] be ahead a large number of games every week ... 
That's a lot of work for somebody throwing more than one inning ... Also, 
there was the added advantage of [Eckersley] not getting overexposed. We 
tried to get [him] to only face three or four batters an outing."[2] Baseball 
teams often copy one another, following a strategy based on one team's 
success.[14] In 1990, Bobby Thigpen set a record with 57 saves while breaking 
Franco's one-inning saves record with 41. Francisco Rodríguez set the current 
record with 54 one-inning saves in 2008.[11] As late as 1989, a team's 
ace reliever was called a fireman,[15] coming to the rescue to "put out 
the fire", baseball terminology for stopping an offensive rally with runners 
on base.[2][16][17] They were occasionally referred to as short relievers, 
stoppers and closers. By the early 1990s, the top late-inning reliever 
was called a closer.[15] The firemen came in whenever leads were in jeopardy, 
usually with men on base, and regardless of the inning and often pitching 
two or three innings while finishing the game.[2][18][19] An example of 
this is that Goose Gossage had 17 games where he recorded at least 10 outs 
in his first season as a closer, including three games where he went seven 
innings. He pitched over 130 innings as a reliever in three different seasons.[18] 
For their careers, Sutter and Gossage had more saves of at least two innings 
than saves where they pitched one inning or less. Fingers was the only 
pitcher who pitched at least three innings in more than 10 percent of his 
saves.[20] The game evolved to where the best reliever was reserved for 
games where the team had a lead of three runs or less in the ninth inning.[12] 
Mariano Rivera, considered one of the greatest closers of his era,[21] 
earned only one save of seven-plus outs in his career, while Gossage logged 
53.[22] "Don't tell me [Rivera's] the best relief pitcher of all-time until 
he can do the same job I did. He may be the best modern closer, but you 
have to compare apples to apples. Do what we did", said Gossage.[23] ESPN.com 
writer Jim Caple wrote that closers' saves in the ninth "merely conclude 
what is usually a foregone conclusion."[18] Dave Smith of Retrosheet researched 
the seasons 1930–2003 and found that the winning percentage for teams who 
enter the ninth inning with a lead has remained virtually unchanged over 
the decades. One-run leads after eight innings have been won roughly 85 
percent of the time, two-run leads 94 percent of the time, and three-run 
leads about 96 percent of the time.[18] Baseball Prospectus projects that 
teams could gain as much as four extra wins a year by focusing on bringing 
their ace reliever into the game earlier in more critical situations with 
runners on base instead of holding them out to accumulate easier ninth 
inning saves.[24] In The Book: Playing the Percentages in Baseball, Tom 
Tango et al. wrote that there was more value to having the ace reliever 
enter in the eighth inning with a one- or a two-run lead instead of the 
ninth with a three-run lead.[25] "Managers feel the need to please their 
closers—and their closers' agents—by getting them cheap saves to pad their 
stats and their bank accounts", wrote Caple.[18] Tango et al. projected 
that using a great reliever over an average one to start the ninth with 
a three-run lead resulted in a two percent increase in wins, versus four 
percent for a two-run lead or six percent for a one-run lead.[26] Former 
Baltimore Orioles manager Johnny Oates once told Jerome Holtzman, the inventor 
of the save statistic, that he created the ninth-inning pitcher by inventing 
the save. Holtzman disagreed, saying it was baseball managers who were 
responsible for not bringing in their top reliever when the game was on 
the line, in the seventh or eighth inning, which had been the practice 
in the past.[27] He noted that managers' usage of closers can "abuse the 
pitching save ... to favor the closer."[28] La Russa says it is important 
that relievers know their roles and the situations which they will be called 
into a game. He added, "Sure, games can get away from you in the seventh 
and eighth, but those last three outs in the ninth are the toughest. You 
want the guy who can handle that pressure. That, to me, is most important."[2] 
Oakland general manager Billy Beane said there would be too much media 
criticism if a pitcher other than the closer lost the game in the ninth."[18] 
Managerial moves are immediately questioned with millions of fans having 
access to ESPN, the MLB Network, and other cable channels.[29] Former manager 
Jim Fregosi said managers do not like to be second-guessed.[30] "Even if 
you know the odds, it's more comfortable being wrong when you go to the 
closer", said Beane. He noted the incremental increase gained by a closer 
in a three-run save situation "is worth it because losing is so painful 
in that situation."[18] Baseball announcer Chris Wheeler noted that there 
is pressure on managers to pitch closers in the ninth inning when they 
were paid big money to pitch in that role.[31] Former general manager Pat 
Gillick said closers become one-inning pitchers as managers began copying 
the practice of having setup pitchers enter before closers. "There are 
just too many specialists, guys who can only pitch one inning and only 
pitch certain innings and throw only 20 pitches. I think most pitchers 
are capable of pitching more", said Gillick.[32] La Russa noted that losing 
clubs risk their closer being under-worked, if they stick to the strategy 
of saving them for ninth inning situations where the team is ahead.[2] 
An instance of this was Philadelphia Phillies manager Charlie Manuel, who 
did not call upon closer Jonathan Papelbon in high leverage situations 
during the 2012 season, including six games where the score was tied during 
the late innings, which may have cost the team seven wins by midseason. 
Jonah Keri suggested "fear of using pitchers in anything but the most predictable 
circumstances, or simple inertia, closers get used far more often in easy-to-manage, 
up-two, bases-empty, ninth-inning situations than they do in tie games 
with runners on and the game actually on the line" and said of Papelbon 
"unless the Phillies start using him in situations where he’s actually 
needed, rather than almost exclusively in spots that nearly any pitcher 
with a pulse can handle successfully 85–90 percent of the time, Papelbon 
will remain the $200,000 Aston Martin that never leaves the garage".[1][2] 
Some critics have noted that the 9th inning closer strategy is illogical 
during playoff games, especially when the club is facing elimination. During 
Games 4 and 6 of the 2010 NLCS, each a late-inning situation with the score 
tied, Phillies manager Charlie Manuel did not call upon closer Brad Lidge 
and both times the selected relief pitcher surrendered the game-winning 
home run.[3][4] Similarly in Games 3 and 6 of the 2010 ALCS, each where 
the New York Yankees were trailing by two runs during a crucial inning, 
manager Joe Girardi did not go to Mariano Rivera, and both times the chosen 
relief pitcher gave up several runs which put the game out of reach for 
the Yankees; ESPN's Matthew Wallace lamented that "Girardi used Rivera 
in the ninth inning of Game 6, with the Yankees trailing 6-1, their ship 
long sailed to sea".[5] Five pitchers who were primarily relievers have 
been inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame. Hoyt Wilhelm was the first 
to be elected in 1985,[33] followed by Rollie Fingers, Dennis Eckersley, 
Bruce Sutter, and Goose Gossage.[a] Eckersley was the first closer in the 
one-inning save era to be inducted. He believed that he was inducted because 
he was both a starter and a reliever.[36] "If I came up today as a closer 
and played 20 years, would I have made it [into the Hall of Fame]? These 
pitchers did the job they were supposed to do for 20 years. What else are 
they supposed to do?" said Eckersley.[37] * Won both the league Cy Young
