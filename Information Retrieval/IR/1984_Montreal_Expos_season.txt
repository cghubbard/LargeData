The Expos recorded 78 wins during the 1984 season and finished in fifth 
place in the National League East. A managerial change occurred as Bill 
Virdon was replaced by Jim Fanning. The highlight of the Expos season was 
the acquisition of Pete Rose. After being benched in the 1983 World Series, 
Rose left the Phillies and signed a one-year contract with the Montreal 
Expos. Infielders Coaches Note: Pos = Position; G = Games played; AB =
