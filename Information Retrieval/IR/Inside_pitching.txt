In baseball, inside pitching is a tactic used by pitchers. It refers to 
throwing a pitch outside the strike zone and near the batter's box. Depending 
on the exact height and location of the pitch, it can result in a brushback 
pitch, or, in the case of a badly controlled pitch, a hit batter. Despite 
the dangers that it poses to batters, it is a common and legal tactic.
