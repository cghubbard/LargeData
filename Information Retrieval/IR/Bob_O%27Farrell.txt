As player As manager Robert Arthur O'Farrell (October 19, 1896 – February 
20, 1988) was an American professional baseball player and manager.[1] 
He played in Major League Baseball as a catcher for 21 seasons with the 
Chicago Cubs, St. Louis Cardinals and the New York Giants.[1] O'Farrell 
also played for the Cincinnati Reds, albeit briefly. He was considered 
as one of the greatest defensive catchers of his generation.[2] O'Farrell 
was born in Waukegan, Illinois where he grew up a Chicago White Sox fan. 
He signed with the Cubs in 1915 after playing an exhibition game for his 
local semi-professional team.[3] His first manager was former catcher, 
Roger Bresnahan, who helped O'Farrell develop his catching skills.[4] After 
a season on the bench, O'Farrell was sent to Three-I League where he spent 
two years before returning to the Cubs for the 1918 season.[5] He served 
as backup catcher working behind Bill Killefer as the Cubs went on to claim 
the 1918 National League pennant before losing to the Boston Red Sox in 
the 1918 World Series.[6] O'Farrell went hitless in three at bats during 
the series.[7] In 1920 O'Farrell caught the majority of the Cubs' games 
and posting a .248 batting average as, Killefer was injured during the 
season.[1] He began the 1921 season as backup catcher until August when, 
Killefer was named the Cubs new manager.[8][9] O'Farrell had a breakout 
season in 1922 when he hit for a .322 average along with 4 home runs, 60 
runs batted in and a .439 on-base percentage.[1] He also became one of 
the best defensive catchers in baseball, leading National League catchers 
in games caught, putouts, assists, baserunners caught stealing and in caught 
stealing percentage.[10] He became skillful at framing pitches by moving 
his catcher's mitt towards the strike zone after having caught a pitch, 
in an effort to influence the umpire to call a strike.[11] O'Farrell had 
an even better year offensively in 1923, producing career-highs in home 
runs (12), runs batted in (80), stolen bases (10) along with a .319 batting 
average.[1] In July 1924, O'Farrell suffered a fractured skull when a foul 
ball broke his catcher's mask.[12] He had asked a club house attendant 
to bring him a newer mask however, not wanting to delay the game, decided 
to continue to play with the older mask when he was struck in the head.[12] 
He missed most of the season, and lost his job when future Baseball Hall 
of Fame member, Gabby Hartnett, played well in his absence.[13] The Cubs 
decided to keep Hartnett as their starting catcher and traded O'Farrell 
to the St. Louis Cardinals at the start of the 1925 season for Mike González 
and Howard Freigau. O'Farrell experienced the highlight of his career in 
1926 when he hit for a .293 average with a career-high 30 doubles, 7 home 
runs and 68 runs batted in as he helped the Cardinals clinch the National 
League pennant.[1][14] He also led National League catchers in games caught 
and in putouts.[15] In the 1926 World Series against the New York Yankees, 
O'Farrell produced a .301 batting average but, is remembered for throwing 
out Babe Ruth trying to steal second base for the last out of the seven-game 
series as the Cardinals claimed their first-ever world championship.[16][17] 
In November, he was voted the winner of the 1926 National League Most Valuable 
Player Award with 79 out of the possible 80 votes.[18][19] He was the first 
catcher to win a Most Valuable Player Award.[19] In December 1926, the 
Cardinals traded their manager Rogers Hornsby to the New York Giants for 
Frankie Frisch and Jimmy Ring while O'Farrell was named player-manager.[20] 
He led the Cardinals to a second-place finish, behind the Pittsburgh Pirates 
even though the Cardinals won three more games than the previous season.[21] 
He only played in 61 games that season because of a sore arm.[21] The owner 
of the Cardinals at that time, Sam Breadon was unhappy that the Cardinals 
didn't win the pennant, and that O'Farrell was leaving his pitchers in 
too long during games.[22] He was given a $5,000 bonus to step down and 
replaced by Bill McKechnie.[23] O'Farrell was traded to the New York Giants 
for George Harper in May 1928.[24] The trade caught many observers by surprise 
as, it left the Cardinals without an experienced catcher while the Giants 
had a surplus of catchers.[25] O'Farrell played as a part-time catcher 
for the Giants, sharing catching duties with Shanty Hogan during John McGraw's 
final four years as manager of the club.[26] He hit for a .306 batting 
average in 1929 and followed that with a .301 average in 1930.[1] By the 
1931 season, the 34-year-old O'Farrell was past his prime as his batting 
average dipped to .224.[1] In October 1932, O'Farrell was traded back to 
the St. Louis Cardinals for catcher Gus Mancuso as part of new Giants manager 
Bill Terry's rebuilding campaign.[27] He spent one season serving as backup 
catcher to Jimmie Wilson before being traded to the Cincinnati Reds in 
January 1934.[1] The General Manager of the Reds, Larry MacPhail, named 
O'Farrell as the team's player-manager.[28] By July, the Reds had fallen 
to last place in the National League standings and, on July 27, O'Farrell 
requested his unconditional release from the team.[29] It was later reported 
that after the Reds had lost nine consecutive games, O'Farrell was engaged 
in a conversation with MacPhail when he quipped, "Well, you can't win 'em 
all." A supposedly infuriated MacPhail hired Charlie Dressen as the new 
Reds manager the following day.[30] In August, he returned to the Chicago 
Cubs where he worked as a backup catcher to Gabby Hartnett.[31] O'Farrell 
was released by the Cubs at the end of the year and signed to play with 
the Cardinals for the 1935 season. He appeared in only 14 games for the 
Cardinals, playing his final major league game on September 23 at the age 
of 38, and was released by the Cardinals in December 1935.[1][32] O'Farrell 
played two more seasons in the minor leagues with the Rochester Red Wings.[5] 
In 1938 he managed the Bloomington Bloomers before retiring from professional 
baseball at the age of 41.[1] In a twenty-one-year major league career, 
O'Farrell played in 1,492 games, accumulating 1,120 hits in 4,101 at bats 
for a .273 career batting average along with 51 home runs, 549 runs batted 
in and a .360 on-base percentage.[1] He finished his career with a .976 
fielding percentage.[1] He led the National League three times in putouts 
and twice in assists.[1] While with the Giants, O'Farrell caught Carl Hubbell's 
no-hitter on May 8, 1929.[33] He caught for six pitchers who would eventually 
be inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame.[34] After retirement he ran 
a bowling alley in Waukegan which was open for over 30 years. O'Farrell
