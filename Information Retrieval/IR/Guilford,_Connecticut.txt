Guilford is a town in New Haven County, Connecticut, United States, that

the population stands at approximately 22,500 people. It was named one 
of the top 100 places to live in the United States by Money magazine in 
2005.[3] Guilford was named after the town of Guildford, in England,[4] 
whose name differs from its own less in pronunciation than in spelling. 
First settled by Europeans in 1639 after being purchased from Native American 
leader Wequash, Guilford is considered by some to have the third largest 
collection of historic homes in New England, with important buildings from 
the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries.[5] There are five historic house museums, 
including Dudley Farm and the Henry Whitfield House (1639), the oldest 
dwelling house in Connecticut and the oldest stone house in North America. 
The Comfort Starr House (1645–46) is one of the oldest wooden framed private 
dwellings in Connecticut, and one of the few houses remaining of the original 
signers who settled Guilford.[6] According to the United States Census 
Bureau, the town has a total area of 49.7 square miles (129 km2), of which 
47.0 square miles (122 km2) is land and 2.7 square miles (6.9 km² or 5.39%) 
is water. The primary settlement in Guilford, known as Guilford Center, 
is located in the southern part of town around the intersection of U.S. 
Route 1 and Connecticut Route 77. It is served by three exits of Interstate

place had a population of 2,597 at the 2010 census.[7] The northwest side 
of Guilford is flanked by the Metacomet Ridge, a mountainous trap rock 
ridgeline that stretches from Long Island Sound to nearly the Vermont border. 
Notable features of the Metacomet ridge in Guilford include Totoket Mountain; 
its most notable peak, Bluff Head; and two eastern high points on the Totoket 
Mountain ridge named East Sugarloaf and West Sugarloaf. The 50-mile (80 km) 
Mattabesett Trail traverses Bluff Head; a shorter network of trails criss-cross 
the Sugarloaves. Guilford also contains the Westwoods Trail System which 
covers 39 miles (63 km) of trails on 1,200 acres (4.9 km2) of land. The 
Shore Line East train stops at Guilford station with service to Branford,
