Ryan Andrew Vogelsong (born July 22, 1977) is an American professional 
baseball pitcher who is a free agent. He has played in Major League Baseball 
(MLB) for the San Francisco Giants and Pittsburgh Pirates and in Nippon 
Professional Baseball (NPB) for the Hanshin Tigers (2007–2008) and Orix 
Buffaloes (2009). His career was revitalized as he established himself 
as a dominant force in the fifth spot in the Giants' 2011 rotation after 
Barry Zito was injured. He made the 2011 All-Star team, and in 2012 he 
posted a streak of 16 consecutive quality starts, allowing three earned 
runs or fewer in at least six innings each game. In four starts during 
the 2012 postseason, he recorded a 3–0 record with a 1.09 ERA, twice helping 
the Giants avoid elimination en route to their 2012 World Series title. 
In 2014, Vogelsong made a career-high 32 starts, helping the Giants win 
another title in the 2014 World Series. In 1995, Vogelsong graduated from 
Octorara Area High school in Atglen, Pennsylvania, where he played baseball, 
basketball, and soccer. He played Legion baseball in Oxford, Pennsylvania. 
He played his little league baseball for Highland in the Southern Chester 
County Midget League. He also played for Kutztown University in Kutztown, 
Pennsylvania, during the 1996–1998 seasons. He recorded 242 strikeouts 
and set nine school records in his three years at Kutztown. He was inducted 
into the university's Athletics Hall of Fame in 2005. Vogelsong was drafted 
by the Giants in the 5th round of the 1998 Major League Baseball draft. 
In 1998 he made his minor league debut with the Single A Salem-Keizer Volcanoes 
in Keizer, Oregon.[1] Vogelsong made his major league debut with the Giants 
on September 2, 2000. He finished the rest of the 2000 season by playing 
4 games with 6 innings in relief pitched. Vogelsong did not perform well 
to start the 2001 season as he went 0–5 and a 6.75 ERA in 15 games (2 started). 
Vogelsong was acquired by the Pirates on July 30, 2001, along with outfielder 
Armando Ríos, for pitcher Jason Schmidt and outfielder John Vander Wal. 
He appeared in two games for the Pirates before he required Tommy John 
surgery that kept him out of the majors until the end of the 2003 season. 
2004 marked Vogelsong's first full season in the major leagues. He spent 
most of the season as a starting pitcher and struggled in that role, ending 
the season with a 6–13 record and 6.50 ERA. He rebounded in 2005 after 
being moved to the bullpen, posting a 4.43 ERA and 2–2 record while being 
used primarily as a middle reliever. At the end of the 2006 season, Vogelsong 
had accumulated a career 10–22 record and a 5.86 ERA in 120 games and 315 
innings over parts of six seasons. Vogelsong signed for the Hanshin Tigers 
of Japan[2] in 2007 and made his Nippon Professional Baseball debut as 
their starting pitcher on April 5, 2007, facing a future Major League Baseball 
pitcher, Kenshin Kawakami. He won in his debut at the home stadium, Koshien 
Stadium, on April 12, 2007, hitting a home run in the bottom of the second 
inning.[3] Vogelsong signed a one-year deal to play for the Orix Buffaloes 
in 2009.[4] During the 2009–2010 off-season, Vogelsong made his way back 
to the MLB and signed a minor league deal with the Philadelphia Phillies. 
He appeared in 25 games for the AAA Lehigh Valley IronPigs, posting a 2–5 
record with a 4.91 ERA in 58.2 innings.[5] He was released by the Phillies 
on July 15, 2010. Vogelsong signed a minor league contract with the Los 
Angeles Angels of Anaheim on July 28, 2010. Vogelsong appeared in eight 
games for the AAA Salt Lake Bees, posting a 1–3 record with a 4.66 ERA 
in 36.2 innings pitched.[5] He was released after the season ended. In 
2011, Vogelsong signed a minor league contract to return to the San Francisco 
Giants with an invitation to spring training. He started the season in 
AAA Fresno, but on April 17, 2011, the Giants purchased his contract to 
replace the injured Barry Zito.[6] On April 28, 2011, after making two 
relief appearances, Vogelsong got his first start since the 2004 season 
against his former club, the Pirates. He held the host Pirates to two earned 
runs on four hits and struck out eight en route to a 5–2 Giants victory 
and his first MLB win since September 2005.[7][8] Vogelsong continued to 
excel in his replacement role, posting a record of 6–1 with a 2.17 ERA 
in the first half, which secured him a spot in San Francisco's vaunted 
starting rotation.[8][9] Giants and 2011 National League All-Star manager 
Bruce Bochy named Vogelsong to the 2011 NL All-Star Team on July 3, 2011.[10] 
He didn't see any action in the NL 5–1 win over the AL.[11] His first start 
after the All-Star break on July 18, 2011, a 5–0 win over the Los Angeles 
Dodgers, gave him enough innings pitched to qualify for the National League 
leader in ERA with 2.02.[12] In his final start of the season Vogelsong 
pitched seven shutout innings against the Colorado Rockies, giving up four 
hits and walking no batters. The 33-year-old Vogelsong finished his first 
MLB season as a starting pitcher since 2005 with a 13–7 record and a 2.71 
ERA, the lowest among the San Francisco starting rotation that boasted 
Tim Lincecum, Matt Cain, and Madison Bumgarner. Five of Vogelsong's seven 
losses occurred in a row, during a stretch where Vogelsong received three 
total runs of support, with no more than one run scored each game by a 
struggling San Francisco offense. During the month of August 2011, Vogelsong 
stated that playing winter ball in Venezuela in 2010 with Tiburones de 
La Guaira was the turning point to recover his career.[13] Prior to his 
experience in Venezuela, Vogelsong had 10 wins, 22 losses and 5.86 ERA 
in his MLB career In January, Vogelsong and the Giants agreed to an $8.3 
million, two-year contract.[14] Vogelsong continued to dominate in 2012. 
He boasted the lowest ERA in the National League at the All-Star Break 
and a 7–4 record.[15] Despite his impressive pitching, Vogelsong did not 
make the 2012 All-Star team, a decision Giants fans consider a major snub.[16] 
Vogelsong was the first ERA leader not to make the All-Star team since 
2001 (Josh Johnson had not pitched enough innings in 2006 to qualify for 
the ERA title). On August 3, 2012, Vogelsong's 16-game streak of allowing 
three or fewer runs per game was snapped by the Colorado Rockies when he 
allowed 4 runs while pitching 6.1 innings in a 16–4 Giants win. Vogelsong 
finished the regular season with a 14–9 record in 31 starts with a 3.37 
ERA. In the 2012 postseason, Vogelsong would play a pivotal role in the 
Giants push toward their 2012 World Series title. During Game 3 of the 
2012 National League Division Series in Cincinnati, with the Reds holding 
a commanding 2–0 lead in the series and the Giants facing elimination, 
Vogelsong pitched a tight game tied at one run through 5 innings. The Giants 
would go on to win Game 3, 2–1 in 10 innings on a Joaquin Arias ground 
ball mishandled by Scott Rolen allowing Buster Posey to score the winning 
run.[17] During Game 2 of the 2012 National League Championship Series 
in San Francisco, Vogelsong faced Chris Carpenter, with the Cardinals holding 
a 1–0 series lead. Vogelsong allowed 1 run in the 2nd inning to tie the 
game, but proceeded to shutout the Cardinals offense through seven innings 
en route to a 7–1 win at home and tie the series at one game a piece.[18] 
During Game 6 of the NLCS in San Francisco, Vogelsong and the Giants faced 
elimination for a fifth time. The Giants pitching began to dominate. Vogelsong 
had a very strong outing this time scattering five hits and allowing one 
run in the 6th inning after the Giants set the tempo with a four-run 2nd 
inning to break the game open and he created a new career-high 9 strikeouts 
on the night after he struck out Daniel Descalso with a foul tip. The Giants 
won the game 6–1 and pushed the NLCS to the limit in a magical Game 7 which 
they won to complete the comeback and advance to the World Series.[19] 
During Game 3 of the 2012 World Series in Detroit, the Giants held a surprising 
2–0 lead for the first time in the 2012 postseason. Vogelsong would have 
his strongest outing of the entire playoffs posting a shutout through 5.2 
innings. The Tigers threatened to open the scoring with the bases loaded 
and one out in the 5th inning, but Vogelsong struck out Quintin Berry and 
got Miguel Cabrera to pop out to end the threat. The Giants would go on 
to win Game 3, 2–0, and posted the first back-to-back shutouts since 1966.[20] 
The Giants went on to sweep the Detroit Tigers 4–0 to win the World Series. 
Vogelsong and Barry Zito were the only pitchers to go undefeated in the 
postseason amongst all Giants' starting pitchers. Vogelsong posted a 3–0 
record with a 1.09 ERA, allowing three runs through 24.2 innings, the lowest 
ERA among all Giants' starting pitchers. Vogelsong's postseason ERA was 
the best since Orel Hershiser's 1.05 in 1988 (minimum 24 innings). Vogelsong 
joined Christy Mathewson as the only pitchers to start their postseason 
careers with four consecutive starts of five or more innings giving up 
one run or fewer.[21] Vogelsong began 2013 as the #5 starter in the Giants 
rotation. His season didn't start out well, where in his first 9 starts, 
he went 2–4 with a 7.19 ERA and 1 quality start. In a start on May 20 against 
the Nationals, he was pitching 5 shutout innings when he came to bat against 
Craig Stammen, who hit him on the hand with a fastball, fracturing two 
bones and dislocating a joint.[22] Vogelsong missed almost 12 weeks before 
returning on August 9. He had a strong final two months, lowering his ERA 
by 1.46. In 19 starts in 2013, Vogelsong went 4–6 with a 5.73 ERA, striking 
out 67 in 103.2 innings. On November 4, Vogelsong had his $6.5 million 
club option declined, and instead was paid a $300,000 buyout. However, 
the Giants remained interested in negotiating a less-expensive deal with 
him.[23] Vogelsong agreed to a 1-year, $5 million contract on November 
29, 2013, pending the completion of a physical examination.[14][24] The 
deal was officially completed on December 4, 2013.[25] Vogelsong made a 
career-high 32 starts in 2014, finishing the season 8–13 with a 4.00 ERA, 
striking out 151 in 184.2 innings. During the postseason, Vogelsong started 
three games, and although he received no decision, the Giants went on to 
win each game.[26] Vogelsong won his second World Series ring as the Giants 
defeated the Kansas City Royals four games to three. On January 23, 2015, 
Vogelsong re-signed with the Giants on a one-year, $4 million contract.[27][28] 
On September 3, he hit his first career home run, a 2-run homer off Chris 
Rusin at Coors Field. On December 18, 2015, Vogelsong signed a one-year 
contract to return to the Pirates for the 2016 season.[29] On May 23, 2016, 
Vogelsong was hit in the face by a pitch from Colorado Rockies right-hander 
Jordan Lyles. He suffered damage to his left eye socket, including fractures 
to the orbital bone. He was subsequently placed on the 15-day disabled 
list.[30] Vogelsong throws a four-seam fastball, two-seam fastball, cut 
fastball, circle changeup, and curveball. His four seam sits in 90–93 mph. 
Vogelsong is married to Nicole Vogelsong, with whom he has one son, Ryder.[33]
