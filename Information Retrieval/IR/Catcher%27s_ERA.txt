Catcher's ERA or CERA in baseball statistics is the earned run average 
of the pitchers pitching when the catcher in question is catching. Its 
primary purpose is to measure a catcher's game-calling, rather than his 
effect on the opposing team's running game.[1] Craig Wright first described 
the concept of CERA in his 1989 book The Diamond Appraised.[2] With it, 
Wright developed a method of determining a catcher's effect on a team's 
pitching staff by comparing pitchers' performance when playing with different 
catchers.[2] However, Baseball Prospectus writer Keith Woolner found through 
statistical analysis of catcher performance that "catcher game-calling 
isn't a statistically significant skill".[2] Sabermetrician Bill James, 
too, performed research into CERA, finding that while it is possible that 
catchers may have a significant effect on a pitching staff, there is too 
much yearly variation in CERA for it to be a reliable indicator of ability.[1] 
James used simulations of catchers with assigned defensive values to directly 
compare CERAs, which influenced Woolner to perform similar simulations 
but instead using weighted events to calculate pitchers' runs per plate 
appearance.[1] Through this, Woolner concluded that even if catchers do 
have an effect on pitchers' abilities to prevent runs, it is undetectable 
and thus has no practical usage.[1] He also stated that "the hypothesis 
most consistent with the available facts appears to be that catchers do
