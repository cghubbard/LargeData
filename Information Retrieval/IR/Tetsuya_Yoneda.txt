also Human Tank.[1] Yoneda was inducted into the Japanese Baseball Hall 
of Fame in 2000. Yoneda attended Sakai High School.[2] He was signed out 
of high school by the Hanshin Tigers, but his selection was invalidated 
after Hankyu complained of an impropriety; he then signed with Hankyu.[1] 
Yoneda won 21 games at age 19, and 23 games at age 20 in 1958. That year 
he also tossed 11 shutouts, a Pacific League record that still stands.[1]
