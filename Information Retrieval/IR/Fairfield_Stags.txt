The Fairfield Stags are the athletic programs representing Fairfield University 
in Fairfield, Connecticut. Most of the programs are members of the Metro 
Atlantic Athletic Conference (MAAC) and classified as Division I-AAA in 
the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). Fairfield sponsors 
20 varsity sports - baseball, men's and women's basketball, men's and women's 
crew, men's and women's cross country, field hockey, men's and women's 
golf, men's and women's lacrosse, men's and women's soccer, softball, men's 
and women's swimming and diving, men's and women's tennis, and women's 
volleyball. Fairfield annually boasts among the best student-athlete graduation 
rates in the nation and has been honored by the NCAA with numerous Public 
Recognition Awards for the academic performance of sports teams among the 
top ten percent of squads in their respective sports nationwide. The men's 
and women's golf programs are both ranked among the best in the nation 
for academics, according to Golf Digest.[3] With the dawn of the first 
athletic team (cross country) in the fall of 1947, it became apparent that 
a nickname would be needed. For the 1947-48 season, Fairfield University 
adopted the "Men In Red" as its nickname. The following year, the University 
introduced men's basketball as its next team and its first varsity sport. 
With the start of varsity sports, the school put it to the students for 
input in naming of a school mascot. Two recommendations were made to the 
Board of Trustees for an official decision and vote. As the late Fr. Charles 
F. Duffy S.J. recounted: "As a member of the Board of Trustees, I remember 
voting at a board meeting late in 1948 on the naming for our athletic teams. 
We voted for Stags over Chanticleers!" What made the decision for the Board 
a bit easier and logical was the fact that the school was part of the Dioceses 
of Hartford and the word Hartford means stags (hart) and stream (ford). 
According to Webster's New World Dictionary the word "hart" means "A male 
of the European red deer; stag." As for the world "ford" Webster describes 
it as "A shallow place in a stream, river, etc." As a result, Fairfield 
University's seal itself was designed featuring a deer leaping over a tumbling 
brook to represent both the school's connection with the Dioceses as well 
with its close ties with nature. Fairfield is situated on a rolling, immensely 
wooded 200-acre (0.81 km2) campus overlooking Long Island Sound. The name 
fits well as a nickname because the Stag is a good jumper and it spirited 
and agile, as Fairfield would like all of its student-athletes to be. Fairfield 
University athletes are among the most academically successful in the nation, 
according to the NCAA's Academic Progress Rate (APR). In the past several 
years the NCAA has honored many Fairfield University sports teams for their 
academic performance with Public Recognition Awards. These teams posted 
multi-year APR scores in the top 10 percent of all squads in their respective 
sports nationwide.[4] The following Fairfield scholar-athletes were honored 
on the national level for their academic and athletic achievements: The 
Fairfield Stags men's baseball team competes in the Metro Atlantic Athletic 
Conference of NCAA Division I and plays their home games at the Alumni 
Baseball Diamond on the campus of Fairfield University. Fairfield fielded 
its first varsity baseball team in 1951, winning 7 of 12 games. The Stags, 
coached by Don Cook, made the first of three straight trips to the ECAC 
New England Tournament in 1977, defeating defending champion University 
of Maine. The team was MAAC South Champions in 1983, 1991, 1993, 1995 and

and slugging percentage; and Mike Pike was named a 1993 Mizuno Freshman 
All-American.[5] Keefe Cato, the holder of ten Fairfield pitching records 
including seven career shutouts and one no-hitter, was the first Fairfield 
athlete to play in a major professional sport on the major league level 
after being selected by the Cincinnati Reds in the second round of the 
1979 Major League Baseball Draft. He was the Reds’ winning pitcher in his 
second game.[6] And Rob Gariano, who surpassed Cato's 31 year stand as 
Fairfield’s all-time strikeout leader with 293 strikeouts was drafted in 
the 36th round of the 2010 Major League Baseball Draft by the San Diego 
Padres.[7] The Stags are currently coached by 2012 MAAC Coach of the Year
