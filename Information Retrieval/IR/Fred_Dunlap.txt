As Player As Manager Frederick C. "Sure Shot" Dunlap (May 21, 1859 â€“ December 
1, 1902) was a second baseman and manager in Major League Baseball from 
1880 to 1891. He was the highest paid player in Major League Baseball from 
1884 to 1889. He has also been rated by some contemporary and modern sources 
as the greatest overall second baseman of the 19th century. He earned the 
nickname "Sure Shot" for the strength and accuracy of his throws to first 
base, and was also sometimes referred to in the 1880s as the "King of Second 
Basemen." He played for the Cleveland Blues from 1880 to 1883, where he 
secured his reputation as one of the best players in the game. As a rookie 
in 1880, he led the National League in doubles and ranked second in extra 
base hits. While playing for Cleveland, he also compiled batting averages 
of .325 and .326 in 1881 and 1883 and led the league in assists by a second 
baseman and range factor. When the Union Association was formed in 1884, 
Dunlap was lured to play for the St. Louis Maroons where he became the 
highest paid player in baseball. His .412 batting average in 1884 was the 
highest ever recorded to that time in Major League Baseball and 56 points 
higher than any other player in the major leagues in 1884 due to the lack 
of talent. After three years in St. Louis, Dunlap was sold to the Detroit 
Wolverines and helped that team win the 1887 National League pennant. Dunlap's 
baseball career ended in 1891 when he broke his leg sliding into a base. 
He went into the construction business and bet on the horses in the 1890s. 
By 1902, Dunlap was penniless and living in a rundown boarding house. He 
died of "consumption of the bowels" in December 1902, and his body was 
unidentified until a policeman at the morgue recognized his body as that 
of the former baseball star. Dunlap was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, 
in 1859. Both of his parents died when he was age 10. Dunlap did not attend 
school after his parents died and spent his youth playing baseball.[1] 
Lacking formal education, Dunlap remained illiterate throughout his life.[2] 
Dunlap began playing semi-pro baseball at age 15 in 1874 for the Gloucester 
Club in Gloucester City, New Jersey. In 1875, he started the season with 
the Greighers of Camden, New Jersey, then joined the Kleinz Club of Philadelphia. 
He played for Chester at the start of the 1876 season before joining the 
Quicksteps of Wilmington, Delaware, as a pitcher.[3] In 1877, he began 
playing professional baseball as a second baseman for the Auburns of Auburn, 
New York. In 1878, he played for teams in Hornellsville and Albany, New 
York. He remained with Albany in 1879.[4][5] In May 1880, Dunlap began 
a 12-year career in Major League Baseball with the Cleveland Blues. In 
his first season, Dunlap immediately established himself as one of the 
game's best players. For the 1880 season, Dunlap led the National League 
in doubles (27) and ranked second in extra base hits (40) and times on 
base (132) while serving as the team's leadoff hitter.[6][7] He also made 
a strong debut on defense, leading the National League in assists by a 
second baseman (290). Dunlap remained with the Cleveland Blues for four 
seasons and consistently ranked as one of the leading hitters and defensive 
second basemen in the National League. In 1881, he compiled 156 total bases, 
the second most in the National League, and had a .325 batting average 
and .444 slugging percentage, ranking fifth in the National League in both 
categories. In 1882, he led the National League's second basemen with 297 
assists and a range factor of 6.73.[6] In his final year in Cleveland, 
Dunlap had a .326 batting average, .361 on-base percentage, and .452 slugging 
percentage, ranking among the league's leaders in each of those categories. 
Defensively, he led the league's second basemen in putouts (304) and ranked 
third in assists (290) and fielding percentage (.911).[6] Dunlap was the 
star of the Cleveland team in the early 1880s. So key was he to the Blues 
that one writer observed, "The Maroons without Dunlap are like the play 
of Hamlet without the melancholy Dane."[8] Dunlap was known during his 
baseball career by the nicknames "Sure Shot" and "King of Second Basemen".[2][9][10] 
Most accounts indicate that the "Sure Shot" nickname arose from Dunlap's 
powerful and accurate throws to first base.[11] King Kelly reportedly gave 
Dunlap the "Sure Shot" nickname after watching him throw.[1] One account 
described Dunlap's throwing prowess as follows: "[E]ndless practice made 
him adept as a monkey at grabbing a sizzling ground ball in either hand 
and firing it off from the very spot he seized it. His whistling throws, 
which seemed to clear the grass by no more than half a foot, never seemed 
to lose more than an inch or two."[2] Alfred Henry Spink, who saw Dunlap 
play, wrote that Dunlap could chase down a ball in the outfield and throw 
it to home plate "with such fearful speed and accuracy that the ball seemed 
to sing as it flew."[1] Dunlap was known for his range in getting to balls 
that others of his era could not, and he was reportedly able to dive for 
a ball and throw while lying on the ground with enough velocity to sting 
the first baseman's hand.[2] Dunlap was ambidextrous and was able to catch 
and throw a baseball with the same skill and accuracy with either hand. 
Moreover, Dunlap reportedly never wore a glove.[1] One source gives an 
entirely different account of how Dunlap obtained the "Sure Shot" nickname. 
In his book on the history of the home run, Mark Ribowsky wrote that the 
nickname dated back to a game against the Chicago White Stockings on July 
10, 1880. The White Stockings had won 21 straight games until Dunlap hit 
a walk-off two-run home run in the bottom of the ninth inning. According 
to Ribowsky, "For this Shot Heard 'Round Cleveland, Dunlap won the nickname 
'Sure Shot.'"[12] In November 1883, Dunlap signed a contract to play for 
the St. Louis Maroons in the new Union Association. He was the biggest 
star lured to the new league. His contract paid Dunlap a salary of $3,400 
(including $1,000 paid in advance),[13] the highest salary paid to any 
baseball player at that time.[4] He remained the highest paid baseball 
player every year from 1884 to 1889.[14] Dunlap played second base for 
the St. Louis Maroons from 1884 to 1886 and also served as the team's manager 
for portions of those seasons. During the 1884 season, the Maroons and 
Dunlap dominated the Union Association. The team compiled a record of 94-19, 
and Dunlap led the new league in most significant offensive and defensive 
categories. His .412 batting average was 56 points higher than any other 
player in the Union Association, the National League, or the American Association. 
He also led the league in on-base percentage (.448), slugging percentage 
(.621), runs scored (160), hits (185), total bases (279), home runs (13), 
extra base hits (60), assists by a second baseman (300), putouts by a second 
baseman (341), range factor at second base (6.41), and fielding percentage 
at second base (.926).[6] Dunlap's .412 batting average in 1884 was the 
highest ever recorded in any of the major leagues up to that time.[15] 
His 160 runs scored in 1884 remains one of the highest single-season totals 
in major league history.[4] Some baseball historians have suggested that 
Dunlap's accomplishments during the 1884 season should be discounted due 
to the lesser talent pool in the Union Association.[16] In 1885, the Union 
Association was disbanded after only one year, and the St. Louis Maroons 
joined the National League. Although his batting average dropped 142 points 
to .270 in 1885, Dunlap continued to be one of the best defensive second 
basemen in the major leagues. He led the National League's second basemen 
in 1885 with a .934 fielding percentage and ranked second in assists (374), 
putouts (314), and range factor (6.49).[6] Dunlap spent a third season 
with the Maroons in 1886, and hit for the cycle on May 24. However, the 
Maroons were in financial distress, and rumors spread that the team might 
disband.[17] In early August 1886, Dunlap was sold to the Detroit Wolverines 
for $4,700, the most expensive purchase price at the time.[17][18][19] 
In addition to the sum paid to the Maroons to grant the release, the Detroit 
team signed a contract to pay Dunlap $4,500 a season for two seasons, with 
an advance of $1,500 on the first day of November 1886 and 1887, respectively.[17] 
The mid-season sale led to concerns about the Maroons: "The transfer of 
Dunlap to Detroit is a small thing in itself, but its bearing on the entire 
base ball world is so great as to almost revolutionize the present order 
of things. He was the king pin of the St. Louis Club and his sale makes 
a certainty of the dissolution of the Maroons."[20] The Detroit management 
was praised for their "pluck and enterprise" in making the bold "business 
stroke."[20] The Sporting News wrote at the time: "Dunlap has joined the 
Detroits and now that team will fly the League pennant just as sure as 
time flies and the world grows. From the day the old St. Louis Union team 
went out of existence Dunlap has been anything but a favorite in St. Louis. 
Still there was no one in the world but was willing to concede that he 
was the greatest second baseman America has ever known."[21] Dunlap, too, 
expressed delight at the move, noting that he had "tried for two seasons 
to get away from the Maroons."[20] While the reaction to the acquisition 
was overwhelmingly positive in Detroit, the Detroit Free Press expressed 
some concern over Dunlap's reputation as a "disorganizer" and "mischief 
maker."[17] For the 1886 season, Dunlap led the National League with a 
career high 393 assists, more than any National League player at any position. 
In 1887, Dunlap's defensive play at second base helped lead the Detroit 
Wolverines to the National League pennant with a record of 79-45. Dunlap 
again led the National League's second basemen in fielding percentage (.948) 
while also ranking second in range factor (6.72).[6] He also played in 
11 games of the 1887 World Series against the American Association champions, 
the St. Louis Browns. Detroit won the series 10 games to 5. At the end 
of the 1887 season, Sporting Life praised Dunlap's contributions to Detroit's 
championship team: "Dunlap is the king of second basemen, and a first-class 
all-round player. His fielding average in 1886 was .931, ranking third. 
This season he ranks first, with .949. ... Dunlap is one of the most active 
men on the field, and is of great value to a team on account of his ability 
as a kicker and coacher."[3] Before the last game of the World Series had 
been played, rumors spread that Detroit (which had amassed an all-star 
lineup with a commensurate payroll) was in negotiations to unload Dunlap's 
high salary by selling him to Pittsburgh.[22] Dunlap announced in November 
1887 that he would not consent unless the Detroit club paid him half of 
the sum it was to receive from Pittsburgh to secure his release. He said 
at the time, "I am sick and tired of being sold without gaining anything 
by it, and it is about time that my bank account was benefited by these 
transfers."[23] He told a reporter for The New York Times that he was not 
penniless and would refuse to play unless his demands were met. He told 
the reporter that the Detroit club had three choices -- "give me half of 
the money secured for my release, allow me to go where I please, or fulfill 
the contract made with me last year."[23] In January 1888, Dunlap finally 
consented to the sale and received $2,000 of the $5,000 sales price paid 
to Detroit.[24] His total annual compensation on signing with Pittsburgh 
was $6,000, making him the highest paid player in baseball history to that 
time.[25] The Detroit Free Press congratulated the "cranks" of Pittsburgh 
for their team's acquisition of "no less than the king second baseman of 
the country."[26] Dunlap played for the Pittsburgh Alleghenies from 1888 
to 1890, and served as manager of the Alleghenies for a portion of the 
1889 season. During his three years in Pittsburgh, Dunlap's offensive performance 
declined. His batting average for the Alleghenies went from .262 in 1888 
to .235 in 1889. At the same time, he remained one of the leading defensive 
second basemen in the game. In 1888, Dunlap ranked second among the league's 
second basemen in fielding percentage (.940) and range factor (6.33), and 
in 1889, Dunlap's last full season in the major leagues, his .950 fielding 
percentage led the National League and was a career high for Dunlap.[6] 
Before the start of the 1890 season, Dunlap engaged in protracted salary 
negotiations with President Nimick of the Alleghenies. In late March 1890, 
the Pittsburg Dispatch reported that the two sides had reached a resolution, 
"and it now seems certain that Dunlap will play his old position in the 
Pittsburg league club."[27] Nimick said at the time: "I had a long talk 
with Mr. Dunlap, and we agreed to terms for him to play with us this season. 
Of course the terms were below those of last year, that is, he will play 
for much less than $5,000. He did not sign a contract, for reasons that 
were quite satisfactory to me ... We know he is a good player and he is 
quite willing to remain with us."[27] In the first 17 games of the 1890 
season, Dunlap's batting average fell to .172, and as a result he was released 
by the Alleghenies on May 15. Aside from his batting average, disagreements 
with Pittsburgh's manager, Guy Hecker, reportedly contributed to the decision. 
The Pittsburgh Dispatch quoted manager Hecker as saying, "Dunlap is certainly 
the worst man to get along with that I ever met. He has had everybody in 
hot water during our entire western trip."[28] Others speculated that Dunlap's 
release was motivated by his $3,500 salary and the fact that Pittsburgh's 
backup second baseman, Henry Youngman, had signed for a salary of only 
$1,050.[28] Dunlap jumped to the New York Giants of the Players' League 
in late May 1890.[6] At the time, the Washington correspondent for Sporting 
Life predicted that Dunlap would bring bad luck to his new team. He wrote: 
"Fred is a great player, but the hoo-doo that seems to shadow him will 
make itself felt wherever he may go. There are a number of people in this 
vicinity who have watched his course with more than ordinary interest, 
and they do not hesitate to declare him a Jonah."[29] Dunlap appeared in 
only one game for the Giants and announced in July that he would play no 
more in 1890 and that he would spend the remainder of the summer at Atlantic 
City, New Jersey, with plans to return in 1891 "and play the game of his 
life."[30] Dunlap concluded his baseball career in 1891 with the Washington 
Statesmen in the American Association. He appeared in only eight games 
for the Statesmen before breaking his leg sliding into a base on April 
20, 1891.[6][9] In early June 1891, the Washington management notified 
him that it would discontinue his salary payments. Dunlap returned the 
notice and filed a grievance, contending he should have been continued 
at least on half pay since he was disabled while sliding into a base. Washington 
refused to pay, and he never played professional baseball again.[31] When 
he retired from baseball, Dunlap was reported to have $100,000 in savings. 
He went into the building business in Philadelphia during the 1890s, and 
owned various properties in the city.[2][10] The Sporting Life reported 
that Dunlap "dropped out of the game in 1892 to follow the racing game, 
at which he lost the respectable fortune he accumulated in base ball."[32] 
Another account indicated that Dunlap lost everything on stock market investments.[25] 
In July 1902, the Philadelphia Times reported that Dunlap was "clean broke."[33] 
In December 1902, Dunlap died penniless and alone at age 43. According 
to the Sporting Life, the "last two years of his life were spent in abject 
poverty and mental gloom" in a Philadelphia boarding house.[32] According 
to several accounts, a policeman at the morgue saw the body and believed 
it to be Dunlap. Lave Cross was called to the morgue and confirmed that 
the body was Dunlap.[2][34] His funeral was poorly attended by his former 
baseball colleagues, and one former player who did attend observed, "There 
were not enough friends of Dunlap at his funeral to bury him and we had 
to call on the hack drivers to make up the list of active pall-bearers."[1] 
Following Dunlap's death, William A. Phelon, Jr., editor of Sporting Life 
wrote: "So Fred Dunlap has passed into the great beyond, and the man whose 
salary figure marked the high-water limit of the long ago is gone! ... 
What a ball player this Dunlap was and what an artist in getting the fat 
salaries! ... Dunlap was a real infielder of the type so popular ten years 
ago -- one of the solid, bulky style through whom no grounder seemed able 
to pass, but who could nevertheless wave the hot ones goodbye with graceful 
ease when occasion demanded. With the gloves now in use to aid, Dunny would 
have been even a bigger wonder now than then."[35] Dunlap has been rated 
by some contemporary and modern sources as the greatest overall second 
baseman of the 19th century. In his 1910 book on the history of baseball, 
Alfred Henry Spink, the founder of The Sporting News, was unequivocal: 
"I have seen all the great second basemen ... I am free to say that Dunlap 
was far and away the greatest second baseman that ever lived."[1] Stanley 
Robinson, who owned and managed major league teams in St. Louis and Cleveland, 
went even further: "He was not only the greatest second baseman, but take 
him in all the departments of the game, he was perhaps the greatest player 
that ever lived."[1] Another of Dunlap's contemporaries, Sam Crane, also 
picked Dunlap as the greatest second baseman in a newspaper column published 
in 1912. Crane wrote: "Fred Dunlap was acknowledged to be the best second 
baseman of his day, and was excellent from every angle. I think he excelled 
Fred Pfeffer."[36] In 1910, John Montgomery Ward, a Hall of Fame inductee 
who played from 1878 to 1894, published an article about the greatest infielders 
in baseball history. While picking Fred Pfeffer as a shade better than 
Dunlap", Ward observed: "Fred Dunlap was the king. Dunlap had the record 
average of .953 in 64 games with the Detroit club in 1887, and was the 
personification of ease and grace. He was something of a grandstand player, 
because of his tendency to make one-handed catches and stops but he got 
there just the same and was a big favorite wherever he showed."[37] In 
a 2008 book using modern sabermetric methods, author William F. McNeil 
concluded that Dunlap was the best offensive second baseman, the second 
best defensive second baseman, and the best overall second baseman of the 
19th century.[11] Dunlap's career range factor of 6.31 at second base still 
ranks as the fifth highest in the history of Major League Baseball.[38] 
However, Bill James, in his 2001 book The New Bill James Historical Baseball 
Abstract, ranked Dunlap as the 89th greatest second baseman of all time 
(and the 8th best of those who played the majority of their careers in 
the 19th century). James wrote that Dunlap was "never a legitimate star 
in a legitimate major league, but a good second baseman and a .275 hitter."[39]
