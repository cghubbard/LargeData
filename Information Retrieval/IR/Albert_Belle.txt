Albert Jojuan Belle (born August 25, 1966) is a former American Major League 
Baseball outfielder for the Cleveland Indians, Chicago White Sox, and Baltimore 
Orioles. Standing at 6 feet 2 inches (1.88 m) and weighing 225 pounds (102 kg), 
Belle was one of the leading sluggers of his time, and in 1995 became the 
first and still only player to ever hit 50 doubles and 50 home runs in 
a single season. He was also the first player to break the 10-million-dollar 
per year compensation contract in Major League Baseball. Belle was also 
considered a model of consistency, compiling a .295 career batting average, 
and averaging 37 home runs and 120 RBIs a season between 1991 and 2000. 
Belle is also one of only six players in MLB history to have nine consecutive 
100-RBI seasons. However, his combative personality, marked by occasional 
angry outbursts, created a reputation that was intimidating to those who 
covered him in the news media. Albert and his fraternal twin, Terry, were 
born on August 25, 1966, in Shreveport, Louisiana, the son of Albert Belle 
Sr., a high school baseball and football coach, and Carrie Belle, a former 
math teacher. A former Boy Scout, he attained the rank of Eagle Scout. 
Belle attended Huntington High School in Shreveport, where he was a star 
baseball and football player, a member of the National Honor Society and 
vice president of the local Future Business Leaders of America. He also 
played little league baseball with future PGA Tour player David Toms. He 
graduated sixth in his high school class and made the all-state baseball 
team twice. In 1984, he was selected to play for the USA in the Junior 
Olympics, in which the U.S. won a silver medal. He played outfield and 
pitched, winning one game. After graduation, Belle was offered many football 
and baseball scholarships, including one to the University of Notre Dame; 
he was also offered an appointment to the United States Air Force Academy. 
However, Belle decided to stay close to home, and accepted a baseball scholarship 
to Louisiana State University. Belle played college baseball at Louisiana 
State University from 1985 to 1987, where he made 1st team All-SEC in 1986 
and 1987 and played in 184 games, with 585 at bats, 194 hits, 30 doubles, 
49 home runs, 172 runs batted in, 157 runs, a .670 slugging percentage, 
and a .332 batting average. After college, he was drafted by the Cleveland 
Indians. Belle was an intimidating presence at the plate; and well known 
for wearing an intense glare. He became the fourth player to have eight 
straight seasons of 30 home runs and 100 RBI, joining Babe Ruth, Jimmie 
Foxx and Lou Gehrig (a feat since matched by Albert Pujols and Alex Rodriguez). 
As a fielder he had a powerful throwing arm, unsurprising given that he 
was a gifted pitcher in high school. His range factor by games played was 
consistently higher than the major league average range factor at that 
position;[1] nevertheless, he still managed to accrue a -12.5 defensive 
WAR during 12 major league seasons.[2] He was an accomplished baserunner 
and base stealer, with a career high of 23 steals in 1993, and a surprising 
17 steals in 1999 despite hip problems. He led the league three times in 
RBIs, three times in total bases, three times in extra-base hits and twice 
in slugging. He was a five-time All-Star between 1993 and 1997. Notably, 
Albert Belle's career highs in home runs, RBI, batting average, runs scored 
and walks occurred in five separate seasons. In 2006, the Hardball Times 
published a statistical comparison of Belle's career statistics with that 
of 60 of his current and former peers. The article ranked him in career 
"prime value", behind current Hall of Famer Ralph Kiner and recent inductee 
Frank Thomas.[3] In 1994, he lost the batting title to New York Yankees 
outfielder Paul O'Neill, .359 to .357. His postseason record was limited 
to two heavy-hitting appearances, in which only his batting average suffered: 
he hit .230/.405/.557 (batting average, on-base percentage and slugging 
percentage, respectively) with six home runs and 14 RBIs in 61 at-bats. 
In 1995, he became the first player in major league history to hit 50 home 
runs and 50 doubles in the same season; the last player before him to reach 
as many as 40 in both categories had been Willie Stargell in 1973. The 
achievement was especially impressive because Belle played only 143 games 
in 1995 due to a season shortened by the previous year's player strike. 
The 40–40 mark has been surpassed since, most recently by Chris Davis in 
2013, but Belle's 50–50 combo remains unique. His reputation, and more 
specifically his disdain of the media, cost him votes for the 1995 MVP 
Award The fact that he was caught cheating the year before, in the infamous 
1994 Bat Burglary, didn't help his cause either. He finished second in 
the media voting to the Boston Red Sox' Mo Vaughn even though he led the 
American League that season in runs scored, home runs, RBIs, slugging percentage 
and total bases, and outpaced Vaughn head-to-head in every important offensive 
category except RBI (both men had 126); both players' teams reached the 
playoffs. This was in the middle of a three-year streak in which Belle 
finished 3rd, 2nd and 3rd for the American League MVP. Belle had two other 
top ten MVP finishes, in 1993 (7th) and 1998 (8th). In the winter of 1996, 
he signed a 5-year, $55 million ($81,211,650 today) deal with the Chicago 
White Sox as a free agent. This contract made him the highest paid player 
in baseball for a brief period.[4] He enjoyed two great seasons in Chicago, 
including a career-high 27-game hitting streak in May 1997, and came close 
to another 50/50 season in 1998 with 49 home runs (a White Sox team record 
that still stands) and 48 doubles. He also drove in 152 runs to break Zeke 
Bonura's single-season franchise record of 138 in 1936 (to date, the RBI 
total also remains a White Sox single-season record). Additionally, when 
Cal Ripken, Jr. ended his record consecutive game streak at 2,632 in September 
1998 on the last day of the season, it was Belle who took over as the major 
leagues' active leader in the category. His White Sox contract had an unusual 
clause allowing him to demand that he would remain one of the three highest 
paid players in baseball. In October 1998 he invoked the clause, and when 
the White Sox declined to give him a raise he immediately became a free 
agent. He again became the game's highest paid player, signing a five-year, 
$65 million ($92,488,014 today) deal with the Baltimore Orioles. But his 
career ended just two seasons later when he was forced into retirement 
at age 34 by degenerative hip osteoarthritis. He was, however, kept on 
Baltimore's active 40-man roster for the next three years as a condition 
of the insurance policy which largely reimbursed the Orioles for the remainder 
of his contract. Belle homered in the final at-bat of his major-league 
career, at Oriole Park at Camden Yards on October 1, 2000.[5] Belle was 
suspended in 1994 for using a corked bat, and gained further notoriety 
for sending teammate Jason Grimsley through the building's ceiling panel 
to break into the locked umpires' dressing room to retrieve his corked 
bat and substitute it with another teammate's bat, resulting in a seven-game 
suspension. The revelation of Belle's use of corked bats was given more 
emphasis when Cleveland teammate Omar Vizquel wrote in his autobiography 
that it would be naive to suggest otherwise and that "...all of Albert's 
bats were corked."[6] He was fined in 1996 for knocking down Brewers infielder 
Fernando Viña, who had blocked his way between bases. He also had unpleasant 
interactions with the public, once chasing down rowdy trick-or-treating 
vandals who were celebrating Halloween by throwing eggs at his home, hitting 
one of the vandals with his car.[7] Sports reporters resented Belle's refusal 
to grant interviews before a game. A profane outburst directed at a group 
of reporters in his team's dugout, including NBC Sports personality Hannah 
Storm, was widely reported during the 1995 World Series. He was unrepentant 
afterward: "The Indians wanted me to issue a statement of regret when the 
fine was announced, but I told them to take it out. I apologize for nothing."[8] 
Eventually, Belle routinely refused to speak with the media. "I don't get 
excited talking about myself", he explained. "Guys such as Sandy Koufax, 
Joe DiMaggio and Steve Carlton did not interview, and it was no big deal. 
They were quiet. I am also quiet. I just want to concentrate on baseball. 
Why does everyone want to hear me talk, anyway?"[9] But the media did not 
ignore him. Buster Olney, then of The New York Times, would write about 
his outbursts as a Cleveland Indian: In 2001, following his retirement, 
the New York Daily News' columnist Bill Madden wrote: In his first year 
of Hall of Fame eligibility (2006), he garnered only 7.7% of the baseball 
writers' votes, missing election by an extremely wide margin.[12] But his 
vote total was high enough to keep his name on the ballot for the following 
year. In 2007, however, he garnered only 19 votes (3.5%). In retirement, 
Belle had his first encounter with the Cleveland Indians since leaving 
the club in 1996, during their 2012 spring training in Goodyear, Arizona 
and was joined by former teammates Kenny Lofton, Sandy Alomar, Jr., and 
Carlos Baerga.[7] Belle has had a chilly relationship with the Indians 
franchise during his retirement. He declined to attend the 20th anniversary 
celebration of the 1995 World Series team and he declined to attend the 
ceremony when he was inducted in to the Indians team Hall of Fame. [13]
