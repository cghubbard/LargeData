A lawn is an area of soil-covered land planted with grasses or (rarely) 
other durable plants such as clover which are maintained at a short height 
with a lawnmower and used for aesthetic and recreational purposes. Common 
characteristics of a lawn are that it is composed only of grass species, 
it is subject to weed and pest control, it is subject to practices aimed 
at maintaining its green color (e.g., watering), and it is regularly mowed 
to ensure an acceptable length,[1] although these characteristics are not 
binding as a definition. Lawns are used around houses, apartments, commercial 
buildings and offices. Many city parks also have large lawn areas. In recreational 
contexts, the specialised names turf, pitch, field or green may be used, 
depending on the sport and the continent. The term "lawn", referring to 
a managed grass space, dates to no earlier than the 16th century. Tied 
to suburban expansion and the creation of the household aesthetic, the 
lawn is an important aspect of the interaction between the natural environment 
and the constructed urban and suburban space.[2] In many suburban areas, 
there are bylaws in place requiring houses to have lawns and requiring 
the proper maintenance of these lawns. In some jurisdictions where there 
are water shortages, local government authorities are encouraging alternatives 
to lawns to reduce water use. Lawn is a cognate of llan which is derived 
from the Common Brittonic word landa (Old French: launde) that originally 
means heath, barren land, or clearing.[3][4] Lawns may have originated 
as grassed enclosures within early medieval settlements used for communal 
grazing of livestock, as distinct from fields reserved for agriculture. 
The word "laune" is first attested in 1540,[5] and is likely related to 
the Celtic Brythonic word lan/llan/laun, which has the meaning of enclosure, 
often in relation to a place of worship. Lawns became popular with the 
aristocracy in northern Europe from the Middle Ages onward. The early lawns 
were not always distinguishable from pasture fields. It is speculated that 
the association between the word "pasture" and biblical mentions made lawns 
a cultural affinity for some[citation needed]. The damp climate of maritime 
Western Europe in the north made lawns possible to grow and manage. They 
were not a part of gardens in other regions and cultures of the world until 
contemporary influence[clarification needed].[6] Before the invention of 
mowing machines in 1830, lawns were managed very differently. They were 
an element of wealthy estates and manor houses, and in some places were 
maintained by the labor-intensive methods of scything and shearing. In 
most situations, they were also pasture land maintained through grazing 
by sheep or other livestock. Areas of grass grazed regularly by rabbits, 
horses or sheep over a long period often form a very low, tight sward similar 
to a modern lawn. This was the original meaning of the word "lawn", and 
the term can still be found in place names. Some forest areas where extensive 
grazing is practiced still have these seminatural lawns. For example, in 
the New Forest, England, such grazed areas are common, and are known as 
lawns, for example Balmer Lawn. Lawns similar to those of today first appeared 
in France and England in the 1700s when André Le Nôtre designed the gardens 
of Versailles that included a small area of grass called the tapis vert, 
or "green carpet". It was not until the 17th and 18th century that the 
garden and the lawn became a place created first as walkways and social 
areas. They were made up of meadow plants, such as camomile, a particular 
favorite. In the early 17th century, the Jacobean epoch of gardening began; 
during this period, the closely cut "English" lawn was born. By the end 
of this period, the English lawn was a symbol of status of the aristocracy 
and gentry; it showed that the owner could afford to keep land that was 
not being used for a building, or for food production. In the early 18th 
century, landscape gardening for the aristocracy entered a golden age, 
under the direction of William Kent and Lancelot "Capability" Brown. They 
refined the English landscape garden style with the design of natural, 
or "romantic", estate settings for wealthy Englishmen.[7] Brown, remembered 
as "England's greatest gardener", designed over 170 parks, many of which 
still endure. His influence was so great that the contributions to the 
English garden made by his predecessors Charles Bridgeman and William Kent 
are often overlooked.[8] His work still endures at Croome Court (where 
he also designed the house), Blenheim Palace, Warwick Castle, Harewood 
House, Bowood House, Milton Abbey (and nearby Milton Abbas village), in 
traces at Kew Gardens and many other locations.[9] His style of smooth 
undulating lawns which ran seamlessly to the house and meadow, clumps, 
belts and scattering of trees and his serpentine lakes formed by invisibly 
damming small rivers, were a new style within the English landscape, a 
"gardenless" form of landscape gardening, which swept away almost all the 
remnants of previous formally patterned styles. His landscapes were fundamentally 
different from what they replaced, the well-known formal gardens of England 
which were criticised by Alexander Pope and others from the 1710s.[10] 
The open "English style" of parkland first spread across Britain and Ireland, 
and then across Europe, such as the garden à la française being replaced 
by the French landscape garden. By this time, the word "lawn" in England 
had semantically shifted to describe a piece of a garden covered with grass 
and closely mown.[11] Wealthy families in America during the late 18th 
century also began mimicking English landscaping styles. In 1780, the Shaker 
community began the first industrial production of high-quality grass seed 
in North America, and a number of seed companies and nurseries were founded 
in Philadelphia. The increased availability of these grasses meant they 
were in plentiful supply for parks and residential areas, not just livestock.[11] 
Thomas Jefferson has long been given credit for being the first person 
to attempt an English-style lawn at his estate, Monticello, in 1806, but 
many others had tried to emulate English landscaping before he did. Over 
time, an increasing number towns in New England began to emphasize grass 
spaces. Many scholars link this development to the romantic and transcendentalist 
movements of the 19th century. These green commons were also heavily associated 
with the success of the Revolutionary War and often became the homes of 
patriotic war memorials after the Civil War ended in 1865.[11] Before the 
mechanical lawnmower, the upkeep of lawns was possible only for the extremely 
wealthy estates and manor houses of the aristocracy. Labor-intensive methods 
of scything and shearing the grass were required to maintain the lawn in 
its correct state, and most of the land in England was required for more 
functional, agricultural purposes. This all changed with the invention 
of the lawnmower by Edwin Beard Budding in 1830. Budding had the idea for 
a lawnmower after seeing a machine in a local cloth mill which used a cutting 
cylinder (or bladed reel) mounted on a bench to trim the irregular nap 
from the surface of woollen cloth and give a smooth finish.[12] Budding 
realised that a similar device could be used to cut grass if the mechanism 
was mounted in a wheeled frame to make the blades rotate close to the lawn's 
surface. His mower design was to be used primarily to cut the lawn on sports 
grounds and extensive gardens, as a superior alternative to the scythe, 
and he was granted a British patent on 31 August 1830.[13] In an agreement 
between John Ferrabee and Edwin Budding, Ferrabee paid the costs of development 
and acquired rights to manufacture, sell and license other manufacturers 
in the production of lawn mowers. Budding went into partnership with a 
local engineer, John Ferrabee, and together they made mowers in a factory 
at Thrupp near Stroud.[14] They allowed other companies to build copies 
of their mower under license, the most successful of these, was Ransomes, 
Sims & Jefferies of Ipswich which began mower production as early as 1832.[15] 
However, his model had two crucial drawbacks. It was immensely heavy (it 
was made of cast iron) and difficult to manoeuvre in the garden, and did 
not cut the grass very well. The blade would often spin above the grass 
uselessly.[15] It took ten more years and further innovations, including 
the advent of the Bessemer process for the production of the much lighter 
alloy steel and advances in motorization such as the drive chain, for the 
lawnmower to become a practical proposition. Middle-class families across 
the country, in imitation of aristocratic landscape gardens, began to grow 
finely trimmed lawns in their back gardens. In the 1850s, Thomas Green 
of Leeds introduced a revolutionary mower design called the Silens Messor 
(meaning silent cutter), which used a chain to transmit power from the 
rear roller to the cutting cylinder. The machine was much lighter and quieter 
than the gear driven machines that preceded them, and won first prize at 
the first lawn mower trial at the London Horticultural Gardens.[15] Thus 
began a great expansion in the lawn mower production in the 1860s. James 
Sumner of Lancashire patented the first steam-powered lawn mower in 1893.[16] 
Around 1900, Ransomes' Automaton, available in chain- or gear-driven models, 
dominated the British market. In 1902, Ransomes produced the first commercially 
available mower powered by an internal combustion gasoline engine. JP Engineering 
of Leicester, founded after World War I, invented the first riding mowers. 
This went hand-in-hand with a booming consumer market for lawns from the 
1860s onward. With the increasing popularity of sports in the mid-Victorian 
period, the lawn mower was used to craft modern-style sporting ovals, playing 
fields, pitches and grass courts for the nascent sports of football, lawn 
bowls, lawn tennis and others.[17] The rise of Suburbanisation in the interwar 
period was heavily influenced by the garden city movement of Ebenezer Howard 
and the creation of the first garden suburbs at the turn of the 20th century.[18] 
The garden suburb, developed through the efforts of social reformer Henrietta 
Barnett and her husband, exemplified the incorporation of the well manicured 
lawn into suburban life.[19] Suburbs dramatically increased in size. Harrow 
Weald went from just 1,500 to over 10,000 while Pinner jumped from 3,00 
to over 20,000. During the 1930s, over 4 million new suburban houses were 
built and the 'suburban revolution' had made England the most heavily suburbanized 
country in the world by a considerable margin.[20] Lawns began to proliferate 
in America from the 1870s onwards. As more plants were introduced from 
Europe, lawns became smaller as they were filled with flower beds, perennials, 
sculptures, and water features.[21] Eventually the wealthy began to move 
away from the cities into new suburban communities. In 1856, an architectural 
book was published to accompany the development of the new suburbia that 
placed importance on the availability of a grassy space for children to 
play on and a space to grow fruits and vegetables that further imbued the 
lawn with cultural importance.[11] Lawns began making more appearances 
in development plans, magazine articles, and catalogs.[22] The lawn became 
less associated with being a status symbol, instead giving way to a landscape 
aesthetic. Improvements in the lawn mower and water supply enabled the 
spread of lawn culture from the Northeast to the South where the grass 
grew more poorly.[11] This in combination with setback rules which required 
all homes to have a 30-foot gap between the structure and the sidewalk 
meant that the lawn had found a specific place in suburbia.[21] Prior to 
European colonization, the grasses on the East Coast of North America were 
mostly broom straw, wild rye, and marsh grass. As Europeans moved into 
the region, it was noted by colonists in New England, more than others, 
that the grasses of the New World were inferior to those of England and 
that their livestock seemed to receive less nutrition from it. In fact, 
once livestock brought overseas from Europe spread throughout the colonies, 
much of the native grasses of New England disappeared, and an inventory 
list from the 17th century noted supplies of clover and grass seed from 
England. New colonists were even urged by their country and companies to 
bring grass seed with them to North America. By the late 17th century, 
a new market in imported grass seed had begun in New England.[11] Much 
of the new grasses brought by Europeans spread quickly and effectively, 
often ahead of the colonists. One such species, Bermuda grass (Cynodon 
dactylon), became the most important pasture grass for the southern colonies. 
Kentucky Bluegrass (Poa pratensis) is a grass native to Europe or the Middle 
East. It was likely carried to Midwestern United States in the early 1600s 
by French missionaries and spread via the waterways to the region around 
Kentucky. However, it may also have spread across the Appalachian mountains 
after an introduction on the east coast. Kentucky Bluegrass is now one 
of the top three pasture grasses in the United States and the most desirable 
species of grass for lawns. Farmers at first continued to harvest meadows 
and marshes composed of indigenous grasses until they became overgrazed. 
These areas quickly fell to erosion and were overrun with less favorable 
plant life. Soon, farmers began to purposefully plant new species of grass 
in these areas, hoping to improve the quality and quantity of hay to provide 
for their livestock as native species had a lower nutritive value. While 
Middle Eastern and Europeans species of grass did extremely well on the 
East Coast of North America, it was a number of grasses from the Mediterranean 
that dominated the Western seaboard. As cultivated grasses became valued 
for their nutritional benefits to livestock, farmers relied less and less 
on natural meadows in the more colonized areas of the country. Eventually 
even the grasses of the Great Plains were overrun with European species 
that were more durable to the grazing patterns of imported livestock.[11] 
A pivotal factor in the spread of the lawn in America was the passage of 
legislation in 1938 of the 40-hour work week. Until then, Americans had 
typically worked half days on Saturdays, leaving little time to focus on 
their lawns. With this legislation and the housing boom following the Second 
World War, managed grass spaces became more commonplace.[21] The creation 
in the early 20th century of country clubs and golf courses completed the 
rise of lawn culture.[11] Lawn monoculture was a reflection of more than 
an interest in offsetting depreciation, it propagated the homogeneity of 
the suburb itself. Although lawns had been a recognizable feature in English 
residences since the 19th century, a revolution in industrialization and 
monoculture of the lawn since the Second World War fundamentally changed 
the ecology of the lawn. Intensive suburbanization both concentrated and 
expanded the spread of lawn maintenance which meant increased inputs in 
not only petrochemicals, fertilizers, and pesticides, but also natural 
resources like water.[2][11][21] Front lawns became standardized in the 
1930s when, over time, specific aspects such as grass type and maintenance 
methods became popular. The lawn-care industry boomed, but the Great Depression 
of the 1930s and in the period prior to World War II made it difficult 
to maintain the cultural standards that had become heavily associated with 
the lawn due to grass seed shortages in Europe, America's main supplier. 
Still, seed distributors such as Scotts Miracle-Gro Company in the United 
States encouraged families to continue to maintain their lawns, promoting 
it as a stress-relieving hobby. During the war itself, homeowners were 
asked to maintain the appearances of the home front, likely as a show of 
strength, morale, and solidarity. After World War II, the lawn aesthetic 
once again became a standard feature of North America, bouncing back from 
its minor decline in the decades before with a vengeance, particularly 
as a result of the housing and population boom post-war.[11] The G.I. Bill 
in the United States let American ex-servicemen buy homes without providing 
a down payment, while the Federal Housing Administration offered lender 
inducements that aided the reduction of down payments for the average American 
from 30% to as little as 10%. These developments made owning your own home 
cheaper than renting, further enabling the spread of suburbia and its lawns.[21] 
Levittown, New York was the beginning of the industrial suburb in the 20th 
Century, and by proxy the industrial lawn. Between 1947 and 1951, Abraham 
Levitt and his sons built more than seventeen thousand homes, each with 
its own lawn. Abraham Levitt wrote "No single feature of a suburban residential 
community contributes as much to the charm and beauty of the individual 
home and the locality as well-kept lawns". Landscaping was one of the most 
important factors in Levittown's success - and no feature was more prominent 
than the lawn. The Levitts understood that landscaping could add to the 
appeal of their developments and claimed that, "increase in values are 
most often found in neighborhoods where lawns show as green carpets" and 
that, over the years, "lawns trees and shrubs become more valuable both 
esthetically and monetarily".[23] During 1948, the first spring that Levittown 
had enjoyed, Levitt and Sons fertilized and reseeded all of the lawns free 
of charge.[21] The economic recession that began in 2008 has resulted in 
many communities worldwide to dig up their lawns and plant fruit and vegetable 
gardens. This has the potential to greatly change cultural values attached 
to the lawn, as they are increasingly viewed as environmentally and economically 
unviable in the modern context.[24] The appearance of the lawn in Australia 
followed closely after its establishment in North America and parts of 
Europe. Lawn was established on the so-called "nature strip" by the 1920s 
and was common throughout the developing suburbs of Australia. This term 
is uniquely Australian, alluding, perhaps, to man's desire to control nature. 
By the 1950s, the Australian-designed Victa lawn mower was being used by 
the many people who had turned pastures into lawn and was also being exported 
to dozens of countries.[25] Prior to the 1970s, all brush and native species 
were stripped from a development site and replaced with lawns that utilized 
imported plant species. Since the 1970s there has been an interest in using 
indigenous species for lawns, especially considering their lower water 
requirements.[26] Lawns are also established in garden areas as well as 
used for the surface of sporting fields. Over time, with consideration 
to the frequency of droughts in Australia, the movement towards "naturalism", 
or the use of indigenous plant species in yards, was beneficial. These 
grasses were more drought resistant than their European counterparts, and 
many who wished to keep their lawns switched to these alternatives or allowed 
their green carpets to revert to the indigenous scrub in an effort to reduce 
the strain on water supplies.[24] However, lawns remain a popular surface 
and their practical and aesthetically pleasing appearance reduces the use 
of water-impervious surfaces such as concrete. The growing use of rainwater 
storage tanks has improved the ability to maintain them. Following recent 
droughts, Australia has seen a change to predominately warm-season turfgrasses, 
particularly in the southern states like New South Wales and Victoria which 
are predominately temperate climates within urban regions. The more drought 
tolerant grasses have been chosen by councils and homeowners for the choice 
of using less water compared to cool-season turfgrasses like fescue and 
ryegrass. Mild dormancy seems to be of little concern when high-profile 
areas can be oversown for short periods or nowadays, turf colourants (fake 
green) are extremely popular. Within Australia it is reported that there 
are nearly 400 turf farms.[27] Knowing which farm is currently selling 
what turf variety is difficult. However, in 2016 an independent web site 
called TurfFinder was developed to assist homeowners and professional turf 
managers in choosing the appropriate turfgrass that meets their needs. 
The web site lists generic and technical information on over 100 warm- 
and cool-season turfgrasses and provides the location of reputable turf 
producers from across Australia that sell these turf varieties. Lawns are 
a common feature of private gardens, public landscapes and parks in many 
parts of the world. They are created for aesthetic pleasure, as well as 
for sports or other outdoor recreational use. Lawns are useful as a playing 
surface both because they mitigate erosion and dust generated by intensive 
foot traffic and because they provide a cushion for players in sports such 
as rugby, football, soccer, cricket, baseball, golf, tennis, hockey and 
lawn bocce. Lawns and the resulting lawn clipping waste can be used as 
an ingredient in making compost and is also viewed as fodder, used in the 
production of lawn clipping silage which is fed to livestock[28][29] as 
a sustainable feed source. Lawns need not be, and have not always been, 
made up of grasses alone. Other plants for lawn-like usable garden areas 
are sedges, low herbs and wildflowers, and ground covers that can be walked 
upon. Thousands of varieties of grasses and grasslike plants are used for 
lawns, each adapted to specific conditions of precipitation and irrigation, 
seasonal temperatures, and sun/shade tolerances. Plant hybridizers and 
botanists are constantly creating and finding improved varieties of the 
basic species and new ones, often more economical and environmentally sustainable 
by needing less water, fertilizer, pest and disease treatments, and maintenance. 
The three basic categories are cool season grasses, warm season grasses, 
and grass alternatives. Many different species of grass are currently used, 
depending on the intended use and the climate. Coarse grasses are used 
where active sports are played, and finer grasses are used for ornamental 
lawns for their visual effects. Some grasses are adapted to oceanic climates 
with cooler summers, and others to tropical and continental climates with 
hotter summers. Often, a mix of grass or low plant types is used to form 
a stronger lawn when one type does better in the warmer seasons and the 
other in the colder ones. This mixing is taken further by a form of grass 
breeding which produces what are known as cultivars. A cultivar is a cross-breed 
of two different varieties of grass and aims to combine certain traits 
taken from each individual breed. This creates a new strain which can be 
very specialised, suited to a particular environment, such as low water, 
low light or low nutrient. Cool season grasses start growth at 5 °C (41 °F), 
and grow at their fastest rate when temperatures are between 10 °C (50 °F) 
and 25 °C (77 °F), in climates that have relatively mild/cool summers, 
with two periods of rapid growth in the spring and autumn.[30] They retain 
their color well in extreme cold and typically grow very dense, carpetlike 
lawns with relatively little thatch. Warm season grasses only start growth 
at temperatures above 10 °C (50 °F), and grow fastest when temperatures 
are between 25 °C (77 °F) and 35 °C (95 °F), with one long growth period 
over the spring and summer (Huxley 1992). They often go dormant in cooler 
months, turning shades of tan or brown. Many warm season grasses are quite 
drought tolerant, and can handle very high summer temperatures, although 
temperatures below −15 °C (5 °F) can kill most southern ecotype warm season 
grasses. The northern varieties, such as buffalograss and blue grama, are 
hardy to 45 °C (113 °F). Carex species and cultivars are well represented 
in the horticulture industry as 'sedge' alternatives for 'grass' in mowed 
lawns and garden meadows. Both low-growing and spreading ornamental cultivars 
and native species are used in for sustainable landscaping as low-maintenance 
and drought-tolerant grass replacements for lawns and garden meadows. wildland 
habitat restoration projects and natural landscaping and gardens use them 
also for 'user-friendly' areas. The J. Paul Getty Museum has used Carex 
pansa (meadow sedge) and Carex praegracilis (dune sedge) expansively in 
the Sculpture Gardens in Los Angeles.[31] Some lawns are replaced with 
low ground covers, such as creeping thyme, camomile, Lippia, purple flowering 
Mazus, grey Dymondia, creeping sedums, and creeping jenny.[32] Other alternatives 
to lawns include meadows, drought-tolerant xeriscape gardens, natural landscapes, 
native plant habitat gardens, paved Spanish courtyard and patio gardens, 
butterfly gardens, rain gardens, tapestry lawn and kitchen gardens. Trees 
and shrubs in close proximity to lawns provide habitat for birds in traditional, 
cottage and wildlife gardens. Seasonal lawn establishment and care varies 
depending on the climate zone and type of lawn grown. Early autumn, spring, 
and early summer are the primary seasons to seed, lay sod (turf), plant 
'liners', or 'sprig' new lawns, when the soil is warmer and air cooler. 
Seeding is the least expensive, but may take longer for the lawn to be 
established. Aerating just before planting/seeding may promote deeper root 
growth and thicker turf.[citation needed] Sodding (American English), or 
turfing (British English), provides an almost instant lawn, and can be 
undertaken in most temperate climates in any season, but is more expensive 
and more vulnerable to drought until established. Hydroseeding is a quick, 
less expensive method of planting large, sloped or hillside landscapes. 
Some grasses and sedges are available and planted from 'liner' and 4-inch 
(100 mm) containers, from 'flats', 'plugs' or 'sprigs', and are planted 
apart to grow together. Lawn growth, 20-hour time lapse Various organic 
and inorganic or synthetic fertilizers are available, with instant or time-release 
applications. Pesticides, which includes biological and chemical herbicides, 
insecticides and fungicides are available. Consideration for their effects 
on the lawn and garden ecosystem and via runoff and dispersion on the surrounding 
environment, can constrain their use. For example, the Canadian province 
of Quebec and over 130 municipalities prohibit the use of synthetic lawn 
pesticides. In order for the lawn to grow and flourish, the soil must be 
prepared properly. If this step is overlooked as many do, the lawn will 
burn out as soon as it runs out of nutrients. [33][33] The Ontario provincial 
government promised on 24–2 September 2007 to also implement a province-wide 
ban on the cosmetic use of lawn pesticides, for protecting the public. 
Medical and environmental groups support such a ban.[34] On 22–2 April 
2008, the Provincial Government of Ontario announced that it will pass 
legislation that will prohibit, province-wide, the cosmetic use and sale 
of lawn and garden pesticides.[35] The Ontario legislation would also echo 
Massachusetts law requiring pesticide manufacturers to reduce the toxins 
they use in production.[36] Sustainable gardening uses organic horticulture 
methods, such as organic fertilizers, biological pest control, beneficial 
insects, and companion planting, among other methods, to sustain an attractive 
lawn in a safe garden. An example of an organic herbicide is corn gluten 
meal, which releases an 'organic dipeptide' into the soil to inhibit root 
formation of germinating weed seeds. An example of an organic alternative 
to insecticide use is applying beneficial nematodes to combat soil-dwelling 
grubs, such as the larvae of chafer beetles. The Integrated Pest Management 
approach is a coordinated low impact approach.[37] Maintaining a rough 
lawn requires only occasional cutting with a suitable machine, or grazing 
by animals. Maintaining a smooth and closely cut lawn, be it for aesthetic 
or practical reasons or because social pressure from neighbors and local 
municipal ordinances requires it,[38] necessitates more organized and regular 
treatments. Usually once a week is adequate for maintaining a lawn in most 
climates. However, in the hot and rainy seasons of regions contained in 
hardiness zones greater than 8, lawns may need to be maintained up to two 
times a week. The prevalence of the lawns in films such as Pleasantville 
and Edward Scissorhands alludes to the importance of the lawn as a social 
mechanism that gives great importance to visual representation of the American 
suburb as well as its practised culture. It is implied that a neighbor, 
whose lawn is not in pristine condition, is morally corrupt, emphasizing 
the role a well-kept lawn plays in neighborly and community relationships. 
In both of these films, green space surrounding a house in the suburbs 
becomes an indicator of moral integrity as well as of social and gender 
norms as lawn care has long been associated with men. These lawns also 
reinforce class and societal norms by subtly excluding minorities who may 
not have been able to afford a house in the suburbs with a lawn that was 
the symbolic representation of safety and stability.[39] The lawn as a 
reflection of someone's character and the neighborhood at large is not 
restricted to films, the same theme is evident in The Great Gatsby, a book 
written by American novelist F. Scott Fitzgerald. Character Nick Carraway 
rents the house next to Gatsby's and fails to maintain his lawn according 
to West Egg standards. The rift between the two lawns troubles Gatsby to 
the point that he dispatches his gardener to mow Nick's grass and thereby 
create uniformity.[40] Most lawn care equipment over the decades has been 
advertised to men, and companies have long associated good lawn care with 
good citizenship in their marketing campaigns. As well, the appearance 
of a healthy lawn was meant to imply the health of the man taking care 
of it; controlled weeds and strict boundaries became a practical application 
of the desire to control nature, as well as an expression of control over 
their personal lives once working full-time became central to suburban 
success. Women were encultured over time to view the lawn as part of the 
household, as an essential furnishing, and to encourage their husbands 
to maintain a lawn for the family and community reputation.[11] During 
World War II, women became the focus of lawn-care companies in the absence 
of their husbands and sons. The lawn was promoted as a necessary means 
by which women could help support their male family members and American 
patriotism as a whole. The image of the lawn changed from focusing on technology 
and manhood to emphasizing aesthetic pleasure and the health benefits derived 
from its maintenance; it was assumed that women would not respond positively 
to images of efficiency and power. The language of these marketing campaigns 
still intended to imbue the female population with notions of family, motherhood, 
and the duties of a wife; it has been argued that this was done so that 
it would be easier for men returning from war to resume the roles their 
wives had taken over in their absence. This was especially apparent in 
the 1950s and 1960s, when lawn-care rhetoric emphasized the lawn as a husband's 
responsibility and as a pleasurable hobby when he retired.[11] The lawn 
aesthetic in Europe and Australia seems to exhibit the same cultural tendencies 
as a representation of order, power over nature, patriotism, and suburban 
family life while still adhering to other gender constructs present throughout 
the world's suburbs. However, there are differences in the particulars 
of lawn maintenance and appearance, such as the length of the grass, species 
(and therefore its color), and mowing.[26][41] Greater amounts of chemical 
fertilizer and pesticides are used per acre of lawn than on an equivalent 
acre of cultivated farmland,[42] and the continued use of these products 
has been associated with environmental pollution, disturbance in the lawn 
ecosystem, and increased health risks to the local human population.[43] 
Other concerns, criticisms, and ordinances regarding lawns come from the 
environmental consequences: Maintaining a green lawn sometimes requires 
large amounts of water. This is not normally a problem in the temperate 
British Isles, where the concept of the lawn originated, as natural rainfall 
is usually sufficient to maintain a lawn's health, although in times of 
drought hosepipe bans may be implemented by the water suppliers.[47] The 
exportation of the lawn ideal to more arid regions of the world, however, 
such as the U.S. Southwest and Australia, has crimped already scarce water 
resources in such areas, requiring larger, more environmentally invasive 
water supply systems. Grass typically goes dormant during cold, winter 
months, and turns brown during hot, dry summer months, thereby reducing 
its demand for water. Many property owners consider this "dead" appearance 
unacceptable, and therefore increase watering during the summer months. 
Grass can also recover quite well from a drought. In the United States, 
50 to 70% of residential water is used for landscaping, most of it to water 
lawns.[45] A 2005 NASA study "conservatively" estimated there was 128,000 
square kilometres (49,000 sq mi; 32,000,000 acres) of irrigated lawn in 
the US, three times the area of irrigated corn.[48] It is possible that 
lawn maintenance could come at the expense of precious resources, especially 
when faced with extreme weather conditions. This situation is described 
in Water in Australia by David Ingle Smith, who observed in 1995 data that 
under extreme conditions during summer drought periods, up to 90% of the 
water used in Canberra, Australia was applied to lawns.[49] An increased 
concern from the general public over pesticide and fertilizer use and their 
associated health risks, combined with the implementation of the legislation, 
such as the US Food Quality Protection Act, has resulted in the reduced 
presence of synthetic chemicals, namely pesticides, in urban landscapes 
such as lawns in the late 20th century.[50] Many of these concerns over 
the safety and environmental impact of some of the synthetic fertilizers 
and pesticides has led to their ban by the United States Environmental 
Protection Agency and many local governments.[43] The use of pesticides 
and other chemicals to care for lawns has also lead to the death of nearly 
7 million birds each year, a topic that was central to Silent Spring by 
the conservationist Rachel Carson.[21] In the United States, lawn heights 
are generally maintained by gasoline-powered lawnmowers, which contribute 
to urban smog during the summer months. The EPA found, in some urban areas, 
up to 5% of smog was due to small gasoline engines made before 1997, such 
as are typically used on lawnmowers. Since 1997, the EPA has mandated emissions 
controls on newer engines in an effort to reduce smog.[51] A 2010 study 
seemed to show lawn care inputs were balanced by the carbon sequestration 
benefits of lawns, and they may not be contributors to anthropogenic global 
warming.[52][53] However, lawns with high maintenance (mowing, irrigation, 
and leaf blowing) and high fertilization rates have a net emission of carbon 
dioxide and nitrous oxide that have large global warming potential.[54] 
With the use of ecological techniques including organic lawn management, 
the impact of lawns can be reduced. Such methods include the use of native 
grasses, sedges, and low herbs; higher mowing techniques; low volume irrigation, 
'grasscycling' grass clippings in place; an integrated pest management 
program; exclusive organic fertilizer and compost use; and including a 
variety of trees, shrubs, perennials, and other plants surrounding the 
lawn. A positive benefit of a healthy lawn is it filters contaminants and 
prevents runoff and erosion of bare soil. Replacing turf grass with low-maintenance 
groundcovers or employing a variety of low-maintenance perennials, trees 
and shrubs[44] can be a good alternative to traditional lawn spaces, especially 
in hard-to-grow or hard-to-mow areas, as it сan reduce maintenance requirements, 
associated pollution and offers higher aesthetic and wildlife value.[55]
