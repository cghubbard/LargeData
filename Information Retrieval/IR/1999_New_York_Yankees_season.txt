Manager Coaches Following lung cancer surgery on October 14, 1998, Joe 
DiMaggio fell into an 18-hour coma on December 11. The coma forced his 
lawyer, Morris Engelberg, to admit that the positive reports he had been 
feeding to the press were greatly exaggerated. He claimed Joe made him 
promise not to tell even his family about his condition. Joe was finally 
taken home on January 19, 1999. Days later, NBC broadcast a premature obituary; 
Engelberg claimed he and DiMaggio were watching TV and saw it. His last 
words, according to Engelberg, were "I'll finally get to see Marilyn." 
However, the day after DiMaggio's death, a hospice worker who cared for 
him gave a radically different account to The New York Post. DiMaggio finally 
died on March 8, 1999. He was buried on March 11, 1999 in Colma, California, 
just south of his longtime home of San Francisco. Note: Pos = position;
