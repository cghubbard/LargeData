end of the season, his 2.56 ERA was the best in the American League and

of the season, he started one game before being placed on the disabled 
list. He was sent to the Mariners' Triple-A affiliate Tacoma Rainiers for 
rehab starts. After dismal starts he was optioned to Tacoma.[15] On 24 
July Rowland-Smith was called up and put in the starting rotation after 
going 5–3 with a 4.31 ERA in 10 starts. [16] From that point on, Rowland-Smith 
got much praise for working out the kinks in his pitching. He said this 
about pitching in the minors: Rowland-Smith finished the season with a 
5–4 record not indicative of how well he pitched during the season due 
to six of his 15 games started ending in no decisions. Despite an increase 
of ERA to 3.74 from last season, the left-handed pitcher was widely recognised 
as a vital part to the Mariners 2010 season and was labelled as the likely 
number three pitcher in the Mariners' rotation.[18] In November 2010, Ryan 
was named on the Sydney Blue Sox 35-man roster for the inaugural Australian 
Baseball League season. He never played in the 2011 season. On 2 December 
2010 the Mariners decided not to offer a new contract, thus allowing Rowland-Smith 
to become an unrestricted free agent. On 9 December 2010 the Houston Astros 
signed Rowland-Smith to a one-year contract.[19] On 2 February 2012, the 
Chicago Cubs signed Rowland-Smith to a minor league deal.[20] On 24 February 
2013, the Boston Red Sox signed Rowland-Smith to a minor league deal.[21]

prior to the 2014 season.[22] On 29 March, he made the Diamondbacks 25-Man 
Opening Day roster. He was designated for assignment on 18 April, and elected 
to become a free agent on 21 April.[23] On 25 April 2014, Rowland-Smith 
signed a minor league deal with the Toronto Blue Jays.[24] He was assigned 
to the Triple-A Buffalo Bisons on 5 May. On 11 June, Rowland-Smith was 
released after allowing 8 runs in just 14 innings of work with Buffalo.[25] 
On 28 June 2014, Rowland-Smith signed a minor league deal with the Cincinnati 
Reds. On 2 August, he opted out of his minor league deal and became a free 
agent. On February 16, 2015, Rowland-Smith signed with the EDA Rhinos for 
the 2015 season. Rowland-Smith is the son of Australian celebrity trainer

avid surfer, and spends a lot of his time in the off-season in his native 
Australia surfing.[27] Rowland-Smith's mother, Julie White, is a retired 
high school physical education teacher.[26] His grandfather was a former 
New South Wales minister for sport and recreation.[26] His parents divorced 
when he was three and along with his sister they lived with their mother 
in Newcastle.[26] Growing-up, Rowland-Smith watched baseball on video cassettes 
because Major League Baseball was not carried on Australian networks back 
then.[26] He is the first player with a hyphenated last name ever to appear 
in a major league game.[28] He maintains his own blog and Twitter account
