The Super Bowl is the annual championship game of the National Football 
League (NFL), the highest level of professional American football in the 
world. The game culminates a season that begins in the late summer of the 
previous calendar year. Normally, Roman numerals are used to identify each 
game, rather than the year in which it is held. For example, Super Bowl 
I was played on January 15, 1967, following the 1966 regular season. The 
single exception to this rule is Super Bowl 50, which was played on February 
7, 2016, following the 2015 regular season. The next game, Super Bowl LI, 
scheduled for February 5, 2017, will follow the 2016 regular season. The 
game was created as part of a merger agreement between the NFL and its 
then-rival league, the American Football League (AFL). It was agreed that 
the two leagues' champion teams would play in the AFL–NFL World Championship 
Game until the merger was to officially begin in 1970. After the merger, 
each league was redesignated as a "conference", and the game has since 
been played between the conference champions to determine the NFL's league 
champion. Currently, the National Football Conference (NFC) leads the league 
with 26 wins to 24 wins for the American Football Conference (AFC). The 
Pittsburgh Steelers have the most Super Bowl victories with six. The day 
on which the Super Bowl is played, now considered by some an unofficial 
American national holiday,[1][2] is called "Super Bowl Sunday". It is the 
second-largest day for U.S. food consumption, after Thanksgiving Day.[3] 
In addition, the Super Bowl has frequently been the most-watched American 
television broadcast of the year; the four most-watched broadcasts in U.S. 
television history are Super Bowls.[4] In 2015, Super Bowl XLIX became 
the most-watched American television program in history with an average 
audience of 114.4 million viewers, the fifth time in six years the game 
had set a record, starting with the 2010 Super Bowl, which itself had taken 
over the number-one spot held for 27 years by the final episode of M*A*S*H.[5][6][7] 
The Super Bowl is also among the most-watched sporting events in the world, 
almost all audiences being North American, and is second to soccer's UEFA 
Champions League final as the most watched annual sporting event worldwide.[8][9] 
The NFL restricts the use of its "Super Bowl" trademark; it is frequently 
called the Big Game or other generic terms by non-sponsoring corporations. 
Because of the high viewership, commercial airtime during the Super Bowl 
broadcast is the most expensive of the year, leading to companies regularly 
developing their most expensive advertisements for this broadcast. As a 
result, watching and discussing the broadcast's commercials has become 
a significant aspect of the event.[10] In addition, popular singers and 
musicians including Michael Jackson, Madonna, Prince, Beyoncé, The Rolling 
Stones, The Who, and Whitney Houston have performed during the event's 
pre-game and halftime ceremonies. For four decades after its 1920 inception, 
the NFL successfully fended off several rival leagues. However, in 1960, 
it encountered its most serious competitor when the American Football League 
(AFL) was formed. The AFL vied heavily with the NFL for both players and 
fans, but by the middle of the decade the strain of competition led to 
serious merger talks between the two leagues. Prior to the 1966 season, 
the NFL and AFL reached a merger agreement that was to take effect for 
the 1970 season. As part of the merger, the champions of the two leagues 
agreed to meet in a world championship game for professional American football 
until the merger was effected. A bowl game is a post-season college football 
game. The original "bowl game" was the Rose Bowl Game in Pasadena, California, 
which was first played in 1902 as the "Tournament East-West football game" 
as part of the Pasadena Tournament of Roses and moved to the new Rose Bowl 
Stadium in 1923. The stadium got its name from the fact that the game played 
there was part of the Tournament of Roses and that it was shaped like a 
bowl, much like the Yale Bowl in New Haven, Connecticut; the Tournament 
of Roses football game itself eventually came to be known as the Rose Bowl 
Game. Exploiting the Rose Bowl Game's popularity, post-season college football 
contests were created for Miami (the Orange Bowl), New Orleans (the Sugar 
Bowl), and El Paso, Texas (the Sun Bowl) in 1935, and for Dallas (the Cotton 
Bowl) in 1937. By the time the first Super Bowl was played, the term "bowl" 
for any major American football game was well established. Lamar Hunt, 
owner of the AFL's Kansas City Chiefs, first used the term "Super Bowl"[11] 
to refer to the NFL-AFL championship game in the merger meetings. Hunt 
later said the name was likely in his head because his children had been 
playing with a Super Ball toy;[12] a vintage example of the ball is on 
display at the Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio. In a July 25, 
1966, letter to NFL commissioner Pete Rozelle, Hunt wrote, "I have kiddingly 
called it the 'Super Bowl,' which obviously can be improved upon." The 
leagues' owners chose the name "AFL-NFL Championship Game",[13] but in 
July 1966 the Kansas City Star quoted Hunt in discussing "the Super Bowl 
— that's my term for the championship game between the two leagues",[14] 
and the media immediately began using the term.[15] Although the league 
stated in 1967 that "not many people like it", asking for suggestions and 
considering alternatives such as 'Merger Bowl' and 'The Game', the Associated 
Press reported that 'Super Bowl' "grew and grew and grew-until it reached 
the point that there was Super Week, Super Sunday, Super Teams, Super Players, 
ad infinitum".[13] 'Super Bowl' became official beginning with the third 
annual game.[16] Roman numerals were first affixed for the fifth edition, 
in January 1971.[17] After the NFL's Green Bay Packers won the first two 
Super Bowls, some team owners feared for the future of the merger. At the 
time, many doubted the competitiveness of AFL teams compared with their 
NFL counterparts, though that perception changed when the AFL's New York 
Jets defeated the NFL's Baltimore Colts in Super Bowl III in Miami. One 
year later, the AFL's Kansas City Chiefs defeated the NFL's Minnesota Vikings 
23–7 in Super Bowl IV in New Orleans, which was the final AFL-NFL World 
Championship Game played before the merger. Beginning with the 1970 season, 
the NFL realigned into two conferences; the former AFL teams plus three 
NFL teams (the Colts, Pittsburgh Steelers, and Cleveland Browns) would 
constitute the American Football Conference (AFC), while the remaining 
NFL clubs would form the National Football Conference (NFC). The champions 
of the two conferences would play each other in the Super Bowl. The winning 
team receives the Vince Lombardi Trophy, named after the coach of the Green 
Bay Packers, who won the first two Super Bowl games and three of the five 
preceding NFL championships in 1961, 1962, and 1965. Following Lombardi's 
death in September 1970, the trophy was named the Vince Lombardi Trophy, 
and was the first awarded as such to the Baltimore Colts following their 
win in Super Bowl V in Miami. The Super Bowl is currently played on the 
first Sunday in February. This is due to the NFL current schedule which 
consists of the opening weekend of the season being held immediately after 
Labor Day (the first Monday in September), the 17-week regular season (where 
teams each play 16 games and have one bye), the first three rounds of the 
playoffs, and the Super Bowl two weeks after the two Conference Championship 
Games. This schedule has been in effect since Super Bowl XXXVIII in February 
2004. The date of the Super Bowl can thus be determined from the date of 
the preceding Labor Day. For example, Labor Day 2015 was September 7: therefore 
the next Super Bowl is scheduled exactly five months later on February 
7, 2016. Originally, the game took place in early to mid-January. For Super 
Bowl I there was only one round of playoffs: the pre-merger NFL and AFL 
Championship Games. The addition of two playoff rounds (first in 1967 and 
then in 1978), an increase in regular season games from 14 to 16 (1978), 
and the establishment of one bye-week per team (1990) have caused the Super 
Bowl to be played later. Partially offsetting these season-lengthening 
effects, simultaneous with the addition of two regular season games in 
1978, the season was started earlier. Prior to 1978 the season started 
as late as September 21. Now, since Labor Day is always the first Monday 
of September, September 13 is the latest possible date for the first full 
Sunday set of games (Since 2002, the regular season has started with the 
Kickoff Game on the Thursday after Labor Day). The Pittsburgh Steelers 
have won six Super Bowls, the most of any team; the Dallas Cowboys and 
San Francisco 49ers have five victories each, while the Green Bay Packers, 
New York Giants and New England Patriots have four Super Bowl championships. 
Thirteen other NFL franchises have won at least one Super Bowl. Nine teams 
have appeared in Super Bowl games without a win. The Minnesota Vikings 
were the first team to have appeared a record four times without a win. 
The Buffalo Bills played in a record four Super Bowls in a row, and lost 
every one. Four teams (the Cleveland Browns, Detroit Lions, Jacksonville 
Jaguars, and Houston Texans) have never appeared in a Super Bowl. The Browns 
and Lions both won NFL Championships prior to the Super Bowl's creation, 
while the Jaguars (1995) and Texans (2002) are both recent NFL expansion 
teams. The Minnesota Vikings won the last NFL Championship before the merger, 
but lost to the AFL champion Kansas City Chiefs in Super Bowl IV. The Green 
Bay Packers won the first two Super Bowls, defeating the Kansas City Chiefs 
and Oakland Raiders following the 1966 and 1967 seasons, respectively. 
The Packers were led by quarterback Bart Starr, who was named the Most 
Valuable Player (MVP) for both games. These two championships, coupled 
with the Packers' NFL championships in 1961, 1962, and 1965, amount to 
the most successful stretch in NFL History; five championships in seven 
years. In Super Bowl III, the AFL's New York Jets defeated the eighteen-point 
favorite Baltimore Colts of the NFL, 16–7. The Jets were led by quarterback 
Joe Namath (who had famously guaranteed a Jets win prior to the game) and 
former Colts head coach Weeb Ewbank, and their victory proved that the 
AFL was the NFL's competitive equal. This was reinforced the following 
year, when the AFL's Kansas City Chiefs defeated the NFL's Minnesota Vikings 
23–7 in Super Bowl IV. After the AFL–NFL merger was completed in 1970, 
three franchises – the Dallas Cowboys, Miami Dolphins, and Pittsburgh Steelers 
– would go on to dominate the 1970s, winning a combined eight Super Bowls 
in the decade. The Baltimore Colts, now a member of the AFC, would start 
the decade by defeating the Cowboys in Super Bowl V, a game which is notable 
as being the only Super Bowl to date in which a player from the losing 
team won the Super Bowl MVP (Cowboys' linebacker Chuck Howley). Beginning 
with this Super Bowl, all Super Bowls have served as the NFL's league championship 
game. The Cowboys, coming back from a loss the previous season, won Super 
Bowl VI over the Dolphins. However, this would be the Dolphins' final loss 
in over a year, as the next year, the Dolphins would go 14–0 in the regular 
season and eventually win all of their playoff games, capped off with a 
14-7 victory in Super Bowl VII, becoming the first and only team to finish 
an entire perfect regular and post season. The Dolphins would repeat as 
league champions by winning Super Bowl VIII a year later. In the late 1970s, 
the Steelers became the first NFL dynasty of the post-merger era by winning 
four Super Bowls (IX, X, XIII, and XIV) in six years. They were led by 
head coach Chuck Noll, the play of offensive stars Terry Bradshaw, Franco 
Harris, Lynn Swann, John Stallworth, and Mike Webster, and their dominant 
"Steel Curtain" defense, led by "Mean" Joe Greene, L.C. Greenwood, Ernie 
Holmes, Mel Blount, Jack Ham, and Jack Lambert. The coaches and administrators 
also were part of the dynasty's greatness as evidenced by the team's "final 
pieces" being part of the famous 1974 draft. The selections in that class 
have been considered the best by any pro franchise ever, as Pittsburgh 
selected four future Hall of Famers, the most for any team in any sport 
in a single draft. The Steelers were the first team to win three and then 
four Super Bowls and appeared in six AFC Championship Games during the 
decade, making the playoffs in eight straight seasons. Nine players and 
three coaches and administrators on the team have been inducted into the 
Pro Football Hall of Fame. Pittsburgh still remains the only team to win 
back-to-back Super Bowls twice and four Super Bowls in a six-year period. 
The Steelers' dynasty was interrupted only by the Cowboys winning their 
second Super Bowl of the decade and the Oakland Raiders' Super Bowl XI 
win. In the 1980s and 1990s, the tables turned for the AFC, as the NFC 
dominated the Super Bowls of the new decade and most of those of the 1990s. 
The NFC won 16 of the 20 Super Bowls during these two decades, including 
13 straight from Super Bowl XIX to Super Bowl XXXI. The most successful 
team of the 1980s was the San Francisco 49ers, which featured the West 
Coast offense of Hall of Fame head coach Bill Walsh. This offense was led 
by three-time Super Bowl MVP and Hall of Fame quarterback Joe Montana, 
Super Bowl MVP and Hall of Fame wide receiver Jerry Rice, and tight end 
Brent Jones. Under their leadership, the 49ers won four Super Bowls in 
the decade (XVI, XIX, XXIII, and XXIV) and made nine playoff appearances 
between 1981 and 1990, including eight division championships, becoming 
the second dynasty of the post-merger NFL. The 1980s also produced the 
1985 Chicago Bears, who posted an 18–1 record under head coach Mike Ditka; 
colorful quarterback Jim McMahon; and Hall of Fame running back Walter 
Payton. Their team won Super Bowl XX in dominating fashion. The Washington 
Redskins and New York Giants were also top teams of this period; the Redskins 
won Super Bowls XVII, XXII, and XXVI. The Giants claimed Super Bowls XXI 
and XXV. As in the 1970s, the Oakland Raiders were the only team to interrupt 
the Super Bowl dominance of other teams; they won Super Bowls XV and XVIII 
(the latter as the Los Angeles Raiders). Following several seasons with 
poor records in the 1980s, the Dallas Cowboys rose back to prominence in 
the 1990s. During this decade, the Cowboys made post-season appearances 
every year except for the seasons of 1990 and 1997. From 1992 to 1996, 
the Cowboys won their division championship each year. In this same period, 
the Buffalo Bills had made their mark reaching the Super Bowl for a record 
four consecutive years, only to lose all four. After Super Bowl championships 
by division rivals New York (1990) and Washington (1991), the Cowboys won 
three of the next four Super Bowls (XXVII, XXVIII, and XXX) led by quarterback 
Troy Aikman, running back Emmitt Smith, and wide receiver Michael Irvin. 
All three of these players went to the Hall of Fame. The Cowboys' streak 
was interrupted by the 49ers, who won their league-leading fifth title 
overall with Super Bowl XXIX in dominating fashion under Super Bowl MVP 
and Hall of Fame quarterback Steve Young, Hall of Fame wide receiver Jerry 
Rice, and Hall of Fame cornerback Deion Sanders; however, the Cowboys' 
victory in Super Bowl XXX the next year also gave them five titles overall 
and they did so with Deion Sanders after he won the Super Bowl the previous 
year with the San Francisco 49ers. The NFC's winning streak was continued 
by the Green Bay Packers who, under quarterback Brett Favre, won Super 
Bowl XXXI, their first championship since Super Bowl II in the late 1960s. 
Super Bowl XXXII saw quarterback John Elway and running back Terrell Davis 
lead the Denver Broncos to an upset victory over the defending champion 
Packers, snapping the NFC's 13 year winning streak. The following year, 
the Broncos defeated the Atlanta Falcons in Super Bowl XXXIII, Elway's 
fifth Super Bowl appearance, his second NFL championship, and his final 
NFL game. The back-to-back victories heralded a change in momentum in which 
AFC teams would win 10 out of 13 Super Bowls. In the years between 2001 
and 2011, three teams – the Patriots, Steelers, and Colts – accounted for 
ten of the AFC Super Bowl appearances, with those same teams often meeting 
each other earlier in the playoffs. In contrast, the NFC saw a different 
representative in the Super Bowl every season from 2001 through 2010. The 
year following the Denver Broncos' second victory, however, a surprising 
St. Louis Rams led by undrafted quarterback Kurt Warner would close out 
the 1990s in a wild battle against the Tennessee Titans in Super Bowl XXXIV. 
The tense game came down to the final play in which Tennessee had the opportunity 
to tie the game and send it to overtime. The Titans nearly pulled it off, 
but the tackle of receiver Kevin Dyson by linebacker Mike Jones kept the 
ball out of the end zone by a matter of inches. In 2007, ESPN would rank 
"The Tackle" as the 2nd greatest moment in Super Bowl history.[18] Super 
Bowl XXXV was played by the AFC's Baltimore Ravens and the NFC's New York 
Giants. The Ravens defeated the Giants by the score of 34–7. The game was 
played on January 28, 2001, at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, Florida. 
The New England Patriots became the dominant team throughout the early 
2000s, winning the championship three out of four years early in the decade. 
They would become only the second team in the history of the NFL to do 
so (after the 1990s Dallas Cowboys). In Super Bowl XXXVI, first-year starting 
quarterback Tom Brady led his team to a 20–17 upset victory over the St. 
Louis Rams. Brady would go on to win the MVP award for this game. The Patriots 
also won Super Bowls XXXVIII[19] and XXXIX defeating the Carolina Panthers 
and the Philadelphia Eagles respectively. This four-year stretch of Patriot 
dominance was interrupted by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers' 48-21 Super Bowl 
XXXVII victory over the Oakland Raiders. The Pittsburgh Steelers and Indianapolis 
Colts continued the era of AFC dominance by winning Super Bowls XL and 
XLI in 2005-06 and 2006–07, respectively defeating the Seattle Seahawks 
and Chicago Bears. In the 2007 season, the Patriots became the second team 
in NFL history to have a perfect regular season record, after the 1972 
Miami Dolphins, and the first to finish 16–0. They easily marched through 
the AFC playoffs and were heavy favorites in Super Bowl XLII. However, 
they lost that game to Eli Manning and the New York Giants 17–14, leaving 
the Patriots' 2007 record at 18-1. The following season, the Steelers logged 
their record sixth Super Bowl title (XLIII) in a 27-23, final-minute victory 
against the Arizona Cardinals. The 2009 Super Bowl XLIV season saw the 
New Orleans Saints defeat the Indianapolis Colts by a score of 31-17 to 
take home their first Championship. The 2010s have seen a return to dominance 
by NFC teams. Between 2010 and 2016, four of the seven Super Bowl winners 
hailed from the NFC. The Giants won another title after the 2011 season, 
again defeating the Patriots in Super Bowl XLVI. Prior to that Super Bowl 
victory, the New Orleans Saints won their first (XLIV) by defeating the 
Indianapolis Colts in February 2010, and the Green Bay Packers won their 
fourth Super Bowl (XLV) and record thirteenth NFL championship overall 
by defeating the Pittsburgh Steelers in February 2011. The Baltimore Ravens 
snapped the NFC's three-game winning streak by winning Super Bowl XLVII 
in a 34-31 nail-biter over the San Francisco 49ers. Super Bowl XLVIII, 
played at New Jersey's MetLife Stadium in February 2014, was the first 
Super Bowl held outdoors in a cold weather environment. The Seattle Seahawks 
won their first NFL title with a 43-8 defeat of the Denver Broncos, in 
a highly touted matchup that pitted Seattle's top-ranked defense against 
a Peyton-Manning-led Denver offense that had broken the NFL's single-season 
scoring record. In Super Bowl XLIX, the New England Patriots, the AFC champions, 
beat the NFC and defending Super Bowl champions, the Seattle Seahawks. 
In Super Bowl 50, the Denver Broncos, led by the league's top-ranked defense, 
defeated the Carolina Panthers, who had the league's top-ranked offense, 
in what became the final game of quarterback Peyton Manning's career. The 
Super Bowls of the 2000s and early 2010s are notable for the performances 
(and the pedigrees) of several of the participating quarterbacks. During 
that era, Tom Brady (six Super Bowl appearances, four wins), Ben Roethlisberger 
(three appearances, two wins), Peyton Manning (four appearances, two wins), 
Eli Manning (two appearances, two wins), Kurt Warner (three appearances, 
one win), Drew Brees (one appearance, one win), Aaron Rodgers (one appearance, 
one win), Joe Flacco (one appearance, one win), and Russell Wilson (two 
appearances, one win) have all added Super Bowl championships to their 
lists of individual accomplishments. The Super Bowl is one of the most 
watched annual sporting events in the world. The only other annual events 
that gather more viewers are the UEFA Champions League final, and El Clásico 
in Spain.[9] For many years, the Super Bowl has possessed a large US and 
global television viewership, and it is often the most watched United States 
originating television program of the year.[20] The game tends to have 
high Nielsen television ratings, which is usually around a 40 rating and 
60 share. This means that on average, more than 100 million people from 
the United States alone are tuned into the Super Bowl at any given moment. 
In press releases preceding each year's event, the NFL typically claims 
that that year's Super Bowl will have a potential worldwide audience of 
around one billion people in over 200 countries.[21] This figure refers 
to the number of people able to watch the game, not the number of people 
actually watching. However the statements have been frequently misinterpreted 
in various media as referring to the latter figure, leading to a common 
misperception about the game's actual global audience.[22][23] The New 
York-based media research firm Initiative measured the global audience 
for the 2005 Super Bowl at 93 million people, with 98 percent of that figure 
being viewers in North America, which meant roughly 2 million people outside 
North America watched the Super Bowl that year.[22] The 2015 Super Bowl 
XLIX holds the record for total number of U.S. viewers, with a final number 
of 114.4 million,[24] making the game the most-viewed television broadcast 
of any kind in American history. The halftime show was the most watched 
ever with 118.5 million viewers tuning in, and an all-time high of 168 
million viewers in the United States had watched several portions of the 
Super Bowl 2015 broadcast.[25] The game set a record for total viewers 
for the fifth time in six years.[6] The highest-rated game according to 
Nielsen was Super Bowl XVI in 1982, which was watched in 49.1 percent of 
households (73 share), or 40,020,000 households at the time. Ratings for 
that game, a San Francisco victory over Cincinnati, may have been aided 
by a large blizzard that had affected much of the northeastern United States 
on game day, leaving residents to stay at home more than usual. Super Bowl 
XVI still ranks fourth on Nielsen's list of top-rated programs of all time, 
and three other Super Bowls, XII, XVII, and XX, made the top ten.[26] Famous 
commercial campaigns include the Budweiser "Bud Bowl" campaign, the 1984 
introduction of Apple's MacIntosh computer, and the 1999 and 2000 dot-com 
ads. As the television ratings of the Super Bowl have steadily increased 
over the years, prices have also increased every year, with advertisers 
paying as much as $3.5 million for a thirty-second spot during Super Bowl 
XLVI in 2012.[27] A segment of the audience tunes into the Super Bowl solely 
to view commercials.[10] In 2010, Nielsen reported that 51 percent of Super 
Bowl viewers tune in for the commercials.[28] The Super Bowl halftime show 
has spawned another set of alternative entertainment such as the Lingerie 
Bowl, the Beer Bottle Bowl, and others. Since 1991, the Super Bowl has 
begun between 6:19 and 6:40 PM EST so that most of the game is played during 
the primetime hours on the East Coast.[29] Note: Years listed are the year 
the game was actually played (will be played) rather than what NFL season 
it is considered to have been. ^ *: Not currently in the rotation for Super 
Bowls. ^ **: The extended current TV contracts with the networks expire 
after the 2022 season (or Super Bowl LVII in early 2023) and the Super 
Bowl is rotated annually between CBS, Fox and NBC in that order. ^ ***: The 
first Super Bowl was simultaneously broadcast by CBS and NBC, with each 
network using the same video feed, but providing its own commentary. Super 
Bowls I–VI were blacked out in the television markets of the host cities, 
due to league restrictions then in place.[30] The Super Bowl provides an 
extremely strong lead-in to programming following it on the same channel, 
the effects of which can last for several hours. For instance, in discussing 
the ratings of a local TV station, Buffalo television critic Alan Pergament 
noted on the coattails from Super Bowl XLVII, which aired on CBS: "A paid 
program that ran on Channel 4 (WIVB-TV) at 2:30 in the morning had a 1.3 
rating. That's higher than some CW prime time shows get on WNLO-TV, Channel 
4's sister station."[31] Because of this strong coattail effect, the network 
that airs the Super Bowl typically takes advantage of the large audience 
to air an episode of a hit series, or to premiere the pilot of a promising 
new one in the lead-out slot, which immediately follows the Super Bowl 
and post-game coverage. Initially, it was sort of a novelty and so it didn't 
quite feel right. But it was just like, this is the year. ... Bands of 
our generation, you can sort of be seen on a stage like this or, like, 
not seen. There's not a lot of middle places. It is a tremendous venue. 
Early Super Bowls featured a halftime show consisting of marching bands 
from local colleges or high schools; but as the popularity of the game 
increased, a trend where popular singers and musicians performed during 
its pre-game ceremonies and the halftime show, or simply sang the national 
anthem of the United States, emerged.[33] Unlike regular season or playoff 
games, thirty minutes are allocated for the Super Bowl halftime. The first 
halftime show to have featured only one star performer was Super Bowl XXVII 
in 1993, at which Michael Jackson performed. The NFL specifically went 
after him to increase viewership and to continue expanding the Super Bowl's 
realm.[34] Sports bloggers have ranked Jackson's appearance as the No. 
1 Super Bowl halftime show since its inception.[35] Another notable performance 
came during Super Bowl XXXVI in 2002, when U2 performed; during their third 
song, "Where the Streets Have No Name", the band played under a large projection 
screen which scrolled through names of the victims of the September 11 
attacks. Whitney Houston's performance of the national anthem at Super 
Bowl XXV in 1991, during the Gulf War, has been regarded as one of the 
best renditions of the anthem in history.[36][37][38] Her performance was 
released as a single on February 12, 1991, and appeared on the album Whitney: 
The Greatest Hits. The halftime show of Super Bowl XXXVIII in 2004 generated 
controversy when Justin Timberlake removed a piece of Janet Jackson's top, 
exposing her right breast with a star-shaped pastie around the nipple. 
Timberlake and Jackson have maintained that the incident was accidental, 
calling it a "wardrobe malfunction". The game was airing live on CBS, and 
MTV had produced the halftime show. Immediately after the moment, the footage 
jump-cut to a wide-angle shot and went to a commercial break; however, 
video captures of the moment in detail circulated quickly on the internet. 
The NFL, embarrassed by the incident, permanently banned MTV from conducting 
future halftime shows. This also led to the FCC tightening controls on 
indecency and fining CBS and CBS-owned stations a total of $550,000 for 
the incident. The fine was later reversed in July 2008. CBS and MTV eventually 
split into two separate companies in part because of the fiasco,[citation 
needed] with CBS going under the control of CBS Corporation and MTV falling 
under the banner of Viacom (although both corporations remain under the 
ownership of National Amusements). For six years following the incident, 
all of the performers in Super Bowl halftime shows were artists associated 
with the classic rock genre of the 1970s and 1980s (including three acts 
from the British Invasion of the 1960s), with only one act playing the 
entire halftime show. Paul McCartney (formerly of The Beatles) played Super 
Bowl XXXIX in 2005, The Rolling Stones played Super Bowl XL in 2006, and 
The Who played Super Bowl XLIV in 2010. The halftime show returned to a 
modern act in 2011 with The Black Eyed Peas. But during the halftime show 
of Super Bowl XLVI in 2012, M.I.A. gave the middle finger during a performance 
of "Give Me All Your Luvin'" with Madonna, which was caught by TV cameras. 
An attempt to censor the gesture by blurring the entire screen came late.[39] 
Excluding Super Bowl XXXIX, the famous "I'm going to Disney World!" advertising 
campaign took place at every Super Bowl since Super Bowl XXI, when quarterback 
Phil Simms from the New York Giants became the first player to say the 
tagline. As of Super Bowl XLVIII, 27 of 49 Super Bowls have been played 
in three cities: New Orleans (ten times), the Greater Miami area (ten times), 
and the Greater Los Angeles area (seven times). No market or region without 
an NFL franchise has ever hosted a Super Bowl, and the presence of an NFL 
team in a market or region is now a de jure requirement for bidding on 
the game.[40][41] The winning market is not, however, required to host 
the Super Bowl in the same stadium that its NFL team uses, and nine Super 
Bowls have been held in a stadium other than the one the NFL team in that 
city was using at the time. Los Angeles's last five Super Bowls were all 
played at the Rose Bowl. No team has ever played the Super Bowl in its 
home stadium. Two teams have played the Super Bowl in their home market: 
the San Francisco 49ers, who played Super Bowl XIX in Stanford Stadium 
instead of Candlestick Park; and the Los Angeles Rams, who played Super 
Bowl XIV in the Rose Bowl instead of the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. 
In both cases, the stadium in which the Super Bowl was held was perceived 
to be a better stadium for a large, high-profile event than the stadiums 
the Rams and 49ers were playing in at the time; this situation has not 
arisen since 1993, in part because the league has traditionally awarded 
the Super Bowl in modern times to the newest stadiums. Besides those two, 
the only other Super Bowl venue that was not the home stadium to an NFL 
team at the time was Rice Stadium in Houston: the Houston Oilers had played 
there previously, but moved to the Astrodome several years prior to Super 
Bowl VIII. The Orange Bowl was the only AFL stadium to host a Super Bowl 
and the only stadium to host consecutive Super Bowls, hosting Super Bowls 
II and III. Traditionally, the NFL does not award Super Bowls to stadiums 
that are located in climates with an expected average daily temperature 
less than 50 °F (10 °C) on game day unless the field can be completely 
covered by a fixed or retractable roof. Five Super Bowls have been played 
in northern cities: two in the Detroit area—Super Bowl XVI at Pontiac Silverdome 
in Pontiac, Michigan and Super Bowl XL at Ford Field in Detroit, one in 
Minneapolis—Super Bowl XXVI, one in Indianapolis at Lucas Oil Stadium for 
Super Bowl XLVI, and one in the New York area—Super Bowl XLVIII at MetLife 
Stadium. Only MetLife Stadium did not have a roof (be it fixed or retractable) 
but it was still picked as the host stadium for Super Bowl XLVIII in an 
apparent waiver of the warm-climate rule. A sixth Super Bowl is planned 
in a northern city as Minneapolis has been picked to host Super Bowl LII 
in 2018 in the roofed U.S. Bank Stadium.[42] There have been a few instances 
where the league has rescinded the Super Bowl from cities. Super Bowl XXVII 
in 1993 was originally awarded to Sun Devil Stadium in Tempe, Arizona, 
but after Arizona voters elected not to recognize Martin Luther King, Jr. 
Day as a paid state-employee's holiday in 1990, the NFL moved the game 
to the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California.[43] When voters in Arizona opted 
to create such a legal holiday in 1992, Super Bowl XXX in 1996 was awarded 
to Tempe. Super Bowl XXXIII was awarded first to Candlestick Park in San 
Francisco, but when plans to renovate the stadium fell through the game 
was moved to Pro Player Stadium in greater Miami. Super Bowl XXXVII was 
awarded to a new stadium not yet built in San Francisco, when that stadium 
failed to be built, the game was moved to San Diego. Super Bowl XLIV, slated 
for February 7, 2010, was withdrawn from New York City's proposed West 
Side Stadium, because the city, state, and proposed tenants New York Jets 
could not agree on funding. Super Bowl XLIV was then eventually awarded 
to Sun Life Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida. And Super Bowl XLIX in 2015 
was originally given to Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Missouri, but 
after two sales taxes failed to pass at the ballot box, and opposition 
by local business leaders and politicians increased, Kansas City eventually 
withdrew its request to host the game.[44] Super Bowl XLIX was then eventually 
awarded to University of Phoenix Stadium in Glendale, Arizona. In 2011, 
Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott said, "It's commonly known as the single 
largest human trafficking incident in the United States." According to 
Forbes, 10,000 prostitutes were brought to Miami in 2010 for the Super 
Bowl.[45] Snopes research in 2015 determined that the actual number of 
prostitutes involved in a typical Super Bowl weekend is less than 100, 
not statistically higher than any other time of the year, and that the 
notion of mass increases in human trafficking around the Super Bowl was 
a politician's myth.[46] The location of the Super Bowl is chosen by the 
NFL well in advance, usually three to five years before the game. Cities 
place bids to host a Super Bowl and are evaluated in terms of stadium renovation 
and their ability to host.[47] In 2014, a document listing the specific 
requirements of Super Bowl hosts was leaked, giving a clear list of what 
was required for a Super Bowl host.[48] Much of the cost of the Super Bowl 
is to be assumed by the host community, although some costs are enumerated 
within the requirements to be assumed by the NFL. Some of the host requirements 
include: The NFL owners meet to make a selection on the site, usually three 
years prior to the event. In 2007, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell suggested 
that a Super Bowl might be played in London, perhaps at Wembley Stadium.[50] 
The game has never been played in a region that lacks an NFL franchise; 
seven Super Bowls have been played in Los Angeles, but none since the Los 
Angeles Raiders and Los Angeles Rams relocated to Oakland and St. Louis 
respectively in 1995. New Orleans, the site of the 2013 Super Bowl, invested 
more than $1 billion in infrastructure improvements in the years leading 
up to the game.[51] The designated "home team" alternates between the NFC 
team in odd-numbered games and the AFC team in even-numbered games.[52][53] 
This alternation was initiated with the first Super Bowl, when the Green 
Bay Packers were the designated home team. Regardless of being the home 
or away team of record, each team has their team wordmark painted in one 
of the end zones. Designated away teams have won 29 of 50 Super Bowls to 
date (58 percent). Since Super Bowl XIII in January 1979, the home team 
is given the choice of wearing their colored or white jerseys. Originally, 
the designated home team had to wear their colored jerseys, which resulted 
in Dallas donning their less exposed dark blue jerseys for Super Bowl V. 
While most of the home teams in the Super Bowl have chosen to wear their 
colored jerseys, there have been five exceptions: the Cowboys during Super 
Bowl XIII and XXVII, the Washington Redskins during Super Bowl XVII, the 
Pittsburgh Steelers during Super Bowl XL, and the Denver Broncos in Super 
Bowl 50. The Cowboys, since 1964, and Redskins, with the arrival of coach 
Joe Gibbs in 1981,[needs update] have traditionally worn white jerseys 
at home. Meanwhile, the Steelers, who have always worn their black jerseys 
at home since the AFL-NFL merger in 1970, opted for the white jerseys after 
winning three consecutive playoff games on the road, wearing white. The 
Steelers' decision was compared with the New England Patriots in Super 
Bowl XX; the Patriots had worn white jerseys at home during the 1985 season, 
but after winning road playoff games against the New York Jets and Miami 
Dolphins wearing red jerseys, New England opted to switch to red for the 
Super Bowl as the designated home team. For the Broncos in Super Bowl 50, 
Denver general manager John Elway simply stated, "We've had Super Bowl 
success in our white uniforms"; they previously had been 0–4 in Super Bowls 
when wearing their orange jerseys.[54][55] The Broncos' decision is also 
perceived to be made out of superstition, losing all Super Bowl games with 
the orange jerseys in terrible fashion. White-shirted teams have won 32 
of 50 Super Bowls to date (64 percent). Fifteen different regions have 
hosted Super Bowls. Note: Years listed are the year the game was actually 
played (will be played) rather than what NFL season it is considered to 
have been. A total of twenty-six different stadiums, five of which no longer 
exist and two of which do not yet exist, have hosted or are scheduled to 
host Super Bowls. Years listed in the table below are the years the game 
was actually played (will be played) rather than what NFL season it is 
considered to have been. ^ Stadium is now demolished. ‡ Miami Gardens became 
a separate city in 2003. Prior to, the stadium had a Miami address. † The 
original Stanford Stadium, which hosted Super Bowl XIX, was demolished 
and replaced with a new stadium in 2006. * Future Super Bowl sites: The 
game has never been played in a region that lacked an NFL franchise. London, 
England has occasionally been mentioned as a host city for a Super Bowl 
in the near future.[58] Wembley Stadium has hosted several NFL games as 
part of the NFL International Series and is specifically designed for large, 
individual events. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell has openly discussed 
the possibility on different occasions.[59][60][61][62] Time zone complications 
are a significant obstacle to a Super Bowl in London; a typical 6:30 p.m. 
Eastern Time start would result in the game beginning at 11:30 p.m. local 
time in London, an unusually late hour to be holding spectator sports (the 
NFL has never in its history started a game later than 9:15 p.m. local 
time).[62] As bids have been submitted for all Super Bowls through Super 
Bowl LV, the soonest that any stadium outside the NFL's footprint could 
serve as host would be Super Bowl LVI in 2022. The NFL is very active on 
stopping what it says is unauthorized commercial use of its trademarked 
terms "NFL", "Super Bowl", and "Super Sunday".[63] As a result, many events 
and promotions tied to the game, but not sanctioned by the NFL, are asked 
to refer to it with colloquialisms such as "The Big Game", or other generic 
descriptions.[64] A radio spot for Planters nuts parodied this, by saying 
"it would be super...to have a bowl...of Planters nuts while watching the 
big game!" and comedian Stephen Colbert began referring to the game in 
2014 as the "Superb Owl". In 2015, the NFL filed opposition with the USPTO 
Trademark Trial and Appeal Board to a trademark application submitted by 
an Arizona-based nonprofit for "Superb Owl".[65] The NFL claims that the 
use of the phrase "Super Bowl" implies an NFL affiliation, and on this 
basis the league asserts broad rights to restrict how the game may be shown 
publicly; for example, the league says Super Bowl showings are prohibited 
in churches or at other events that "promote a message", while venues that 
do not regularly show sporting events cannot show the Super Bowl on any 
television screen larger than 55 inches.[66] Some critics say the NFL is 
exaggerating its ownership rights by stating that "any use is prohibited", 
as this contradicts the broad doctrine of fair use in the United States.[66] 
Legislation was proposed by Utah Senator Orrin Hatch in 2008 "to provide 
an exemption from exclusive rights in copyright for certain nonprofit organizations 
to display live football games", and "for other purposes".[67] In 2006, 
the NFL made an attempt to trademark "The Big Game" as well; however, it 
withdrew the application in 2007 due to growing commercial and public-relations 
opposition to the move, mostly from Stanford University and the University 
of California, Berkeley and their fans, as the Stanford Cardinal football 
and California Golden Bears football teams compete in the Big Game, which 
has been played since 1892 (28 years before the formation of the NFL and 
75 years before Super Bowl I).[68] Additionally, the Mega Millions lottery 
game was known as The Big Game from 1996 to 2002.[69] Like the other major 
professional leagues in the United States, the winner of the Super Bowl 
is usually declared "world champions", a title often mocked by non-Americans.[70][71] 
Others feel the title is fitting, since it is the only professional league 
of its kind.[72] The practice by the U.S. major leagues of using the "World 
Champion" moniker originates from the World Series of professional baseball,[citation 
needed] and it was later used during the first three Super Bowls when they 
were referred to as AFL-NFL World Championship Games. The phrase is still
