This sports historic article is about the Major League Baseball franchise 
St. Louis Cardinals. For the National Football League franchise while it

People Overview Grounds Teams The St. Louis Cardinals, a professional baseball 
franchise based in St. Louis, Missouri, compete in the National League 
(NL) of Major League Baseball (MLB). In 1953, the Anheuser-Busch (AB) brewery 
bought the Cardinals, and August "Gussie" Busch became team president. 
Busch's influence is still seen today as three of the Cardinals' home stadia 
are or were named some form of Busch Stadium. Three World Series titles 
in the 1960s and 1980s, contrasted with missing the playoffs for the entirety 
of the 1950s and 1970s checkered the team's success distinctly by decades. 
However, the team still remained generally competitive in each of those 
decades - they did not see a last place finish until 1990, which had been 
the first since 1918. With Busch's tenure as owner, the Cardinals also 
won six NL pennants.[1] Soon after AB purchased the team, Busch bought 
Sportsman's Park from St. Louis Browns owner Bill Veeck, renovated it, 
and renamed it Busch Stadium.[2][3] The Browns, who had not been as successful 
or popular as the Cardinals in three decades, realized they could not compete 
with the deep pockets of the brewery.[4] After the 1953 season the Browns 
left St. Louis to become the Baltimore Orioles (but kept the same colors), 
leaving the Cardinals as the only major league team in town.[5] With the 
breaking of the color barrier that had started in 1947, in 1954, the Cardinals 
débuted the first African-American player on the Major League club.[6] 
Conversely, as the Cardinals had just begun to bring on non-white players 
to play for them. Others such as Bob Gibson,[7] Lou Brock[8] and Curt Flood[9] 
led the competitive Cardinals clubs of the 1960s. The Cardinals' dissolution 
of the color barrier actualized a new phase when they became the first 
Major League organization to integrate spring training housing, albeit 
reluctantly.[10] Between 1954 and 1959, the Cardinals finished below the 
.500 mark in four of five seasons. In 1954, Wally Moon replaced the popular 
Enos Slaughter in center field and won the first Rookie of the Year (ROY) 
award in franchise history with a .304 batting average, twelve home runs 
and 193 hits.[11] Replacing Moon in center––who shifted to right field––Bill 
Virdon was voted ROY the next season.[12] In 1957, the Cardinals finished 
in second place, leading the league in batting average (.274) and finishing 
third in earned run average (3.78).[13] Meanwhile, a National Football 
League (NFL) Cardinals franchise relocated from Chicago to St. Louis in 
1960. Chicago was distinctly becoming the Bears' town and the Cardinals 
could not match their success. The 12 NFL owners unanimously voted to allow 
the Chicago Cardinals franchise to move.[14] Ironically, Chicago forms 
the other half of the MLB's Cardinals' baseball rivalry with the Cubs.[15] 
The football Cardinals called St. Louis and Busch Stadium/Busch Memorial 
Stadium home through the 1987 season, after which the Cardinals migrated 
to Phoenix to become the Arizona Cardinals.[16][17] Local sports fans and 
media coverage referred to the two teams as the "baseball Cardinals" and 
"football Cardinals." For decades before the NFL Cardinals moved into St. 
Louis, the baseball team was also known as the "Redbirds," while the football 
team was the "Gridbirds" or "Big Red."[18] "Here stands baseball's perfect 
warrior. Here stands baseball's perfect knight." Stan Musial remained St. 
Louis' most consistent player, winning seven batting titles and gaining 
election to the Major League Baseball All-Star Game every year from 1946 
until his retirement in 1963, which ironically was the last year before 
the Cardinals' next World Series appearance and win.[20] In 1958, Musial 
became the eighth player in Major League Baseball history to accumulate 
3,000 hits.[21] In 1968, the Cardinals erected a statue of Musial outside 
of Busch Memorial Stadium[22] that was moved to the new Busch Stadium in 
2006[23] and is inscribed with this quote: "Here stands baseball's perfect 
warrior. Here stands baseball's perfect knight."[22] President Barack Obama 
bestowed Musial with the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2011.[24][25] 
The Cardinals returned to the top in the 1960s with the help of a franchise-altering 
trade and the emergence of a dominating pitcher. In 1964 the Cardinals 
traded pitcher Ernie Broglio and two other players to the rival Cubs for 
outfielder Lou Brock and two other players.[27][28][29] The trade, since 
nicknamed "Brock for Broglio", has become emblematic of trades which in 
retrospect are ridiculously lopsided; from it, the Cardinals gained substantially.[30] 
Brock successfully replaced Musial, who had retired at the end of 1963, 
in left field.[20][31] Later that season, a procession of events off the 
field induced events on the field. Busch, impatient that the team had not 
caught up with the Philadelphia Phillies, fired GM Bing Devine in August.[32] 
Although he had considered firing manager Johnny Keane, Busch relented; 
however, he secretly met with Leo Durocher to offer him the manager position 
for the next season.[33][34] Word of the meeting leaked to Keane.[35] Resolutely 
propelled by Brock, MVP third baseman Ken Boyer and 19-game winner Bob 
Gibson, the Cardinals beset the Phillies to relinquish a 6 1⁄2 game lead 
with 12 to play, and St. Louis won the league pennant.[26][29][36] Next, 
the Cardinals met and defeated the New York Yankees in the 1964 World Series 
as Gibson was named series MVP.[36][37] Busch changed his mind about firing 
Keane after the Series, but Keane, affronted about the way he and Devine 
were treated, instead accepted the manager position with the Yankees.[38] 
Red Schoendienst succeeded Keane as manager.[39] Three years later, regretting 
Devine's firing, Busch successfully negotiated his return with the New 
York Mets to bring him back as GM.[40] In 1966, the Cardinals moved to 
the just-completed Busch Memorial Stadium and hosted the MLB All-Star Game 
that summer. Behind the performance of MVP Orlando Cepeda the next year, 
St. Louis won 101 regular season games, the league, and the World Series 
over the Red Sox. Gibson pitched three complete-game wins - allowing just 
three earned runs - and was named World Series MVP for the second time. 
In 1968 - nicknamed the "Year of the Pitcher" because of the domination 
of pitching over hitting throughout the majors - Gibson proved to be the 
most dominant of all. His earned run average of 1.12 is a live-ball era 
record (he allowed only 38 earned runs in 304 2⁄3 innings pitched), garnering 
him both the NL Cy Young Award and the NL MVP Award.[41] Fueled by Gibson's 
historic season, the Cardinals led the Major Leagues in staff ERA at 2.49 
and faced the Detroit Tigers in the World Series.[42] Gibson again pitched 
three complete games and set a World Series record with 35 strikeouts, 
including a single-game World Series record 17 in Game 1, but ended up 
losing the deciding Game 7.[43] Following the 1968 season, Major League 
Baseball implemented realignment by splitting both the National and the 
American Leagues into "East" and "West" divisions to coincide with the 
expansion of four teams. The Cardinals, along with the Chicago Cubs, were 
placed in the National League East division, thus helping to maintain the 
strength of their rivalry.[44] Although the Cardinals remained competitive 
in the 1970s, their best season was 1971, when they won 90 games and finished 
second in the NL East. They also finished second in 1973 and 1974 and with 
a .500 record or better six times.[1] The decade featured crucial links 
to the division rival Philadelphia Phillies. First, before the 1970 season, 
Flood refused a trade to Philadelphia, challenging the reserve clause and 
eventually helping to bring about free agency.[45] Second, due to a salary 
dispute, Steve Carlton was traded to the Phillies for fellow pitcher Rick 
Wise, which like the Brock trade turned out to be lopsided, but this time 
left the Cardinals on the wrong end.[46] Led by Carlton, the Phillies won 
three division titles before the end of the decade.[47] Gibson won a second 
Cy Young Award in 1970, and Joe Torre and Keith Hernández each won a NL 
MVP Award in 1971 and 1979 respectively.[36][48][49][50] Ted Simmons became 
one of the top hitting catchers in team history, batting .298, finishing 
in the top ten in team history in home runs, RBIs, extra base hits, walks, 
among others; and appearing in six All-Star games and receiving MVP votes 
six times.[51][52] Gibson retired as the franchise career leader, among 
other categories, in wins (251), strikeouts (3117) and shutouts (56).[53] 
Brock set the modern-day (since 1898) stolen base record of 118 in 1974, 
since eclipsed by only Rickey Henderson in 1982, and is second all-time 
to Henderson in career stolen bases with 938.[54][55][56] Brock also collected 
his 3,000th hit in 1979, and is the franchise leader in stolen bases (888), 
and is second in franchise history in hits (2713) and runs scored (1427).[52][57] 
In 1980, Busch hired Whitey Herzog to manage the Cardinals. He became known 
for a style of play known as Whiteyball that catered to Busch Stadium's 
Astroturf to maximize speed, defense and pitching.[58] Herzog's multifaceted 
operations emphasized pitching, line drive gap hitters for the exaggerated 
bouncing effects of the Astroturf, working the count to get on base, stealing 
bases, the hit and run, hitting the ball the other way, bunting, and smooth, 
fleet-footed fielders—essentially expanding small ball large.[59] He also 
built lineups around a primary power hitter, such as Jack Clark, with one 
or two others for protection.[60] Other players that drove this style of 
play included outfielders Lonnie Smith,[61] Willie McGee (1985 NL MVP who 
won two batting titles in a Cardinals uniform),[62] Andy Van Slyke,[63] 
and Vince Coleman;[64] infielders Keith Hernández,[50] George Hendrick,[65] 
Terry Pendleton,[66] José Oquendo,[67] Darrell Porter,[68] Tom Herr,[69] 
and Ozzie Smith;[70] and pitchers John Tudor,[71] Bruce Sutter,[72] Bob 
Forsch[73] and Joaquín Andújar.[74] One of the most successful managers 
in team history, Herzog's Cardinals operated on lower payrolls and won 
the league three times and the World Series once.[58][75][76] The 1980 
team featured one of the best offensive units in the league. They paced 
the NL in eight offensive categories including runs scored (738), batting 
average (.275), on-base percentage (.328), slugging percentage (.400) and 
featured six players who tallied 275 plate appearances or more and hit 
over .300. Thus the 1980 Cardinals set the record for the most Silver Slugger 
Award winners in one season (five) in the award's inaugural season: Hernández 
(first base), Garry Templeton (shortstop), Hendrick (outfielder), Ted Simmons 
(catcher), and Forsch (pitcher).[50][51][65][73][77][78] However, they 
were an overall disappointment, finishing last in pitching and going through 
four managers.[79] St. Louis returned to their winning ways in 1981, but 
missed the playoffs in the strike-shortened season despite posting the 
best overall record in the NL East (59-43).[80] A one year-only change 
in the playoff format declared two half-season division champions rather 
than one division champion at the end of the season.[81] The Cardinals 
finished in second place in each half of the split season.[82] Between 
1981 and 1984, Sutter saved 132 games and twice finished in third place 
in the Cy Young Award balloting.[72] Forsch, Tudor, and Joaquín each anchored 
the Cardinals' rotation.[71][73] Joaquín won 20 or more games in both 1984 
and 1985.[74] Just like in 1964, another key trade significantly altered 
the direction of the franchise and propelled the Cardinals back to the 
top. Before the 1982 season, the Cardinals swapped shortstops with the 
San Diego Padres: Templeton was shipped for Ozzie Smith, another player 
for whom the Whiteyball strategy was tailor-made: "The Wizard" won thirteen 
Gold Gloves.[70][83] The Cardinals won the 1982 World Series over the Milwaukee 
Brewers.[84] For his hitting excellence in the NLCS (.556 batting average) 
and the World Series, Porter was awarded both the NLCS MVP and the World 
Series MVP.[68] On September 26, 1983, Forsch hurled his second career 
no-hitter as a Cardinal, becoming the first and only player in team history 
to do so.[85] That season, the Cardinals set a team record with 207 stolen 
bases. The next season, on their way to again breaking their stolen bases 
(220), the Cardinals also became the first team since the 1916 St. Louis 
Browns to record 200 or more stolen bases three years in a row.[3] In 1985, 
the Cardinals met cross-state rivals Kansas City Royals for the first time 
in a non-exhibition setting. They won 101 regular-season games and the 
league behind the MVP performance of center fielder Willie McGee (he led 
the league in batting (.353), triples (18) and hits (216)),[62] and Tudor's 
21 wins and 10 shutouts.[71] Rookie of the Year left fielder Vince Coleman 
dramatically increased the speed of an already larcenous team, pilfering 
a major-league leading 110 bases on the way to a new team record of 314.[58][64][86] 
After defeating the Los Angeles Dodgers in the 1985 NLCS, the Cardinals 
reached the World Series to face the Royals.[87] The series was nicknamed 
the "I-70 Series" after the highway that connects the two in-state rivals.[3] 
The Royals won in seven games, but the infamous blown call by umpire Don 
Denkinger in Game 6 proved pivotal. In the 9th inning, the Cardinals, who 
had a 3 games to 2 advantage over the Royals, were leading 1–0 and three 
outs away from winning the Series when Denkinger's call on a play at first 
base sparked a Kansas City rally.[88] The Royals won the game by a score 
of 2–1, and went on to defeat the Cardinals in the seventh and deciding 
game.[89][90] Incidentally, after the Cardinals traded outfielder Lonnie 
Smith to the Royals on May 17, he stung them for a .333 batting average 
in the Series.[61] In 1987, Herzog made McGee his number-five hitter, and 
he responded well to this unconventional choice, driving in 105 runs despite 
hitting only 11 home runs.[62] Coleman became the first player to steal 
100 or more bases in each of his first three seasons in the major leagues.[3] 
The Cardinals reached the 1987 World Series, losing to the Minnesota Twins 
in seven games.[91] Decimated by injuries to key players such as Clark 
and Pendleton, St. Louis found it difficult to keep up with the high-powered 
Twins offense.[3] This series was the first World Series in which the home 
team won every game—it happened again four years later when the Twins defeated 
the Atlanta Braves.[92] It was also the only World Series where one pitcher 
started Games One and Seven, but none of the others in between—that was 
rookie Joe Magrane. In 1989, Coleman registered yet another stolen base 
record by swiping 50 consecutive bases without being caught.[3] Pedro Guerrero 
led the team with .311 batting average and 117 RBIs and batted .400 with 
runners in scoring position.[93][94][95] That year, the team set a then-attendance 
record of 3,080,980.[3] In September, Busch died, concluding the longest 
tenure of ownership in team history at 37 years.[96] The brewery assumed 
control of the team, but the Cardinals' competitiveness had started to 
ebb and continued to do so until AB sold them in 1995.[97] Herzog continued 
managing the Cardinals until abruptly resigning less than one year after 
Busch's death.[98] In addition to the World Series title and three NL pennants, 
Herzog won the 1985 NL Manager of the Year award and guided the Cardinals 
to 822 regular season wins against 728 losses for a .530 winning percentage.[76]
