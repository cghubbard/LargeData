As Player As Manager Harry Duffield Stovey (December 20, 1856 – September 
20, 1937), born Harry Duffield Stowe, was a 19th-century Major League Baseball 
player and the first player in major league history to hit 100 home runs. 
Born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Stovey played for 14 seasons in the 
majors and was appointed player-manager on two separate occasions during 
his career.[1] Known today as both a prolific home run hitter and base-stealer, 
he led the league in both categories multiple times in his career, including 
a season record of 14 home runs in 1883[2] and a league-leading 97 stolen 
bases in 1890. From 1880 to 1891 he appeared in the top 10 in home runs 
every year except 1887, and led the league five times.[3] He was the first 
to wear sliding pads and among the first to slide feet first.[4] Harry 
began his career as an outfielder / first baseman in 1880 for the Worcester 
Ruby Legs under the surname of Stovey instead of his birth name of Stowe 
due to his desire to keep his family from discovering he was making his 
career at baseball, which was seen at the time as not a respectable profession.[5] 
He made an immediate impact that first season, leading the league with 
14 triples and six home runs, while also finishing in the top ten in many 
other offensive categories.[3] On July 17, he hit his first major league 
home run off Jim McCormick of the Cleveland Blues.[6] For the 1881 season, 
his offensive numbers did not slow down, again finishing in the top ten 
in several offensive categories, though he did not lead the league in any 
this time around.[3] On August 17, 1881, Worcester suspended Captain Mike 
Dorgan‚ and Stovey took over the position for the remainder of the season. 
Lee Richmond‚ who had quit because of conflicts with Dorgan‚ rejoined the 
team after this switch.[6] In 1882, his last season for the Ruby Legs, 
his batting average saw an increase, up to .289 from the .270 the year 
before, but his numbers in relation to the rest of the league took a slight 
dip. He ranked third in the league in runs scored, with 90, and fourth 
in the league in home runs, with five.[3] For the 1883 season, Stovey moved 
on to play for the Philadelphia Athletics of the American Association, 
and it was during the next seven years when he had his best years, and 
made his greatest impact on the game. His first season in Philadelphia 
saw him set the single season record for home runs with 14, breaking the 
old mark of nine set by Charley Jones in 1879. He kept this record for 
only one season, as Ned Williamson set a new mark the very next season 
with 27.[2] Not only did he set the home run record, he batted .306, and 
led the league in runs scored with 110, doubles with 31, and games played 
with 112, while also finishing in the top five in most offensive categories.[3] 
The offensive explosiveness continued throughout his stay in Philadelphia, 
leading the league in runs scored four times, doubles once, triples three 
times, and home runs three times. The accumulation of home runs led to 
him becoming the career home run leader, overtaking Charley Jones[2] with 
his 51st career homer on September 28, 1885.[6] He held onto the career 
lead for a season until he was passed for a short period of time by Dan 
Brouthers for the 1886 and the 1887 seasons. Stovey regained the lead, 
and held it until Roger Connor passed him in 1895.[2] In 1890, the Players' 
League, a rival league to the National League and the American Association, 
began, and it attracted many of the game's star players, including Stovey 
who "jumped" to the Boston Reds.[1] He had a good season, batting .299, 
hit 11 triples, and 12 home runs.[3] On September 3, 1890, Stovey became 
the first player to hit 100 homers for a career, off of Jersey Bakely in 
a game against Cleveland, a significant milestone in a day when home runs 
were relatively rare.[6] After the 1890 season, the Players' League folded 
with many of the players returning to their former ballclubs. Stovey‚ who 
played with the A's in 1889, was not claimed by that club through a clerical 
error, so on February 5, 1891, he signed with the Boston Beaneaters of 
the National League.[6] He led the league that season with 16 home runs, 
and 20 triples, while also hitting .279 with 31 doubles as well. It proved 
to be last great season of his career.[3] He played only 38 games for the 
Beaneaters in 1892, before he was released on June 20, but he was quickly 
signed by the Baltimore Orioles. He finished the season with a .272 batting 
average with the Orioles and hit 11 triples,[3] including three in one 
game on July 21 in a 10–3 victory over the Pittsburgh Pirates.[6] The 1893 
season was Stovey's last season in the majors. He was released by the Orioles 
on May 22 after only eight games, and was signed three days later on May 
15 by the Brooklyn Grooms. He finished the season with Grooms and retired 
after the season was over.[3] After his career, Stovey became a police 
officer in New Bedford, Massachusetts.[7] Stovey died at the age of 80 
in New Bedford, and is interred at Oak Grove Cemetery.[1] The Nineteenth 
Century Committee of the Society for American Baseball Research named Stovey
