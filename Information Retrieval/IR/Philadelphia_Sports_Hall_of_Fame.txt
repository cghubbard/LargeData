The Philadelphia Sports Hall of Fame is a nonprofit organization in Philadelphia, 
Pennsylvania, U.S., that was established in May 2002, to honor individuals 
and groups who are either area natives who became prominent in the field 
of sports or who became prominent in the field of sports in the region.[1][2] 
From 2004 to 2010, the organization also presented an annual "Pride of 
Philadelphia Award" to a team or individual.[3] Individuals, Teams, Venues, 
Events, and Organizations are all eligible. Generally they must have gained 
national prominence as individuals or venues while attached to the Philadelphia 
region, or won a championship as a team from the Philadelphia region. Individuals 
are eligible for induction five years after retirement from a playing career. 
When an individual dies, he or she becomes immediately eligible.[4] An 
individual who was not an athlete may be inducted in the following categories: 
Legacy of Excellence, Lifetime Commitment, Philadelphia Medal. The Pride 
of Philadelphia Award is given to teams or individuals who have "represented 
the Philadelphia area with dignity, determination, and class through athletic 
achievement."[3] The hall of fame's website has a page that honors every 
Greater Philadelphia team—college and professional—that won the championship 
in its particular sport.[7] The Foundation formed Hall of Fame Charities 
in 2004. It supports or has formed partnerships with organizations in the 
Greater Philadelphia area that promote youth sports, especially at the 
pre-teen, grade-school level. These organizations include: Richie Ashburn 
Baseball Foundation, Police Athletic League (PAL) Junior Golf, Arthur Ashe 
Youth Tennis and Education, Bruce Simon Southampton Summer Basketball Camp, 
The First Tee of Philadelphia, and Ed Snider Youth Hockey Foundation.[8] 
Hall of Fame Charities also has student[9] and community[10] programs.
