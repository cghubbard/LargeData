Stephen Wayne Bedrosian (born December 6, 1957) is an American former Major 
League Baseball player of Armenian descent.[1] Nicknamed "Bedrock", he 
played from 1981 to 1995 with the Atlanta Braves, Philadelphia Phillies, 
San Francisco Giants, and Minnesota Twins. Bedrosian won the 1987 National 
League Cy Young Award. At University of New Haven Bedrosian put up a career 
record of 13-3 and 3 saves. He helped the Chargers to a third-place finish 
in the 1978 College World Series. He was then drafted by the Atlanta Braves 
in the 1978 MLB draft. In 1985, his only full season as a starter, Bedrosian 
went 7–15 and set a Major League record for most starts in a single season 
without a complete game (37).[2] Bedrosian was traded by the Braves to 
the Phillies in the off-season and was converted to a reliever before the 
1986 season. In his first year in relief, he saved 29 games. His best season 
came in 1987 when he posted a 5–3 record for the Phillies with a 2.83 earned 
run average, recorded a league-leading 40 saves, and was named the National 
League Cy Young Award winner.[3] Since Bedrosian, only three other relievers 
(Mark Davis, Dennis Eckersley and Éric Gagné) have won Cy Young honors. 
He was traded to the Giants during the 1989 season to help their pennant 
drive that year.[4] In 1990, he won the Willie Mac Award, voted upon by 
his teammates, honoring his spirit and leadership (his then two-year-old 
son, Cody was battling leukemia).[citation needed] As a member of the Minnesota 
Twins, Bedrosian faced his former team the Braves in the 1991 World Series. 
The Minnesota Twins won in seven games. Currently, Bedrosian resides in 
Newnan, Georgia, where he served on the Coweta County board of education, 
through 2010, and is an assistant baseball coach at East Coweta High School. 
In 2008, Bedrosian was inducted into the Coweta Sports Hall of Fame.[5] 
Bedrosian has also been inducted into the University of New Haven Hall 
of Fame.[6] Bedrosian has four sons: Cameron, who plays for the Los Angeles 
Angels, drafted by them in the 2010 MLB draft; Kyle, who played for Mercer 
University and is a pitching coach at local baseball academy Home Plate; 
Cody; and Carson, who also played for East Coweta High. Bedrosian was referenced 
in the It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia "A Very Sunny Christmas" episode.
