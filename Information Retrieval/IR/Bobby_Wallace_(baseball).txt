As player As manager Roderick John "Bobby" Wallace (November 4, 1873 – 
November 3, 1960) was a Major League Baseball infielder, pitcher, manager, 
umpire, and scout. Wallace was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He made 
his major league debut in 1894 as a starting pitcher with the Cleveland 
Spiders. After a 12–14 record in 1895, Wallace played outfield and pitcher 
in 1896. In 1897, Wallace was an everyday player as he became the team's 
full-time third baseman, batted .335 and drove in 112 runs. In 1899, Wallace 
moved to the St. Louis Perfectos (renamed the Cardinals in 1900) and changed 
position to shortstop. He hit .295 with 108 RBI and 12 home runs (second 
in the league behind Buck Freeman's 25). Wallace changed teams again in 
1902, when he joined the St. Louis Browns. His playing time began decreasing 
a decade later, with his last season as a regular coming in 1912. Wallace 
played in just 55 games in 1913, and never played that much again for the 
rest of his career. In July 1917, he returned to the National League and 
the Cardinals, and played in just eight games that season. After batting 
.153 in 32 games in 1918, Wallace retired with a .268 career batting average, 
1059 runs, 34 home runs, 1121 RBI and 201 stolen bases. He played his last 
game on September 2, 1918 at the age of 44 years and 312 days, making him 
the oldest shortstop to play in a regular-season game.[1] The record was 
broken by Omar Vizquel on May 7, 2012. Wallace was generally recognized 
as the AL's best shortstop from 1902 to 1911, when he served briefly as 
Browns player-manager. He played for 24 seasons, and holds the record for 
the longest career by a player who never played in a World Series. When 
his playing time diminished, Wallace managed and umpired. He managed the 
St. Louis Browns in 1911 and 1912 and the Cincinnati Reds during part of 
the 1937 season. He compiled 62 wins and 154 losses for a .287 winning 
percentage as a major league manager. He also managed the minor league 
Wichita Witches in 1917. He umpired in the American League in 1915, working 
111 games. Upon retiring, he also became a scout. Wallace was inducted
