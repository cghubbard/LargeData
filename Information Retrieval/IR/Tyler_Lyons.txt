Tyler William Lyons (born February 21, 1988) is an American professional 
baseball pitcher for the St. Louis Cardinals of Major League Baseball (MLB). 
He attended Oklahoma State University (OSU) at Stillwater and played college 
baseball for the Cowboys. The New York Yankees selected him in the 10th 
round of the 2009 amateur draft, but he chose to remain at OSU. The next 
year, the Cardinals made him a ninth round pick, and he signed. Lyons made 
his major league debut on May 22, 2013. In 2011, while pitching for the 
Palm Beach Cardinals of the Florida State League in the minor leagues, 
Lyons completed the first no-hitter in team history. He is a three-time 
recipient of the Pacific Coast League Pitcher of the Week Award. Tyler 
Lyons, son of Monte and Lori Lyons, was born in Lubbock, Texas. He and 
his two siblings, Clay and Bailey, were raised in the Lubbock area, where 
Tyler attended Frenship High School. [1] Lyons was a multi-sport athlete 
for the Frenship Tigers, lettering in football three years and being selected 
as an "all-state" quarterback his senior year.[1] On the baseball field, 
Tyler Lyons was a two-time district MVP and was named "All-City Player 
of the Year" his senior season by the Lubbock Avalanche-Journal.[1] After 
giving consideration to attending Texas Tech University after high school, 
he instead chose Oklahoma State University.[1] Lyons majored in sport management 
at Oklahoma State while also starring on the baseball diamond for the Cowboys 
from 2007 to 2010.[1] In 2008 he posted twelve wins, fourth best nationally 
that year, while earning second-team All-Big 12 honors. He remained strong 
in the classroom as well, being named first-team Academic All-Big 12.[1] 
In the summer of 2008, Lyons was chosen to play for Team USA. His eleven 
appearances without giving up an earned run helped the team to a 24-0 record 
and a gold medal in the FISU World Championships.[1] In 2009 Lyons was 
tied for the team lead with seven wins while earning an All-Big 12 "honorable 
mention."[1] The New York Yankees drafted Lyons in the 10th round of the 
2009 amateur draft, but he chose to return to OSU. The Cardinals selected 
him in the ninth round in 2010, and he signed.[2] Lyons signed too late 
to play in the Cardinals minor league system in 2010; however, in 2011 
he pitched for the Palm Beach Cardinals of the Florida State League. On 
August 8, 2011, he threw the first no-hitter in Palm Beach's history, a 
10–0 win over the Fort Myers Miracle. Lyons struck out eight and faced 
two batters over the minimum in his eighth career professional start.[3] 
He finished the 2011 season with an overall record of 9-4 with an ERA of 
4.50 over 94 innings pitched.[4] Tyler Lyons split the 2012 season between 
the Cardinals Double-A affiliate Springfield Cardinals of the Texas League 
and Triple-A Memphis Redbirds of the Pacific Coast League (PCL). He posted 
five wins against four losses in 64 innings of work for Springfield. Lyons 
struggled to adjust, however, after moving up to Memphis, going just 4-9 
with a 4.28 ERA over 88 innings for the Redbirds.[4] Tyler Lyons started 
the 2013 season with Memphis, posting a record of 2–1 in eight starts with 
a 4.47 ERA prior to his first major league call-up.[5] He made his major 
league debut with the Cardinals on May 22, 2013, against the San Diego 
Padres at Petco Park, allowing one run and four hits over seven innings 
as the Cardinals won, 5–3.[6] AFter winning his first two games, Lyons 
began to struggle on the mound. On June 22 the Cardinals optioned Lyons 
to Triple A Memphis and called up Michael Blazek.[7] In his previous four 
starts, Lyons gave up at least four earned runs in each start and saw his 
ERA climb to 5.51; his ultimate appearance lasted just 1 2⁄3 innings on 
June 21 against the Texas Rangers.[7] Lyons made six more appearances – 
two starts – in the rest of 2013, and finished the year 2–4 with a 4.75 
ERA in 12 games. The Cardinals appeared in the World Series, but left Lyons 
off the playoff roster. Beginning the 2014 season again in Memphis, Lyons 
made three starts before the Cardinals recalled him on April 21 to replace 
the injured Joe Kelly in the rotation. He made four starts with two relief 
appearances sandwiched between as the temporary fifth starter, going 0–3 
with a 6.12 ERA and 23 strikeouts in 25 innings. Following a May 12 start 
in which he gave up 9 runs in 4 innings pitched, he was placed on the disabled 
list with a shoulder strain, and replaced in the rotation by Jaime García.[8] 
Lyons pitched most of the rest of the season in Memphis, where he had a 
six-game streak of winning his starts. In St. Louis in 2014, Lyons went 
0-4 in 11 appearances (four starts), posting a 4.42 ERA with 36 strikeouts 
and a 1.200 WHIP. Filling roles as a sixth starter and swingman in 2015, 
the Cardinals recalled Lyons from Memphis to replace injured starters, 
including Adam Wainwright and Lance Lynn. After a brief stint in April, 
the club optioned Lyons back to Memphis. For the week ending June 7, he 
named PCL Pitcher of the week after defeating both the Salt Lake Bees and 
Iowa Cubs. Combined, he allowed a 0.00 ERA, 0.54 WHIP and .136 batting 
average against while striking out 13 in 13 IP.[9] The Cardinals then recalled 
him to replace Lynn. Lyons made his next MLB start on June 13, stopping 
a winless streak of 13 MLB starts by pitching a 3–2 victory over the Kansas 
City Royals. He struck out five in six innings.[10] Lyons' next start, 
against the Philadelphia Phillies on June 19, was his second win of the 
season by a 12–4 margin. While hitting, he collected his first major league 
run batted in and base on balls and hit two singles. He reached base and 
scored in all three plate appearances.[11] In his first relief appearance 
of the season, Lyons completed 5 1⁄3 scoreless innings in a 10–5 loss to 
the Pittsburgh Pirates on August 13. It was the Cardinals' first scoreless 
relief outing of at least five innings since Manny Aybar did so in 1999.[12] 
Starting against the Pittsburgh Pirates on September 30, Lyons completed 
seven scoreless innings with just four hits and no walks allowed while 
the Cardinals won their 100th game of the season by an 11–1 score and clinched 
their third consecutive National League Central division title.[13][14] 
Reaching new major league career highs in multiple categories, Lyons appeared 
in 17 games and 60 innings for the Cardinals, with eight starts, 3.75 ERA,
