finished in fifth place in the American League East with a record of 74-87, 
24 games behind the New York Yankees. They were outscored by their opponents 
709 to 609. The Tigers drew 1,467,020 fans to Tiger Stadium in 1976, ranking 
4th of the 14 teams in the American League. 1976 was the year of "The Bird" 
in Detroit, as rookie pitcher Mark Fidrych drew sell-out crowds to Tiger 
Stadium. Fidrych led the major leagues with a 2.34 ERA, won the AL Rookie 
of the Year award, and finished with a 19-9 record. Aurelio Rodríguez also 
became the first American League third baseman other than Brooks Robinson 
to win the Gold Glove Award at third base since 1959. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5]
