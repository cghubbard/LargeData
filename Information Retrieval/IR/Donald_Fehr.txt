Donald Martin Fehr (born July 18, 1948)[1] is the executive director of 
the National Hockey League Players Association. He became nationally prominent 
while serving as the executive director of the Major League Baseball Players 
Association from 1985 to 2009. Fehr's parents are Irene Sylvia (née Gulko) 
and Louis Alvin Fehr, of German-Jewish descent.[2][3] He was raised in 
Prairie Village, Kansas. He graduated from Indiana University and was a 
member of Sigma Alpha Mu Fraternity. Fehr received his law degree from 
the University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Law.[4] As a young lawyer, 
Fehr assisted the MLBPA in the Andy Messersmith and Dave McNally arbitration 
case (later known as the Seitz decision). In 1977, Marvin Miller hired 
Fehr as the Players Association general counsel. In December 1985, Fehr 
was voted executive director of the MLBPA after having served as acting 
director since December 9, 1983. Fehr successfully challenged the owners' 
collusion, leading to the owners paying $280 million in damages to the 
players. Fehr led the players union through the 1994–95 Major League Baseball 
strike and subsequent World Series cancellation. He was instrumental in 
implementing the rejection of future admissions into the MLBPA by replacement 
players who planned to fill in during the strike of 1995. Fehr attended 
the 1995 New York Yankees' home opener against the Texas Rangers, which 
saw only 50,425 fans show up making it was the smallest opening day crowd 
at Yankee Stadium since 1990.[5] Fehr's presence angering many fans who 
blamed him for ruining their team's postseason chances and what would have 
been Don Mattingly's postseason debut.[6] Fans booed Fehr and yelled "You 
ruined the game!"[6] in response to him having attended the last game played 
at Yankee Stadium before the strike, and booed as he left the stadium;[7][8] 
one fan also held up a sign saying "$HAME ON YOU!",[9] to which Fehr responded 
by flipping off the fan. On June 22, 2009, Fehr announced his intention 
to step down as the MLBPA executive director position, recommending Michael 
Weiner as his successor. This was subject to the approval of the union's 
executive board and possible ratification by all players.[10] He officially 
relinquished his job to Weiner in December 2009.[11][12] Shortly after 
leaving his position as Executive Director of the MLBPA, Fehr took up a 
position as an advisor to the NHL Players' Association. On December 18, 
2010, Fehr was voted in by the NHLPA as their executive director.[13][14] 
With the NHL locking out the players at midnight on September 15, 2012, 
Fehr became the only Executive Director of a players union to be directly 
involved in work stoppages in two sports. Six of the eight contract negotiations 
he has been involved in have resulted in work stoppages, including five 
consecutive negotiations between the MLBPA and Major League Baseball.[15]
