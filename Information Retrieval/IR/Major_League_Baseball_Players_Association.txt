The Major League Baseball Players Association (or MLBPA) is the collective 
bargaining representative for all current Major League Baseball players. 
All players, managers, coaches, and trainers who hold or have held a signed 
contract with a Major League club are eligible for membership in the Association. 
The MLBPA has three major divisions: a labor union, a business (Players 
Choice Group Licensing Program), and a charitable foundation (Major League 
Baseball Players Trust).[2] The MLBPA primarily serves as a collective 
bargaining representative for all Major League Baseball players, as well 
as playing significant roles in MLB-related business and non-profit affairs. 
The MLBPAs Players Choice group licensing program utilizes collective 
marketing to assist licensees and sponsors who want to associate their 
brands and products with that of Major League players, teams, and coaches. 
Through an individual agreement with each player, the MLBPA holds exclusive 
right to use, license and sublicense the names, numbers, nicknames, likenesses, 
signatures and other personal indicia (known as publicity rights) of 
active Major League Baseball players who are its members for use in connection 
with any product, brand, service or product line when more than two players 
are involved. Among its other functions, the Players Choice licensing program 
also protects the rights of players from exploitation by unauthorized parties.[3] 
Major League Baseball players also formed the Players Trust, a charitable 
foundation that is the first of its kind in professional sports. Through 
the Players Trust, Major Leaguers contribute their time, money and fame 
to call attention to important issues affecting those in need and to help 
encourage others to get involved in their own communities. Many programs 
including Buses for Baseball, City Clinics, Medicines for Humanity, the 
Players Choice Awards and Volunteers of America are funded through the 
foundation.[4] In 2003, the Major League Baseball Players Trust and Volunteers 
of America created the Action Team National Youth Volunteer Program to 
recruit and train high school students to become volunteers in their communities.[5] 
The Players Choice Awards is an award ceremony held to recognize each season's 
best performers, as chosen by the players themselves. Each Players Choice 
Awards winner designates the charity of his choice to receive a grant from 
the Player's Trust.[6] The MLBPA was not the first attempt to unionize 
baseball players. Earlier attempts had included: President Executive Director 
The organization that would eventually become the MLBPA was conceived in 
1953. However, it was not officially recognized as a union until 1966. 
It is in this year that the newly recognized union hired Marvin Miller 
from the United Steel Workers of America to head the organization, serving 
as Executive Director until 1983. In 1968, Miller negotiated the first 
collective bargaining agreement (CBA) with the team owners, which raised 
the minimum salary from $6,000 to $10,000 per year.[9] The 1970 CBA included 
arbitration to resolve disputes.[8] In 1972 the major leagues saw their 
first player strike, in opposition to the owners' refusal to increase player 
pension funds. In 1974, when owner Charlie Finley failed to make a $50,000 
payment into an insurance annuity as called for in Catfish Hunter's contract, 
the MLBPA took the case to arbitration. The arbitrator ruled that Hunter 
could be a free agent.[10] During Miller's tenure, base salaries, pension 
funds, licensing rights and revenues were increased. Miller challenged 
the reserve clause which was used by team owners to bind players to one 
team. The strength of the union was immeasurably increased by the creation 
of the modern free agent system following the Seitz decision in 1975. Players 
and owners failed to come to terms over free agent compensation, which 
led to another strike in 1981. In the late 1980s and early 1990s the MLBPA 
filed collusion charges, arguing that team owners had violated the collective 
bargaining agreement in the 1985–1987 seasons. The MLBPA won each case, 
resulting in "second look" free agents, and over $269 million in owner 
fines.[11] Donald Fehr joined the MLBPA as general counsel in 1977 and 
was named executive director in 1985, leading it through the 1994 Major 
League Baseball strike and recent issues. On June 22, 2009, Fehr announced 
he would step down, and after a transition period and was replaced by the 
union's general counsel, Michael Weiner.[12] On November 21, 2013, MLBPA 
Executive Director Michael Weiner died after a 15-month battle with a non-operable 
brain tumor. He was 51 years old. Tony Clark, the Deputy Executive Director, 
was named Executive Director on December 2, 2013, the first former major 
league player to hold the position.[13] In 2016, the MLBPA celebrated its 
50th anniversary as a union, commemorating the event at the 2016 Major 
League Baseball All-Star Game with a redesigned golden logo and merchandise 
such as T-shirts.[14] In 1968, the Major League Baseball Players Association 
negotiated the first-ever Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) in professional 
sports. The current agreement expires on Dec. 1, 2016.[15] The Joint Drug 
Agreement went into effect in December 2011 and is scheduled to terminate 
Dec. 1, 2016, the same date as the Basic Agreement. The prohibited substances 
section of the Joint Drug Agreement is updated annually.[16] In August 
2015, Major League Baseball and the MLBPA reached agreement on the Joint 
Domestic Violence, Sexual Assault and Child Abuse Policy, and is intended 
to provide a comprehensive policy addressing issues such as protecting 
the legal rights of players, treating violations seriously, holding players 
accountable through appropriate disciplinary measures and providing resources 
for the intervention and care of victims, families and the players themselves.[17] 
The terms of this joint policy cover four primary areas: Treatment & Intervention; 
Investigations; Discipline; and Training, Education & Resources. In June 
2016, Executive Director, Tony Clark and Commissioner of Major League Baseball, 
Rob Manfred along with Curtis Granderson, Andrew McCutchen, Marquis Grissom 
and Ken Griffey Jr. announced major initiatives within youth baseball in 
a press conference held at Citi Field. On top of jointly donating over 
$2 million several youth-focused initiatives supported by current and former 
Major League player, other major initiatives included financial contributions 
to youth baseball projects and the creation of a partnership with Positive 
Coaching Alliance for the training of coaches and administrators from the 
Reviving Baseball in Inner Cities program.[18] As of 2014, Major League 
Baseball is the only major professional sports league in North America 
that does not have a salary cap; the MLS, NHL, NBA and NFL all implement 
some sort of salary cap.[citation needed] The MLBPA was initially opposed 
to random steroid testing, claiming it to be a violation of the privacy 
of players. After enormous negative publicity surrounding the alleged or 
actual involvement of several star players in the BALCO steroid scandal, 
the players dropped their opposition to a steroid testing program and developed 
a consensus that favored testing. Under pressure from US Congress which 
threatened to pass a law if the MLB's drug policy was not strengthened, 
the baseball union agreed in 2005 to a stricter policy that would include
