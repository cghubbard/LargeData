Home The Vegueros de Pinar del Río is a baseball team in the Cuban National 
Series. Based in the western city of Pinar del Río, the Vegueros are historically 
one of the more successful teams in the Cuban National Series, winning 
championships in 1997, 1998, 2011, 2015. Prior to the 1992-93 Cuban National 
Series, two teams competed in the province of Pinar del Río: Forestales 
(also known as Pinar del Río during some seasons) and Vegueros. Vegueros 
was a bona fide powerhouse, winning the championship in 1978, 1981, 1982, 
1985, 1987 and 1988. A 1992–1993 contraction of the league, in which eight 
teams were eliminated, caused Vegueros and Forestales to be combined into 
a single team. in 2015, Pinar del Rio won the Caribbean Series. Several 
Pinar del Río players have left Cuba for the North American Major Leagues.
