In baseball, a save (abbreviated SV or S) is credited to a pitcher who 
finishes a game for the winning team under certain prescribed circumstances, 
described below. The number of saves, or percentage of save opportunities 
successfully converted, is an oft-cited statistic of relief pitchers, particularly 
those in the closer role. It became an official Major League Baseball (MLB) 
statistic in 1969.[1] Mariano Rivera is MLB's all-time leader in regular 
season saves with 652. The term save was being used as far back as 1952.[2] 
Executives Jim Toomey of the St. Louis Cardinals, Allan Roth of the Los 
Angeles Dodgers and Irv Kaze of the Pittsburgh Pirates awarded saves to 
pitchers that finished winning games but were not credited with the win, 
regardless of the margin of victory. The statistic went largely unnoticed. 
A formula with more criteria for saves was invented in 1960 by baseball 
writer Jerome Holtzman.[3] He felt that the existing statistics at the 
time, earned run average (ERA) and win–loss record (W-L), did not sufficiently 
measure a reliever's effectiveness. ERA does not account for inherited 
runners a reliever allows to score, and W-L record does not account for 
relievers protecting leads. Elroy Face of the Pittsburgh Pirates was 18–1 
in 1959; however, Holtzman wrote that in 10 of the 18 wins, Face allowed 
the tying or lead run but got the win when the Pirates offense regained 
the lead.[1][note 1] Holtzman felt that Face was more effective the previous 
year when he was 5–2. When Holtzman presented the idea to J. G. Taylor 
Spink, publisher of The Sporting News, "[Spink] gave [Holtzman] a $100 
bonus. Maybe it was $200." Holtzman recorded the unofficial save statistic 
in The Sporting News weekly for nine years before it became official in 
1969. In conjunction with publishing the statistic, The Sporting News in 
1960 also introduced the Fireman of the Year Award, which was awarded based 
on a combination of saves and wins.[1][6] The save became an official MLB 
statistic in 1969.[1] It was MLB's first new major statistic since the 
run batted in was added in 1920.[1] Bill Singer is credited with recording 
the first official save when he pitched three shutout innings in relief 
of Don Drysdale in the Los Angeles Dodgers' 3–2 Opening Day victory over 
the Cincinnati Reds at Crosley Field on April 7 of that year.[7][8] In 
baseball statistics, the term save is used to indicate the successful maintenance 
of a lead by a relief pitcher, usually the closer, until the end of the 
game. A save is a statistic credited to a relief pitcher, as set forth 
in Rule 10.19 of the Official Rules of Major League Baseball. That rule 
states the official scorer shall credit a pitcher with a save when such 
pitcher meets all four of the following conditions:[9] If a relief pitcher 
satisfies all of the criteria for a save, except he does not finish the 
game, he will often be credited with a hold (which is not an officially 
recognized statistic by Major League Baseball). A blown save (abbreviated 
BSV, BS or B) is charged to a pitcher who enters a game in a situation 
which permits him to earn a save (a save situation or save opportunity), 
but who instead allows the tying run to score. Note that if the tying run 
was scored by a runner who was already on base when the new pitcher entered 
the game, that new pitcher will be charged with a blown save even though 
the run will not be charged to the new pitcher, but rather to the pitcher 
who allowed that runner to reach base. If the reliever allows the tying 
or leading run, but the reliever's team wins the game, the reliever wins 
the game. Due to this definition, a pitcher cannot blow multiple saves 
in a game unless he has multiple save opportunities, a situation only possible 
when a pitcher temporarily switches defensive positions. The blown save 
was introduced by the Rolaids Relief Man Award in 1988.[10] A pitcher who 
enters the game in a save situation and does not finish the game—but his 
team still leading—is not charged with a save opportunity. Save percentage 
is the ratio of saves to save opportunities.[11] In 1974, tougher criteria 
were adopted for saves where the tying run had to be on base or at the 
plate when the reliever entered to qualify for a save (unless he pitched 
three innings).[12] This addressed saves such as Ron Taylor's in a 20–6 
New York Mets win over the Atlanta Braves.[13][14] The rule was relaxed 
in 1975 to credit a save when a reliever pitches at least one inning with 
no more than a three-run lead, or comes in with runners on base but the 
tying run on deck.[15] In 2000, Rolaids started recording a tough save 
when a pitcher enters a save situation with the potential tying run already 
on base, but still earns the save.[12] As Francisco Rodríguez pursued the 
single-season saves record in 2008, Baseball Prospectus member Joe Sheehan, 
Sports Illustrated writer Tom Verducci, and The New York Sun writer Tim 
Marchman wrote that Rodríguez's save total was enhanced by the number of 
opportunities his team presented, allowing him to amass one particular 
statistic. They thought that Rodríguez on his record-breaking march was 
less effective than in prior years.[16][17][18] Sheehan offered that saves 
did not account for a pitcher's proficiency at preventing runs nor did 
it reflect leads that were not preserved.[16] Bradford Doolittle of The 
Kansas City Star wrote, "[The closer] is the only example in sports of 
a statistic creating a job." He decried the best relievers pitching fewer 
innings starting in the 1980s with their workload being reduced from two- 
to one-inning outings while less efficient pitchers were pitching those 
innings instead.[19] ESPN.com columnist Jim Caple has argued that the save 
statistic has turned the closer position into "the most overrated position 
in sports".[20] Caple and others contend that using one's best reliever 
in situations such as a three-run lead in the ninth—when a team will almost 
certainly win even with a lesser pitcher—is foolish, and that using a closer 
in the traditional fireman role exemplified by pitchers such as Goose Gossage 
is far wiser. (A "fireman" situation is men on base in a tied or close 
game, hence a reliever ending such a threat is "putting out the fire.")[20][21] 
Firemen frequently pitched two- or three-inning outings to earn saves. 
The modern closer, reduced to a one-inning role, is available to pitch 
more save opportunities. In the past, a reliever pitching three innings 
one game would be unavailable to pitch the next game.[22] Gossage had more 
saves of at least two innings than saves where he pitched one inning or 
less.[23] "The times I did a one-inning save, I felt guilty about it. It's 
like it was too easy", said Gossage.[24] ESPN.com wrote that saves have 
not been determined to be "a special, repeatable skill—rather than simply 
a function of opportunities".[25] It also noted that blown saves are "non-qualitative", 
pointing out that the two career leaders in blown saves—Gossage (112) and 
Rollie Fingers (109)—were both inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame.[25] 
Fran Zimniuch in Fireman: The Evolution of the Closer in Baseball wrote, 
"But you have to be a great relief pitcher to blow that many saves. Clearly, 
[Gossage] saved many, many more than he did not save."[26] More than half 
of Gossage's and Finger's blown saves came in tough save situations, where 
the tying run was on base when the pitcher entered. In nearly half of their 
blown tough saves, they entered the game in the sixth or seventh inning. 
Multiple-inning outings provide more chances for a reliever to blow a save. 
The pitchers need to get out of the initial situation and pitch additional 
innings with more chances to lose the lead. A study by the Baseball Hall 
of Fame[note 2] found modern closers were put into fewer tough save situations 
compared to past relievers.[note 3] The modern closer also earned significantly 
more "easy saves", defined as saves starting the ninth inning with more 
than a one-run lead.[note 4][12] The study offered "praise to the combatants 
who faced more danger for more innings."[12] On September 3, 2002, the 
Texas Rangers won 7-1 over the Baltimore Orioles as Joaquín Benoit pitched 
a seven-inning save, the longest save since it became an official statistic 
in 1969.[27][note 5] Benoit relieved Todd Van Poppel (who entered the game 
in the first inning after starter Aaron Myette was ejected for throwing 
at Melvin Mora) at the start of the third inning, and finished the game 
while allowing just one hit. The official scorer credited the win to Van 
Poppel and not Benoit, a decision that was also supported by Texas manager 
Jerry Narron.[30] On August 22, 2007, Wes Littleton earned a save with 
the largest winning margin ever, pitching the last three innings of a 30–3 
Texas Rangers victory win over the Baltimore Orioles. Littleton entered 
the game with a 14–3 lead, and the final 27-run differential broke the 
previous record for a save by eight runs. The New York Times noted that 
"there are the preposterous saves, of which Littleton's now stands out 
as No. 1."[31] On October 29, 2014, Madison Bumgarner of San Francisco 
Giants recorded the longest save in World Series history, pitching five 
scoreless innings of relief in a Game 7 3-2 victory over Kansas City Royals.[32] 
The statistic was formally introduced in 1969,[1] although research has 
identified saves earned prior to that point.[33] Listed are the Major League
