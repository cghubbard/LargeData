The 1930 New York Giants season was the 48th in franchise history. The 
team finished third in the National League with a record of 87–67, 5 games 
behind the St. Louis Cardinals. Giants player Bill Terry was the last member 
of the Giants, and the last National League player in the 20th century, 
to have a batting average of .400 in one season.[1] In the process, he 
tied the National League record – set the previous year by Lefty O'Doul 
– for most hits in a single season with 254. As of the end of the 2009 
season, that record still stands. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] Infielders
