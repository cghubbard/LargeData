As player As manager As coach William Killefer (October 10, 1887 – July 
3, 1960) was an American professional baseball player, coach and manager 
who had a 48-year career in Major League Baseball.[1] Killefer, who was 
nicknamed "Reindeer Bill" due to his speed afoot, played as a catcher for 
the St. Louis Browns, Philadelphia Phillies, and Chicago Cubs.[1][2] He 
is remembered for being Hall of Fame pitcher Grover Cleveland Alexander's 
favorite catcher and for being one of the finest defensive catchers of 
his era.[1][3] Killefer made his major league debut on September 13, 1909 
with the St. Louis Browns.[2] After the 1910 season in which the Browns 
finished in last place, Killefer was released to the Buffalo Bisons of 
the Eastern League.[1] Under the tutelage of Bisons' manager George Stallings, 
Killefer developed into a refined catcher.[1] His contract was purchased 
by the Philadelphia Phillies on August 19, 1911, and he played his first 
game as a starter on October 3.[1] The Phillies pitcher on that day was 
Grover Cleveland Alexander, and the game marked the first of 250 times 
the pair teamed up as a battery in the major leagues.[1] Although he was 
a light hitter, Killefer became known for his strong defensive skills.[1] 
In 1913, he led National League catchers with 166 assists, 130 baserunners 
caught stealing, a 50.6% caught stealing percentage, and finished second 
in putouts and fielding percentage.[4] In 1914, Killefer made news when 
it was reported that he had signed with the Chicago Whales of the Federal 
League, although he denied the report.[1] When the Phillies offered him 
a salary increase, he decided to sign with the Phillies, which led the 
Federal League to file a lawsuit against him and the Phillies.[1] A judge 
ruled against the Federal League and Killefer remained with the Phillies.[1] 
From 1915 to 1917, Alexander and Killefer solidified their reputation as 
the best battery in baseball, with Alexander posting three consecutive 
30-win seasons.[1][5] Killefer had one of his best seasons for the Phillies 
in 1917. He led National League catchers with a .984 fielding percentage, 
as well as in putouts, double plays, and total chances.[6] He also had 
one of his best seasons offensively with a .274 batting average.[2] After 
the 1917 season, in one of the most lopsided trades in major league history, 
the financially strapped Phillies sent Killefer and Alexander to the Chicago 
Cubs for two players and $55,000 in cash.[1][7] With the Cubs, Killefer 
was credited with strengthening their pitching staff.[8] The Cubs won the 
1918 National League pennant before losing to the Boston Red Sox in the 
1918 World Series.[9] Killefer had another strong season in 1919, hitting 
a career-high .286 batting average and leading National League catchers 
in fielding percentage, putouts and assists.[2][10] He served as player-manager 
for the Cubs in 1921 before retiring as a player at age 33. In a thirteen-year 
major league career, Killefer played in 1,035 games, accumulating 751 hits 
in 3,150 at bats for a .238 career batting average along with 4 home runs 
and 240 runs batted in.[2] He had a career fielding percentage of .977.[2] 
While he was not a powerful hitter, he possessed a strong throwing arm 
and a talent for working with pitchers.[8] Killefer led National League 
catchers in fielding percentage four consecutive seasons from 1916 to 1919.[2][11] 
He also led the league three times in putouts, assists and in baserunners 
caught stealing.[2] Killefer caught 115 shutouts in his career, ranking 
him 16th all-time among major league catchers.[12] Killefer's reputation 
as a defensive standout is enhanced because of the era in which he played. 
In the Deadball Era, catchers played a huge defensive role, given the large 
number of bunts and stolen base attempts, as well as the difficulty of 
handling the spitball pitchers who dominated pitching staffs.[13] Richard 
Kendall of the Society for American Baseball Research devised an unscientific 
study that ranked Killefer as the most dominating fielding catcher in major 
league history.[14] After his playing career ended, Killefer continued 
as manager of the Cubs until he was fired after 75 games in 1925.[1] He 
was hired by St. Louis Cardinals manager Rogers Hornsby as a coach for 
the 1926 season.[1] The Cardinals went on to win the 1926 World Series 
with Killefer receiving credit for his help with the pitching staff.[1] 
In 1927, he was hired by the St. Louis Browns as a coach, and became their 
manager in 1930.[15] Killefer enjoyed little success as the Browns' manager, 
never finishing above fifth place as the depression-era team had cut its 
payroll significantly.[1] He was fired in 1933 and took two years off from 
organised baseball.[1] He accepted a role as manager for the Sacramento 
Solons in the Pacific Coast League, leading them to a first-place finish 
in 1937.[1] He later coached for the Brooklyn Dodgers and managed the minor 
league Milwaukee Brewers.[1] His managerial record was 524–622 (.457) in 
nine seasons.[15] Killefer's last on-the-field position in the major leagues 
was as a coach for the 1942 Philadelphia Phillies.[1] He also served as 
a scout for the Cleveland Indians, the Phillies and the Dodgers.[16] As 
a scout for the Indians, Killefer was involved in the signing of Larry 
Doby in 1947 (the American League's first black player).[1] Killefer was 
credited with helping the development of such catching standouts as Bob 
O'Farrell, Gabby Hartnett, Rick Ferrell, and Walker Cooper.[1] He died 
in Elsmere, Delaware, at age 72.[16] His brother, Red Killefer, was also 
a major league baseball player. Political economist Nancy Killefer is a
