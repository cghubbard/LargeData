Thomas F. Cheek (June 13, 1939 – October 9, 2005) was an American sportscaster 
who is best remembered today as the original "Voice of the Toronto Blue 
Jays", Cheek announced Major League Baseball (MLB) games for the Toronto 
Blue Jays on radio, as the play-by-play announcer, from the team's establishment 
in 1977 until his retirement in 2004, in which he had a 27-year streak 
of 4,306 consecutive games plus 41 post-season games called, which lasted 
from the first ever Blue Jays game on April 7, 1977 to June 3, 2004. Cheek 
was inducted to the Blue Jays Level of Excellence in 2004. Cheek's best-known 
call was perhaps his description of Joe Carter's dramatic title-clinching 
home run in Game 6 of the 1993 World Series, when he said, "Touch 'em all, 
Joe, you'll never hit a bigger home run in your life!"[1] He is also author 
of the book Road to Glory, which chronicled the first 16 years of Blue 
Jays baseball. Cheek was selected as the recipient of the 2013 Ford C. 
Frick Award after being nominated as a finalist for the award every year 
since 2005. Born and raised in the west side of Pensacola, Florida, Cheek, 
an avid sports fan, was introduced to his first tape recorder at the age 
of 14, which would lay the foundations for his future in broadcasting. 
From 1957 to 1960, he served in the United States Air Force where he was 
introduced to the Yankees broadcaster Red Barber. Following his discharge 
from the armed forces in 1960, Cheek attended the Cambridge School of Broadcasting 
in Boston for two years.[2] His father, also named Tom Cheek, was a well 
known United States Navy flyer in World War II and a recipient of the Navy 
Cross at the Battle of Midway.[3] Cheek began his radio broadcasting career 
in Plattsburgh, New York as a Disc jockey on WEAV in 1962. He then moved 
to Burlington, Vermont where he worked for WDOT and was quickly promoted 
to corporate sales manager and sports director. He later moved from music 
to sports broadcasting when he moved to WJOY where his on-air sports work 
included baseball, basketball, football, and hockey for the University 
of Vermont. During this time, in 1968, he was almost hired to be the first 
broadcaster for the newly formed Atlanta Hawks of the NBA, only to lose 
out to Skip Caray.[4] At the same time, the newly formed Montreal Expos 
were looking for a second announcer to complement their primary play-by-play 
man, Dave Van Horne. Burlington, being only 99 miles from Montreal, although 
traditionally a Boston Red Sox town, was warming up to the new expansion 
team. It was later decided that the Expos would go with a guest announcer 
format, and this is where Cheek would get his first broadcast experience 
of Major League Baseball, where he filled in occasionally from 1974 to 
1976.[5] Beginning in 1977, Cheek became the first full-time announcer 
for the Toronto Blue Jays alongside his first broadcast partner, Baseball 
Hall of Fame pitcher Early Wynn who remained with him through the end of 
1980. Wynn was replaced by Jerry Howarth in 1981. For the next 23 years, 
this combination of "Tom and Jerry" would be the radio voices of the Blue 
Jays. Their partnership covered the rise of the Blue Jays through the 1980s, 
culminating with back to back World Series Championships in 1992 and 1993. 
The team was joined by color commentator Gary Matthews in 2000 and 2001. 
Cheek, along with Howarth, were perhaps the most respected Toronto sports 
broadcasters of the era.[6] Cheek's Blue Jays broadcasts originated from 
Toronto's CKFH "The Fan" 1430, a station that was founded by another legendary 
Toronto sports broadcaster, Hockey Hall of Fame member Foster Hewitt. For 
a brief period, his broadcast was heard on 1050 CHUM, but following the 
purchase of the Blue Jays by Rogers Communications, reverted to "The Fan", 
which had changed its callsign and frequency to CJCL 590 AM, also known 
as the FAN 590. Cheek called many memorable moments in Toronto Blue Jays 
franchise history, including many firsts; the Blue Jays division-clinching 
game in 1985 and both the final plays of the 1992 and 1993 World Series, 
the latter of which spawned his famous "Touch 'em all, Joe!" quote, when 
Joe Carter clinched the World Series on a walk-off home run, only the second 
time this ever happened in World Series history. Cheek announced every 
Blue Jays game from their inaugural game at Exhibition Stadium, in Toronto, 
on April 7, 1977 until June 3, 2004, when he took two games off following 
the death of his father – a streak of 4,306 consecutive regular season 
games and 41 postseason games.[7] During the 2004 season, the Jays raised 
a banner to SkyDome's (now the Rogers Centre) "Level of Excellence" bearing 
his name and, in place of a jersey number, 4,306 – his streak of straight 
regular-season broadcasts.[8] Outside of his Blue Jays broadcasts, Cheek 
was also a member of the broadcast team for ABC Sports at the 1980 Winter 
Olympics in Lake Placid and at the 1984 Winter Olympics in Sarajevo.[9] 
Cheek was forced to take further time off to undergo surgery on June 12, 
2004 to remove a brain tumor.[10] Following the surgery, Cheek was able 
to call some Blue Jays home games while undergoing chemotherapy, but he 
was replaced on the road by various guest announcers. For a time it seemed 
Cheek had recovered and would be able to resume calling Blue Jays games 
in 2005, however the cancer then returned at which he required further 
treatment at Toronto's Mount Sinai Hospital and Toronto Western Hospital. 
Cheek did sit in with the new commentator, Canadian-born former minor league 
baseball infielder/outfielder Warren Sawkiw and Howarth to call an inning 
of the Blue Jays' 2005 opening game, played in Tampa Bay.[11] Cheek died 
at age 66 in Oldsmar, Florida, and was buried in Clearwater, Florida.[12] 
Cheek married his wife, Shirley, of Hemmingford, Quebec in 1959. They had 
three children together, Jeff, Lisa, and Tom and seven grandchildren at 
the time of his death.[13] Cheek was inducted into the Blue Jays Level 
of Excellence in 2004 with the number "4306" next to his name, signifying 
his streak. Canada's Sports Hall of Fame established the "Tom Cheek Media 
Leadership Award" shortly before his death, for "playing a key role in 
promoting Canadian sports", with Cheek being named the recipient of the 
first award. During the 2006 season, the Blue Jays wore a white circular 
sewn on patch with the letters ' TC ' and a radio microphone in black beside 
the letters on their uniform sleeve, in tribute to Cheek.[14] For nine 
straight years (2005–2013),[15][16][17] Cheek was named among the ten finalists 
for the Ford C. Frick Award by the National Baseball Hall of Fame. The 
award is presented each year during the Hall of Fame's induction weekend 
to a broadcaster for "major contributions to baseball."[18] Cheek was selected 
as the 2013 recipient of the award on December 5, 2012.[19] Roberto Alomar
