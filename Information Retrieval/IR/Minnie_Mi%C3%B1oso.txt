Orestes "Minnie" Miñoso (born Saturnino Orestes Armas Miñoso Arrieta, /mᵻˈnoʊsoʊ/; 
Spanish pronunciation: [miˈɲoso], November 29, 1923 – March 1, 2015), nicknamed 
"The Cuban Comet" and "Mr. White Sox", was a Cuban Negro league and Major 
League Baseball (MLB) player. He began his baseball career in 1946 and 
became an All-Star third baseman with the New York Cubans and was signed 
by the Cleveland Indians after the 1948 season as baseball's color line 
slowly fell. Miñoso went on to become an All-Star left fielder with the 
Indians and Chicago White Sox. The first Black Cuban in the major leagues 
and the first black player in White Sox history, as a 1951 rookie he was 
the one of the first Latin Americans to play in an MLB All-Star Game. Miñoso 
was an American League (AL) All-Star for seven seasons[a] and a Gold Glove 
winner for three seasons when he was in his 30s.[1] He batted over .300 
for eight seasons. He was the AL leader in triples and stolen bases three 
times each and in hits, doubles, and total bases once each. Willie Mays 
(179 steals) and Miñoso (167 steals) have been widely credited with leading 
the resurgence of speed as an offensive weapon in the 1950s. Miñoso was 
particularly adept at reaching base, leading the AL in times hit by pitch 
a record ten times, and holding the league mark for career times hit by 
pitch from 1959 to 1985. Miñoso, as a defensive standout, led the AL left 
fielders in assists six times and in putouts and double plays four times 
each. Miñoso was one of the most popular and dynamic players in White Sox 
franchise history. He helped the "Go-Go" White Sox become one of the premier 
teams of the 1950s and 1960s. A rare power threat on a team known for speed 
and defense, Miñoso also held the White Sox record for career home runs 
from 1956 to 1974. Miñoso left the major leagues following the 1964 season, 
but went on playing and managing in Mexico through 1973. He rejoined the 
White Sox as a coach, and made brief but highly publicized player appearances 
in 1976 and 1980. He became the third player to get a hit after the age 
of 50 and the second player to appear in the major leagues in five decades. 
Miñoso's White Sox uniform number 9 was retired in 1983, and a statue of 
him was unveiled at U.S. Cellular Field in 2004. Miñoso was elected to 
the Cuban Baseball Hall of Fame in Exile in 1983, and to the Mexican Professional 
Baseball Hall of Fame in 1996. In 2014, Miñoso appeared for the second 
time as a candidate on the National Baseball Hall of Fame's Golden Era 
Committee election ballot[2] for possible Hall of Fame consideration in 
2015. He and the other candidates including former White Sox teammate Billy 
Pierce, and two other former players from Cuba, Tony Oliva and Luis Tiant, 
all missed induction in 2015.[3] The Committee meets and votes on ten selected 
candidates from the Golden Era (1947 to 1972) every three years. Miñoso 
was born in Perico, Cuba near Havana, the son of Carlos Arrieta and Cecilia 
Armas. His date of birth is often cited as being November 29, 1925. However, 
according to his Republic of Cuba, 1951 Drivers License and his first Topps 
baseball card(s) 1952/195, his date of birth is November 29, 1923.[4] The 
Miñoso baseball card which was handed out by his family to visitors who 
stopped by to pay their respects for Miñoso at a remembrance held for him 
at a Chicago church before his funeral has printed on it "1924-2015".[5] 
His father worked in the fields of the sugarcane plantation on which the 
family lived. His mother had four other children from a previous marriage 
who had the surname "Miñoso" from her first husband. Her son Orestes became 
referred to as a "Miñoso" too,[6] and eventually this name became his last 
name for life; he changed his name legally to Orestes Miñoso when he became 
a US citizen. Miñoso grew up playing baseball with two of his brothers 
and in fact managed his own team while working on his father's plantation, 
finding players and the necessary equipment himself.[7] In 1941, he moved 
to Havana to live with his sister and play baseball there.[citation needed] 
Miñoso played professional baseball as a third baseman in Cuba and in the 
Negro leagues. He signed a contract with the team from the borough of Marianao 
in 1945 for $150 per month,[6] and moved into the Negro leagues with the 
New York Cubans the next season and doubled his monthly salary.[8] Batting 
leadoff for the Cubans, he hit .309 in 1946, and followed up with a .294 
average in 1947 as they won the Negro World Series over the Cleveland Buckeyes. 
He was the starting third baseman for the East in the 1947 All-Star Game, 
and again in 1948.[6] Miñoso remained with the Cubans until signing with 
the Cleveland Indians organization during the 1948 season and starting 
his minor league career with the Dayton Indians of the Central League, 
batting .525 in 11 games.[9] On April 19, 1949, Miñoso made his major league 
debut with the Cleveland Indians, becoming the first Black Cuban in the 
major leagues; he drew a walk as a pinch hitter in the seventh inning of 
a 5–1 road loss to the St. Louis Browns. He got his first hit in his next 
game on May 4, a single off Alex Kellner in the sixth inning of a 4–3 win 
over the Philadelphia Athletics. The next day, he hit his first home run, 
off Jack Kramer in the second inning of a 7–3 win over the Boston Red Sox. 
Miñoso had little further chance to make an impression, however; the Indians 
were signing black players more aggressively than any other team in the 
American League, but coming off their victory in the 1948 World Series, 
they were the strongest team in baseball. They had little opportunity to 
get Miñoso into the lineup as a rookie, as they played Ken Keltner at third 
base, and he had only 16 at bats through May 13 before being sent to the 
minor leagues.[6] Miñoso was sent to the San Diego Padres of the Pacific 
Coast League for the rest of the 1949 season and all of 1950, batting .297 
the first year and following up with a .339 average and 115 runs batted 
in (RBIs).[10] Miñoso rejoined the Indians to start the 1951 season, but 
the team still could not find a spot for him in the lineup, as the Indians 
had Al Rosen at third base and Larry Doby, Dale Mitchell and Bob Kennedy 
in the outfield. He consequently had only 14 at bats in eight April games.[6] 
On April 30, 1951, the Indians sent Miñoso to the White Sox in a three-team 
trade involving the Athletics, getting relief pitcher Lou Brissie from 
the Athletics in exchange.[11] On May 1, Miñoso became the first black 
player on the White Sox, hitting a 415-foot (126 m) home run in Comiskey 
Park on the first pitch of his first at bat against the New York Yankees. 
He was an instant star, maintaining a batting average over .350 through 
most of the first half of the season, and finished the season hitting .324 
– second in the AL behind the .344 mark of the Athletics' Ferris Fain. 
Miñoso was named for the first time to the AL All-Star roster (reserve 
player)[12] becoming – along with White Sox teammate Chico Carrasquel and 
Washington Senators pitcher Connie Marrero – one of the first Latin Americans 
ever named to an All-Star team. That year he scored 112 runs (one short 
of Dom DiMaggio's league leading total) in 138 games played, topping the 
league with 14 triples and 31 stolen bases as well as 16 times being hit 
by pitches,[13] and became known as "Mr. White Sox". Following the 1951 
season, he finished second in the AL's Rookie of the Year voting behind 
the Yankees' Gil McDougald,[14][15] drawing a protest by the White Sox 
due to Miñoso having better statistics in nearly every category. Miñoso 
also finished fourth in the year's Most Valuable Player voting.[14] Miñoso 
was regarded as such an outstanding all-around player that Yankees outfielder 
Mickey Mantle acquired the nickname "The Commerce Comet" because he reminded 
observers of "The Cuban Comet". Miñoso followed up with several years of 
outstanding play for Chicago. He led the AL in steals in both 1952 (22)[16] 
and 1953 (25),[17] and topped the league with 18 triples and 304 total 
bases in 1954,[18] appearing in the All-Star Game all three years and starting 
in 1954. On April 14, 1953, Opening Day, he provided the only hit for the 
Sox in a 4–0 loss to the Indians' Bob Lemon,[19] and on July 4, 1954, he 
broke up a combined no-hitter by three Indians pitchers with two out in 
the ninth inning of a 2–1 loss. He led AL left fielders with three double 
plays in 1953,[20] and the following year led all major league left fielders 
with 13 assists and three double plays.[21] In the first game of a doubleheader 
on May 16, 1954, he drove in six runs in a 10–5 win over the Senators, 
and on April 23, 1955 he scored a career-high five runs in the White Sox' 
record-setting 29–6 road win over the Kansas City Athletics. Miñoso again 
finished second in the batting race in 1954 with a .320 mark, trailing 
the .341 average by the Indians' Bobby Ávila[18] (Ted Williams, who did 
not have enough plate appearances to qualify, would have finished second 
given the needed at bats). On May 18, 1955, Miñoso suffered a skull fracture 
from being hit in the head by a pitch from the Yankees' Bob Grim in the 
first inning of an 11–6 loss.[22] He finished the season with a .288 average, 
his lowest from 1953 through 1960; however, he had the longest hitting 
streak in the AL that year and the longest of his career, a 23-game string 
from August 9 to 30 during which he batted .421. In addition, his 18 assists 
that season were not only twice as many as any other left fielder in the 
major leagues, but also matched the highest mark by any AL left fielder 
from 1945 through 1983. He also led AL left fielders in putouts for the 
first time with 267.[23] Miñoso also represented a rare power threat for 
the Sox; due to the dimensions of Comiskey Park, the White Sox were the 
only major league team who did not have a player hit 100 home runs for 
them prior to World War II. On September 2, 1956, he hit his 80th home 
run with the Sox, off Hank Aguirre, in a 4–3 win over the Indians, breaking 
Zeke Bonura's team record. On September 23, 1957, in a 6–5 road loss to 
the Athletics, he became the first player to hit 100 home runs with the 
White Sox, connecting in the fourth inning off Alex Kellner. Miñoso topped 
AL left fielders again with 282 putouts and 10 assists in 1956,[24] and 
with two double plays in 1957.[25] He led the league in triples again in 
1956 with 11, and in doubles with 36 in 1957. In the 1957 All-Star Game, 
he saved a 6–5 victory for the AL with a dramatic catch for the final out, 
with the tying run on second base. The 1957 season marked the first in 
which Gold Glove Awards were awarded, and Miñoso was chosen as the first 
honoree in left field[26] (separate awards for both leagues were established 
the following year, and awards for each outfield position were discontinued 
for half a century after 1960 in favor of three awards for outfielders 
regardless of position). The White Sox traded Miñoso back to the Indians 
after the 1957 season in a four-player deal, with the White Sox getting 
pitcher Early Wynn and outfielder Al Smith in exchange for Miñoso and third 
baseman Fred Hatfield.[27] With Cleveland, Miñoso hit a career high 24 
home runs in 1958, and again led AL left fielders with 13 assists.[28] 
He batted .302 in both 1958 and 1959, and on April 21, 1959 had a career-high 
five hits in a 14–1 road win against the Detroit Tigers, also driving in 
six runs for the second time in his career. He was involved in a notable 
incident in a road game against the Boston Red Sox on July 17 that year 
when Indians manager Joe Gordon was ejected after an interference call 
on the previous batter, but continued his argument instead of leaving the 
field; Miñoso refused to enter the batter's box while Gordon was still 
arguing, and became furious when plate umpire Frank Umont called him out 
on three strikes. Miñoso was then ejected after throwing his bat at Umont, 
but apologized profusely after the game, saying he was unaware of the rule 
that any pitch in that situation must be called a strike regardless of 
its location; he served a three-game suspension.[29] That year he led all 
major league left fielders with a career-high 317 putouts, and also led 
the AL again with 14 assists,[28] and received his second Gold Glove Award.[26] 
Also in 1959, he made another All-Star appearance, starting in left field 
on July 7, the first of two All-Star Games held that year (MLB played two 
All-Star Games from 1959 through 1962).[30][30] He went 0 for 5 in the 
first game and didn't play in the second game on August 3. Miñoso was deeply 
disappointed over having missed playing for the White Sox during their 
1959 pennant-winning season, and was thrilled to be traded back to Chicago 
in a seven-player deal in December, with Norm Cash being the top player 
sent in return.[31] White Sox owner Bill Veeck presented Miñoso with an 
honorary 1959 pennant championship ring[32] at the beginning of the 1960 
season, saying that he had done as much as anyone in helping the White 
Sox reach the top of the league – partially through his influence in building 
a winning team, and partially because the Sox had acquired Wynn, who won 
the 1959 Cy Young Award, in exchange for Miñoso in the 1957 trade. Miñoso 
responded by driving in six runs for the third time in his career, hitting 
a grand slam in the fourth inning on Opening Day against Kansas City, and 
giving the Sox a 10–9 victory with a walk-off home run leading off the 
bottom of the ninth. Minoso had his last great season in 1960 – he made 
his last All-Star appearances (starter in both games),[33][34] led the 
AL with 184 hits, had 105 RBIs, batted over .300 for the eighth and final 
time,[35] and finished fourth in the MVP vote for the fourth time. He also 
had perhaps his best defensive season, leading all major league left fielders 
in putouts (277), assists (14) and double plays (3) and winning his third 
and final Gold Glove Award.[26] After the 1961 season, in which his average 
dropped to .280, Miñoso was traded to the St. Louis Cardinals in exchange 
for Joe Cunningham;[36] Miñoso had led the AL in times hit by pitch every 
year since his rookie season, except 1955.[37] After struggling to adjust 
to his new league's pitchers and strike zone, he missed two months of the 
1962 season due to suffering a fractured skull and broken wrist from crashing 
into the outfield wall in the sixth inning of an 8–5 loss to the Los Angeles 
Dodgers on May 11,[38] and finished the year hitting .196. His contract 
was sold to the Washington Senators prior to the 1963 season,[39] and after 
hitting .229, he was released that October.[40] On October 12, he played 
in the first and only Hispanic American All-Star Game at New York's Polo 
Grounds. He signed with the White Sox before the 1964 campaign,[41] but 
appeared in only thirty games that year, batting .226 – almost exclusively 
as a pinch hitter – and hit his last home run in the second game of a doubleheader 
on May 6 off Ted Bowsfield in the seventh inning of an 11–4 win over the 
Athletics. He retired after the 1964 season. Starting in 1965, Miñoso played 
for the Charros de Jalisco of the Mexican League. Playing first base, he 
batted .360 in his first season, leading the league with 35 doubles and 
106 runs scored. He continued to play in the Mexican League for the next 
eight seasons. He hit .265 with 12 home runs and 83 RBIs in 1973, when 
he was 50 years old.[6] In 1976, Miñoso was called out of retirement, becoming 
a first and third base coach for three seasons for the White Sox.[42] He 
also made three game appearances for the Sox that September in games against 
the California Angels, picking up one single in eight at bats (four coming 
as a designated hitter) – a two-out single off Sid Monge on September 12 
in the second inning of a 2–1, 10-inning win, becoming – at age 50 – the 
fourth oldest player ever to get a base hit in the major leagues.[43][44] 
In 1980, Miñoso, age 57, was activated again to play for the White Sox, 
and was a pinch hitter in two games, again against the Angels. He became 
the fourth-oldest player ever to play in the majors, behind Nick Altrock, 
who at age 57 pinch hit in 1933, Charley O'Leary, who at age 58 pinch hit 
in 1934, and Satchel Paige, who at age 59 pitched three shutout innings 
in one game in 1965. Miñoso joined Altrock (1890s–1930s) as just the second 
player in major league history to play in five decades (1940s–1980s); out 
of the players who played in the major leagues in the 1940s, Minoso was 
the last one to appear in a major league game. Bill Melton broke Miñoso's 
White Sox record of 135 career home runs in the second game of a doubleheader 
on August 4, 1974, a 13–10 win over the Texas Rangers; he had tied the 
record in the previous day's 12–5 loss. On August 29, 1985, Don Baylor 
broke Minoso's AL record of being hit by pitches 189 times.[45] In 1990, 
Miñoso was scheduled to make an appearance with the minor league Miami 
Miracle of the Florida State League and become the only professional to 
play in six decades; however, MLB overruled the Miracle on the idea.[46] 
When the last game was played at Comiskey Park during the same season, 
Miñoso was invited to present the White Sox lineup card to the umpires 
in the pregame ceremonies at home plate. He did so while wearing the new 
uniform debuted by the White Sox that day, his familiar number 9 on the 
back. In 1993, a 67-year-old Miñoso made an appearance with the independent 
St. Paul Saints of the Northern League.[47] He returned to the Saints in 
2003 and drew a walk, thus becoming the only player to appear professionally 
in seven different decades.[48] The earlier extensions to his career with 
the Sox were publicity stunts orchestrated respectively by one-time Sox 
owner Bill Veeck and his son Mike, who at the time owned partial or controlling 
interest in the team.[49] Miñoso lived in Chicago where he represented 
the Chicago White Sox as "Mr. White Sox". He married Sharon Rice in the 
1990s and they have one son, Charles. Miñoso also has three children from 
a previous marriage, Orestes, Jr., Cecilia, and Marilyn. His eldest son, 
Orestes Jr., briefly played professional baseball.[50] He became a member 
of the Chicagoland Sports Hall of Fame in 1994, the Mexican Professional 
Baseball Hall of Fame in 1996, the Hispanic Heritage Baseball Museum Hall 
of Fame on August 11, 2002, and the Cuban Baseball Hall of Fame in 2014. 
On September 19, 2004, Minnie Miñoso Day was celebrated at U.S. Cellular 
Field and there was a pregame unveiling of a Minnie Miñoso statue at the 
field.[51] Miñoso received the 2011 Jerome Holtzman Award from the Chicago 
Baseball Museum.[52] Miñoso was found dead in the driver's seat of a car 
near a gas station in Chicago at 1 am on March 1, 2015 after attending 
a friend's birthday party the previous day. An autopsy found that he died 
from a torn pulmonary artery resulting from chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease.[53] A funeral service was held for him at Holy Family Church in 
Chicago on March 7. "For South Siders and Sox fans all across the country, 
including me, Minnie Miñoso is and will always be ‘Mr. White Sox,’" President 
Barack Obama said in a statement released by the White House.[54][55] Miñoso 
became eligible for election to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1970 
– a year before the Hall began considering players from the Negro leagues 
or taking into account the accomplishments of major leaguers in the Negro 
leagues – and was dropped from the ballot for insufficient support. He 
was restored to the ballot five years after his final 1980 appearances 
as a player, and finally began to receive support as a candidate, remaining 
on the ballot for fourteen years before his eligibility expired; however, 
most of the writers voting by that point had little memory of him during 
his prime. In 2001, historian Bill James selected Miñoso as the tenth greatest 
left fielder of all time; based on the then-general belief that Miñoso 
was born in 1922 rather than 1925, James wrote, "Had he gotten the chance 
to play when he was 21 years old, I think he'd probably be rated among 
the top thirty players of all time."[56] Author Stuart Miller makes the 
case for Miñoso's election based on the wins above replacement (WAR) statistic, 
which calculates the number of additional wins a team would get from a 
player's production compared to having played a replacement-level minor 
league player at the position. Miñoso is among the top five AL players 
in WAR for seven of his MLB seasons, ranking first in WAR for two of those 
seasons.[57] Jay Jaffe of Sports Illustrated has written that Miñoso's 
Hall of Fame candidacy may have been damaged by the publicity stunt game 
appearances in his later life. He said that the biggest question for Hall 
of Fame voters would be how much potential major league production was 
taken away from Miñoso because baseball was not integrated at the outset 
of his career.[58] Miñoso was selected to be on the Hall of Fame's Golden 
Era Committee election ballot in 2011 and 2014.[59] Since 2011, the Baseball 
Writers' Association of America's (BBWAA) Historical Overview Committee 
serves as the Hall's screening committee every three years to identify 
ten long-retired players, managers, umpires, or executives (living or deceased) 
from the "Golden Era" (1947–1973) for possible induction into the Hall 
of Fame .[60] In order to be inducted, any of ten candidates on the ballot 
must receive at least 12 of 16 votes cast by the 16-member Golden Era Committee 
at the MLB Winter Meeting in December.[61] In 2011 and 2014, Miñoso received 
9 and 8 votes; in 2011, only Ron Santo with 15 votes was elected to the 
Hall of Fame (inducted 2012).[62][63] In 2014, none of the candidates was
