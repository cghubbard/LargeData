William Chase Temple (December 28, 1862 â€“ January 9, 1917) was a coal, 
citrus, and lumber baron during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. 
He was also a part owner of the Pittsburgh Pirates from baseball's National 
League. He also established the Temple Cup, a trophy awarded to the winner 
of a best-of-seven, post-season Major League Baseball championship series 
that was conducted for four seasons in the National League, from 1894 to 
1897. He became the first sole owner of a professional American football 
team, in 1898. Temple was born in Starke, Florida. After moving to Delaware, 
he attended public school in Wilmington, and graduated from Delaware State 
Normal School in 1879. After graduation, he worked as an employee of Plankinton 
& Armour in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. In June 1880, he worked as a bank clerk 
for Alexander Mitchell Bank in Milwaukee. By 1883, Chase returned to Florida 
and became a lumber baron. Between 1885 and 1889, he was a President and 
General Manager of the Metropolitan Electrical Service Company in New York 
City. He later became a manager of Babcock & Wilcox Steam Boiler Company 
in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania from 1890 thru 1895. While in Pittsburgh, he 
was on the boards of directors of more than 20 industrial, mining and financial 
companies.[1] From 1891 until 1893, Temple was the president and part-owner 
of the Pittsburgh Pirates. In 1894, he donated a 30-inch-high silver cup, 
later called the Temple Cup to the National League. The first and second-place 
teams of the league would play in a seven-game, post season, series to 
determine the winner. The revenue from the series was to be split 65% to 
35%; however, the players of the first series in 1894 decided to evenly 
split the money. However, after the series the New York Giants reportedly 
cheated some Oriole players out of their money, tainting the Cup and prompting 
Temple to sell the Pirates in disgust.[2] In 1898, Temple's interests expanded 
into football when he solely took over the team payments for the Duquesne 
Country and Athletic Club, a professional football team based in Pittsburgh 
from 1895 until 1900, becoming the first known individual football club 
owner. The Duquesnes had become the best professional team in Pennsylvania 
and, almost certainly, in the country. In 1900, A.C. Dinkey stole most 
of the Duquesne players, as well as Temple, for his rival Homestead Library 
& Athletic Club. Over the next two seasons (1900[3] and 1901), Homestead 
fielded the best professional football team in the country and did not 
lose a game.[4][5] In 1902, Temple and Pittsburgh Pirates majority owner, 
Barney Dreyfuss, were suspected of being the secret owners to the Pittsburgh 
Stars of the first National Football League. Temple denied any connection 
to the Stars' finances, as well as being the team's owner. The team's owner 
on paper, David Berry, insisted that he was the team's sole owner. However, 
it was impossible for him to afford the money to finance the team without 
the backing of Temple or Dreyfuss. The Stars would go on to win the 1902 
NFL championship.[6] In 1909, Temple founded the Florida Citrus Exchange 
in 1909 and served as the organization's general manager from 1910 until 
1913. During that time, Temple helped increased the business of the exchange 
from $200,000 to $5,000,000 per year. In 1915, he was named the first president 
of the South Florida Chamber of Commerce. He was also the first life member 
of the American Automobile Association.[1] Temple died in 1917 in Winter 
Park, Florida, and is buried in the local Palm Cemetery.[7] Prior to his 
death, he served as the town's mayor.[8] Temple Terrace, a city in northeastern 
Hillsborough County, was named after Temple. The Temple orange was named 
after him as well.[8] William Chase Temple would go on to marry Carrie 
Lee Wood, the daughter of major league baseball player, Jimmy Wood. The 
couple's daughter, Dorothy, would later marry major league pitcher, Del
