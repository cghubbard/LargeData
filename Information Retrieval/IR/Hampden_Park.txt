Hampden Park (often referred to as Hampden) is a football stadium in the 
Mount Florida area of Glasgow, Scotland. The 51,866-capacity[1] venue serves 
as the national stadium of football in Scotland. It is the normal home 
venue of the Scotland national football team and amateur Scottish league 
club Queen's Park F.C. and regularly hosts the latter stages of the Scottish 
Cup and Scottish League Cup competitions. It is also used for music concerts 
and other sporting events, such as when it was reconfigured as a athletics 
stadium for the 2014 Commonwealth Games. There were two 19th century stadia 
called Hampden Park, built on different sites. A stadium on the present 
site was first opened on 31 October 1903. Hampden was the biggest stadium 
in the world when it was opened, with a capacity in excess of 100,000. 
This was increased further between 1927 and 1937, reaching a peak of 150,000. 
The record attendance of 149,415, for a Scotland v England match in 1937, 
is the European record for an international football match. Tighter safety 
regulations meant that the capacity was reduced to 81,000 in 1977. The 
stadium has been fully renovated since then, with the most recent work 
being completed in 1999. The stadium houses the offices of the Scottish 
Football Association (SFA) and Scottish Professional Football League (SPFL). 
Hampden has hosted prestigious sporting events, including three Champions 
League finals, two Cup Winners' Cup finals and a UEFA Cup final. Hampden 
is a UEFA category four stadium and it is served by the nearby Mount Florida 
and King's Park railway stations. Queen's Park, the oldest club in Scottish 
football, have played at a venue called Hampden Park since October 1873.[3][4] 
The first Hampden Park was overlooked by a nearby terrace named after Englishman 
John Hampden, who fought for the roundheads in the English Civil War.[3][4] 
Queen's Park played at the first Hampden Park for 10 years beginning with 
a Scottish Cup tie on 25 October 1873.[5] The ground hosted the first Scottish 
Cup Final, in 1874, and a Scotland v England match in 1878.[5] The club 
moved to the second Hampden Park, 150 yards from the original, because 
the Cathcart District Railway planned a new line through the site of the 
ground's western terrace.[4][6] A lawn bowling club at the junction of 
Queen's Drive and Cathcart Road marks the site of the first Hampden.[3] 
The second Hampden Park opened in October 1884.[3][4] It became a regular 
home to the Scottish Cup Final, but Celtic Park shared some of the big 
matches including the Scotland v England fixture in 1894.[3] In the late 
1890s, Queen's Park requested more land for development of the second Hampden 
Park.[4][5] This was refused by the landlords, which led to the club seeking 
a new site.[4][5] Henry Erskine Gordon agreed to sell 12 acres of land 
off Somerville Drive to Queen's Park in November 1899.[7][8] James Miller 
designed twin grandstands along the south side of the ground[8] with a 
pavilion wedged in between.[3] The natural slopes were shaped to form banks 
of terracing, designed by Archibald Leitch.[3] Construction of the new 
ground took over three years to complete; during construction, a disaster 
occurred at Ibrox in which part of the wooden terraces collapsed.[8] In 
response, the terraces at Hampden were firmly set in the earthwork and 
innovative techniques were used to control spectators.[8] Third Lanark 
A.C. took over the second Hampden Park in 1903 and renamed it Cathkin Park.[3] 
The club rebuilt the ground from scratch due to a failure to agree a fee 
for the whole stadium.[5][7] Third Lanark went out of business in 1967 
and Cathkin Park is now a public park with much of the original terracing 
still evident.[3][5] Hampden Park was the biggest stadium in the world 
from its opening in 1903 until it was surpassed by the Maracanã in 1950.[6] 
Along with Celtic Park and Ibrox, the city of Glasgow possessed the three 
largest football stadia in the world at the time Hampden opened.[3] In 
the stadium's first match, on 31 October 1903, Queen's Park defeated Celtic 
1–0 in the Scottish league.[3][6][7][9] The first Scottish Cup Final played 
at the ground was an Old Firm match in 1904, attracting a record Scottish 
crowd of 64,672.[9] The first Scotland v England match at the ground was 
played in April 1906 with 102,741 people in attendance, which established 
Hampden as the primary home of the Scotland team.[10] Attendances continued 
to increase during the remainder of the 1900s, as 121,452 saw the 1908 
Scotland v England match.[10] The two Old Firm matches played for the 1909 
Scottish Cup Final attracted a total of 131,000.[10] After the second match 
there was a riot because there was confusion over what would happen next 
when the second match also ended in a draw.[11] The fans believed that 
the replay would be played to a conclusion and demanded that a period of 
extra time be played.[11] The Scottish Cup trophy was withheld as Hampden 
was not in a fit condition to host a second replay.[12] In response to 
the riot, the Scottish Football Association decided not to use Hampden 
as the Scottish Cup Final venue until after the First World War.[13] Queen's 
Park conducted extensive ground improvements after the 1909 riot.[13] A 
new world record of 127,307 were in attendance to see Scotland play England 
in 1912.[14] A fire in 1914 destroyed the pavilion, which was replaced 
by a four-storey structure with a press box on the roof.[3] The Scottish 
Cup Final returned to Hampden in 1920, when a large crowd of 95,000 saw 
Kilmarnock win the cup against Albion Rovers.[15] Record crowds attended 
the 1925 Scottish Cup Final, a 5–0 win for Celtic against Rangers,[16] 
and the 1927 Scotland v England match, England's first win in the stadium.[17] 
Hampden became the sole venue of the Scottish Cup Final after 1925[3] except 
in the 1990s when it was being renovated. Queen's Park purchased more land 
in 1923 to bring the total to 33 acres.[3] 25,000 places were added to 
the terraces and rigid crush barriers were installed in 1927.[3] World 
record crowds attended Scotland matches against England in 1931 and 1933.[18] 
In 1933, Austria, who had beaten Scotland 5–0 in Vienna in 1931, became 
the first foreign national side to visit Hampden Park.[18] Further ground 
improvements increased the official capacity of the ground to 183,388 in 
1937, but the SFA were only allowed to issue 150,000 tickets for games.[19] 
The 1937 Scotland v England match had an official attendance of 149,415, 
but at least 20,000 more people entered the ground without tickets.[19] 
A week later the 1937 Scottish Cup Final between Celtic and Aberdeen drew 
an official crowd of 147,365, with 20,000 more people locked outside.[19] 
During the Second World War, matches at heavily-attended grounds were initially 
prohibited due to the fear of aerial bombing by the Luftwaffe.[20] Scottish 
national league and cup competitions were suspended for the duration of 
the war, but regional league and cup competitions were established in their 
place.[20] Attendance was initially restricted to 50 percent of capacity; 
therefore, when 75,000 attended a wartime cup final in May 1940, it was 
the maximum permitted.[21] The Parashots, a forerunner of the Home Guard, 
set up a command post at Lesser Hampden in 1940.[21] A government official 
presented an order demanding that both the Hampden and Lesser Hampden pitches 
be ploughed and used to plant vegetables, but the Queen's Park committee 
chose to ignore the order and the government did not pursue it.[21] Wartime 
internationals were played at Hampden, and 91,000 saw Scotland beat England 
5–4 on 18 April 1942.[21] After the Second World War ended in 1945, Hampden 
started to host Scotland matches more frequently.[22] Before then, Hampden 
had only hosted 15 matches against England and one match each against Austria 
and Czechoslovakia.[23] During the post-war attendance boom, Hampden was 
the only stadium big enough to host the crowds who wanted to see the team.[22] 
Matches that would have ordinarily attracted a crowd of 40,000 were being 
attended by nearly 100,000.[24] The Hampden fixture list was also expanded 
by the new Scottish League Cup competition.[24] In 1947, Rangers defeated 
Aberdeen in the first League Cup Final.[24] A fire on 25 December 1945 
destroyed the stadium press box and damaged offices.[22] The press box 
was replaced with a plainer two-storey structure that overhung the pitch.[25] 
The capacity of the ground was cut to 135,000 following the Burnden Park 
disaster in Bolton.[25] The re-entry of the Home Nations into FIFA in 1947 
was marked by a match between a Great Britain and a Rest of Europe select 
on 10 May 1947.[26] Great Britain won 6–1 and 130,000 people attended.[26] 
Unusually, a league match between Third Lanark and Hibernian was played 
immediately afterwards at Hampden because Cathkin Park was undergoing repair 
work.[26] The first FIFA World Cup qualification match played at Hampden 
was a 2–0 win for Scotland against Wales on 9 November 1949; this match 
was also part of the 1950 British Home Championship.[27] The win appeared 
to guarantee Scotland qualification for the 1950 FIFA World Cup because 
the top two finishers in the Championship were offered places in the tournament, 
but the SFA decreed that they would only send a team if they were British 
champions.[28] Scotland only needed a draw against England at Hampden to 
meet that condition but lost 1–0.[28] The Coronation Cup, a competition 
to mark the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II, was held in Glasgow during 
May 1953.[29] Four major clubs from each of Scotland and England were invited, 
with the Old Firm clubs playing their matches at Hampden.[29] Celtic and 
Hibernian progressed to the final, and a crowd of 117,060 saw Celtic win 
2–0.[30][31] Scotland hosted the Magical Magyars of Hungary in December 
1954 in front of 113,506 fans.[28] The Scots put up a good fight against 
one of the most outstanding teams in the world at the time, but eventually 
lost 4–2.[32] Scotland qualified for the 1958 FIFA World Cup by defeating 
Spain, including Luis Suarez, Ladislao Kubala and Alfredo Di Stéfano, at 
Hampden.[33] Hampden hosted the 1960 European Cup Final; Real Madrid defeated 
7–3 Eintracht Frankfurt with 130,000 people in attendance.[34][35] Floodlights 
were installed at Hampden in 1961 and were inaugurated with a friendly 
match between Eintracht Frankfurt and Rangers.[36] The ground then also 
hosted the 1962 and 1966 finals of the European Cup Winners' Cup.[36] The 
attendances for each of these finals was less than 50,000,[37] and the 
SFA did not offer to host another European final until the 1976 European 
Cup Final, in which Bayern Munich defeated St Etienne.[38][39] Until 1987, 
Hampden used square goalposts.[39][40] St Etienne believed that two of 
their efforts which hit the square crossbar and rebounded into play would 
have resulted in goals if it had been round.[39][40] After Celtic won the 
1967 European Cup Final, the home leg of their Intercontinental Cup tie 
against Racing Club was held at Hampden.[41] Celtic won 1–0 at Hampden, 
but lost the tie after a play-off in Montevideo.[41] In 1970, Celtic played 
in the semi-finals of the European Cup against English league champions, 
Leeds United.[42] Celtic chose to move their home leg of the tie from their 
Celtic Park home to Hampden, which had a far greater capacity.[42] A crowd 
of 136,505, a record for any match in UEFA competition, saw Celtic win 
2–1 (3–1 on aggregate) to advance to the 1970 European Cup Final.[42] Celtic 
also played European Cup ties against Ajax[43] and Rosenborg[38] at Hampden 
during the 1970s. A fire was deliberately started in the south stand in 
October 1968, destroying offices, 1,400 seats and one of the team dressing 
rooms.[25][44] The fire caused the 1968–69 Scottish League Cup Final to 
be postponed until April.[44] By 1970 Hampden was starting to age as a 
stadium.[34] Wembley had been revamped for the 1966 World Cup, while other 
major stadia were being constructed for tournaments.[34] Public safety 
was emphasized after the Ibrox disaster of January 1971, when 66 spectators 
were crushed to death.[45] A benefit match was played at Hampden, while 
the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 compelled stadium authorities to 
obtain licences from local officials, impose crowd segregation and restrict 
attendances.[46][47] Pittodrie and Ibrox were converted into all-seater 
stadiums, while Hampden's capacity was reduced to 81,000.[25][48] Scotland 
secured qualification for the 1974 FIFA World Cup at Hampden, with a 2–1 
victory over Czechoslovakia.[49] Kenny Dalglish scored the winning goal 
against England in 1976 by nutmegging Ray Clemence.[49] In 1977, Scotland 
again won against Czechoslovakia to move towards qualification for the 
1978 FIFA World Cup.[49] Scotland played a friendly match against world 
champions Argentina in 1979; the talented, 18-year-old Diego Maradona scored 
a goal in a 3–1 win for the visitors.[43][50] During the late 1970s, it 
became apparent that the facilities at Hampden were in need of renewal.[51][52] 
As an amateur club, Queen's Park could not possibly fund the works,[25] 
while Glasgow District Council withdrew funding and the UK Government decided 
not to fund it either.[51][52] Queen's Park considered selling Hampden,[25] 
but a public appeal and minor repair work kept Hampden open during the 
1980s.[51] The riot after the 1980 Scottish Cup Final prompted reforms, 
as alcohol was banned from football stadia in Scotland.[53][54] The first 
phase of the redevelopment involved the demolition of the North Stand, 
the concreting of all terraces and the building a block of turnstiles around 
the upper section of the East Terrace.[55] This work, begun in October 
1981 and completed in 1986, reduced the capacity to 74,370 and cost £3 
million.[55] A second phase had been planned to begin in 1988, but the 
release of the Taylor Report caused the plans to be redrawn and the proposed 
costs escalated to £25 million.[55] Scotland hosted the 1989 FIFA Under-16 
World Cup, with the Scots contesting the final against Saudi Arabia at 
Hampden.[56] After the cancellation of the annual Scotland v England fixture 
in 1989, questions were raised as to whether Scottish football required 
a separate national stadium.[55] Rangers proposed Ibrox as an alternative 
venue, while Murrayfield was about to be redeveloped without public funding.[52][55][57] 
None of these arguments impressed the National Stadium committee, which 
consisted of the SFA, Scottish Football League and Queen's Park.[55] The 
West Terrace was converted to seating in 1991 for only £700,000, but this 
left two terraces and therefore disqualified Hampden from hosting FIFA 
World Cup qualification matches.[55] The UK Government eventually provided 
a grant of £3.5 million in 1992, which allowed work to begin on a £12 million 
project to convert Hampden into an all-seater stadium.[51][55][58] The 
last match played in front of the sloping terraces was the 1992 Scottish 
League Cup Final.[56] Within a year, the east and west ends of the ground 
had been replaced and the partially rebuilt Hampden was re-opened for a 
friendly match between Scotland and Netherlands on 23 March 1994.[55] It 
was then also used for the later stages of the 1993–94 Scottish Cup competition.[59] 
As the capacity of the old South Stand had been limited to 4,500, the total 
capacity of Hampden had been reduced to approximately 37,000.[55] With 
Celtic Park also undergoing extensive redevelopment to become all-seater, 
Celtic spent the 1994–95 season groundsharing at Hampden, at a cost of 
£500,000 rent.[60] The final stage of the renovation began in November 
1997, costing £59 million.[35][61] There was a cost overrun[52] and a fraud 
squad investigated alleged financial irregularities.[62] Queen's Park retained 
ownership of the ground but the renovation was funded by the National Lottery.[52] 
The South Stand was replaced and the stadium was re-opened for the 1999 
Scottish Cup Final.[63] The ground now has a capacity of 51,866.[1] Real 
Madrid were again victorious when Hampden Park hosted the 2002 UEFA Champions 
League Final, defeating Bayer Leverkusen, with Zinedine Zidane scoring 
the winning goal with a left-foot volley.[64][65] Hampden has since hosted 
the 2007 UEFA Cup Final[6] and was one of the venues for football at the 
2012 Summer Olympics.[66][67] One of the 2012 Olympics matches was delayed 
after the North Korean team protested against the flag of South Korea being 
used to represent their players.[68][69] Later in 2012, a Scotland women's 
national football team game was played at Hampden for the first time, when 
it hosted the first leg of a European Championship qualifying playoff against 
Spain.[70] Hampden was temporarily converted into an athletics stadium 
for the 2014 Commonwealth Games.[71][72] It hosted its last international 
game before the conversion work on 15 November 2013 and Queen's Park are 
playing their home games at the Excelsior Stadium in Airdrie.[73][74] Due 
to the works being carried out at the Olympic Stadium, the 2014 London 
Grand Prix was by hosted by Hampden.[75] The conversion works involved 
the removal of eight rows of seating, which reduced the capacity to 44,000.[2] 
Hampden was converted back into a football stadium after the Commonwealth 
Games.[76][77] In September 2014, Hampden was one of 13 venues chosen to 
host matches in the UEFA Euro 2020 tournament.[78] The football match crowd 
at Hampden were renowned for creating the Hampden Roar and trying to terrify 
opposing teams. The stadium's capacity exceeded 100,000 from the early 
1900s until the 1980s and the Roar could be heard whenever Scotland scored 
an important goal.[52] After the renovation of the stadium and the reduced 
capacities, the roar has become more muted.[52] The Hampden Roar was first 
noticed in a game against England in 1929.[79] Scotland, who had played 
the second half with ten players due to an injury to Alex Jackson, equalised 
in the final minute with a goal from Alec Cheyne direct from a corner kick.[79] 
The roar that followed the goal was so loud that Jackson, who was a mile 
away in the Glasgow Victoria Infirmary, could tell that Scotland had scored.[79] 
The phrase Hampden Roar is also used as rhyming slang.[52] People from 
Glasgow may ask, "What's the Hampden?", by which they mean "What is the 
score?" or "How are you?".[52] Hampden is an all-seated bowl stadium, although 
the ground is split into four geographic sections, officially known as 
the North, East, South and West Stands.[80] Due to the dominance of the 
Old Firm within Scottish football and their regular qualification for cup 
matches played at Hampden, the East and West stands are commonly known 
as the Celtic and Rangers ends.[81][82] The East Stand has 12,800 seats 
on a single tier of 53 rows.[55] The two end stands are up to 140 metres 
away from the pitch, due to Hampden retaining its bowl shape after it was 
redeveloped.[83] This distance is almost as great as if Hampden included 
an athletics track, although the distance between the pitch and the two 
side stands is more comparable to a normal football stadium.[83] The South 
Stand is the main stand of the stadium, as it holds the technical areas, 
dressing rooms, indoor warm-up area, executive boxes,[84] lounges[85] and 
media facilities. It has been sponsored by BT Scotland since 1998.[86] 
The South Stand is also the only part of the stadium split into two tiers, 
although there is also a small gallery above the North Stand that has 290 
seats and access to lounges.[80][83] The North Stand accommodates 9,100 
spectators in 46 rows.[83] The total capacity of the stadium is 51,866.[1][5] 
The capacity was temporarily reduced to 44,000 for the 2014 Commonwealth 
Games, as the running track raised the field level by 1.9 metres.[71] The 
redeveloped Hampden has held the top status with the various UEFA stadium 
categories,[6] holding category four status. The Scottish Football Museum, 
which opened in 2001, is located within Hampden.[87][88] Part of the museum 
is the Scottish Football Hall of Fame.[87] A distinctive feature of the 
old Hampden, the press box which sat on the roof of the old South Stand,[89] 
is also exhibited at the museum.[88] The offices of the Scottish Football 
Association, Scottish Premier League and Scottish Football League are all 
located within Hampden.[90] Lesser Hampden is a football stadium located 
immediately beside the western end of Hampden Park. The ground was constructed 
in the early 1920s after additional ground was purchased to expand the 
main stadium.[3][91] Queen's Park proposed in 1990 to sell off Lesser Hampden 
to fund redevelopment works on the main stadium, but this was rejected 
by planners.[55] It is used by Queen's Park for training, reserve team 
matches and youth football.[7] Lesser Hampden was refurbished for use as 
a warm-up area during the 2014 Commonwealth Games.[71] Hampden Park has 
held four full rugby union international matches. The first was in 1906, 
when the Scottish Rugby Union chose to play their match against the touring 
South Africans at Hampden because no rugby ground could satisfy the demand 
to see the visitors.[10] A crowd of over 30,000 saw Scotland win 6–0.[10] 
The redeveloped Hampden served as one of the 1999 Rugby World Cup venues, 
over 90 years later.[10][62] Scotland played Romania in a friendly match 
before the tournament and South Africa played Uruguay in a tournament pool 
match.[92] The only rugby union international played at Hampden since then 
was in November 2004, between Scotland and Australia.[93][94] Hampden hosted 
the Scottish Amateur Athletics Association championships during the 1920s 
and 1930s, with the original Meadowbank Stadium used as an alternative 
venue.[95] Eric Liddell won the 110, 220 and 440 yard dashes in the 1924 
championship.[95] His last competition in Britain was the 1925 championship, 
when he won the 220 yards race for a record fifth time.[95] Hampden was 
temporarily converted to stage the athletics events for the 2014 Commonwealth 
Games.[71][96] It was also used for the closing ceremony.[97] Suzanne Lenglen, 
the French professional tennis player, played an exhibition match against 
Vivian Dewhurst at Hampden in 1927.[17] A crowd of 10,000 saw that match 
and another between male players Howard Kinsey and Karel Koželuh.[17] During 
the Second World War, American armed forces based in Scotland played games 
of softball, baseball and American football at Hampden.[98] American football 
returned to Hampden in 1998, when the NFL Europe team Scottish Claymores 
shared home games between Hampden and Murrayfield. World Bowl XI was held 
at Hampden in 2003, but after the 2004 season the Claymores folded and 
were replaced by the Hamburg Sea Devils. Hampden was the home of the Glasgow 
Tigers speedway team from 1969 until 1972.[99] Poor crowds, escalating 
costs and the refusal of the city council to allow music to be played at 
events contributed to the team moving to Cliftonhill, in Coatbridge.[99] 
The redeveloped Hampden was the venue for a boxing card headlined by former 
world champion Mike Tyson in June 2000.[100][101] Tyson knocked down Lou 
Savarese after just 12 seconds of the fight, which the referee stopped 
after 38 seconds.[100][102] The fight ended in farce as the referee, who 
had been attempting to separate the two fighters, was also knocked down 
by Tyson.[102][103] The disappointed crowd booed Tyson out of the ring,[100][101] 
while former fighters Jim Watt and Barry McGuigan criticised his actions.[102] 
After the fight, Tyson claimed that he wanted to eat the children of world 
champion Lennox Lewis, which also drew criticism.[103][104][105] Genesis 
and Paul Young performed in the first concert at Hampden, in 1987.[106] 
The Rolling Stones played there in 1990, during their Urban Jungle Tour.[106] 
Since the redevelopment of Hampden was completed in 1999, many acts have 
performed there, including The Rolling Stones, Rod Stewart, Tina Turner, 
Bon Jovi, Eagles, U2,[107] Oasis, George Michael, the Red Hot Chili Peppers, 
Neil Diamond, Take That, AC/DC, Bruce Springsteen, Coldplay, Pink, Paul 
McCartney, Rihanna,[108] and Beyoncé. The damage caused to the Hampden 
pitch by a U2 concert in August 2009 forced a Queen's Park league match 
to be postponed.[107] The 50th anniversary Conventicle of the Boys' Brigade, 
which had been founded in Glasgow by William Alexander Smith, was staged 
at Hampden in 1933.[109] 130,000 people were inside the ground, while another 
100,000 stood outside singing Psalms.[109] American evangelical Christian 
missionary Billy Graham had an "All Scotland Crusade" during the spring 
of 1955.[30] The major outdoor event of the tour was at Hampden, where 
a crowd of 100,000 heard him speak.[30] The highest attendance recorded 
at Hampden for a football match was 149,415, for the 1937 British Home 
Championship tie between Scotland and England.[6][35][110] This is still 
a European record for an international match.[6][35][110] The 1937 Scottish 
Cup Final between Celtic and Aberdeen drew an official crowd of 147,365, 
a world record for a club match, with 20,000 more people locked outside.[6][19] 
Hampden set world attendance records that year that were only surpassed 
by the Maracanã,[19] and it still holds all the major European records.[6][110] 
The European Cup match between Celtic and Leeds United in 1970 was attended 
by 136,505, which is a UEFA competition record.[6][110] Since the redevelopment 
of Hampden was completed in 1999, the capacity for sporting events is now 
limited to 52,063. Attendances for concerts can be higher than this as 
people are allowed onto the pitch area. In 2009, more people attended concerts 
at Hampden than football matches.[35] Hampden regularly has crowds of below 
1,000 for Queen's Park matches in the lower divisions of the Scottish football 
league system.[111] Queen's Park have not played in the top division of 
Scottish football since 1958.[30] The nearest railway stations are Mount 
Florida and King's Park.[111][112][113] Both stations are served by trains 
from Glasgow Central on the Cathcart Circle Lines.[111] First Glasgow operate 
several bus routes in the area surrounding Hampden.[112][114] There is 
a stadium car park immediately behind the south stand, but for major events 
this is only available to permit holders.[115] Public car parking is provided 
by City Parking Glasgow on the Queens Park recreational ground and the 
Toryglen playing fields.[116] Coordinates: 55°49′33.11″N 4°15′7.21″W﻿ /
