James Riley Turner (August 6, 1903 – November 29, 1998) was a pitcher and 
coach in Major League Baseball. As a member of the Reds and Yankees, he 
was a member of nine World Series Championship teams between 1940 and 1959, 
two as a player and seven as a coach. Most notably, he was pitching coach 
for the New York Yankees under Casey Stengel from 1949 to 1959, during 
which time they won seven titles. Apart from his baseball career, Turner 
was a lifelong resident of Nashville, Tennessee. From 1937 through 1945, 
he played for the Boston Bees (1937–39), Cincinnati Reds (1940–42) and 
New York Yankees (1942–45). Turner's Major League career got off to a late 
start, as he did not reach the big leagues until he was 33 years old. He 
led the National League in earned run average in 1937 as a rookie with 
Boston. Because he worked for his family's dairy farm in the offseason 
in Antioch, Tennessee, he was known as "Milkman Jim" to his fans. For his 
career, Turner compiled a 69–60 record in 231 games, with a 3.22 earned 
run average and 329 strikeouts. He was a member of two World Series championship 
teams, the 1940 Reds and the 1943 Yankees, as well as the 1942 Yankees 
team that won the American League pennant. In two postseason appearances, 
Turner was 0–1 with a 6.43 ERA and 4 strikeouts in 7 innings pitched. After 
his pitching career ended, Turner served the Yankees (1949–59; 1966–73) 
and Reds (1961–65) as their pitching coach, working for ten pennant-winning 
clubs over that 24-year span. He also managed the Beaumont Exporters (1946), 
Portland Beavers (1947–48) and Nashville Volunteers (1960). Turner was 
criticized by Jim Bouton in his book, Ball Four. Bouton claimed Turner 
(his pitching coach with the Yankees from 1966 to 1968) was a front-runner, 
who only wanted to be associated with successful pitchers. "In case you 
forgot", Bouton wrote, "you could always tell how you were doing by the 
way The Colonel [Turner] said good morning", citing that Turner would greet 
his stars effusively, middling pitchers brusquely, and with struggling 
pitchers he would "[look] past you, over your shoulder, as if you didn't 
exist." Bouton also criticized Turner for yelling obvious advice (such 
as "keep the ball down") from the dugout to a pitcher on the mound, as 
a preemptive second-guess. Bouton noted that pitchers know these principles 
already, and all the shouting can do is break their concentration. "But 
pitching coaches use shouted advice as protection. If they shout enough
