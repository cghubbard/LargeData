Prairie, Illinois was a third baseman for the Cleveland Blues (1884), Brooklyn 
Grays/Bridegrooms/Grooms(1885–91), St. Louis Browns (1892) and Louisville 
Colonels (1893). He helped the Bridegrooms win the 1889 American Association 
Pennant and the 1890 National League Pennant. Pinkney led the American 
Association in games (141), at bats (597) and walks (70) in 1886. He led 
the American Association in games (143), runs (134), times on base (234) 
and outs (419) in 1888. In 10 seasons Pinkney played in 1,163 games and

Major League Baseball's all-time record for most consecutive games played

with the innings played mark having stood for 95 years until it was broken 
by Cal Ripken, Jr.. He remained the only player to play in more than 500 
consecutive games until Fred Luderus played in 533 games. He died in Peoria,
