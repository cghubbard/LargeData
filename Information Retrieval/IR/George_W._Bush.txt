Governor of Texas President of the United States Policies First term Second 
term Post-Presidency George Walker Bush (born July 6, 1946) is an American 
politician who was the 43rd President of the United States from 2001 to 
2009 and 46th Governor of Texas from 1995 to 2000. The eldest son of Barbara 
and George H. W. Bush, he was born in New Haven, Connecticut. After graduating 
from Yale University in 1968 and Harvard Business School in 1975, he worked 
in oil businesses. He married Laura Welch in 1977 and ran unsuccessfully 
for the House of Representatives shortly thereafter. He later co-owned 
the Texas Rangers baseball team before defeating Ann Richards in the 1994 
Texas gubernatorial election. He was elected president in 2000 after a 
close and controversial election against Al Gore, becoming the fourth president 
to be elected while receiving fewer popular votes nationwide than an opponent.[6] 
He is the second president to have been the son of a former president, 
the first having been John Quincy Adams.[7] He is also the brother of Jeb 
Bush, a former Governor of Florida and candidate for the Republican presidential 
nomination in the 2016 presidential election. Eight months into Bush's 
first term as president, the September 11 terrorist attacks occurred. Bush 
responded with what became known as the Bush Doctrine: launching a "War 
on Terror", an international military campaign which included the war in 
Afghanistan, in 2001, and the Iraq War, in 2003. He also promoted policies 
on the economy, health care, education, social security reform, and amending 
the Constitution to prohibit same-sex marriage.[8] He signed into law broad 
tax cuts, the Patriot Act, the No Child Left Behind Act, the Partial-Birth 
Abortion Ban Act, Medicare prescription drug benefits for seniors, and 
funding for the AIDS relief program known as PEPFAR. His tenure saw national 
debates on immigration, Social Security, electronic surveillance, and torture. 
Bush successfully ran for re-election against Democratic Senator John Kerry 
in 2004, in another relatively close election. After his re-election, Bush 
received increasingly heated criticism from across the political spectrum[9][10][11] 
for his handling of the Iraq War, Hurricane Katrina,[12][13][14] and other 
challenges. Amid this criticism, the Democratic Party regained control 
of Congress in the 2006 elections. In December 2007, the United States 
entered its longest post-World War II recession, often referred to as the 
"Great Recession", prompting the Bush administration to obtain congressional 
passage of multiple economic programs intended to preserve the country's 
financial system. Nationally, Bush was both one of the most popular and 
unpopular presidents in history, having received the highest recorded presidential 
approval ratings in the wake of the September 11 attacks, as well as one 
of the lowest approval ratings during the 2008 financial crisis.[15] Bush 
left office in 2009, returning to Texas where he purchased a home in suburban 
Dallas. He is currently a public speaker, and has written a memoir, Decision 
Points.[16] His presidential library was opened in 2013. His presidency 
has been ranked among the worst in historian rankings of U.S. presidents 
published in the late 2000s and 2010s.[17][18][19] George Walker Bush was 
born on July 6, 1946, at Grace-New Haven Hospital (now Yale–New Haven Hospital) 
in New Haven, Connecticut,[20] as the first child of George Herbert Walker 
Bush and Barbara Pierce. He was raised in Midland and Houston, Texas, with 
four siblings, Jeb, Neil, Marvin and Dorothy. Another younger sister, Robin, 
died from leukemia at the age of three in 1953.[21] His grandfather, Prescott 
Bush, was a U.S. Senator from Connecticut.[22] His father, George H.W. 
Bush, was Ronald Reagan's Vice President from 1981 to 1989 and the 41st 
U.S. President from 1989 to 1993. Bush has English and some German ancestry, 
along with more distant Dutch, Welsh, Irish, French, and Scottish roots.[23] 
Bush attended public schools in Midland, Texas, until the family moved 
to Houston after he had completed seventh grade. He then went to The Kinkaid 
School, a prep school in Houston for two years.[24] Bush attended high 
school at the Phillips Academy, a boarding school (then all-male) in Andover, 
Massachusetts, where he played baseball, and during his senior year, was 
the head cheerleader.[25][26] He attended Yale University from 1964 to 
1968, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts degree in History.[27] During 
this time, he was a cheerleader and a member of the Delta Kappa Epsilon, 
serving as the president of the fraternity during his senior year.[28][29][30] 
Bush became a member of the Skull and Bones society as a senior.[31] Bush 
was a rugby union player and was on Yale's 1st XV.[32] He characterized 
himself as an average student.[33] His GPA during his first three years 
at Yale was 77, and he had a similar average under a nonnumeric rating 
system in his final year.[34] Beginning in the fall of 1973, Bush attended 
the Harvard Business School, where he earned an M.B.A. degree. He is the 
only U.S. President to have earned an M.B.A.[35] In May 1968, Bush was 
commissioned into the Texas Air National Guard.[36] After two years of 
active-duty service while training,[37] he was assigned to Houston, flying 
Convair F-102s with the 147th Reconnaissance Wing out of the Ellington 
Field Joint Reserve Base.[36][38] Critics, including former Democratic 
National Committee Chairman Terry McAuliffe, have alleged that Bush was 
favorably treated due to his father's political standing as a member of 
the House of Representatives, citing his selection as a pilot despite his 
low pilot aptitude test scores and his irregular attendance.[36] In June 
2005, the United States Department of Defense released all the records 
of Bush's Texas Air National Guard service, which remain in its official 
archives.[39] In late 1972 and early 1973, he drilled with the 187th Fighter 
Wing of the Alabama Air National Guard, having moved to Montgomery, Alabama, 
to work on the unsuccessful U.S. Senate campaign of Republican Winton M. 
Blount.[40][41] In 1972, Bush was suspended from flying for failure to 
take a scheduled physical exam.[42] He was honorably discharged from the 
Air Force Reserve on November 21, 1974.[43] At a backyard barbecue in 1977, 
friends introduced him to Laura Lane Welch, a school teacher and librarian. 
Bush proposed to her after a three-month courtship, and they married on 
November 5 of that year.[44] The couple settled in Midland, Texas. Bush 
left his family's Episcopal Church to join his wife's United Methodist 
Church.[2] On November 25, 1981, Laura Bush gave birth to fraternal twin 
daughters, Barbara Bush and Jenna Welch Bush;[44] they graduated from high 
school in 2000 and from Yale University and the University of Texas at 
Austin, respectively, in 2004. Prior to his marriage, Bush had multiple 
episodes of alcohol abuse.[45] In one instance, on September 4, 1976, he 
was arrested near his family's summer home in Kennebunkport, Maine, for 
driving under the influence of alcohol. He pleaded guilty, was fined $150, 
and had his Maine driver's license briefly suspended.[46] Bush says his 
wife has had a stabilizing effect on his life,[44] and attributes to her 
influence his 1986 decision to give up alcohol.[47] While Governor of Texas, 
Bush said of his wife, "I saw an elegant, beautiful woman who turned out 
not only to be elegant and beautiful, but very smart and willing to put 
up with my rough edges, and I must confess has smoothed them off over time."[44] 
Bush has been an avid reader throughout his adult life, preferring biographies 
and histories.[48] During his time as president, Bush read the Bible daily.[49] 
He also read 14 Lincoln biographies and, during the last three years of 
his presidency, he reportedly read 186 books. Walt Harrington, a journalist, 
recalls seeing "books by John Fowles, F. Scott Fitzgerald, James Joyce, 
and Gore Vidal lying about, as well as biographies of Willa Cather and 
Queen Victoria" in his home when Bush was a Texas oilman. Other hobbies 
include cigar smoking and golf.[50] Since leaving the White House, Bush 
has also taken up oil painting.[51] His first granddaughter, Margaret Laura 
"Mila" Hager, was born to his daughter Jenna Bush on April 14, 2013. She 
is named after her two grandmothers.[52] In 1978, Bush ran for the House 
of Representatives from Texas's 19th congressional district. His opponent, 
Kent Hance, portrayed him as out of touch with rural Texans. Bush lost 
the election by 6,000 votes (6 percent) of the 103,000 votes cast.[53] 
He returned to the oil industry and began a series of small, independent 
oil exploration companies.[54] He created Arbusto Energy,[55] and later 
changed the name to Bush Exploration. In 1984, his company merged with 
the larger Spectrum 7, and Bush became chairman.[54] The company was hurt 
by decreased oil prices, and it folded into HKN, Inc.[54][56] Bush served 
on the board of directors for HKN.[54] Questions of possible insider trading 
involving HKN arose, but the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) 
investigation concluded that the information Bush had at the time of his 
stock sale was not sufficient to constitute insider trading.[54][57] Bush 
moved his family to Washington, D.C. in 1988 to work on his father's campaign 
for the U.S. presidency.[58][59] He served as a campaign adviser and liaison 
to the media;[54] he assisted his father by campaigning across the country.[54] 
Returning to Texas after the successful campaign, he purchased a share 
in the Texas Rangers baseball franchise in April 1989, where he served 
as managing general partner for five years.[60] He actively led the team's 
projects and regularly attended its games, often choosing to sit in the 
open stands with fans.[61] Bush's sale of his shares in the Rangers in 
1998 brought him over $15 million from his initial $800,000 investment.[62] 
In December 1991, Bush was one of seven people named by his father to run 
his father's 1992 Presidential re-election campaign as "campaign advisor".[63] 
The previous month, his father asked him to tell White House chief of staff 
John H. Sununu that he should resign.[64] As Bush's brother, Jeb, sought 
the governorship of Florida, Bush declared his candidacy for the 1994 Texas 
gubernatorial election. His campaign focused on four themes: welfare reform, 
tort reform, crime reduction, and education improvement.[54] Bush's campaign 
advisers were Karen Hughes, Joe Allbaugh, and Karl Rove.[65] After easily 
winning the Republican primary, Bush faced popular Democratic incumbent 
Governor Ann Richards.[54][66] In the course of the campaign, Bush pledged 
to sign a bill allowing Texans to obtain permits to carry concealed weapons. 
Richards had vetoed the bill, but Bush signed it after he became governor.[67] 
According to The Atlantic Monthly, the race "featured a rumor that she 
was a lesbian, along with a rare instance of such a tactic's making it 
into the public record – when a regional chairman of the Bush campaign 
allowed himself, perhaps inadvertently, to be quoted criticizing Richards 
for 'appointing avowed homosexual activists' to state jobs".[68] The Atlantic, 
and others, connected the lesbian rumor to Karl Rove,[69] but Rove denied 
being involved.[70] Bush won the general election with 53.5 percent against 
Richards' 45.9 percent.[71] Bush used a budget surplus to push through 
Texas's largest tax-cut, $2 billion.[65] He extended government funding 
for organizations providing education of the dangers of alcohol and drug 
use and abuse, and helping to reduce domestic violence.[72] Critics contended 
that during his tenure, Texas ranked near the bottom in environmental evaluations. 
Supporters pointed to his efforts to raise the salaries of teachers and 
improve educational test scores.[54] In 1999, Bush signed a state law obliging 
electric retailers to buy a certain amount of energy from renewable sources 
(RPS),[73][74][75] which helped Texas eventually become the leading producer 
of wind powered electricity in the U.S.[76][77][78] In 1998, Bush won re-election 
with a record[54] 69 percent of the vote.[79] He became the first governor 
in Texas history to be elected to two consecutive four-year terms.[54] 
For most of Texas history, governors served two-year terms; a constitutional 
amendment extended those terms to four years starting in 1975.[80] In his 
second term, Bush promoted faith-based organizations and enjoyed high approval 
ratings.[54] He proclaimed June 10, 2000 to be Jesus Day in Texas, a day 
on which he "urge[d] all Texans to answer the call to serve those in need".[81] 
Throughout Bush's first term, national attention focused on him as a potential 
future presidential candidate. Following his re-election, speculation soared.[54] 
Within a year, he decided to seek the 2000 Republican presidential nomination. 
In June 1999, while Governor of Texas, Bush announced his candidacy for 
President of the United States. With no incumbent running, Bush entered 
a large field of candidates for the Republican Party presidential nomination 
consisting of John McCain, Alan Keyes, Steve Forbes, Gary Bauer, Orrin 
Hatch, Elizabeth Dole, Dan Quayle, Pat Buchanan, Lamar Alexander, John 
Kasich, and Bob Smith. Bush portrayed himself as a compassionate conservative, 
implying he was more centrist than other Republicans. He campaigned on 
a platform that included bringing integrity and honor back to the White 
House, increasing the size of the United States Armed Forces, cutting taxes, 
improving education, and aiding minorities.[54] By early 2000, the race 
had centered on Bush and McCain.[54] Bush won the Iowa caucuses, but, although 
he was heavily favored to win the New Hampshire primary, he trailed McCain 
by 19 percent and lost that primary. Despite this, Bush regained momentum 
and, according to political observers, effectively became the front runner 
after the South Carolina primary, which according to The Boston Globe made 
history for his campaign's negativity; The New York Times described it 
as a smear campaign.[82][83][84] On July 25, 2000, Bush surprised some 
observers by asking Dick Cheney, a former White House Chief of Staff, U.S. 
Representative, and Secretary of Defense, to be his running mate. Cheney 
was then serving as head of Bush's Vice-Presidential search committee. 
Soon after, Bush and Cheney were officially nominated by the Republican 
Party at the 2000 Republican National Convention. Bush continued to campaign 
across the country and touted his record as Governor of Texas.[54] Bush's 
campaign criticized his Democratic opponent, incumbent Vice President Al 
Gore, over gun control and taxation.[85] When the election returns came 
in on November 7, Bush won 29 states, including Florida. The closeness 
of the Florida outcome led to a recount.[54] The initial recount also went 
to Bush, but the outcome was tied up in courts for a month until reaching 
the U.S. Supreme Court.[86] On December 9, in the controversial Bush v. 
Gore ruling,[87] the Court reversed a Florida Supreme Court decision ordering 
a third count, and stopped an ordered statewide hand recount based on the 
argument that the use of different standards among Florida's counties violated 
the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.[54] The machine 
recount showed that Bush had won the Florida vote by a margin of 537 votes 
out of six million cast.[88] Although he received 543,895 fewer individual 
votes than Gore nationwide, Bush won the election, receiving 271 electoral 
votes to Gore's 266 (Gore's statewide victories had electoral votes tallying 
267; however, one of Gore's pledged electors abstained, rendering the official 
tally at 266). Bush was the first person to win an American presidential 
election with fewer national votes than another candidate since Benjamin 
Harrison in 1888.[88] In 2004, Bush commanded broad support in the Republican 
Party and did not encounter a primary challenge. He appointed Ken Mehlman 
as campaign manager, with a political strategy devised by Karl Rove.[89] 
Bush and the Republican platform included a strong commitment to the wars 
in Iraq and Afghanistan,[90] support for the USA PATRIOT Act,[91] a renewed 
shift in policy for constitutional amendments banning abortion and same-sex 
marriage,[90][92] reforming Social Security to create private investment 
accounts,[90] creation of an ownership society,[90] and opposing mandatory 
carbon emissions controls.[93] Bush also called for the implementation 
of a guest worker program for immigrants,[90] which was criticized by conservatives.[94] 
The Bush campaign advertised across the U.S. against Democratic candidates, 
including Bush's emerging opponent, Massachusetts Senator John Kerry. Kerry 
and other Democrats attacked Bush on the Iraq War, and accused him of failing 
to stimulate the economy and job growth. The Bush campaign portrayed Kerry 
as a staunch liberal who would raise taxes and increase the size of government. 
The Bush campaign continuously criticized Kerry's seemingly contradictory 
statements on the war in Iraq,[54] and argued that Kerry lacked the decisiveness 
and vision necessary for success in the War on Terror. In the election, 
Bush carried 31 of 50 states, receiving a total of 286 electoral votes. 
He won an absolute majority of the popular vote (50.7 percent to his opponent's 
48.3 percent).[95] The previous President to win an absolute majority of 
the popular vote was Bush's father in the 1988 election. Additionally, 
it was the first time since Herbert Hoover's election in 1928 that a Republican 
president was elected alongside re-elected Republican majorities in both 
Houses of Congress. Though Bush originally outlined an ambitious domestic 
agenda, his priorities were significantly altered following the September 
11 terrorist attacks in 2001.[96] Wars were waged in Afghanistan and Iraq 
with significant domestic debates regarding immigration, healthcare, Social 
Security, economic policy, and treatment of terrorist detainees. Over an 
eight-year period, Bush's once-high approval ratings[97] steadily declined, 
while his disapproval numbers increased significantly.[98] In 2007, the 
United States entered the longest post-World War II recession.[99] Bush 
took office during a period of economic recession in the wake of the bursting 
of the Dot-com bubble.[100] The terrorist attacks also impacted the economy. 
The Bush administration increased federal government spending from $1.789 
trillion to $2.983 trillion (60 percent) while revenues increased from 
$2.025 trillion to $2.524 trillion (from 2000 to 2008). Individual income 
tax revenues increased by 14 percent, corporate tax revenues by 50 percent, 
customs and duties by 40 percent. Discretionary defense spending was increased 
by 107 percent, discretionary domestic spending by 62 percent, Medicare 
spending by 131 percent, social security by 51 percent, and income security 
spending by 130 percent. Cyclically adjusted, revenues rose by 35 percent 
and spending by 65 percent.[101] The increase in spending was more than 
under any predecessor since Lyndon B. Johnson.[102] The number of economic 
regulation governmental workers increased by 91,196.[103] The surplus in 
fiscal year 2000 was $237 billion—the third consecutive surplus and the 
largest surplus ever.[104] In 2001, Bush's budget estimated that there 
would be a $5.6 trillion surplus over the next ten years.[105] Facing congressional 
opposition, Bush held townhall style meetings across the U.S. in order 
to increase public support for his plan for a $1.35 trillion tax cut program—one 
of the largest tax cuts in U.S. history.[54] Bush argued that unspent government 
funds should be returned to taxpayers, saying "the surplus is not the government's 
money. The surplus is the people's money."[54] Federal Reserve chairman 
Alan Greenspan warned of a recession and Bush stated that a tax cut would 
stimulate the economy and create jobs.[106] Treasury Secretary Paul H. 
O'Neill, opposed some of the tax cuts on the basis that they would contribute 
to budget deficits and undermine Social Security.[107] O'Neill disputes 
the claim, made in Bush's book Decision Points, that he never openly disagreed 
with him on planned tax cuts.[108] By 2003, the economy showed signs of 
improvement, though job growth remained stagnant.[54] Another tax cut program 
was passed that year. During the 2001 to 2008 years, GDP grew at an average 
annual rate of 2.125 percent,[109] less than for past business cycles.[110] 
Bush entered office with the Dow Jones Industrial Average at 10,587, and 
the average peaked in October 2007 at over 14,000. When Bush left office, 
the average was at 7,949, one of the lowest levels of his presidency.[111] 
Unemployment originally rose from 4.2 percent in January 2001 to 6.3 percent 
in June 2003, but subsequently dropped to 4.5 percent as of July 2007.[112] 
Adjusted for inflation, median household income dropped by $1,175 between 
2000 and 2007,[113] while Professor Ken Homa of Georgetown University has 
noted that "Median real after-tax household income went up 2%".[114] The 
poverty rate increased from 11.3 percent in 2000 to 12.3 percent in 2006 
after peaking at 12.7 percent in 2004.[115] By October 2008, due to increases 
in spending,[116] the national debt had risen to $11.3 trillion,[117] an 
increase of over 100 percent from 2000 when the debt was only $5.6 trillion.[118][119] 
Most debt was accumulated as a result of what became known as the "Bush 
tax cuts" and increased national security spending.[120] In March 2006, 
then-Senator Barack Obama said when he voted against raising the debt ceiling: 
"The fact that we are here today to debate raising America's debt limit 
is a sign of leadership failure."[121] By the end of Bush's presidency, 
unemployment climbed to 7.2 percent.[122] In December 2007, the United 
States entered the longest post–World War II recession,[123] which included 
a housing market correction, a subprime mortgage crisis, soaring oil prices, 
and a declining dollar value.[124] In February, 63,000 jobs were lost, 
a five-year record.[125][126] To aid with the situation, Bush signed a 
$170 billion economic stimulus package which was intended to improve the 
economic situation by sending tax rebate checks to many Americans and providing 
tax breaks for struggling businesses. The Bush administration pushed for 
significantly increased regulation of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in 2003,[127] 
and after two years, the regulations passed the House but died in the Senate. 
Many Republican senators, as well as influential members of the Bush Administration, 
feared that the agency created by these regulations would merely be mimicking 
the private sector's risky practices.[128][129][130] In September 2008, 
the crisis became much more serious beginning with the government takeover 
of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac followed by the collapse of Lehman Brothers 
and a federal bailout of American International Group for $85 billion.[131] 
Many economists and world governments determined that the situation became 
the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.[132][133] Additional 
regulation over the housing market would have been beneficial, according 
to former Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan.[134] Bush, meanwhile, 
proposed a financial rescue plan to buy back a large portion of the U.S. 
mortgage market.[135] Vince Reinhardt, a former Federal Reserve economist 
now at the American Enterprise Institute, said "it would have helped for 
the Bush administration to empower the folks at Treasury and the Federal 
Reserve and the comptroller of the currency and the FDIC to look at these 
issues more closely", and additionally, that it would have helped "for 
Congress to have held hearings".[129] In November 2008, over 500,000 jobs 
were lost, which marked the largest loss of jobs in the United States in 
34 years.[136] The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that in the last 
four months of 2008, 1.9 million jobs were lost.[137] By the end of 2008, 
the U.S. had lost a total of 2.6 million jobs.[138] Bush undertook a number 
of educational priorities, such as increasing the funding for the National 
Science Foundation and National Institutes of Health in his first years 
of office, and creating education programs to strengthen the grounding 
in science and mathematics for American high school students. Funding for 
the NIH was cut in 2006, the first such cut in 36 years, due to rising 
inflation.[139] One of the administration's early major initiatives was 
the No Child Left Behind Act, which aimed to measure and close the gap 
between rich and poor student performance, provide options to parents with 
students in low-performing schools, and target more federal funding to 
low-income schools. This landmark education initiative passed with broad 
bipartisan support, including that of Senator Ted Kennedy of Massachusetts.[140] 
It was signed into law by Bush in early 2002.[141] Many contend that the 
initiative has been successful, as cited by the fact that students in the 
U.S. have performed significantly better on state reading and math tests 
since Bush signed "No Child Left Behind" into law.[142] Critics argue that 
it is underfunded[143] and that NCLBA's focus on "high-stakes testing" 
and quantitative outcomes is counterproductive.[144] After being re-elected, 
Bush signed into law a Medicare drug benefit program that, according to 
Jan Crawford, resulted in "the greatest expansion in America's welfare 
state in forty years;" the bill's costs approached $7 trillion.[145] In 
2007, Bush opposed and vetoed State Children's Health Insurance Program 
(SCHIP) legislation, which was added by the Democrats onto a war funding 
bill and passed by Congress. The SCHIP legislation would have significantly 
expanded federally funded health care benefits and plans to children of 
some low-income families from about six million to ten million children. 
It was to be funded by an increase in the cigarette tax.[146] Bush viewed 
the legislation as a move toward socialized health care, and asserted that 
the program could benefit families making as much as $83,000 per year who 
did not need the help.[147] Following Republican efforts to pass the Medicare 
Act of 2003, Bush signed the bill, which included major changes to the 
Medicare program by providing beneficiaries with some assistance in paying 
for prescription drugs, while relying on private insurance for the delivery 
of benefits.[148] The retired persons lobby group AARP worked with the 
Bush Administration on the program and gave their endorsement. Bush said 
the law, estimated to cost $400 billion over the first ten years, would 
give the elderly "better choices and more control over their health care".[149] 
Bush began his second term by outlining a major initiative to reform Social 
Security,[150] which was facing record deficit projections beginning in 
2005. Bush made it the centerpiece of his domestic agenda despite opposition 
from some in the U.S. Congress.[150] In his 2005 State of the Union Address, 
Bush discussed the potential impending bankruptcy of the program and outlined 
his new program, which included partial privatization of the system, personal 
Social Security accounts, and options to permit Americans to divert a portion 
of their Social Security tax (FICA) into secured investments.[150] Democrats 
opposed the proposal to partially privatize the system.[150] Bush embarked 
on a 60-day national tour, campaigning for his initiative in media events 
known as "Conversations on Social Security", in an attempt to gain public 
support.[151] Nevertheless, public support for the proposal declined[152] 
and the House Republican leadership decided not to put Social Security 
reform on the priority list for the remainder of their 2005 legislative 
agenda.[153] The proposal's legislative prospects were further diminished 
by the political fallout from Hurricane Katrina in the fall of 2005.[154] 
After the Democrats gained control of both houses of Congress as a result 
of the 2006 midterm elections, there was no prospect of further congressional 
action on the Bush proposal for the remainder of his term in office. Upon 
taking office in 2001, Bush stated his opposition to the Kyoto Protocol, 
an amendment to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 
which seeks to impose mandatory targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, 
citing that the treaty exempted 80 percent of the world's population[155] 
and would have cost tens of billions of dollars per year.[156] He also 
cited that the Senate had voted 95–0 in 1997 on a resolution expressing 
its disapproval of the protocol. In May 2001, Bush signed an executive 
order to create an inter-agency task force to streamline energy projects,[157] 
and later signed two other executive orders to tackle environmental issues.[158] 
In 2002, Bush announced the Clear Skies Act of 2003,[159] aimed at amending 
the Clean Air Act to reduce air pollution through the use of emissions 
trading programs. Many experts argued that this legislation would have 
weakened the original legislation by allowing higher emission rates of 
pollutants than were previously legal.[160] The initiative was introduced 
to Congress, but failed to make it out of committee. Later in 2006, Bush 
declared the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands a national monument, creating 
the largest marine reserve to date. The Papahānaumokuākea Marine National 
Monument comprises 84 million acres (340,000 km2) and is home to 7,000 
species of fish, birds, and other marine animals, many of which are specific 
to only those islands.[161] The move was hailed by conservationists for 
"its foresight and leadership in protecting this incredible area".[162] 
Bush has said that he believes that global warming is real[163] and has 
noted that it is a serious problem, but he asserted there is a "debate 
over whether it's man-made or naturally caused".[164] The Bush Administration's 
stance on global warming remained controversial in the scientific and environmental 
communities. Critics have alleged that the administration[165] misinformed 
the public and did not do enough to reduce carbon emissions and deter global 
warming.[166] In his 2006 State of the Union Address, Bush declared, "America 
is addicted to oil" and announced his Advanced Energy Initiative to increase 
energy development research.[167] In his 2007 State of the Union Address, 
Bush renewed his pledge to work toward diminished reliance on foreign oil 
by reducing fossil fuel consumption and increasing alternative fuel production.[168] 
Amid high gasoline prices in 2008, Bush lifted a ban on offshore drilling.[169] 
However, the move was largely symbolic as there is still a federal law 
banning offshore drilling. Bush said, "This means that the only thing standing 
between the American people and these vast oil reserves is action from 
the U.S. Congress."[169] Bush had said in June 2008, "In the long run, 
the solution is to reduce demand for oil by promoting alternative energy 
technologies. My administration has worked with Congress to invest in gas-saving 
technologies like advanced batteries and hydrogen fuel cells... In the 
short run, the American economy will continue to rely largely on oil. And 
that means we need to increase supply, especially here at home. So my administration 
has repeatedly called on Congress to expand domestic oil production."[170] 
In his 2008 State of the Union Address, Bush announced that the U.S. would 
commit $2 billion over the next three years to a new international fund 
to promote clean energy technologies and fight climate change, saying, 
"Along with contributions from other countries, this fund will increase 
and accelerate the deployment of all forms of cleaner, more efficient technologies 
in developing nations like India and China, and help leverage substantial 
private-sector capital by making clean energy projects more financially 
attractive." He also announced plans to reaffirm the United States' commitment 
to work with major economies, and, through the UN, to complete an international 
agreement that will slow, stop, and eventually reverse the growth of greenhouse 
gases; he stated, "This agreement will be effective only if it includes 
commitments by every major economy and gives none a free ride."[171] Federal 
funding for medical research involving the creation or destruction of human 
embryos through the Department of Health and Human Services and the National 
Institutes of Health has been forbidden by law since the passage in 1995 
of the Dickey-Wicker Amendment by Congress and the signature of President 
Bill Clinton.[172] Bush has said that he supports adult stem cell research 
and has supported federal legislation that finances adult stem cell research. 
However, Bush did not support embryonic stem cell research.[173] On August 
9, 2001, Bush signed an executive order lifting the ban on federal funding 
for the 71 existing "lines" of stem cells,[174] but the ability of these 
existing lines to provide an adequate medium for testing has been questioned. 
Testing can be done on only 12 of the original lines, and all approved 
lines have been cultured in contact with mouse cells, which creates safety 
issues that complicate development and approval of therapies from these 
lines.[175] On July 19, 2006, Bush used his veto power for the first time 
in his presidency to veto the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act. The bill 
would have repealed the Dickey-Wicker Amendment, thereby permitting federal 
money to be used for research where stem cells are derived from the destruction 
of an embryo.[176] On May 21, 2008 President George W. Bush signed into 
law the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA).[177][178] The 
bill aims to protect Americans against discrimination based on their genetic 
information when it comes to health insurance and employment. The issue 
had been debated for 13 years before becoming law. It is designed to protect 
citizens while not hindering genetic research. Nearly 8 million immigrants 
came to the United States from 2000 to 2005, more than in any other five-year 
period in the nation's history.[179] Almost half entered illegally.[180] 
In 2006, Bush urged Congress to allow more than 12 million illegal immigrants 
to work in the United States with the creation of a "temporary guest-worker 
program". Bush also urged Congress to provide additional funds for border 
security and committed to deploying 6,000 National Guard troops to the 
Mexico–United States border.[181] From May to June 2007, Bush strongly 
supported the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007, which was written 
by a bipartisan group of Senators with the active participation of the 
Bush administration.[182] The bill envisioned a legalization program for 
illegal immigrants, with an eventual path to citizenship; establishing 
a guest worker program; a series of border and work site enforcement measures; 
a reform of the green card application process and the introduction of 
a point-based "merit" system for green cards; elimination of "chain migration" 
and of the Diversity Immigrant Visa; and other measures. Bush argued that 
the lack of legal status denies the protections of U.S. laws to millions 
of people who face dangers of poverty and exploitation, and penalizes employers 
despite a demand for immigrant labor.[183] Bush contended that the proposed 
bill did not amount to amnesty.[184] A heated public debate followed, which 
resulted in a substantial rift within the Republican Party, most conservatives 
opposed it because of its legalization or amnesty provisions.[185] The 
bill was eventually defeated in the Senate on June 28, 2007, when a cloture 
motion failed on a 46–53 vote.[186] Bush expressed disappointment upon 
the defeat of one of his signature domestic initiatives.[187] The Bush 
administration later proposed a series of immigration enforcement measures 
that do not require a change in law.[188] On September 19, 2010, former 
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said that Bush offered to accept 100,000 
Palestinian refugees as American citizens if a permanent settlement had 
been reached between Israel and the Palestinian Authority.[189] Hurricane 
Katrina, one of the most damaging natural disasters in U.S. history, struck 
early in Bush's second term. Katrina formed in late August during the 2005 
Atlantic hurricane season and devastated much of the north-central Gulf 
Coast of the United States, particularly New Orleans.[190] Bush declared 
a state of emergency in Louisiana on August 27,[191] and in Mississippi 
and Alabama the following day;[192] he authorized the Department of Homeland 
Security (DHS) and Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to manage 
the disaster, but his announcement failed to spur these agencies to action.[193] 
The eye of the hurricane made landfall on August 29, and New Orleans began 
to flood due to levee breaches; later that day, Bush declared that a major 
disaster existed in Louisiana,[194] officially authorizing FEMA to start 
using federal funds to assist in the recovery effort. On August 30, DHS 
Secretary Michael Chertoff declared it "an incident of national significance",[195] 
triggering the first use of the newly created National Response Plan. Three 
days later, on September 2, National Guard troops first entered the city 
of New Orleans.[196] The same day, Bush toured parts of Louisiana, Mississippi, 
and Alabama and declared that the success of the recovery effort up to 
that point was "not enough".[197] As the disaster in New Orleans intensified, 
critics charged that Bush was misrepresenting his administration's role 
in what they saw as a flawed response. Leaders attacked Bush for having 
appointed apparently incompetent leaders to positions of power at FEMA, 
notably Michael D. Brown;[198] it was also argued that the federal response 
was limited as a result of the Iraq War[199] and Bush himself did not act 
upon warnings of floods.[200][201][202] Bush responded to mounting criticism 
by accepting full responsibility for the federal government's failures 
in its handling of the emergency.[196] It has been argued that with Katrina, 
Bush passed a political tipping point from which he would not recover.[203] 
During Bush's second term, a controversy arose over the Justice Department's 
midterm dismissal of seven United States Attorneys.[204] The White House 
maintained that the U.S. attorneys were fired for poor performance.[205] 
Attorney General Alberto Gonzales later resigned over the issue, along 
with other senior members of the Justice Department.[206][207] The House 
Judiciary Committee issued subpoenas for advisers Harriet Miers and Josh 
Bolten to testify regarding this matter, but Bush directed Miers and Bolten 
to not comply with those subpoenas, invoking his right of executive privilege. 
Bush maintained that all of his advisers were protected under a broad executive 
privilege protection to receive candid advice. The Justice Department determined 
that the President's order was legal.[208] Although Congressional investigations 
focused on whether the Justice Department and the White House were using 
the U.S. Attorney positions for political advantage, no official findings 
have been released. On March 10, 2008, the Congress filed a federal lawsuit 
to enforce their issued subpoenas.[209] On July 31, 2008, a United States 
district court judge ruled that Bush's top advisers were not immune from 
Congressional subpoenas.[210] In all, twelve Justice Department officials 
resigned rather than testify under oath before Congress. They included 
Attorney General Alberto Gonzales[211] and his chief of staff Kyle Sampson,[212] 
Gonzales' liaison to the White House Monica Goodling,[213] aide to the 
president Karl Rove[214] and his senior aide Sara Taylor.[215] In addition, 
legal counsel to the president Harriet Miers[216] and deputy chief of staff 
to the president Joshua Bolten[217] were both found in contempt of Congress.[215] 
In 2010, the Justice Department investigator concluded that though political 
considerations did play a part in as many as four of the attorney firings,[218] 
the firings were "inappropriately political", but not criminal. According 
to the prosecutors, there was insufficient evidence to pursue prosecution 
for any criminal offense.[219] In July 2001, Bush visited Pope John Paul 
II at Castel Gandolfo.[220] During his Presidential campaign, Bush's foreign 
policy platform included support for stronger economic and political relationship 
with Latin America, especially Mexico, and a reduction of involvement in 
"nation-building" and other small-scale military engagements. The administration 
pursued a national missile defense.[221] Bush was an advocate of China's 
entry into the World Trade Organization.[222] In his 2002 State of the 
Union Address, Bush referred to an axis of evil including Iraq, Iran and 
North Korea.[223] After the September 11 attacks on New York, Bush launched 
the War on Terror, in which the United States military and a small international 
coalition invaded Afghanistan. In 2003, Bush then launched the invasion 
of Iraq, searching for Weapons of Mass Destruction, which he described 
as being part of the War on Terrorism.[224] Those invasions led to the 
toppling of the Taliban regime in Afghanistan and the removal of Saddam 
Hussein from power in Iraq. Bush began his second term with an emphasis 
on improving strained relations with European nations. He appointed long-time 
adviser Karen Hughes to oversee a global public relations campaign. Bush 
lauded the pro-democracy struggles in Georgia and Ukraine.[citation needed] 
In March 2006, a visit to India led to renewed ties between the two countries, 
reversing decades of U.S. policy.[225] The visit focused particularly on 
areas of nuclear energy and counter-terrorism cooperation, discussions 
that would lead eventually to the India–United States Civil Nuclear Agreement.[226] 
This is in stark contrast to the stance taken by his predecessor, Clinton, 
whose approach and response to India after the 1998 nuclear tests was that 
of sanctions and hectoring. The relationship between India and the United 
States was one that dramatically improved during Bush's tenure.[227] Midway 
through Bush's second term, it was questioned whether Bush was retreating 
from his freedom and democracy agenda, highlighted in policy changes toward 
some oil-rich former Soviet republics in central Asia.[228] In an address 
before both Houses of Congress on September 20, 2001, Bush thanked the 
nations of the world for their support following the September 11 attacks. 
He specifically thanked UK Prime Minister Tony Blair for traveling to Washington 
to show "unity of purpose with America", and said "America has no truer 
friend than Great Britain."[229] The September 11 terrorist attacks were 
a major turning point in Bush's presidency. That evening, he addressed 
the nation from the Oval Office, promising a strong response to the attacks. 
He also emphasized the need for the nation to come together and comfort 
the families of the victims. On September 14, he visited Ground Zero, meeting 
with Mayor Rudy Giuliani, firefighters, police officers, and volunteers. 
Bush addressed the gathering via a megaphone while standing on a heap of 
rubble, to much applause: "I can hear you. The rest of the world hears 
you. And the people who knocked these buildings down will hear all of us 
soon."[230] In a September 20 speech, Bush condemned Osama bin Laden and 
his organization Al-Qaeda, and issued an ultimatum to the Taliban regime 
in Afghanistan, where bin Laden was operating, to "hand over the terrorists, 
or ... share in their fate".[231] After September 11, Bush announced a 
global War on Terror. The Afghan Taliban regime was not forthcoming with 
Osama bin Laden, so Bush ordered the invasion of Afghanistan to overthrow 
the Taliban regime.[232] In his January 29, 2002 State of the Union Address, 
he asserted that an "axis of evil" consisting of North Korea, Iran, and 
Iraq was "arming to threaten the peace of the world" and "pose[d] a grave 
and growing danger".[233] The Bush Administration asserted both a right 
and the intention to wage preemptive war, or preventive war.[234] This 
became the basis for the Bush Doctrine which weakened the unprecedented 
levels of international and domestic support for the United States which 
had followed the September 11 attacks.[235] Dissent and criticism of Bush's 
leadership in the War on Terror increased as the war in Iraq continued.[236][237][238] 
In 2006, a National Intelligence Estimate concluded that the Iraq War had 
become the "cause célèbre for jihadists".[239][240] On October 7, 2001, 
U.S. and British forces initiated bombing campaigns that led to the arrival 
of Northern Alliance troops in Kabul on November 13. The main goals of 
the war were to defeat the Taliban, drive al-Qaeda out of Afghanistan, 
and capture key al-Qaeda leaders. In December 2001, the Pentagon reported 
that the Taliban had been defeated,[241] but cautioned that the war would 
go on to continue weakening Taliban and al-Qaeda leaders.[241] Later that 
month the UN had installed the Afghan Transitional Administration chaired 
by Hamid Karzai.[242][243] In 2002, based on UNICEF figures, Nicholas Kristof 
reported that "our invasion of Afghanistan may end up saving one million 
lives over the next decade" as the result of improved healthcare and greater 
access to humanitarian aid.[244] Efforts to kill or capture al-Qaeda leader 
Osama bin Laden failed as he escaped a battle in December 2001 in the mountainous 
region of Tora Bora, which the Bush Administration later acknowledged to 
have resulted from a failure to commit enough U.S. ground troops.[245] 
It was not until May 2011, two years after Bush left office, that bin Laden 
was killed by U.S. forces. Bin Laden's successor, Ayman al-Zawahiri, remains 
at large. Despite the initial success in driving the Taliban from power 
in Kabul, by early 2003 the Taliban was regrouping, amassing new funds 
and recruits.[246] The 2005 failure of Operation Red Wings showed that 
the Taliban had returned.[247] In 2006, the Taliban insurgency appeared 
larger, fiercer and better organized than expected, with large-scale allied 
offensives such as Operation Mountain Thrust attaining limited success.[248][249][250] 
As a result, Bush commissioned 3,500 additional troops to the country in 
March 2007.[251] Beginning with his January 29, 2002 State of the Union 
address, Bush began publicly focusing attention on Iraq, which he labeled 
as part of an "axis of evil" allied with terrorists and posing "a grave 
and growing danger" to U.S. interests through possession of weapons of 
mass destruction.[233][252] In the latter half of 2002, CIA reports contained 
assertions of Saddam Hussein's intent of reconstituting nuclear weapons 
programs, not properly accounting for Iraqi biological and chemical weapons, 
and that some Iraqi missiles had a range greater than allowed by the UN 
sanctions.[253][254] Contentions that the Bush Administration manipulated 
or exaggerated the threat and evidence of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction 
capabilities would eventually become a major point of criticism for the 
president.[255][256] In late 2002 and early 2003, Bush urged the United 
Nations to enforce Iraqi disarmament mandates, precipitating a diplomatic 
crisis. In November 2002, Hans Blix and Mohamed ElBaradei led UN weapons 
inspectors in Iraq, but were advised by the U.S. to depart the country 
four days prior to the U.S. invasion, despite their requests for more time 
to complete their tasks.[257] The U.S. initially sought a UN Security Council 
resolution authorizing the use of military force but dropped the bid for 
UN approval due to vigorous opposition from several countries.[258] More 
than 20 nations (most notably the United Kingdom), designated the "coalition 
of the willing" joined the United States[259] in invading Iraq. They launched 
the invasion on March 20, 2003. The Iraqi military was quickly defeated. 
The capital, Baghdad, fell on April 9, 2003. On May 1, Bush declared the 
end of major combat operations in Iraq. The initial success of U.S. operations 
increased his popularity, but the U.S. and allied forces faced a growing 
insurgency led by sectarian groups; Bush's "Mission Accomplished" speech 
was later criticized as premature.[260] From 2004 until 2007, the situation 
in Iraq deteriorated further, with some observers arguing that there was 
a full-scale civil war in Iraq.[261] Bush's policies met with criticism, 
including demands domestically to set a timetable to withdraw troops from 
Iraq. The 2006 report of the bipartisan Iraq Study Group, led by James 
Baker, concluded that the situation in Iraq was "grave and deteriorating". 
While Bush admitted that there were strategic mistakes made in regards 
to the stability of Iraq,[262] he maintained he would not change the overall 
Iraq strategy.[263][264] According to Iraq Body Count, some 251,000 Iraqis 
have been killed in the civil war following the U.S.-led invasion, including 
at least 163,841 civilians.[265] In January 2005, free, democratic elections 
were held in Iraq for the first time in 50 years.[266] According to Iraqi 
National Security Advisor Mowaffak al-Rubaie, "This is the greatest day 
in the history of this country."[266] Bush praised the event as well, saying 
that the Iraqis "have taken rightful control of their country's destiny".[266] 
This led to the election of Jalal Talabani as President and Nouri al-Maliki 
as Prime Minister of Iraq. A referendum to approve a constitution in Iraq 
was held in October 2005, supported by most Shiites and many Kurds.[267] 
On January 10, 2007, Bush announced a surge of 21,500 more troops for Iraq, 
as well as a job program for Iraqis, more reconstruction proposals, and 
$1.2 billion for these programs.[268] On May 1, 2007, Bush used his second-ever 
veto to reject a bill setting a deadline for the withdrawal of U.S. troops,[269] 
saying the debate over the conflict was "understandable" but insisting 
that a continued U.S. presence there was crucial.[270] In March 2008, Bush 
praised the Iraqi government's "bold decision" to launch the Battle of 
Basra against the Mahdi Army, calling it "a defining moment in the history 
of a free Iraq".[271] He said he would carefully weigh recommendations 
from his commanding General David Petraeus and Ambassador Ryan Crocker 
about how to proceed after the end of the military buildup in the summer 
of 2008. He also praised the Iraqis' legislative achievements, including 
a pension law, a revised de-Baathification law, a new budget, an amnesty 
law, and a provincial powers measure that, he said, set the stage for the 
Iraqi elections.[272] By July 2008, American troop deaths had reached their 
lowest number since the war began,[273] and due to increased stability 
in Iraq, Bush announced the withdrawal of additional American forces.[273] 
Following the events of September 11, Bush issued an executive order authorizing 
the President's Surveillance Program which included allowing the NSA to 
monitor communications between suspected terrorists outside the U.S and 
parties within the U.S. without obtaining a warrant as required by the 
Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.[274] As of 2009, the other provisions 
of the program remained highly classified.[275] Once the Department of 
Justice Office of Legal Counsel questioned its original legal opinion that 
FISA did not apply in a time of war, the program was subsequently re-authorized 
by the President on the basis that the warrant requirements of FISA were 
implicitly superseded by the subsequent passage of the Authorization for 
Use of Military Force Against Terrorists.[276] The program proved to be 
controversial, as critics of the administration, as well as organizations 
such as the American Bar Association, argued that it was illegal.[277] 
In August 2006, a U.S. district court judge ruled that the NSA electronic 
surveillance program was unconstitutional,[278] but on July 6, 2007, that 
ruling was vacated by the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth 
Circuit on the grounds that the plaintiffs lacked standing.[279] On January 
17, 2007, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales informed U.S. Senate leaders 
that the program would not be reauthorized by the President, but would 
be subjected to judicial oversight.[280] Later in 2007, the NSA launched 
a replacement for the program, referred to as PRISM, that was subject to 
the oversight of the United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.[281] 
This program was not publicly revealed until reports by The Washington 
Post[281] and The Guardian[282] emerged in June 2013.[281] Bush authorized 
the CIA to use waterboarding as one of several enhanced interrogation techniques.[283][284][285] 
Between 2002 and 2003 the CIA considered certain enhanced interrogation 
techniques, such as waterboarding, to be legal based on a secret Justice 
Department legal opinion arguing that terror detainees were not protected 
by the Geneva Conventions' ban on torture and Vice President Cheney said 
enhanced interrogation including waterboarding was not torture or illegal.[286][287] 
The CIA had exercised the technique on certain key terrorist suspects under 
authority given to it in the Bybee Memo from the Attorney General, though 
that memo was later withdrawn.[288] While not permitted by the U.S. Army 
Field Manuals which assert "that harsh interrogation tactics elicit unreliable 
information",[286] the Bush administration believed these enhanced interrogations 
"provided critical information" to preserve American lives.[289] Critics, 
such as former CIA officer Bob Baer, have stated that information was suspect, 
"you can get anyone to confess to anything if the torture's bad enough."[290] 
On October 17, 2006, Bush signed into law the Military Commissions Act 
of 2006,[291] a law enacted in the wake of the Supreme Court's decision 
in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, 548 U.S. 557 (2006),[292] which allows the U.S. 
government to prosecute unlawful enemy combatants by military commission 
rather than a standard trial. The law also denies them access to habeas 
corpus and bars the torture of detainees, but allows the president to determine 
what constitutes torture.[291] On March 8, 2008, Bush vetoed H.R. 2082,[293] 
a bill that would have expanded congressional oversight over the intelligence 
community and banned the use of waterboarding as well as other forms of 
interrogation not permitted under the United States Army Field Manual on 
Human Intelligence Collector Operations, saying that "the bill Congress 
sent me would take away one of the most valuable tools in the War on Terror".[294] 
In April 2009, the ACLU sued and won release of the secret memos that had 
authorized the Bush administration's interrogation tactics.[295] One memo 
detailed specific interrogation tactics including a footnote that described 
waterboarding as torture as well as that the form of waterboarding used 
by the CIA was far more intense than authorized by the Justice Department.[296] 
Bush publicly condemned Kim Jong-il of North Korea, naming North Korea 
one of three states in an "axis of evil", and saying that "the United States 
of America will not permit the world's most dangerous regimes to threaten 
us with the world's most destructive weapons."[233] Within months, "both 
countries had walked away from their respective commitments under the U.S.–DPRK 
Agreed Framework of October 1994."[297] North Korea's October 9, 2006, 
detonation of a nuclear device further complicated Bush's foreign policy, 
which centered for both terms of his presidency on "[preventing] the terrorists 
and regimes who seek chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons from threatening 
the United States and the world".[233] Bush condemned North Korea's position, 
reaffirmed his commitment to "a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula", and stated 
that "transfer of nuclear weapons or material by North Korea to states 
or non-state entities would be considered a grave threat to the United 
States", for which North Korea would be held accountable.[14] On May 7, 
2007, North Korea agreed to shut down its nuclear reactors immediately 
pending the release of frozen funds held in a foreign bank account. This 
was a result of a series of three-way talks initiated by the United States 
and including China.[298] On September 2, 2007, North Korea agreed to disclose 
and dismantle all of its nuclear programs by the end of 2007.[299] By May 
2009, North Korea had restarted its nuclear program and threatened to attack 
South Korea.[300] On June 22, 2010, "While South Korea prospers, the people 
of North Korea have suffered profoundly," he said, adding that, "communism 
had resulted in dire poverty, mass starvation and brutal suppression. "In 
recent years," he went on to say, "the suffering has been compounded by 
the leader who wasted North Korea's precious few resources on personal 
luxuries and nuclear weapons programs."[301] Bush expanded economic sanctions 
on Syria.[302] In early 2007, the Treasury Department, acting on a June 
2005 executive order, froze American bank accounts of Syria's Higher Institute 
of Applied Science and Technology, Electronics Institute, and National 
Standards and Calibration Laboratory. Bush's order prohibits Americans 
from doing business with these institutions suspected of helping spread 
weapons of mass destruction[303] and being supportive of terrorism.[304] 
Under separate executive orders signed by Bush in 2004 and later 2007, 
the Treasury Department froze the assets of two Lebanese and two Syrians, 
accusing them of activities to "undermine the legitimate political process 
in Lebanon" in November 2007. Those designated included: Assaad Halim Hardan, 
a member of Lebanon's parliament and current leader of the Syrian Socialist 
National Party; Wi'am Wahhab, a former member of Lebanon's government (Minister 
of the Environment) under Prime Minister Omar Karami (2004–2005); Hafiz 
Makhluf, a colonel and senior official in the Syrian General Intelligence 
Directorate and a cousin of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad; and Muhammad 
Nasif Khayrbik, identified as a close adviser to Assad.[305] Bush initiated 
the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief Program (PEPFAR). The U.S. 
government has spent some $44 billion on the project since 2003 (a figure 
that includes $7 billion contributed to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, 
Tuberculosis, and Malaria, a multilateral organization),[306] saving an 
estimated 5 million lives.[307] According to The New York Times correspondent 
Peter Baker, "Bush did more to stop AIDS and more to help Africa than any 
president before or since."[307] On May 10, 2005, Vladimir Arutyunian, 
a native Georgian who was born to a family of ethnic Armenians, threw a 
live hand grenade toward a podium where Bush was speaking at Freedom Square 
in Tbilisi, Georgia. Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili was seated 
nearby. It landed in the crowd about 65 feet (20 m) from the podium after 
hitting a girl, but it did not detonate. Arutyunian was arrested in July 
2005, confessed, was convicted and was given a life sentence in January 
2006.[308] Bush withdrew U.S. support for several international agreements, 
including the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty (ABM) with Russia. He also 
signed the Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty with Russia. Bush emphasized 
a careful approach to the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians; 
he denounced Palestine Liberation Organization leader Yasser Arafat for 
his support of violence, but sponsored dialogues between Prime Minister 
Ariel Sharon and Palestinian National Authority President Mahmoud Abbas. 
Bush supported Sharon's unilateral disengagement plan, and lauded the democratic 
elections held in Palestine after Arafat's death. Bush also expressed U.S. 
support for the defense of Taiwan following the stand-off in April 2001 
with the People's Republic of China over the Hainan Island incident, when 
an EP-3E Aries II surveillance aircraft collided with a People's Liberation 
Army Air Force jet, leading to the detention of U.S. personnel. From 2003 
to 2004, Bush authorized U.S. military intervention in Haiti and Liberia 
to protect U.S. interests. Bush condemned the militia attacks Darfur and 
denounced the killings in Sudan as genocide.[309] Bush said that an international 
peacekeeping presence was critical in Darfur, but opposed referring the 
situation to the International Criminal Court. In the State of the Union 
address in January 2003, Bush outlined a five-year strategy for global 
emergency AIDS relief, the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. 
Bush announced $15 billion for this effort[310] which directly supported 
life-saving antiretroviral treatment for more than 3.2 million men, women 
and children worldwide.[311] On June 10, 2007, Bush met with Albanian Prime 
Minister Sali Berisha and became the first president to visit Albania.[312] 
Bush has voiced his support for the independence of Kosovo.[313] Bush opposed 
South Ossetia's independence.[314] On August 15, 2008, Bush said of Russia's 
invasion of the country of Georgia: "Bullying and intimidation are not 
acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century."[315] Bush 
opened the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, Utha. Departing from 
previous practice, he stood among a group of U.S. athletes rather than 
from a ceremonial stand or box, saying: "On behalf of a proud, determined, 
and grateful nation, I declare open the Games of Salt Lake City, celebrating 
the Olympic Winter Games."[316] In 2008, in the course of a good-will trip 
to Asia, he attended the Summer Olympics in Beijing.[317] Bush twice invoked 
Section 3 of the Twenty-fifth Amendment, which allows a President to temporarily 
transfer the powers and duties of his office to the Vice President who 
then becomes Acting President. On June 29, 2002, Bush underwent a colonoscopy 
and chose to invoke Section 3 of the amendment, making Vice President Dick 
Cheney the Acting President. The medical procedure began at 7:09 am. EDT 
and ended at 7:29 am. EDT. Bush woke up twenty minutes later, but did not 
resume his presidential powers and duties until 9:24 am. EDT after the 
president's doctor, Richard Tubb, conducted an overall examination. Tubb 
said he recommended the additional time to make sure the sedative had no 
after effects. On July 21, 2007, Bush again invoked Section 3 in response 
to having to undergo a colonoscopy, again making Vice President Cheney 
the Acting President. Bush invoked Section 3 at 7:16 am. EDT. He reclaimed 
his powers at 9:21 am. EDT. In both cases, Bush specifically cited Section 
3 when he transferred the Presidential powers to the Vice President and 
when he reclaimed those powers.[318] Following the announcement of Supreme 
Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's retirement on July 1, 2005, Bush nominated 
John Roberts to succeed her. On September 5, following the death of Chief 
Justice William Rehnquist, this nomination was withdrawn and Bush instead 
nominated Roberts for Chief Justice to succeed Rehnquist. Roberts was confirmed 
by the Senate as the 17th Chief Justice on September 29, 2005. On October 
3, 2005, Bush nominated long time White House Counsel Harriet Miers for 
O'Connor's position. After facing significant opposition from both parties, 
who found her to be ill-prepared and uninformed on the law,[319] Miers 
asked that her name be withdrawn on October 27. Four days later, on October 
31, Bush nominated federal appellate judge Samuel Alito. Alito was confirmed 
as the 110th Supreme Court Justice on January 31, 2006.[320] In addition 
to his two Supreme Court appointments, Bush appointed 61 judges to the 
United States courts of appeals and 261 judges to the United States district 
courts. Each of these numbers, along with his total of 324 judicial appointments, 
is third in American history, behind both Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton. 
Bush experienced a number of judicial appointment controversies. Debate 
during one confirmation session lasted "39 stupefying hours" according 
to The New York Times. On August 3, 2001, the Senate did not consent to 
keep existing nominations in status quo, returning 40 judicial nominations, 
and 164 total nominations.[321][322][323] At the outset, Judicature magazine 
noted that the "Senate Democrats were gearing up for the approaching confirmation 
hearings" before the first set of nominees were sent to the Senate. It 
then cites The New York Times as saying "Senate Democrats have pledged 
they will not automatically vote to confirm Mr. Bush's judicial nominees 
and will subject them to intense scrutiny."[324] The Senate confirmed only 
8 out of 60 judicial nominations by October 2001. In February 2003, the 
Democrats successfully filibustered the nomination of Miguel Estrada.[325] 
Bush's upbringing in West Texas, his accent, his vacations on his Texas 
ranch, and his penchant for country metaphors contribute to his folksy, 
American cowboy image.[326][327] "I think people look at him and think 
John Wayne," said Piers Morgan, editor of the British Daily Mirror.[328] 
It has been suggested that Bush's accent was an active choice, as a way 
of distinguishing himself from Northeastern intellectuals and anchoring 
himself to his Texas roots.[329] Both supporters and detractors have pointed 
to his country persona as reasons for their support or criticism.[327] 
Bush has been parodied by the media,[330] comedians, and other politicians.[331][332] 
Detractors tended to cite linguistic errors made by Bush during his public 
speeches, which are colloquially referred to as Bushisms.[333] Some pundits 
labeled Bush "the worst president ever".[334][335][336][337][338] In contrast 
to his father, who was perceived as having troubles with an overarching 
unifying theme, Bush embraced larger visions and was seen as a man of larger 
ideas and associated huge risks.[339] Tony Blair wrote in 2010 that the 
caricature of Bush as being dumb is "ludicrous" and that Bush is "very 
smart".[340] In an interview with Playboy, New York Times columnist David 
Brooks said George W. Bush "was 60 IQ points smarter in private than he 
was in public. He doesn't want anybody to think he's smarter than they 
are, so puts on a Texas act."[341] Bush began his presidency with approval 
ratings near 50 percent.[342] After the September 11 attacks, Bush gained 
an approval rating of 90 percent,[343] maintaining 80 to 90 percent approval 
for four months after the attacks. It remained over 50 percent during most 
of his first term[15] and then fell to as low as 19 percent in his second 
term.[344] In 2000 and again in 2004, Time magazine named George W. Bush 
as its Person of the Year, a title awarded to someone who the editors believe 
"has done the most to influence the events of the year".[345] In May 2004, 
Gallup reported that 89 percent of the Republican electorate approved of 
Bush.[346] However, the support waned due mostly to a minority of Republicans' 
frustration with him on issues of spending, illegal immigration, and Middle 
Eastern affairs.[347] Within the United States armed forces, according 
to an unscientific survey, the president was strongly supported in the 
2004 presidential elections.[348] While 73 percent of military personnel 
said that they would vote for Bush, 18 percent preferred his Democratic 
rival, John Kerry.[348] According to Peter Feaver, a Duke University political 
scientist who has studied the political leanings of the U.S. military, 
members of the armed services supported Bush because they found him more 
likely than Kerry to complete the War in Iraq.[348] Bush's approval rating 
went below the 50 percent mark in AP-Ipsos polling in December 2004.[349] 
Thereafter, his approval ratings and approval of his handling of domestic 
and foreign policy issues steadily dropped. Bush received heavy criticism 
for his handling of the Iraq War, his response to Hurricane Katrina and 
to the Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse, NSA warrantless surveillance, the Plame 
affair, and Guantanamo Bay detention camp controversies.[350] There were 
calls for Bush's impeachment, though most polls showed a plurality of Americans 
would not support such an action.[351] The arguments offered for impeachment 
usually centered on the NSA warrantless surveillance controversy,[352] 
the Bush administration's justification for the war in Iraq,[353] and alleged 
violations of the Geneva Conventions.[354] Representative Dennis Kucinich 
(D-OH), who had run against Bush during the 2004 presidential campaign, 
introduced 35 articles of impeachment on the floor of the House of Representatives 
against Bush on June 9, 2008, but Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) declared 
that impeachment was "off the table".[355] Polls conducted in 2006 showed 
an average of 37 percent approval ratings for Bush,[356] the lowest for 
any second-term president at that point of his term since Harry S. Truman 
in March 1951 (when Truman's approval rating was 28 percent),[349][357] 
which contributed to what Bush called the "thumping" of the Republican 
Party in the 2006 mid-term elections.[358] Throughout most of 2007, Bush's 
approval rating hovered in the mid-thirties;[359] the average for his entire 
second term was 37 percent, according to Gallup.[360] By the beginning 
of 2008, his final year in office, Bush's approval rating had dropped to 
a low of just 19 percent, largely from the loss of support among Republicans.[344] 
Commenting on his low poll numbers and accusations of being "the worst 
president,"[361][362] Bush would say, "I make decisions on what I think 
is right for the United States based upon principles. I frankly don't give 
a damn about the polls."[363] In the spring of that year, Bush's disapproval 
ratings reached the highest ever recorded for any president in the 70-year 
history of the Gallup poll, with 69 percent of those polled in April 2008 
disapproving of the job Bush was doing as president and 28 percent approving—although 
the majority (66 percent) of Republicans still approved of his job performance.[364] 
In polls conducted in the fall, just before the 2008 election, his approval 
ratings remained at record lows of 19 to 20 percent,[365][366] while his 
disapproval ratings ranged from 67 percent to as high as 75 percent.[366][367] 
In polling conducted January 9–11, 2009, his final job approval rating 
by Gallup was 34 percent, which placed him on par with Jimmy Carter and 
Harry S. Truman, the other presidents whose final Gallup ratings measured 
in the low 30s (Richard Nixon's final Gallup approval rating was even lower, 
at 24 percent).[368] According to a CBS News/New York Times poll conducted 
January 11–15, 2009, Bush's final approval rating in office was 22 percent, 
the lowest in American history.[365] Bush was criticized internationally 
and targeted by the global anti-war and anti-globalization campaigns for 
his administration's foreign policy.[369][370] Views of him within the 
international community—even in France, a close ally of the United States—were 
more negative than those of most previous American presidents in history.[371] 
Bush was described as having especially close personal relationships with 
Tony Blair of Great Britain and Vicente Fox of Mexico, although formal 
relations were sometimes strained.[372][373][374] Other leaders, such as 
Afghan president Hamid Karzai,[375] Ugandan president Yoweri Museveni,[376] 
Spanish prime minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero,[377] and Venezuelan 
president Hugo Chávez,[378] openly criticized the president. Later in Bush's 
presidency, tensions arose between him and Vladimir Putin, which led to 
a cooling of their relationship.[379] In 2006, most respondents in 18 of 
21 countries surveyed around the world were found to hold an unfavorable 
opinion of Bush. Respondents indicated that they judged his administration 
as negative for world security.[380][381] In 2007, the Pew Global Attitudes 
Project reported that during the Bush presidency, attitudes towards the 
United States, and towards Americans, became less favorable around the 
world.[382] A March 2007 survey of Arab opinion conducted by Zogby International 
and the University of Maryland found that Bush was the most disliked leader 
in the Arab world.[383] The Pew Research Center's 2007 Global Attitudes 
poll found that out of 47 countries, in only nine countries did most respondents 
express "a lot of confidence" or "some confidence" in Bush: Ethiopia, Ghana, 
India, Israel, Ivory Coast, Kenya, Mali, Nigeria, and Uganda.[384] During 
a June 2007 visit to the predominantly Muslim[385] Albania, Bush was greeted 
enthusiastically. Albania has a population of 2.8 million,[386] has troops 
in both Iraq and Afghanistan, and the country's government is highly supportive 
of American foreign policy.[387] A huge image of the President was hung 
in the middle of the capital city of Tirana flanked by Albanian and American 
flags while a local street was named after him.[388][389] A shirt-sleeved 
statue of Bush was unveiled in Fushë-Krujë, a few kilometers northwest 
of Tirana.[390] The Bush administration's support for the independence 
of Albanian-majority Kosovo, while endearing him to the Albanians, has 
troubled U.S. relations with Serbia, leading to the February 2008 torching 
of the U.S. embassy in Belgrade.[391] On May 7, 2005, during an official 
state visit to Latvia, Bush was awarded the Order of the Three Stars presented 
to him by President Vaira Vīķe-Freiberga.[392] A few places outside the 
United States bear Bush's name. In 2005, the Tbilisi City Council voted 
to rename a street in honor of the U.S. president.[393] Previously known 
as Melaani Drive, the street links the Georgian capital's airport with 
the city center and was used by Bush's motorcade during his visit four 
months earlier.[394] A street in Tirana, formerly known as Rruga Puntorët 
e Rilendjes, situated directly outside the Albanian Parliament, was renamed 
after Bush a few days before he made the first-ever visit by an American 
president to Albania in June 2007.[395] In Jerusalem, a small plaza with 
a monument bearing his name is also dedicated to Bush.[396] In 2012, Estonian 
President Toomas Hendrik Ilves awarded Bush the Order of the Cross of Terra 
Mariana for his work in expanding NATO.[397] The Bush presidency has been 
ranked among the worst in surveys of presidential scholars published in 
the late 2000s and 2010s.[17][18][19] After his re-election in 2004, Bush 
received increasingly heated criticism from across the political spectrum[9][10][11] 
for his handling of the Iraq War, Hurricane Katrina,[12][13][14] and other 
challenges. Amid this criticism, the Democratic Party regained control 
of Congress in the 2006 elections. In December 2007, the United States 
entered its longest post-World War II recession, often referred to as the 
"Great Recession", prompting the Bush administration to obtain congressional 
passage of multiple economic programs intended to preserve the country's 
financial system. Nationally, Bush was both one of the most popular and 
unpopular presidents in history, having received the highest recorded presidential 
approval ratings in the wake of the September 11 attacks, as well as one 
of the lowest approval ratings during the 2008 financial crisis.[15] For 
his part, Bush said in 2013, "Ultimately history will judge the decisions 
I made, and I won't be around because it will take time for the objective 
historians to show up. So I am pretty comfortable with it. I did what I 
did."[398] Following the inauguration of Barack Obama, Bush and his family 
flew from Andrews Air Force Base to a homecoming celebration in Midland, 
Texas, following which they returned to their ranch in Crawford, Texas.[399] 
They bought a home in the Preston Hollow neighborhood of Dallas, Texas, 
where they settled down.[400] He makes regular appearances at various events 
throughout the Dallas/Fort Worth area, most notably when he conducted the 
opening coin toss at the Dallas Cowboys first game in the team's new stadium 
in Arlington[401] and an April 2009 visit to a Texas Rangers game, where 
he thanked the people of Dallas for helping him settle in and was met with 
a standing ovation.[402] He also attended every home playoff game for the 
Texas Rangers 2010 season and, accompanied by his father, threw out the 
ceremonial first pitch at Rangers Ballpark in Arlington for Game 4 of the 
2010 World Series on October 31, 2010.[403] On August 6, 2013, Bush was 
successfully treated for a coronary artery blockage with a stent. The blockage 
had been found during an annual medical examination.[404] In reaction to 
the 2016 shooting of Dallas police officers, Bush stated: "Laura and I 
are heartbroken by the heinous acts of violence in our city last night. 
Murdering the innocent is always evil, never more so than when the lives 
taken belong to those who protect our families and communities."[405] Since 
leaving office, Bush has kept a relatively low profile[406] though he has 
made public appearances, most notably after the release of his memoirs 
in 2010 and for the 10th anniversary of the September 11 attacks in 2011. 
In March 2009, he delivered his first post-presidency speech in Calgary, 
Alberta,[407][408] appeared via video on The Colbert Report during which 
he praised U.S. troops for earning a "special place in American history,"[409] 
and attended the funeral of Senator Ted Kennedy.[410] Bush made his debut 
as a motivational speaker on October 26 at the "Get Motivated" seminar 
in Dallas.[411] In the aftermath of the Fort Hood shooting that took place 
on November 5, 2009, in Texas, the Bushes paid an undisclosed visit to 
the survivors and victims' families the day following the shooting, having 
contacted the base commander requesting that the visit be private and not 
involve press coverage.[412] Bush released his memoirs, Decision Points, 
on November 9, 2010. During a pre-release appearance promoting the book, 
Bush said he considered his biggest accomplishment to be keeping "the country 
safe amid a real danger", and his greatest failure to be his inability 
to secure the passage of Social Security reform.[413] He also made news 
defending his administration's enhanced interrogation techniques, specifically 
the waterboarding of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, saying, "I'd do it again to 
save lives."[414] In 2012, he wrote the foreword of The 4% Solution: Unleashing 
the Economic Growth America Needs, an economics book published by the George 
W. Bush Presidential Center.[415][416][417] He also presented the book 
at the Parkland Memorial Hospital in Dallas, Texas.[418] Bush appeared 
on NBC's The Tonight Show with Jay Leno on November 19, 2013, along with 
the former First Lady, Laura Bush. When asked by Leno why he does not comment 
publicly about the Obama administration, Bush said, "I don't think it's 
good for the country to have a former president criticize his successor."[419] 
Despite this statement, on Saturday, April 25, 2015, Bush criticized President 
Barack Obama at a meeting of the Republican Jewish Coalition at the Venetian 
Hotel in Las Vegas. Bush criticized Obama's handling of Iran, specifically 
with respect to sanctions and a nuclear deal, saying: "You think the Middle 
East is chaotic now? Imagine what it looks like for our grandchildren. 
That's how Americans should view the deal." Bush also attacked Obama's 
withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq in 2011, calling it a "strategic blunder", 
borrowing a term that had been used by South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham.[420] 
Alongside the 2014 United States–Africa Leaders Summit, Bush, Michelle 
Obama, the State Department, and the George W. Bush Institute hosted a 
daylong forum on education and health with the spouses of the African leaders 
attending the summit. Bush urged African leaders to avoid discriminatory 
laws that make the treatment of HIV/AIDS more difficult.[421] Bush has 
spoken in favor of increased global participation of women in politics 
and societal matters in foreign countries.[422][423] On November 2, 2014, 
Bush spoke at an event to 200 business and civic leaders at the George 
W. Bush Presidential Library and Museum to raise awareness for the upcoming 
Museum of the Bible in Washington D.C.[49][424] Bush published a biography 
of his father, George Bush, called 41: A Portrait of My Father. It was 
released on November 11, 2014.[425] In an interview published by Israel 
Hayom magazine on June 12, 2015, Bush said that "boots on the ground" would 
be needed in order to defeat the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIS). 
He added that people had said during his Presidency that he should withdraw 
American troops from Iraq, but he chose the opposite, sending 30,000 more 
troops in order to defeat Al Qaeda in Iraq, and that Al Qaeda in Iraq was 
defeated. Bush was also asked about Iran but declined to answer, stating 
that any answer he gives would be interpreted as undermining President 
Barack Obama.[426] In February 2016, George W. Bush spoke and campaigned 
for his brother Jeb Bush in South Carolina during a rally for the Jeb Bush 
presidential campaign in the 2016 Republican Party presidential primaries.[427] 
While Bush endorsed the Republican Party's 2012 presidential nominee Mitt 
Romney, he declined to endorse the 2016 Republican nominee Donald Trump[428] 
and he didn't attend the 2016 Republican National Convention that formally 
nominated Trump.[429] On the eve of Trump's nomination, it was reported 
that Bush had privately expressed concern about the current direction of 
the Republican Party and told a group of his former aides and advisors, 
"I'm worried that I will be the last Republican president."[430][431] Bush 
and his wife Laura did not vote for Trump in the 2016 presidential election 
according to a spokesperson for the Bush family, instead choosing to leave 
their presidential ballots blank.[432] After the election, Bush, his father, 
and his brother Jeb called Trump on the phone to congratulate him on his 
victory.[433] In January 2010, at President Obama's request, Bush and Bill 
Clinton established the Clinton Bush Haiti Fund to raise contributions 
for relief and recovery efforts following the 2010 Haiti earthquake earlier 
that month.[434] On May 2, 2011, President Obama called Bush, who was at 
a restaurant with his wife, to inform him that Osama bin Laden had been 
killed.[435] The Bushes joined the Obamas in New York City to mark the 
tenth anniversary of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. At the 
Ground Zero memorial, Bush read a letter that President Abraham Lincoln 
wrote to a widow who lost five sons during the Civil War.[436] After serving 
as president, Bush began painting as a hobby. Subjects have included dogs 
and still life.[437] He has also painted self-portraits and portraits of 
world leaders, including Vladimir Putin and Tony Blair.[438][439][440] 
His paintings have been met with a middling reception from art critics. 
Bill Arning, director of the Contemporary Arts Museum Houston, called his 
portraits "thickly painted in what I would call 'high-amateur' mode" and 
wrote, "I would say they need to be less based on photographic reproduction. 
You can tell when someone is taking a found photograph and making a painting 
out of it [...] I think he'd be well advised to work from other, multiple 
photographic sources or the real person to get a little bit more liveliness 
going on."[441] George W. Bush's legacy remains a contested one. Supporters 
credit Bush's counterterrorism policies with preventing another major terrorist 
attack from occurring in the US after 9/11 and also praise individual policies 
such as the Medicare prescription drug benefit and the AIDS relief program 
known as PEPFAR. Critics often point to his handling of the Iraq War, specifically 
the failure to find weapons of mass destruction, that were the main rationale 
behind the initial invasion—as well as his handling of tax policy, Hurricane 
Katrina and the 2008 financial crisis as proof that George W. Bush was 
unfit to be president.[442][443] Several historians and commentators hold 
the view that Bush was one of the most consequential presidents in American 
history. Princeton University scholar Julian Zelizer described Bush's presidency 
as a "transformative" one, and said that "some people hate him, some people 
love him, but I do think he'll have a much more substantive perception 
as time goes on".[444] Bryon Williams of The Huffington Post referred to 
Bush as "the most noteworthy president since FDR" and said that the Patriot 
Act "increased authority of the executive branch at the expense of judicial 
opinions about when searches and seizures are reasonable" as evidence.[445] 
Bush's administration presided over the largest tax cuts since the Reagan 
administration,[446] and his homeland security reforms proved to be the 
most significant expansion of the federal government since the Great Society.[447] 
Much of these policies have endured in the administration of Bush's Democratic 
successor, Barack Obama.[448][449] A 2010 Siena Research Institute survey 
of the opinions of historians, political scientists, and presidential scholars 
ranked him 39th out of 43 presidents. The survey respondents gave President 
Bush low ratings on his handling of the U.S. economy, communication, ability 
to compromise, foreign policy accomplishments, and intelligence.[450] Among 
the public, his reputation has improved somewhat since his presidency ended 
in 2009. In February 2012, Gallup reported that "Americans still rate George 
W. Bush among the worst presidents, though their views have become more 
positive in the three years since he left office."[451] Gallup had earlier 
noted that Bush's favorability ratings in public opinion surveys had begun 
to rise a year after he had left office, from 40 percent in January 2009 
and 35 percent in March 2009, to 45 percent in July 2010, a period during 
which he had remained largely out of the news.[452] Other pollsters have 
noted similar trends of slight improvement in Bush's personal favorability 
since the end of his presidency.[453] In April 2013, Bush's approval rating 
stood at 47 percent approval and 50 percent disapproval in a poll jointly 
conducted for The Washington Post and ABC, his highest approval rating 
since December 2005. Bush had achieved notable gains among seniors, non-college 
whites, and moderate and conservative Democrats since leaving office, although 
majorities disapproved of his handling of the economy (53 percent) and 
the Iraq War (57 percent).[454] His 47 percent approval rating was equal 
to that of President Obama's in the same polling period.[455] A CNN poll 
conducted that same month found that 55 percent of Americans said Bush's 
presidency had been a failure, with opinions divided along party lines, 
and 43 percent of independents calling it a success.[456] Academic Reflections
