The 1907 New York Highlanders season, its fifth in New York and its seventh 
overall, finished with the team in 5th place in the American League with 
a record of 70â€“78. Another notable newcomer was New York's recently acquired 
left fielder Branch Rickey, who would become well known for integrating 
Jackie Robinson into the major leagues some four decades later. [1] [2]
