Bill Veeck attempted to purchase the Phillies in late 1943. Veeck’s plan 
was to sign players from the Negro leagues to make the Phillies competitive.[1] 
The organization held a fan contest prior to the 1944 season to solicit 
a second nickname for the Phillies. Fans voted on Blue Jays and Elizabeth 
Crooks designed a logo of a blue jay perched on the Phillies word mark.[2] 
The Phillies got off to a 12–6 start, and on May 13 were 1.5 games out 
of first place. However, it was all downhill from there, as they finished 
with yet another losing season. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] Infielders
