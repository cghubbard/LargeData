John Gladstone Graney (June 10, 1886 – April 20, 1978) was a Canadian left 
fielder in Major League Baseball who played his entire career with the 
Cleveland Indians. Following his playing days, Graney became a baseball 
radio broadcaster, providing play-by-play, for the Indians in 1932–53. 
Graney was inducted into the Cleveland Indians Distinguished Hall of Fame 
for non-uniformed personnel on August 11, 2012, prior to a game at Progressive 
Field. On June 26, 1916, the Cleveland Indians used numbers on their uniforms 
on an experimental basis in a home game against the White Sox. The numbers, 
which were worn on the players' uniform sleeves, corresponded with information 
in the scorecards. Jack Graney was the first player in Major League Baseball 
history to appear in a regular season game with a number on his uniform 
and, two seasons before, was the first batter to face Babe Ruth in a Major 
League Baseball game on Saturday, July 11, 1914. After retiring from playing, 
Graney became a play-by-play broadcaster for the team, thus being the first 
former Major League Baseball player to become a radio broadcaster in the 
United States. He died at age 91 in Louisiana, Missouri on Thursday, April 
20, 1978.[1] He was inducted into the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame in 
1984, its second year of operation. In 1987 the Canadian Baseball Hall 
of Fame instituted an award in the name of Jack Graney, presented periodically 
to journalists deemed to have made notable contributions to promoting baseball
