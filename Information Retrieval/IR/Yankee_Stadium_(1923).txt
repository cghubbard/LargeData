Yankee Stadium was a stadium located in the Bronx, a borough of New York 
City. It was the home ballpark of the New York Yankees, one of the city's 
Major League Baseball (MLB) franchises, from 1923 to 1973 and from 1976 
to 2008. The stadium hosted 6,581 Yankees regular season home games during 
its 85-year history. It was also the former home of the New York Giants 
football team from 1956 through the first part of the 1973–74 football 
season. The stadium's nickname, "The House That Ruth Built",[2] is derived 
from Babe Ruth, the legendary baseball superstar whose prime years coincided 
with the stadium's opening and the beginning of the Yankees' winning history. 
It has also been known as "The Big Ballpark in The Bronx", "The Stadium", 
and "The Cathedral of Baseball". The stadium was built from 1922 to 1923 
for $2.4 million ($32 million in 2014 dollars). The stadium's construction 
was paid for entirely by Yankees owner Jacob Ruppert, who was eager to 
have his own stadium after sharing the Polo Grounds with the New York Giants 
baseball team the previous 10 years. Yankee Stadium opened for the 1923 
MLB season and at the time, it was hailed as a one-of-a-kind facility in 
the country for its size. Over the course of its history, it became one 
of the most famous venues in the United States, having hosted a variety 
of events and historic moments during its existence. While many of these 
moments were baseball-related—including World Series games, no-hitters, 
perfect games and historic home runs—the stadium also hosted boxing matches, 
concerts, Jehovah's Witnesses conventions (see record attendance) and three 
Papal Masses. The stadium went through many alterations and playing surface 
configurations over the years. The condition of the facility worsened in 
the 1960s and 1970s, prompting its closing for renovation from 1974 to 
1975. The renovation significantly altered the appearance of the venue 
and reduced the distance of the outfield fences. In 2006, the Yankees began 
building a new $2.3 billion stadium in public parkland adjacent to the 
stadium. The price included $1.2 billion in public subsidies.[3] The design 
includes a replica of the frieze along the roof that was in Yankee Stadium. 
Monument Park, a Hall of Fame for prominent former Yankees, was relocated 
to the new stadium. Yankee Stadium closed following the 2008 baseball season 
and the new stadium opened in 2009, adopting the "Yankee Stadium" moniker. 
The original Yankee Stadium was demolished in 2010, two years after it 
closed, and the 8-acre site was converted into a park called Heritage Field.[4] 
The Yankees had played at the Polo Grounds in upper Manhattan since 1913, 
sharing the venue with the New York Giants. However, relations between 
the two teams were rocky, with the Giants harboring resentment towards 
the Yankees. For the 1920 season, the Yankees acquired star slugger Babe 
Ruth and in his first year with his new team, the Yankees drew 1.3 million 
fans to the Polo Grounds, outdrawing the Giants. By the middle of 1920, 
the Giants had issued an eviction notice to the Yankees, which was soon 
rescinded.[5] In 1921, the Yankees won their first American League pennant 
(but lost the then-best-of-nine 1921 World Series to the Giants in eight 
games, all played at the Polo Grounds). This exacerbated Giants owner Charles 
Stoneham's resentment of the Yankees and reinforced his insistence that 
the Yankees find another place to play their home games. The Giants derisively 
suggested that the Yankees relocate "to Queens or some other out-of-the-way 
place".[6] Tillinghast L'Hommedieu Huston and Jacob Ruppert, the Yankees' 
owners since January 1915, decided to build their own stadium. They did 
so at considerable financial risk and speculation. Baseball teams typically 
played in 30,000-seat facilities, but Huston and Ruppert invoked Ruth's 
name when asked how the Yankees could justify a ballpark with 60,000 seats. 
The doubt over the Yankees' lasting power was amplified by baseball's sagging 
popularity after the 1919 Black Sox Scandal, in which eight Chicago White 
Sox players were expelled for conspiring with gamblers to fix that year's 
World Series. Many people also felt three baseball teams could not prosper 
in New York City, but Huston and Ruppert were confident the Yankees could 
thrive amongst the more established New York Giants and Brooklyn Dodgers 
of the National League (which proved more than true, as both would eventually 
relocate to California following the 1957 season). The total bill for construction 
of the stadium was $2.5 million. Huston and Ruppert explored many areas 
for Yankee Stadium. Of the other sites being considered, the Hebrew Orphan 
Asylum, at Amsterdam Avenue between 136th and 138th streets in Manhattan, 
nearly became reality. Consideration was also given to building atop railroad 
tracks on the West Side of Manhattan (an idea revived in 1998) and to Long 
Island City, in Queens. The area Huston and Ruppert settled on was a 10 
acres (4.0 ha) lumberyard in the Bronx within walking distance from and 
in sight of, Coogan's Bluff. The Polo Grounds was located on the Manhattan 
side of the Harlem River, at 155th Street and Eighth Avenue. Huston and 
Ruppert purchased the lumberyard from William Waldorf Astor for $600,000, 
equal to $8.5 million today. Construction began May 5, 1922 and Yankee 
Stadium opened to the public less than a year later. The stadium's walls 
were built of "an extremely hard and durable concrete that was developed 
by Thomas Edison",[7] with total of 20,000 cubic yards (15,000 cubic meters) 
of concrete used in the original structure.[8] Yankee Stadium officially 
opened on Wednesday, April 18, 1923, with the Yankees' first home game, 
against the Boston Red Sox. According to the New York Evening Telegram, 
"everything smelled of ... fresh paint, fresh plaster and fresh grass". 
At 3 pm, the composer-conductor John Philip Sousa led the Seventh ("Silk-Stocking") 
Regiment Band in playing The Star-Spangled Banner. After a parade of the 
players and dignitaries, Babe Ruth was presented with a case containing 
a symbolically big bat. New York Governor Al Smith threw out the first 
pitch directly into the glove of catcher Wally Schang rather than the customary 
couple of feet wide. The Yankees went on to defeat Ruth's former team, 
the Boston Red Sox, by a score of 4–1, with Ruth hitting a three-run home 
run into the right-field stands. Asked later for his opinion of the stadium, 
he replied, "Some ball yard."[9] Upon opening, Fred Lieb of the New York 
Evening Telegram dubbed it "The House That Ruth Built".[6][10] The Yankees 
also won their first World Series during the Stadium's inaugural season. 
Future Yankee manager Casey Stengel hit the first post-season home run 
in stadium history while playing with the opposing New York Giants.[11][12] 
The only other team to do so prior to the 2006 St. Louis Cardinals in (the 
new) Busch Stadium had been the Pittsburgh Pirates, who won the 1909 World 
Series in Forbes Field's inaugural season; and the Boston Red Sox, who 
won the 1912 World Series in Fenway Park's first year. The Yankees accomplished 
this feat yet again in the New Yankee Stadium in the 2009 World Series. 
The Stadium was the first facility in North America with three tiers, although 
the triple deck originally extended only to the left and right field corners. 
The concrete lower deck extended well into left field, with the obvious 
intention of extending the upper deck over it, which was accomplished during 
the 1926–27 off-season. As originally built, the stadium seated 58,000. 
For the stadium's first game, the announced attendance was 74,217 (with 
another 25,000 turned away); however, Yankees business manager Ed Barrow 
later admitted that the actual attendance was closer to 60,000. Regardless 
of what the figure was, it was undoubtedly more than the 42,000 fans who 
attended game five of the 1916 World Series at Braves Field, baseball's 
previous attendance record. However, during the 1920s and 1930s, the Yankees' 
popularity was such that crowds in excess of 80,000 were not uncommon. 
It was referred to as "the Yankee Stadium" (with the "s" in "stadium" sometimes 
lowercase) until the 1950s. Yankee Stadium underwent more extensive renovations 
from 1936 through 1938. The wooden bleachers were replaced with concrete, 
shrinking the "death valley" area of left and center substantially, although 
the area was still much deeper than in most ballparks; and the second and 
third decks were extended to short right center. Runways were left between 
the bleachers and the triple-deck on each end, serving as bullpens. By 
1938, the Stadium had assumed the "classic" shape that it would retain 
for the next 35 years. In April 1945, Yankees president Larry MacPhail 
announced that after the War, the Yankees would install an additional tier 
of bleachers to increase stadium capacity to 100,000. In addition to the 
bleachers, he also planned to add 2,000 additional box-seats by lowering 
the field and shortening the distance from the backstop to home-plate from 
82 to 60 feet (25 to 18 m).[13] However, the plans fell through and the 
expansion did not take place. Many sources incorrectly state that prior 
to the 1955 season, Yankee Stadium's Ballantine Beer scoreboard was sold 
to the Phillies for use in Shibe Park. Although the two scoreboards possessed 
some superficial resemblances, they differed in many details and the Yankee 
Stadium scoreboard remained at Yankee Stadium until 1959 when it was replaced, 
two years after a different Ballantine scoreboard was installed at Shibe 
(by then renamed Connie Mack Stadium).[14] The stadium was owned by the 
Yankees until December 17, 1953 when the ballclub's co-owners Dan Topping 
and Del Webb sold it and Blues Stadium for $6.5 million ($57,676,180 in 
2016 dollars) to Arnold Johnson, who also dealt the land under the ballpark 
to the Knights of Columbus for $2 million ($17,746,517 in 2016 dollars).[15] 
After he purchased the Philadelphia Athletics and transferred the franchise 
to Kansas City on November 8, 1954, Johnson sold Yankee Stadium to John 
W. Cox on March 22, 1955.[16] Cox, a 1927 graduate of Rice University, 
donated the ballpark to his alma mater on July 19, 1962.[17] In the 1966–67 
offseason, during the period in which Rice owned the stadium, the concrete 
exterior was painted white, and the interior was painted blue.[18] The 
metal frieze circling the upper deck was painted white. In 1970, newly 
reelected Mayor John Lindsay approached team president Michael Burke of 
CBS, which owned the Yankees, with an offer to spend $25 million on improvements 
to Yankee Stadium. (Six years earlier, the Mets' new home, Shea Stadium, 
had opened in Queens at a similar public cost.) By this time, it was obvious 
that the stadium had significant structural issues; concrete chunks were 
seen falling from the stands. Burke floated two proposals to build a new 
stadium on the same site in the Bronx; one included a dome. CBS also asked 
for 10,000 additional parking spaces and road improvements to alleviate 
traffic. In August 1971, the New York Giants football team announced that 
it would leave Yankee Stadium for a new football-only stadium in the Meadowlands 
Sports Complex under development in New Jersey. In 1971, the city of New 
York forced (via eminent domain) Rice to sell the stadium for a mere $2.5 million 
(equivalent to $14.6 million today). That December, after significant lobbying 
by Lindsay, the Board of Estimate approved $24 million ($140 million in 
2014 dollars) for the city to renovate Yankee Stadium. The figure included 
$3.5 million for the purchase of the stadium and the 8-acre piece of land 
from Rice University and the Knights of Columbus.[19] At the time, New 
York City was on the brink of bankruptcy.[20] In January 1973, CBS sold 
the Yankees to a group led by George Steinbrenner for $10 million. Yankee 
Stadium closed for renovation on September 30, 1973. The Yankees would 
play all of their 1974 and 1975 home games at Shea Stadium. When the renovated 
stadium opened on April 15, 1976, the cost had ballooned to $160 million 
($672 million in 2014 dollars). The cost was originally borne by New York 
City and is now being paid off by New York State. The outside shell of 
the stadium remained the same, with its original limestone painted over. 
Among the more noticeable changes after the renovation was the removal 
of 118 columns reinforcing each tier of the stadium's grandstand. The stadium's 
roof, including its distinctive 15 feet (4.6 m) metal frieze, was replaced 
by the new upper shell and new lights were added. A white painted concrete 
replica of the frieze was added atop the wall encircling the bleachers. 
The playing field was lowered by about seven feet and moved outward slightly. 
Escalators and ramps were added in three sections to make the upper deck 
more accessible. The original wooden stadium seats were replaced with wider 
plastic ones and the upper deck expanded upward nine rows, excluding the 
walkway. A new upper concourse was built above the old and original concourse 
exits were closed in by new seating. A new middle tier was built featuring 
a larger press box and 16 luxury boxes. About one-third of the bleacher 
seats were eliminated, their middle section converted to a blacked-out 
batter's eye. A wall was built behind the bleachers blocking the views 
from Gerard Avenue and the elevated subway platform above River Avenue. 
On this wall, the Yankees erected the first instant replay display in baseball, 
referred to in literature as a "telescreen". All told, the Stadium was 
reduced to a listed capacity of 57,545. The Stadium's playing field was 
drastically altered. "Death Valley" was reduced by more than 40 feet (12 m) 
while the right-field home-run porch was moved out. Monuments once in play 
were moved to a newly created Monument Park. In 1985, the left field fence 
was moved in and the stadium assumed its final dimensions in 1988. Although 
it was essentially the same structure, the renovations were significant 
enough that some sources consider them two different stadiums. The ESPN 
Sports Almanac, for instance, calls the original stadium "Yankee Stadium 
I" and the renovated stadium "Yankee Stadium II". After years of speculation 
that the Yankees would build a new ballpark to replace Yankee Stadium, 
construction on a new facility began on August 16, 2006 with a groundbreaking 
ceremony across the street in Macombs Dam Park, the site of the new stadium. 
This all but sealed the fate of Yankee Stadium and the Yankees played their 
final two seasons in the stadium in 2007 and 2008 while the new venue was 
being built. After the final game in the Stadium's history was played on 
September 21, 2008, public tours of Yankee Stadium continued until November 
23, 2008. November 9, 2008 was the last day the public tours included Monument 
Park and the retired number area. On November 12, 2008 construction workers 
began removing memorials from Monument Park for relocation to the new facility.[21] 
On November 8, 2008 former Yankees Scott Brosius, Paul O'Neill, David Cone 
and Jeff Nelson, all members of the 1998 World Series championship team, 
joined 60 children from two Bronx based youth groups Youth Force 2020 and 
the ACE Mentor Program in ceremoniously digging up home plate, the pitcher's 
mound pitching plate (rubber) and the surrounding dirt of both areas and 
transporting them to comparable areas of new Yankee Stadium.[22] An official 
closing ceremony was reportedly discussed to occur in November 2008, but 
was scrapped when the organization decided the final event should be a 
baseball game.[23] Yankee officials said that while the team had contemplated 
a final ceremony (with any proceeds going to charity), talk of a concert 
was just media speculation.[24] The front office staff vacated the premises 
on January 23, 2009.[25] Demolition began in March 2009 with the removal 
of the playing field.[26] On May 13, 2009, the process of removing seats 
began and was completed on June 8.[27][28] On September 3 and 4, the iconic 
white facade was dismantled.[29][30] On November 4, 2009, construction 
workers began tearing down the outfield bleachers, marking the first major 
structural demolition of the old ballpark.[31] On November 12, demolition 
work began on the field level grandstand.[32] By the end of November, most 
of the grandstand and bleachers at field level were gone.[33] By the first 
week of December, demolition of the midlevel loge seats had begun.[34][35] 
By January 2010, the loge level was gone and demolition began on the left 
field escalator bank adjacent to Gate 2. In February 2010, demolition work 
began on the upper deck and the outfield wall; the final part of the outfield 
wall (the Continental Airlines ad, the out-of-town scoreboard and the remaining 
part of the advertising panel to its right) was taken down February 24, 
2010.[36] By March 25, the entire upper deck was taken down. Following 
an unsuccessful attempt to save Gate 2 (the only portion of the original 
Yankee Stadium that mostly remained unaltered after the venue's renovation), 
demolition of the outer walls of the stadium began on March 29. Demolition 
of the original Yankee Stadium was completed on May 13, 2010.[37][38] A 
10-acre (40,000 m2) park complex called Heritage Field was constructed 
on the old stadium site, accounting for 40% of the original parkland that 
is now occupied by the new Stadium.[4] The groundbreaking ceremony for 
Heritage Field took place on June 29, 2010.[39] Heritage Field was officially 
opened in April 2012.[40] At its opening, a blue outline showing the location 
of the original Yankee Stadium diamond was interwoven into the grass, showing 
that second base on the new field is in the approximate location of home 
plate of the original diamond.[41] Yankee Stadium was the first three-tiered 
sports facility in the United States and one of the first baseball parks 
to be given the lasting title of stadium. Baseball teams typically played 
in a park or a field. The word stadium deliberately evoked ancient Greece, 
where a stade was a unit of measure—the length of a footrace; the buildings 
that housed these footraces were called stadia. Yankee Stadium was one 
of the first to be deliberately designed as a multi-purpose facility. The 
field was initially surrounded by a (misshapen) 0.25 miles (0.40 km) running 
track, which effectively also served as a warning track for outfielders, 
a feature now standard on all major league fields. The left and right field 
bleacher sections were laid out roughly at a right angle and to the third 
base stands, to be properly positioned for both track-and-field events 
and football. The large electronic scoreboard in right-center field, featuring 
both teams' lineups and scores of other baseball games, was the first of 
its kind. As Yankee Stadium owed its creation largely to Ruth, its design 
partially accommodated the game's left-handed-hitting slugger. Initially 
the fence was 295 feet (90 m) from home plate down the right-field line, 
referred to as the "short porch" and 350 feet (110 m) to near right field, 
compared with 490 feet (150 m) to the deepest part of center field, nicknamed 
Death Valley. The right-field bleachers were appropriately nicknamed "Ruthville". 
Although the right field fences were eventually pushed back after the 1974–1975 
renovations, they were still relatively close to home plate and retained 
the "short porch" moniker. There is an urban legend that the stadium's 
field level was several feet below sea level, but that is easily disproven 
by observing how much higher the stadium site was (and is) than the level 
of the nearby Harlem River. In fact, the altitude of the old ballpark's 
site is 39 feet above sea level. Monument Park was an open-air museum that 
contained the Yankees' retired numbers, as well as a collection of monuments 
and plaques honoring distinguished members of the New York Yankees. It 
was located beyond the left-center field fences, near the bullpens. The 
origins of Monument Park can be traced to the original three monuments 
of Lou Gehrig, Miller Huggins and Babe Ruth that once used to stand in-play 
in center field. Over the years, the Yankees continued to honor players 
and personnel with additional monuments and plaques. After the 1974–1975 
renovations of Yankee Stadium, the monuments and plaques were moved behind 
the outfield fences to "Monument Park". A visual collection of retired 
numbers was soon added to this location. Monument Park remained there until 
the stadium's closing in 2008; after the new Yankee Stadium opened, the 
retired numbers, plaques, and monuments were moved into a new Monument 
Park in the new ballpark. One of the most distinguishing characteristics 
of Yankee Stadium was the facade, which consisted of a white frieze that 
ran along the bleacher billboards and scoreboard. The facade was an addition 
made by Osborn Engineering, when the owners of the Yankees asked that the 
stadium be given "an air of dignity". Yankee Stadium tour guide Tony Morante 
stated, "The owners of the New York Yankees at the time decided that they 
wanted to give it an air of dignity, so the Osborn Engineering Company 
had erected what was known originally as a frieze. Somewhere along the 
way it took on the term of facade, and most people know it today as the 
facade." It originally ran around the roof of the grandstand's upper deck. 
This original facade was made of copper and over the course of time, developed 
a patina (just like the Statue of Liberty). It was painted white in the 
mid-1960s. When the stadium was renovated in the 1970s, 10 rows were added 
to the top of upper deck, and the support columns were removed. The original 
roof had to be removed; the facade was removed and sold as scrap. A smaller, 
concrete version was erected above the scoreboards and billboards behind 
the bleachers. In the new stadium, the facade was replicated in its original 
position along the roof of the upper deck, although now constructed of 
steel painted white. It does not cantilever out over the upper deck as 
much as the original did. The iconic facade is employed in graphics for 
the YES Network and was incorporated into the logo for the 2008 All-Star 
Game held at the Stadium. The term "facade" is actually a misnomer. The 
scalloped arches are actually a frieze, and it was originally known as 
such. It is unknown when or where the term "facade" came into use, but 
it has become the more common name, used by fans, broadcasters and personnel. 
With the move to the new stadium, the organization has made a move to return 
to the term "frieze", exclusively using it in public statements and literature. 
In its existence, Yankee Stadium changed its dimensions several times. 
Many photographs taken throughout the stadium's history are used as references, 
as the Yankees were among the first to post distance markers on the outfield 
walls. The 415 sign, and its 367 counterpart in right field, were both 
covered by auxiliary scoreboards during the 1949 season. Those boards displayed 
the current game inning-by-inning along with runs-hits-errors. When the 
stadium reopened in 1976, the distance in straight-away center field was 
417 feet (127 m). The deepest part of the outfield was in left center at 
430 feet (130 m). The most recent field dimensions were reached primarily 
by moving the Yankee bullpen to left-center from right and making a few 
other changes so as to bring the left-center field wall in. The 1973-era 
left-center field wall locations could still be seen in 1976, as this is 
where the outfield bleacher seats began. The following is a partial list 
of the stadium's dimensions throughout the years:[42][43][44] After a mid-1960s 
remodeling, the 461 marker[45] was replaced by a 463 marker slightly farther 
to the left of the pair of double doors[46] and a 433 marker was added 
between the 463 and 407 markers[47] ostensibly to represent true straightaway 
center field (being roughly at the midpoint of the batter's-eye screen). 
From 1951 through 2007, Bob Sheppard was the public address announcer at 
Yankee Stadium. His distinctive voice (Yankee legend Reggie Jackson has 
called him "the Voice of God") and the way he announced players for over 
half a century made him a part of the lore of the stadium and the team. 
Before a player's first at-bat of the game, Sheppard announced his position, 
his uniform number, his name, and his uniform number again. Example: "Now 
batting for the Yankees, the shortstop, number 2, Derek Jeter, Number 2." 
For each following at-bat, Sheppard announced just the position and name: 
"The shortstop, Derek Jeter." Due to health reasons, 97-year-old Sheppard 
announced his last game on September 5, 2007.[48] He did sign a new two-year 
contract with the Yankees in March 2008 but lacked the strength necessary 
to do the job and missed the entire 2008 season,[49] including the 2008 
All-Star Game,[50] which was played at Yankee Stadium. He could not announce 
the final game at the old stadium in September 2008, but recorded a video 
address that was played during the pregame ceremonies and also recorded 
the lineups for the game. He officially announced his retirement after 
the 2009 season.[51] Sheppard died in July 2010.[49] The Hammond Organ 
was installed at Yankee Stadium in 1967 and was primarily played by Eddie 
Layton from its introduction until his retirement after the 2003 season. 
The playing of the organ has added to the character of the stadium for 
many years, playing before games, introducing players, during the national 
anthem and the rendition of "Take me out to the ball game" during the seventh-inning 
stretch. After Layton's retirement, he got to pick his replacement, Paul 
Cartier.[52] In recent years, the use of the organ has been decreased in 
favor of recorded music between innings and introducing players. Since 
the 2004 season, the national anthem has rarely been performed by the organists, 
opting for military recordings of the Star Spangled Banner. In 2005, a 
new Hammond Elegante was installed replacing the original Hammond Colonnade. 
One of the most famous traditions for Yankee Stadium was playing Frank 
Sinatra's version of the "Theme from New York, New York" over the loudspeakers 
after every home game, since 1980. After the September 11 attacks, all 
American Major League Baseball stadiums started playing God Bless America 
during the seventh-inning stretch for the remainder of the 2001 season. 
Many teams ceased this practice the following season, although it has continued 
in post-season events at many cities and become a tradition at Yankee Stadium 
alongside Take Me Out to the Ballgame. Usually, a recording of the song 
by Kate Smith is played, although sometimes there is a live performance 
by Irish tenor Ronan Tynan. For part of the 2005 season, the Yankees used 
a recording of Tynan, but the Kate Smith version was reinstated due to 
fan complaints about the long duration of the Tynan version. For the final 
game at Yankee Stadium, Tynan performed "God Bless America" live, including 
the rarely heard introduction to the song (which Tynan includes every time 
he performs the song at a Yankees game). When the Yankees scored a run, 
a version of the Westminster chime played as the last player to score in 
the at-bat gets to home plate. The version of the chime is the beginning 
of "Workaholic" by the music group 2 Unlimited. Since 1998, the Yankees' 
World Series championship has been celebrated with the playing of Queen's 
"We Are The Champions" followed by Frank Sinatra's "New York, New York". 
Outside the stadium's main entrance gate, stands a 138-foot (42 m) tall 
exhaust pipe in the shape of a baseball bat, complete with tape at the 
handle that frays off at the end. It is sponsored by Hillerich & Bradsby, 
makers of the famous Louisville Slugger line of baseball bats, which is 
specifically designed to look like a Babe Ruth model. As the most prominent 
feature on the stadium's exterior, recognizable even to first-time visitors, 
the bat was often used as a designated meeting spot for fans to meet their 
ticket holding friends before entering the stadium. The "Bat" continues 
to stand outside the Metro North Station, built in 2009. A 450-foot long 
pedestrian walkway and its staircase meet at the "bat".[53] Beginning in 
the 1990s and after the first pitch was thrown at the top of the first 
inning, the "Bleacher Creatures" in Section 39, usually led by a man nicknamed 
Bald Vinny, began chanting the names of every player in the defensive lineup 
(except the pitcher and catcher, with some rare exceptions), starting with 
the center fielder. They did not stop chanting the player's name until 
he acknowledged the Creatures (usually with a wave or a point), who then 
moved on to the next player. Other names called out during roll call from 
time to time have included Yankee broadcasters John Sterling and Michael 
Kay or Aaron Boone, Bucky Dent and Babe Ruth when the Yankees hosted the 
rival Boston Red Sox. Sometimes, after a long rain delay, the Creatures 
started another Roll Call for comedic effect. Often when a player was replaced 
in the field, their replacement was also welcomed with a chant. In 2008, 
center fielder Melky Cabrera booted a routine grounder while attempting 
to wave to the fans. In its 86 years of existence, Yankee Stadium hosted 
6,581 regular season home games for the Yankees. Only Fenway Park (Boston), 
Wrigley Field (Chicago), Sportsman's Park (St. Louis) and Tiger Stadium 
(Detroit) have hosted more games. Due to the Yankees' frequent appearances 
in the World Series, Yankee Stadium played host to 161 postseason games, 
more than any other stadium in baseball history. The Stadium hosted 37 
of the 83 possible World Series during its existence (not counting 1974–75, 
and the 1994 strike), with the Yankees winning 26 of them. In total, the 
venue hosted 100 World Series games. 16 of the 17 World Series won in the 
Bronx were clinched at the 1923 Yankee Stadium, nine by the Yankees and 
seven by their opponents: Perhaps the most memorable moment in the venue's 
history came on July 4, 1939, designated as "Lou Gehrig Appreciation Day". 
Gehrig, forced out of action permanently by amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 
(ALS) and facing his impending death, gave a legendary farewell speech 
thanking his fans and colleagues for making him "the luckiest man on the 
face of the earth".[54] Many memorable and historic games have been played 
at Yankee Stadium. All three perfect games thrown by Yankee pitchers have 
occurred at the Stadium. Don Larsen threw a perfect game on October 8, 
1956, in the fifth game of the World Series, while David Wells and David 
Cone threw theirs on May 17, 1998 and July 18, 1999, respectively. No-hitters 
were thrown by Monte Pearson, Bob Feller, Allie Reynolds, Virgil Trucks, 
Dave Righetti, Jim Abbott, Dwight Gooden and a combination of six Houston 
Astros pitchers in one game.[55] The Stadium was the site of a nationally 
televised game on August 6, 1979, the same day as the funeral for departed 
Yankees captain Thurman Munson. The team attended the funeral in Canton, 
Ohio earlier in the day and flew to New York for an emotional game. Bobby 
Murcer drove in all five runs for the Yankees, including a game winning 
two-run single that defeated the Baltimore Orioles 5–4. Many historic home 
runs have been hit at Yankee Stadium. Babe Ruth hit the ballpark's first 
home run on its Opening Day in 1923.[56] Ruth also set the then-league 
record for most home runs in a single season by hitting his 60th home run 
in 1927. Roger Maris would later break this record in 1961 at Yankee Stadium 
on the final day of the season by hitting his 61st home run. In 1967, Mickey 
Mantle slugged his 500th career home run. Chris Chambliss won the 1976 
ALCS by hitting a "walk-off" home run in which thousands of fans ran onto 
the field as Chambliss circled the bases. A year later, in the 1977 World 
Series, Reggie Jackson hit three home runs on three consecutive pitches 
in the championship-clinching Game 6. In 1983, the Pine Tar Incident involving 
George Brett occurred; Brett's go-ahead home run in the ninth inning of 
the game was overturned for his bat having too much pine tar, resulting 
in him furiously charging out of the dugout. In Game 1 of the 1996 ALCS, 
Derek Jeter hit a fly ball to right-field that was interfered with by fan 
Jeffrey Maier but ruled a home run. In Game 7 of the 2003 ALCS, Aaron Boone 
hit an extra-inning "walk-off" home run to send the Yankees to the World 
Series. On August 6, 2007, Alex Rodriguez hit his 500th home run against 
the Kansas City Royals at the Stadium. In 2001, six weeks after the September 
11 attacks, Yankee Stadium hosted an emotional three games in the World 
Series. For Game 3, President George W. Bush hurled the ceremonial first 
pitch, throwing a strike. In Game 4, Tino Martinez hit a game-tying home 
run off Arizona Diamondbacks closer Byung-Hyun Kim with two out in the 
ninth inning. Derek Jeter hit the winning "walk-off" home run in extra 
innings off Kim, earning himself the nickname "Mr. November". The following 
night in Game 5, the Yankees replicated their heroics from the previous 
night; Scott Brosius hit a game-tying home run off Kim with two outs in 
the bottom of the ninth inning en route to a win. On July 11, 1939, Major 
League Baseball held the league's seventh All-Star Game at Yankee Stadium, 
in concert with the World's Fair being held at Flushing-Meadows in Queens. 
Yankees manager Joe McCarthy loaded his American League team with pinstripes: 
Bill Dickey (catcher), Joe DiMaggio (outfield), Joe Gordon (second base), 
Red Rolfe (third base), George Selkirk (outfield) and Red Ruffing (pitcher) 
were all in the starting lineup. Reserve players included Frank Crosetti 
(shortstop), Lou Gehrig (first base), Lefty Gomez (pitcher) and Johnny 
Murphy (pitcher). The American League won, 3–1, behind a home run by DiMaggio, 
in front of more than 62,000. This was the second All-Star Game held in 
New York; the Polo Grounds had hosted the event in 1934. From 1959 to 1962, 
Major League Baseball held two All-Star Games each year. On July 13, 1960, 
Yankee Stadium hosted baseball's second All-Star Game in three days. The 
National League won both games. In the latter game, Whitey Ford was the 
starting pitcher. Yogi Berra (catcher), Mickey Mantle (outfield), Roger 
Maris (outfield) and Bill Skowron (first base) were in the starting lineup; 
Jim Coates (pitcher) and Elston Howard (catcher) were reserves. The National 
League won the Yankee Stadium game, 6–0, tying a record with four home 
runs, including one by hometown favorite Willie Mays. The 38,000 fans who 
attended the game also saw the Red Sox' Ted Williams in his final All-Star 
appearance. Showcasing its new renovation, Yankee Stadium hosted the All-Star 
Game on July 19, 1977. With the Yankees defending their 1976 pennant, Billy 
Martin managed the American League team on his home field. The National 
League won its sixth consecutive All-Star Game, 7–5, in front of more than 
56,000 fans; the senior circuit's streak would reach 11. Reggie Jackson 
(outfield) and Willie Randolph (second base) started for the American League; 
Sparky Lyle (pitcher), Thurman Munson (catcher) and Graig Nettles (third 
base) also made the team. Jim Palmer was the game's starting pitcher because 
Nolan Ryan refused to play when Martin asked him. In honor of its final 
year of existence, in July 2008, Yankee Stadium hosted 2008 All-Star Game 
festivities. The Yankees were represented by Derek Jeter, Alex Rodriguez 
and Mariano Rivera. In the Home Run Derby, Josh Hamilton set a single-round 
record with 28 home runs in the first round. At one point, he hit 13 straight 
home runs, many of which landed in the stadium's upper deck and deep into 
the right field bleachers, spurring the crowd to chant his name. Minnesota 
Twins first baseman Justin Morneau won the competition defeating Hamilton 
in the final round. The following evening, the American League won the 
2008 All-Star Game 4–3 in 15 innings. Michael Young hit the game winning 
sacrifice fly in the 15th inning off Brad Lidge. The game was the longest 
in All-Star Game history by time, lasting 4 hours and 50 minutes and tied 
for the longest in history by innings, tied with the 1967 All-Star Game 
and was played in front of 55,632 people. J. D. Drew was named game MVP 
going 2 for 4 with a home run and two RBIs. Yankee Stadium hosted its final 
baseball game on September 21, 2008. The ceremonies for the final game 
at Yankee Stadium began with the opening of Monument Park, as well as allowing 
Yankee fans to walk on the warning track around the field. Many former 
Yankee greats, including Yogi Berra, Whitey Ford, Reggie Jackson, Bernie 
Williams, Paul O'Neill, Willie Randolph, Roy White and Chris Chambliss 
took their positions in the playing field as their names were announced 
by the legendary Bob Sheppard. Julia Ruth Stevens, daughter of Babe Ruth, 
threw out the ceremonial first pitch in the final game in "The House That 
Ruth Built". With Andy Pettitte as the starting pitcher, the Yankees played 
their final game at Yankee Stadium against the Baltimore Orioles, recording 
the final out at 11:43 pm EDT in a 7–3 Yankee victory. Among many lasts 
to be recorded, a long-time standing question was answered. It was first 
wondered by Babe Ruth after he hit the first home run in Yankee Stadium 
on its opening day of April 18, 1923: I was glad to have hit the first 
home run in this park. God only knows who will hit the last. That person 
turned out to be Jose Molina, as he hit a two-run home run in the fourth 
inning.[57] Other lasts were Jason Giambi recording the last hit in Yankee 
Stadium, driving in Brett Gardner, who scored the last run in Yankee Stadium. 
Mariano Rivera made the final pitch in the stadium with Cody Ransom recording 
the final out at first base. In the eighth inning, Derek Jeter became the 
final Yankee to bat in Yankee Stadium. After the game was over, captain 
Derek Jeter delivered a speech on the field surrounded by his teammates. 
In the unplanned speech, Jeter thanked and saluted the fans: For all of 
us up here, it's a huge honor to put this uniform on every day and come 
out here and play. And every member of this organization, past and present, 
has been calling this place home for eighty-five years. There's a lot of 
tradition, a lot of history, and a lot of memories. Now the great thing 
about memories is you're able to pass it along from generation to generation. 
And although things are going to change next year, we're going to move 
across the street, there are a few things with the New York Yankees that 
never change— its pride, its tradition, and most of all, we have the greatest 
fans in the world. And we are relying on you to take the memories from 
this stadium, add them to the new memories that come at the new Yankee 
Stadium, and continue to pass them on from generation to generation. So 
on behalf of the entire organization, we just want to take this moment 
to salute you, the greatest fans in the world. Afterwards, the team circled 
the stadium on the warning track waving to fans and wishing the stadium 
goodbye. When Yankee Stadium opened in 1923, the Polo Grounds continued 
to host boxing matches; however, Yankee Stadium was home to prizefighting 
beginning in its first few months. Benny Leonard retained the lightweight 
championship in a 15-round decision over Lew Tendler on July 24, 1923, 
in front of more than 58,000 fans. It was the first of 30 championship 
bouts to be held at the Stadium. (This excludes dozens of non-title fights.) 
The boxing ring was placed over second base; a 15-foot (4.6 m) vault contained 
electrical, telegraph and telephone connections. In July 1927, the aging 
former heavyweight champion Jack Dempsey came from behind to defeat heavily 
favored Jack Sharkey by delivering several questionable punches that were 
deemed illegal. Sharkey had similarly bad luck in a July 1930 heavyweight 
championship bout at Yankee Stadium, when his knockout punch to Max Schmeling 
was ruled illegal; Schmeling won by default. In July 1928, Gene Tunney 
upheld the heavyweight title against Tom Heeney at Yankee Stadium, and 
then retired as champion. Perhaps the most famous boxing match ever held 
at Yankee Stadium was on June 22, 1938, when Joe Louis, an African-American, 
squared off against Schmeling, a German. Adolf Hitler followed the rematch 
carefully, imploring Schmeling to defeat Louis, whom Hitler publicly berated. 
This left some with what they perceived as a moral predicament: root for 
the black fighter, or for the Nazi. Schmeling had defeated Louis in 1936, 
but in defense of his title, Louis knocked out Schmeling in the first round. 
This was one of eight championship fights the "Brown Bomber" fought at 
Yankee Stadium. On July 1, 1939, Max Baer defeated Lou Nova at Yankee Stadium, 
in the first televised boxing match in the United States. The event was 
broadcast by television station W2XBS, forerunner of WNBC-TV. (The World 
Series was not televised until 1947.) On September 27, 1946, Tony Zale 
knocked out New York native Rocky Graziano for the middleweight crown; 
it was the first of three bouts between Zale and Graziano. On June 25, 
1952, middleweight champion Sugar Ray Robinson sought his third title against 
light-heavyweight champ Joey Maxim at Yankee Stadium. More than 47,000 
saw Robinson outfight Maxim but lose due to heat exhaustion in round 14 
(due to the weather that topped 104-degrees Fahrenheit). The referee who 
declared Maxim the winner was the second that night; the first had left 
the fight due to heat exhaustion. After its 1970s renovation, Yankee Stadium 
hosted only one championship fight. On September 28, 1976, a declining 
Muhammad Ali defended his heavyweight crown against Ken Norton. To that 
point, Norton was one of only two boxers who had beaten Ali (in 1973); 
this was their third and final, meeting. Norton led for most of the fight, 
but Ali improved in the later rounds to win by unanimous decision. The 
first college football game played in Yankee Stadium was a 3-0 Syracuse 
victory over Pittsburgh on October 20, 1923.[59] When an ill Ruth could 
not lead the Yankees to the World Series in 1925, college football took 
center stage at Yankee Stadium that fall. The fiercely competitive Notre 
Dame–Army game moved to Yankee Stadium, where it remained until 1947. In 
the 1928 game, with the score 0–0 at halftime, legendary Notre Dame coach 
Knute Rockne gave his "win one for the Gipper" speech (with reference to 
All-American halfback George Gipp, who died in 1920); Notre Dame went on 
to defeat Army, 12–6. The 1929 game between the two teams had the highest 
attendance in the series at 79,408.[60] The 1946 Army vs. Notre Dame football 
game at Yankee stadium is regarded as one of the 20th century college football 
Games of the Century.[61] Notre Dame played 24 games at Yankee Stadium, 
going 15–6–3. Army played 38, compiling a 17–17–4 record (including the 
best-attended game, on December 1, 1928 when Army lost to Stanford 26–0 
before 86,000 fans). New York University played more games there than any 
other school, 96, using it as a secondary home field from 1923 to 1948, 
with a record of 52–40–4. Nearby Fordham University played 19 games there, 
going 13–5–1. Eight college football games were played at Yankee Stadium 
on Thanksgiving Day, the first seven by New York University. Perhaps, the 
most famous Thanksgiving Day game was the first. Oregon State Agricultural 
College (now Oregon State) was the first West Coast team to travel across 
the country and play an East Coast team. 8–1 NYU was a 3–1 favorite to 
beat 5–3 OSAC, but Oregon State upset the hometown favorites 25–13. Will 
Rogers lamented what the "Oregon apple knockers" had done to his "city 
slickers" in a column after the game. After the 1928 game, NYU beat Carnegie 
Tech (now Carnegie Mellon University) in 1931 and 1932, defeated Fordham 
in 1936, lost to Carnegie Tech in 1929 and lost to Fordham in 1934 and 
1935. In the eighth game, in 1963, Syracuse beat Notre Dame, 14–7. This 
was a rematch following the teams' controversial 1961 game won by Notre 
Dame, 17–15. The Gotham Bowl was scheduled to premiere at Yankee Stadium 
in 1960, but was canceled when no opponent could be found for Oregon State 
University. The 1961 game was moved to the Polo Grounds, and when just 
6,166 people came to Yankee Stadium for the 1962 game, in which the University 
of Nebraska defeated the University of Miami, 36–34, the Gotham Bowl was 
never played again. The Miami-Nebraska game remains the only college bowl 
ever played at the stadium. In 1969, Notre Dame and Army reprised their 
long series at the Stadium (1925–1946 except 1930) with one final game. 
Starting in 1971, the Stadium hosted the Whitney M. Young Urban League 
Classic, a game between historically black colleges, often featuring Grambling 
State University of Louisiana, coached by Eddie Robinson, the first college 
coach to win 400 games. The Classic helped to spread the fame of Grambling 
and other similar schools. Yankee Stadium hosted its final Classic during 
the 1987 season, also the last time a football game was played there. Grambling 
lost to Central State University of Ohio, 37–21.[62] The Classic has been 
held at Giants Stadium and MetLife Stadium in New Jersey's Meadowlands 
Sports Complex ever since, though the Yankees remain a supporter of the 
event. In 1926, after negotiations failed with the fledgling NFL and the 
Chicago Bears, Red Grange and his agent C.C. Pyle formed the first American 
Football League and fielded a team called the New York Yankees based in 
Yankee Stadium. The league failed after only one year, but the team continued 
as a member of the NFL for two seasons before ceasing operations. A second 
New York Yankees football team, not related to the first, split its home 
games between Yankee Stadium and Downing Stadium as it competed in the 
second AFL in 1936 and 1937. A third AFL New York Yankees took the field 
in 1940 and became the New York Americans in 1941. The New York Yankees 
of the All-America Football Conference (AAFC) played their home games at 
Yankee Stadium from 1946 to 1949. The 1947 AAFC championship game was held 
at Yankee Stadium. Following the 1949 season, the NFL New York Bulldogs 
acquired many of the players from the 1949 Yankees. Using the name the 
New York Yanks they played two seasons at Yankee Stadium, 1950 and 1951. 
The New York Giants of the NFL played their home games at Yankee Stadium 
from 1956 to 1973. On December 28, 1958, Yankee Stadium hosted the NFL 
championship game, frequently called "The Greatest Game Ever Played". The 
Baltimore Colts tied the Giants, 17–17, on a field goal with seven seconds 
left. Led by quarterback Johnny Unitas, the Colts won in overtime, 23–17. 
The game's dramatic ending is often cited as elevating professional football 
to one of the United States' major sports. Additionally, one of the most 
notable plays in NFL history occurred at Yankee Stadium on November 20, 
1960 when the Philadelphia Eagles' Chuck Bednarik forcefully tackled the 
Giants' Frank Gifford in the last minute of a close game, forcing a fumble 
recovered by the Eagles that clinched the victory for Philadelphia and 
ultimately helped the Eagles dethrone the two-time defending champion Giants 
as NFL Eastern Conference champions. The hit left Gifford with a concussion 
and forced his temporary retirement from football for the remainder of 
the 1960 season and all of the 1961 season.[63] Three NFL championships 
games were played at Yankee Stadium; 1956, 1958 and 1962. The Giants played 
their first two home games at Yankee Stadium in 1973, concluding their 
tenancy on September 23 with a 23–23 tie against the Philadelphia Eagles. 
In October, they moved to the Yale Bowl in New Haven, Connecticut, for 
the rest of the season. Celtic F.C. defeated New York Yankees in the first 
major soccer game to be played at the Stadium on June 28, 1931. In the 
coming three decades, a number of games between Jewish Palestinian teams 
and American all-stars were played. European club exhibitions first came 
in 1952, when on June 14, Liverpool drew 1–1 with Grasshopper Club Zürich. 
The next day, Tottenham Hotspur thrashed Manchester United 7–1, just a 
year after United had taken over for Spurs as champions of England. The 
following year, on June 8, the English national team defeated the U.S. 
national team 6–3, in a rematch of the Miracle on Grass match at the 1950 
World Cup.[64] Major international clubs returned to the Stadium in 1966, 
with Pele's Santos of Brazil beating Inter Milan 4–1 on June 5. In 1967, 
C.A. Cerro of Uruguay played in the United Soccer Association during the 
summer months under the title "New York Skyliners". They played major games 
against Hibernian F.C. of Scotland, renamed "Toronto City", Cagliari F.C. 
of Italy, renamed "Chicago Mustangs" and Bangu Atlético Clube of Brazil, 
renamed "Houston Stars". During the same year, the stadium also became 
home to the New York Generals of the National Professional Soccer League. 
Upon the 1968 merger of the United Soccer Association and the National 
Professional Soccer League, a new league was created known as the North 
American Soccer League, where the Generals remained as the New York team. 
In 1968, in addition to league competition, the Generals took on Santos, 
winning 5–3 and Real Madrid, losing 4–1. That year, Santos also played 
and beat S.S.C. Napoli of Italy 4–2 at the Stadium, along with S.L. Benfica 
of Portugal, with whom they drew 3–3. The next year, four major international 
club games were played at the Stadium: Barcelona beat Juventus 3–2 on May 
30, Inter Milan beat Sparta Prague 4–0 on June 27 and A.C. Milan defeated 
Panathinaikos 4–0 also on June 27. Finally, on June 29, Yankee Stadium 
hosted its own version of the Derby della Madonnina, with A.C. Milan defeating 
Inter 6–4. The latter three games that year were all part of a three-day 
"United States Cup of Champions".[65] On September 15, 1968, the U.S. national 
soccer team played an international friendly against the Israel national 
team at the Stadium. It was the first game for the U.S. in 15 months and 
10,118 saw Israel and the U.S. draw 3-3.[66] In 1971 and 1976, the New 
York Cosmos of the NASL played their home games at Yankee Stadium. During 
the 1971 season, they also hosted Hearts from Scotland, and Apollon Kalamarias 
of Greece. In 1976 the team's star attraction was Pelé. The Brazil native, 
known as "The King of Football", was considered the best player in the 
world. Also that year, in Yankee Stadium's final international match on 
May 28, England defeated Italy 3–2 as part of the Bicentennial Cup Tournament. 
Finally, on August 10, 1976, the last ever soccer game was played at Yankee 
Stadium, with the Cosmos thrashing the Miami Toros 8–2. The Cosmos moved 
to Giants Stadium for the 1977 season.[67] Beginning in 1950, the stadium 
began holding religious conventions of Jehovah's Witnesses. The 1958 New 
York International Convention of Jehovah's Witnesses attracted 253,922 
people from all over the world, although many were at the nearby Polo Grounds, 
the Yankee Stadium total of 123,707 in a single day remains the biggest 
attendance ever for any event at Yankee Stadium and is commemorated by 
a historical marker in the sidewalk nearby.[68] These conventions would 
continue on until the late 1980s. When room ran out in the stands, the 
ladies were asked to remove their heels, and people were brought in to 
sit in the outfield. There was also a makeshift camp nearby where the program 
was broadcast for hundreds others to listen to. On July 20, 1957, evangelist 
Billy Graham attracted a crowd of 100,000 to a televised "crusade" at Yankee 
Stadium. A New York Times article of the following day described the turnout 
as "the largest crowd in stadium history" to that time.[69] Cardinal Francis 
Spellman (1957), Pope Paul VI (1965), Pope John Paul II (1969 as a cardinal, 
1979 as pope) and Pope Benedict XVI (2008) all celebrated Mass at the ballpark, 
along with numerous clergy and lay Catholics. On June 21, 1990, a rally 
was held at Yankee Stadium for Nelson Mandela upon his release from prison. 
On September 23, 2001, Yankee Stadium hosted a memorial service for victims 
of the September 11 terrorist attacks in New York City. The first concert 
ever held there was an ensemble R&B show on June 21, 1969, put together 
by the Isley Brothers; the first rock concert held at the stadium was on 
June 22, 1990, by Billy Joel. It was also the site of two dates of U2's 
Zoo TV Tour in 1992. During one song, Bono paid tribute to the show's setting 
with the line "I dreamed I saw Joe DiMaggio/Dancing with Marilyn Monroe". 
Pink Floyd also performed two sold-out shows at this venue on their final 
North American tour in 1994 in support of their album The Division Bell. 
On March 10, 2006, Yankee Stadium saw its only wedding at home plate. Blind 
sportswriter Ed Lucas, who has been a member of the Yankee family for over 
40 years, got special permission from the Yankees, the City of New York 
and Major League Baseball to exchange vows with his fiancée, Allison Pfieffle, 
on the same spot where Lou Gehrig made his famous farewell speech, among 
the many notable events. Over 400 people, including present and former 
members of the Yankee family were in attendance to see the happy couple 
united, and the ceremony was broadcast on ESPN, the YES Network, NBC's 
Today Show and other national media outlets. National Hockey League (NHL) 
executives inquired about the possibility of using Yankee Stadium for an 
outdoor ice hockey match featuring the New York Rangers in the 2008–2009 
season after the successful reception of both the 2003 Heritage Classic 
and the 2008 NHL Winter Classic outdoor games. If approved, it would have 
been the final sporting event at the current stadium.[70] The NHL, however, 
decided to hold the second Winter Classic in Chicago, at Wrigley Field.[71] 
The new Yankee Stadium would end up hosting two outdoor NHL games in 2014.

Heritage Field. The park actually has the outline of the field from its 
predecessor. Also, it is across the street from the new Yankee Stadium.
