Andrew James Van Slyke (born December 21, 1960) is an American retired 
Major League Baseball (MLB) center fielder. Van Slyke earned All-American 
honors in baseball as a senior at New Hartford Central High school in New 
Hartford, New York. He was drafted in the first round (sixth overall pick) 
of the 1979 Major League Baseball amateur draft by the St. Louis Cardinals. 
Called up from the AAA Louisville Redbirds, he made his Major League debut 
with the Cardinals on June 17, 1983, collecting a double, a run batted 
in (RBI) and making three putouts in the outfield without an error.[1] 
In 1985, he was one of five Cardinals to steal at least 30 bases. He stole 
34 that season, part of the "Whiteyball" era. The first two years of his 
career Van Slyke played first base, third base and all three outfield positions. 
He mostly played right field the next two years on the strength of his 
throwing arm, occasionally platooning with Tito Landrum, sometimes substituting 
for Willie McGee in center field. On September 21, 1986, he hit a rare 
inside-the-park home run.[2] During spring training 1987, he was traded 
to the Pittsburgh Pirates along with left-handed hitting catcher Mike LaValliere 
and minor league pitcher Mike Dunne for catcher Tony Peña. The trade occurred 
on April 1, with Van Slyke initially believing that it was an April Fools' 
Day joke.[3] In Pittsburgh, he mostly played center field alongside stars 
Barry Bonds and Bobby Bonilla. During the 1991 Gulf War, when the MLB decreed 
all players would wear both the Canadian and U.S. flags on their batting 
helmets as a patriotic gesture, Van Slyke scraped the Maple Leaf off his 
helmet, stating "I guess the people in Quebec won't be upset because the 
last time we were there they booed [the Canadian] Nation Anthem". MLB Commissioner 
Fay Vincent ordered that the Canadian flag decal be reinserted onto the 
helmet.[4] Once Van Slyke became a full-time outfielder, he showed off 
one of the most accurate and powerful throwing arms in the majors, so much 
that the "Slyke Zone" was established at Three Rivers Stadium. From 1985 
to 1994, he was frequently among the league leaders in outfield assists. 
From 1985 to 1988, he posted seasons of 13, 10, 11, and 12 assists, respectively. 
As center fielder for the Pirates, he won five consecutive Gold Gloves 
from 1988 to 1992. Van Slyke played for four different teams in his career: 
the St. Louis Cardinals (1983–1986), Pittsburgh Pirates (1987–1994), Baltimore 
Orioles (1995), and Philadelphia Phillies (1995). He played his final game 
on October 1, 1995. In his 13-year career, Van Slyke appeared in three 
All-Star games (1988, 1992, 1993), won five Gold Glove Awards, two Silver 
Slugger Awards, and ranked in the top 10 in many offensive categories in 
varying seasons. Prior to the 2006 season, Van Slyke was named first base 
coach for the Detroit Tigers by manager Jim Leyland, under whom he had 
played in Pittsburgh. Van Slyke served in that capacity on Leyland's staff 
for four years through the 2009 season. When Lloyd McClendon was named 
the Seattle Mariners' manager prior to the 2014 season, Van Slyke was hired 
to be the team's first base coach. He also worked as the assistant hitting 
coach and outfield instructor through the 2015 season. # = MLB All-Star 
Game selection Van Slyke became eligible for the National Baseball Hall 
of Fame in 2001. 75% of the vote was necessary for induction, and 5% was 
necessary to stay on the ballot. Of the 32 total candidates,[6] Van Slyke 
received no votes and was eliminated from future BBWAA voting.[7] Having 
retired from baseball, Van Slyke has begun pursuing a career as an author, 
focusing on books centered on baseball. In 2009 he authored Tiger Confidential: 
The Untold Inside Story of the 2008 Season (with co-author Jim Hawkins). 
In July 2010, he published The Curse: Cubs Win! Cubs Win! Or Do They? (with 
co-author Rob Rains), a book in the subgenre sports fiction about the Chicago 
Cubs finally breaking their one hundred year curse and playing in the World 
Series. Andy has four sons, three of whom played college or professional 
sports. Scott Van Slyke plays for the Los Angeles Dodgers;[8] Jared Van 
Slyke was a defensive back on the University of Michigan football team;[9] 
and A. J. Van Slyke played baseball for the University of Kansas and for
