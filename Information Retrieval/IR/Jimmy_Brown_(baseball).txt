James Roberson Brown (April 25, 1910 – December 29, 1977) was a Major League 
Baseball infielder and coach. Born in Jamesville, North Carolina, he played 
college baseball for the North Carolina State College (now North Carolina 
State University) Wolfpack.[1] He signed with the St. Louis Cardinals afterwards 
and made his major league debut two days before his 27th birthday. He made 
an immediate impact, not only scoring 9 triples his rookie year, but also 
leading the league in sacrifice hits with 26.[2] His 1938 season was not 
as impressive, but he did manage to increase his batting average over .300.[2] 
Brown had a career year in 1939, not only leading the league in at-bats 
with 645, but finishing 6th in MVP voting.[2] He began being known as a 
reliable leadoff hitter and as an infielder that the Cardinals could put 
anywhere, having played 1936 primarily as a second baseman, 1939 as a shortstop, 
and 1941 as a third baseman.[2] After a decent season in 1940, he came 
back with another great year in 1941, tying a career high in triples with 
9, earning a career high batting average with .306, and finishing 4th in 
MVP voting.[2] This, however, was still not enough to earn an all-star 
appearance. In 1942 he managed to earn his lone all-star appearance and 
finish 13th in MVP voting.[2] Despite this and leading the league in at-bats 
with 606, his batting average dipped to .256, a career low.[2] Despite 
this, during the 1942 World Series, he led all Cardinals' hitters in batting 
average with .300 en route to their World Series victory.[3] Brown enlisted 
in the United States Army Air Forces after playing 34 games during the 
1943 season.[4] When World War II ended, his contract was sold for $30,000 
on January 5, 1946, to the Pittsburgh Pirates; he played the 1946 season 
as a utility infielder before being released by the Pirates on November 
15.[5] Upon retirement, he became a manager in the Pittsburgh farm system, 
with the Indianapolis Indians in 1947 and the New Orleans Pelicans in 1948.[6] 
Brown then returned to the National League as a coach for the Boston Braves, 
working for three seasons (1949–51) under his old Cardinal skipper, Billy 
Southworth. After leaving Boston in 1952, he was a manager for minor league 
teams in the farm systems of the Cardinals, Braves and Cincinnati Reds.
