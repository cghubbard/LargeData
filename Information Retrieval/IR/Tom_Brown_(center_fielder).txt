Thomas Tarlton Brown (September 21, 1860 – October 25, 1927) was an Anglo-American 
center fielder in Major League Baseball. Born in Liverpool, Lancashire, 
England, he played for 17 seasons, a career in which he batted .265 while 
scoring 1,521 runs with 1,951 hits. Upon his retirement he served as an 
umpire, working mostly in the National League in 1898 and 1901–1902.[1] 
In June 1882, Tom signed with the Baltimore Orioles, of the American Association, 
as non-drafted free agent. As a right fielder, he hit one home run with 
23 runs batted in for that season with Baltimore. He was a right fielder 
for most of his early career, he switched over to center later in his career.[1] 
That year, the Orioles finished 6th in the league,[2] and Brown was sent 
to the Columbus Buckeyes in an unknown transaction before the 1883 season. 
He played two season in Columbus, both of which he hit five home runs and 
drove in 32 runs. His best season with them occurred in 1884, when he batted 
.273 and scored 93 runs in 106 games played.[1] On October 30, 1884, the 
Buckeyes went under and the team, with all of its players, were purchased 
by the Pittsburg Alleghenys for a sum of $8,000. Highlights of his two 
and a half seasons with the Alleghenys include a .307 batting average in 
1885 and 51 RBIs in 1886. However, he struggled in 1887 and was released 
by Pittsburg on August 15. He was picked up by the Indianapolis Hoosiers, 
of the National League, a few days later, where he hit only .179 in 36 
games.[1] While at Indianapolis, Brown became part of the first known platoon 
arrangement in baseball, as he split time with right-handed hitting Gid 
Gardner.[3][4] Before the 1888 season, he was sent to the Boston Beaneaters. 
Brown was one of Boston's star players. As their starting right fielder, 
and he hit nine home runs with 49 RBIs, and stole 46 bases.[1] After the 
1888 season, Albert Spalding assembled two teams of players for a baseball 
world tour with Tom pitching for the "All America" team. The tour lasted 
until March 1889.[5] For the 1889 season, he only hit two home runs, and 
drove in 24 runs, but he placed third in the league with 63 stolen bases.[6] 
He also scored 93 runs while only accumulating 84 hits.[1] Brown jumped 
to the new Players' League, along with many other major league players, 
before the 1890 season. The league lasted just one season, and Tom signed 
with the Boston Reds. In that season with the Reds, he hit .274 with 4 
home runs and 61 RBIs, and stole 79 bases. When the league folded after 
the season, the Reds continued on in the American Association in 1891, 
where Brown had his greatest season, when he led the league in at bats, 
triples with 21, runs scored with 177, stolen bases with 106, base hits 
with 189.[1] Behind Brown's hitting prowess, and with other star such as 
Dan Brouthers, Hugh Duffy, and Charlie Buffinton, the Reds finished first 
in the league.[7] After the 1891 season, the Association folded, Brown 
was granted to the league and was later obtained by the Louisville Colonels 
on January 1, 1892.[1] He played in Louisville for three seasons, during 
which he stole a league-leading 66 bases in 1893, hit 9 home runs in 1894, 
and scored over 100 runs in each of his three seasons.[6] On January 6, 
1895, he was traded to the St. Louis Browns for shortstop Frank Shugart. 
Brown played in 83 games for St. Louis before being released in August. 
He signed with the Washington Senators on August 21, 1895. Brown later 
served as the player-manager of the Senators for the 1897 and 1898 seasons, 
winning 64 games and losing 72.[1] Brown established the major league record 
with 490 errors committed as an outfielder. He racked up 222 errors in 
the American Association, 238 in the National League, and 30 in the Player's 
League. By contrast, the National League record is held by nineteenth-century 
player George Gore with 346 errors and the American League record by Ty 
Cobb with 271.[8] After his retirement early in the 1898 season, he became 
an umpire and finished the season in the National League, umpiring a total 
of 96 games that year. During his time umpiring, he ejected seven players 
from games, three of which were in 1898. On September 30, Philadelphia 
Phillies second baseman Nap Lajoie was sent to the bench after a heated 
argument, insists that Brown is crooked. Nap was suspended for three days.[9] 
The following season, in 1899 he only umpired two games before becoming 
manager of the minor league team in Springfield of the Eastern League.[1][10] 
He returned to umpiring for the 1901 and 1902 seasons when he called 65 
and 143 games respectively. He again left the profession until he returned 
for 12 more games in 1907 in the American League.[1] Tom died in Washington, 
D.C. at the age of 67, and is interred at the Fort Lincoln Cemetery in
