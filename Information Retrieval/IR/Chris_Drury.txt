Christopher Ellis Drury (born August 20, 1976) is a retired American professional 
ice hockey player who most recently played with the New York Rangers of 
the National Hockey League. He currently serves as the Assistant General 
Manager for the New York Rangers.[1] Drury is a Hobey Baker Award-winner 
with Boston University, a Calder Trophy winner with the Colorado Avalanche, 
a Stanley Cup champion with the Avalanche, a two-time Olympic silver medalist 
with the United States, and a former captain of the Buffalo Sabres and 
New York Rangers. As a child, he also won the Little League Baseball World 
Series Championship with his hometown team from Trumbull, Connecticut. 
Drury excelled at a variety of sports as a child, including hockey and 
baseball. Playing for his hometown baseball team from Trumbull, Drury pitched 
a complete game, 5-hitter and drove in two runs to win the 1989 Little 
League World Series championship game against Chinese Taipei.[2] Two months 
later, Drury threw out the ceremonial first pitch in Game 2 of the 1989 
World Series. He also met President George H. W. Bush and appeared on Good 
Morning America in New York City. Drury played many sports simultaneously; 
before winning the Little League World Series with Trumbull, he won a national 
pee wee championship with his hockey team from Bridgeport the same year.[3] 
Along with his older brother, Ted Drury, he attended Fairfield College 
Preparatory School. He was co-captain of the varsity hockey team in his 
senior year, receiving Connecticut all-state honors for his efforts on 
the ice.[4] Chris and Ted are the only players in Fairfield Prep's hockey 
history to have their numbers retired.[5] The number 18, which they both 
wore, hangs above the school's home rink at the Wonderland of Ice in Bridgeport 
in the old rink (currently known as the Stadium Rink after the renovations 
that added another rink), as well as in the lobby outside the locker room 
complex at Fairfield Prep itself. Chris' name and number are also painted 
above the entrance doors to the Classic arena at the same ice rink. After 
graduating from Fairfield College Preparatory School, Drury was drafted 
by the Quebec Nordiques 72nd overall in the third round of the 1994 NHL 
Entry Draft. Upon being drafted, Drury began a four-year career at Boston 
University. In 1995, Drury won a national championship with BU in his freshman 
year.[2] In both 1997 and 1998 he was named Hockey East's player of the 
year and was also named best defensive forward in 1998. In his senior year, 
he won the Hobey Baker Award as the National Collegiate Athletics Association 
(NCAA)'s top ice hockey player after finishing as the runner-up the previous 
season. Drury was the first BU player to reach 100 career goals and assists, 
finishing with 113 and 100, respectively.[6] BU would win the Beanpot tournament 
all four years he played for them. On January 15, 2009, well into his NHL 
career, Drury was named Hockey East's Best Defensive Forward, as part of 
the league's 25th Anniversary celebration. Drury was chosen in a vote of 
Hockey East fans and members of the league's 25th Anniversary Committee.[7] 
The Nordiques franchise was relocated to Denver, Colorado in 1995, and 
renamed the Colorado Avalanche. Drury began his NHL career there in 1998–99. 
Recording 44 points in his first season, Drury was awarded the Calder Memorial 
Trophy as the league's top rookie. In doing so, he became the first player 
in history to have won both the Hobey Baker Award and the Calder Trophy.[8] 
After a 65-point season in 2000–01, Drury won the Stanley Cup with the 
Avalanche, adding 16 points in the playoffs. Drury became a fan favorite 
with the Avalanche crowd primarily due to his clutch play during playoffs. 
He had a total of 11 game-winning goals in 4 straight playoff seasons in 
Colorado. Avalanche captain Joe Sakic once said of Drury, "You want a goal, 
you're in overtime – you want him."[2][9] Because of his penchant for game-winning 
goals, Drury was often referred to as one of the best clutch players in 
the NHL. Although Drury's production dipped to 46 points in 2001–02, he 
was named to the U.S. roster for the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake 
City. Though he did not record any points in the tournament, the Americans 
surprised many by making it all the way to the finals where they lost to 
Canada. This was the best finish for the United States at the tournament 
since the 1980 Miracle on Ice.[10] Before the start of the next season, 
on October 1, 2002, Drury and Stephane Yelle were traded to the Calgary 
Flames in exchange for Derek Morris, Dean McAmmond and Jeff Shantz. He 
spent just one season with the team before he was traded again on July 
3, 2003, this time to the Buffalo Sabres. Traded twice in two seasons, 
Drury was admittedly frustrated.[11] However, Drury regained his form and 
excelled in Buffalo, serving as co-captain with Daniel Brière from 2005 
to his departure via free agency in 2007. With his previous numbers (37 
with Colorado and 18 with Calgary) both taken in Buffalo, Drury switched 
to 23 in honor of his childhood hero, New York Yankees first baseman Don 
Mattingly.[12] Drury again represented the United States at the 2006 Winter 
Olympics, where the Americans finished 8th overall.[13] After a career-high 
37-goal, 69-point campaign in 2006–07, the Sabres made a second consecutive 
run to the Eastern Conference Finals this time as the Presidents' Trophy-winning 
first seed, where they faced the Ottawa Senators, . Proving he could still 
be a clutch performer, Drury scored two game-winning goals in the first 
round against the New York Islanders,[2] then scored the game-tying goal 
in game five of the second round against the New York Rangers with 7.7 
seconds left in regulation time.[14] The Sabres won 2–1 in overtime and 
closed out the series against the Rangers 4 games to 2. In game four of 
the Conference Finals against the Senators, Drury recorded another game-winner 
to stave off elimination,[15] though the Sabres were eventually defeated 
4 games to 1. In the off-season, Drury and co-captain Danny Brière both 
became unrestricted free agents. While Brière signed with the Philadelphia 
Flyers, on July 1, 2007, Drury signed a five-year, $35.25 million contract 
with the New York Rangers.[16] He made his Rangers debut against the Florida 
Panthers, scoring a goal in a 5–2 win.[17] On February 1, 2008, in a game 
against the New Jersey Devils, Drury scored an empty net goal on the power 
play for his 500th career point.[18] He finished his first season with 
the Rangers with 58 points – third in team scoring. Matched up against 
the New Jersey Devils in the first round, Drury scored the game-winning 
and series-clinching goal to eliminate the Devils in five games.[19] On 
October 1, 2008, Drury and the Rangers won the Victoria Cup, defeating 
Metallurg Magnitogorsk by a score of 4–3. After the departure of Jaromir 
Jagr from the Rangers to play in the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL), Drury 
was named the 25th captain in Rangers history on October 3, 2008. Drury 
was only the second American-born captain in team history (The first was 
Brian Leetch from 1997 to 2000).[20] This made Drury one of four active 
NHL players at the time to have captained two different NHL teams (the 
others were Chris Pronger, Joe Thornton and former teammate Adam Foote). 
Drury was named to the United States roster for the 2010 Winter Olympics. 
Drury, Jamie Langenbrunner and Brian Rafalski were the only members of 
the 2010 team who have previous Olympic experience. Because of his disappointing 
play for the Rangers in 2010 (he had spent much of the season on the fourth 
line, with a pre-Olympics scoring total of 8G-11A-19P and a –14 plus-minus 
rating), Drury's inclusion on the team was questioned by former Olympian 
Jeremy Roenick, who said the team might be better served by adding either 
former Rangers teammate Scott Gomez or T. J. Oshie.[21] On February 21, 
2010, Drury scored the go-ahead goal to break a 2–2 tie in a critical round-robin 
game against Canada. The American team went on to win 5–3. The Americans 
lost a rematch to the Canadians in the gold medal game and Drury was awarded 
an Olympic silver medal for the second time. In June 2011, rumors began 
circulating that the Rangers were looking to negotiate a contract buyout 
with Drury. However, these rumors were silenced after it was announced 
that Drury may have a degenerative condition in his left knee which would 
cause him to miss the entire 2011–12 season.[22] On June 29, 2011, Drury 
accepted a buy-out of the final year of his contract, to become an unrestricted 
free agent July 1, 2011. Drury would count approximately $3.716 million 
against the 2011–12 salary cap, and about $1.667 million against the 2012–13 
salary cap.[23] On August 19, 2011, Drury retired as a player.[24] In September 
2015, the Rangers named Drury their Director of Player Development.[25] 
In September 2016, Drury was promoted by the Rangers to Assistant General 
Manager.[26] Chris and wife Rory[27] have three children; two daughters 
Dylan, born December 2003, and Kelly, born December 2009, and son Luke, 
born May 2005.[citation needed] and currently resides in Greenwich, CT
