Wilmer Dean Chance (June 1, 1941 – October 11, 2015) was an American professional 
baseball player. He played in Major League Baseball as a right-handed pitcher.[1] 
During his 11-year major league career, he played for the Los Angeles Angels, 
Minnesota Twins, Cleveland Indians, New York Mets, and Detroit Tigers. 
With a touch of wildness and the habit of never looking at home plate once 
he received the sign from his catcher, Chance would turn his back fully 
towards the hitter in mid-windup before spinning and unleashing a good 
fastball, sinker or sidearm curveball.[2] In 1964, Chance became at the 
time the youngest pitcher to win the Cy Young Award[3] when, as a member 
of the Los Angeles Angels, he led the American League in wins (20), innings 
pitched (278 1⁄3) and earned run average (1.65—as of 2015, a franchise 
record) and was third in the A.L. in strikeouts.[1] He pitched 11 shutouts 
(also a franchise record as of 2015) that season, winning five of those 
by a 1–0 score.[1] At the time, only one Cy Young Award was given in all 
of MLB; since 1967, separate awards have been given in the AL and the National 
League.[4] Chance's Cy Young Award was the third in a string of five consecutive 
Cy Young Awards won by a pitcher from a Los Angeles-based team. The others 
were won by Dodger pitchers: Don Drysdale in 1962 and Sandy Koufax in 1963, 
1965, and 1966.[4] Chance attended West Salem's Northwestern High School 
(Ohio) and starred on the baseball team and basketball teams (leading the 
team to a 1958 state title), but baseball is where Chance would shine. 
During his high school years, he set several state records which still 
stand including a 52–1 career record, 20 wins in a season, 32 straight 
wins, eight no-hitters in a season (in both his junior and senior years), 
and 17 no-hitters total. He also led the Huskies to the Class A state semifinals 
in 1958 and a championship in 1959 (and pitching every inning of every 
postseason tournament game).[5] Following high school, Chance signed with 
the Baltimore Orioles (for a $30,000 bonus and $12 Greyhound bus ticket) 
prior to the start of the 1959 season as an amateur free agent.[5][6] After 
signing, he was assigned to the Bluefield Orioles in the class-D Appalachian 
League where he went 10–3 with a 2.94 ERA. In 1960, he went 12–9 for Fox 
Cities Foxes in class-B Illinois–Indiana–Iowa League. On December 14, 1960, 
Chance was drafted by the Washington Senators as the 48th pick in the 1960 
AL expansion draft. Immediately following the draft, Chance was traded 
by the Senators to the Los Angeles Angels for outfielder Joe Hicks. He 
pitched most of 1961 for the Dallas-Fort Worth Rangers, going 9–12, before 
making his major league debut on September 11, 1961, at the age of 20.[7] 
Chance finished the season 0–2 with a 6.87 ERA in five games, but was in 
the majors to stay. Chance had an outstanding rookie campaign in 1962, 
winning 14 games with an ERA of 2.96 and finishing tied for third in AL 
Rookie of the Year voting with Bernie Allen and Dick Radatz (behind fellow 
Angel Buck Rodgers and winner Tom Tresh). The 1962 campaign was notable 
for the Angels as Chance and fellow phenom Bo Belinsky teamed on both the 
mound and in the Hollywood social circles, much to the enjoyment of the 
Los Angeles beat writers and the consternation of manager Bill Rigney and 
the rest of the Angels' front office.[3] Although he lost 18 games in 1963, 
he finished with a 3.19 ERA in 248 innings.[1] The pair were inseparable 
and often roomed together, some saying so that the Angels' would only have 
to mind one bad room – at least when they were in their room after curfew 
(which wasn't often).[3] After his 1964 season in which he won the Cy Young 
Award and was elected to his first All-Star Game, Chance went 15–10 in 
1965 and 12–17 in 1966, despite a respectable ERA of 3.08.[1] After the 
1966 season, the Angels, a weak hitting team desperate for power and looking 
to shed one of their problem children, shipped Chance and infielder Jackie 
Hernandez to the Minnesota Twins on December 2 in a trade that netted them 
outfielder Jimmie Hall, slugging first baseman Don Mincher, and relief 
pitcher Pete Cimino.[8] Chance responded by winning 20 games for the Twins 
in 1967, leading the AL in games started (39), complete games (18) and 
innings pitched (283 2⁄3).[1] On August 6 of that year, he pitched a rain-shortened, 
five-inning perfect game against the Red Sox at Metropolitan Stadium in 
Bloomington, Minnesota.[9] He also pitched a 2–1 no-hitter against the 
Cleveland Indians on August 25 with the Indians scoring their sole run 
in the first inning on two walks, an error, and a wild pitch.[10] Chance 
later said that umpire Ed Runge's wide strike zone had a lot to do with 
him keeping the Indians off the basepaths.[11] The Twins nearly won the 
1967 pennant, but Chance was outdueled in the season's final game, at Fenway 
Park, by Boston's Jim Lonborg, chasing Chance in with 5 runs in the sixth 
despite getting only one ball out of the infield,[12] and the Red Sox emerged 
as surprise league champions — with Lonborg winning the 1967 AL Cy Young 
trophy in the process.[13] The trade helped both teams and Chance as the 
Angels rose to fifth place with an 84–77 record in 1967, the Twins were 
in it until the season's final game, and Chance was voted to his second 
all-star team and won the Sporting News AL Comeback Player of the Year 
award.[14] The 1968 campaign saw Chance put up a lackluster 16–16 record 
(echoing the Twins' 79–83 finish), but saw him notch career lows in hits 
and walks per 9 innings (6.9 and 1.9 respectively), and career highs in 
innings (292), strikeouts (234), and strikeouts per 9 innings (7.9). Due 
to his strong numbers, Chance had more than a decent chance at again winning 
20 games, but the Twins offense let him down in 1968, scoring two runs 
or fewer in 17 of his 22 starts (games in which Chance himself posted an 
ERA of 2.55). In the games in which the Twins scored at least three runs, 
Chance posted a 13–4 record.[15] Despite his strong season, owner Calvin 
Griffith, well known for being "thrifty", tried to cut Chance's salary 
by $9,000. Chance held out prior to the 1969 season and was successful 
in having his salary cut by "only" $5,000.[11] However, 1968 was his last 
big year before his career rapidly declined. From 1969–1971, he won only 
18 games. In 1969, he was plagued by a back injury caused by rushing to 
get into shape following his holdout and only pitched 88 1⁄3 innings. On 
December 10, 1969, the Twins shipped Chance, third baseman (and future 
New York Yankees star) Graig Nettles, infielder Ted Uhlaender, and pitcher 
Bob Miller to the Cleveland Indians for relief pitcher Stan Williams and 
future Boston Red Sox star Luis Tiant. The trade was a disaster for the 
Twins as Nettles immediately blossomed and hit 26 home runs for the 1970 
Indians and Tiant, the key to the trade, was released after only one injury-plagued 
season. Chance split the 1970 season between the Indians, for whom he pitched 
a 9–8 record with a 4.28, and the New York Mets (after being purchased 
from the Indians on September 18). Chance was traded again on March 30, 
1971, this time to the Detroit Tigers along with reliever Bill Denehy for 
minor league pitcher Jerry Robertson. Used largely out of the bullpen, 
Chance finished his career with a 4–6 record in 31 games. His career record 
over 11 seasons (1961–71) and 406 games pitched was 128 wins, 115 losses 
and an ERA of 2.92. He was a notoriously weak batsman in the days prior 
to the designated hitter, garnering only 44 hits in 662 at bats, for a 
batting average of .066. He struck out 420 times in those 662 at-bats. 
Baseball author Bill James named Chance, along with Ron Herbel as the worst 
hitting pitchers of the 1960s.[16] Chance retired to a 300-acre ranch 3 
miles from his boyhood farm right.[5] During the 1970s and 1980s Chance 
acted as a midway barker and operated games of skill at carnivals and fairs 
and was one of the most successful operators, eventually employing 250 
people and running 40 games at the Ohio State Fair alone, on a circuit 
that includes Columbus, Ohio, Raleigh, North Carolina, Augusta, Georgia, 
Syracuse, New York, Hollywood, Florida, and Corpus Christi, Texas[17] before 
tiring of the constant travels and con men (He was one himself) who frequented 
this business.[14] Chance founded the International Boxing Association 
during the 1990s, managed many fighters, and was its long-time president.[18] 
As part of the Angels' 50th anniversary, Chance threw out the first pitch 
before the June 4, 2011 game versus the New York Yankees.[11] Chance had 
one child, son Brett, who graduated from Ohio State University in 1985[19] 
and worked as an executive for the Ohio State Fair, the Ohio Expo Center, 
and Instagram.[20] In August 2015 Chance was inducted into the Angels hall 
of fame. Chance died at his home in Wooster on October 11, 2015 at the
