Selee Joe Williams Elections to the Baseball Hall of Fame for 1999 followed 
the system in use since 1995. The Baseball Writers Association of America 
(BBWAA) voted by mail to select from recent major league players and elected 
three: George Brett, Nolan Ryan, and Robin Yount. The Veterans Committee 
met in closed sessions and selected four people from multiple classified 
ballots: Orlando Cepeda, Nestor Chylak, Frank Selee, and Joe Williams. 
Brett, Ryan, and Yount—the BBWAA class of 1999—were all newly eligible, 
as they all played their last games in 1993. It was the first time the 
writers elected more than two first-ballot candidates since the inaugural 
class of 1936 (five). Induction ceremonies in Cooperstown, New York, were 
held July 25 with George Grande as emcee. The BBWAA was authorized to elect 
players active in 1979 or later but not after 1993 (final game, 1979 to 
1993). There were 28 candidates, 17 returning from the 1998 ballot, where 
they received at least 5% support, and 11 on the ballot for the first time 
(†), chosen by a screening committee from players who last appeared in 
1993. All 10-year members of the BBWAA were eligible to participate by 
voting for as many as 10 candidates; any candidate receiving votes on at 
least 75% of the ballots returned would be honored with induction to the 
Hall. Results were announced on January 5, 1999. A total of 497 ballots 
were cast so 373 votes were required for election. A total of 3348 individual 
votes were cast, an average of 6.74 per ballot. Candidates who received 
less than 5% support, or 25 votes, would not appear on future BBWAA ballots 
(*). They were also eliminated from future consideration by the Veterans 
Committee of the time, but that possibility has been restored.[a] Three 
players were elected and 16 who last played during 1980–93 were forwarded 
to next year. Mickey Lolich and Minnie Miñoso were on the ballot for the 
15th and final time, although Miñoso's term as a candidate was not consecutive. 
The field of newly-eligible candidates, who played their last games during 
1993, included 19 All-Stars (ten on the ballot) with a total of 63 All-Star 
selections. Some of them were 13-time All-Star George Brett, 11-time All-Star 
Carlton Fisk, 8-time All-Star Nolan Ryan and 7-time All-Star Dale Murphy. 
There were two Most Valuable Players in the field (Brett, Murphy, Robin 
Yount and George Bell, of whom Murphy and Yount won two MVPs) and two Rookies 
of the Year (Fisk and Alfredo Griffin). The newly-eligible players who 
did not reach the ballot were Juan Agosto, Wally Backman, Steve Balboni, 
Randy Bush, Iván Calderón, Henry Cotto, Glenn Davis, Ken Dayley, Frank 
DiPino, Bill Doran, Dan Gladden, Alfredo Griffin, Kelly Gruber, Neal Heaton, 
Steve Lake, Terry Leach, Bob McClure, Gene Nelson, Pete O'Brien, Geno Petralli, 
Ted Power, John Russell, Bryn Smith, Tim Teufel, Dickie Thon, José Uribe, 
Bob Walk, Chico Walker, Curtis Wilkerson, Glenn Wilson, Curt Young, and 
Matt Young. The Veterans Committee met in closed sessions to elect as many 
as two executives, managers, umpires, and older major league players—the 
categories considered in all its meetings since 1953. The older players 
eligible were those with ten major league seasons beginning 1945 or earlier; 
those who received at least 100 votes from the BBWAA in some election up 
to 1990; and those who received at least 60% support in some election beginning 
1991. Players on Major League Baseball's ineligible list were also ineligible 
for election. By an arrangement since 1995 the committee separately considered 
candidates from the Negro Leagues and from the 19th century with authority 
to select one from each of those two special ballots. It elected four people, 
the maximum number permitted: first baseman Orlando Cepeda from the 1960s, 
umpire Nestor Chylak, pitcher Smokey Joe Williams from the Negro Leagues, 
and manager Frank Selee from the 19th century. Bob Stevens received the 
J. G. Taylor Spink Award honoring a baseball writer. (The award was voted 
at the December 1998 meeting of the BBWAA, dated 1998, and conferred in 
the summer 1999 ceremonies.) Arch McDonald received the Ford C. Frick Award
