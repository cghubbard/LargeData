Raymond Bloom "Rube" Bressler (October 23, 1894 – November 7, 1966) was 
an American left-handed pitcher in Major League Baseball for the Philadelphia 
Athletics from 1914 to 1916 and Cincinnati Reds from 1917 to 1920, before 
being converted to an outfielder and first baseman for Cincinnati from 
1918 to 1927, the Brooklyn Robins from 1928 to 1931 and the Philadelphia 
Phillies and St. Louis Cardinals in his final year of 1931. The first two 
teams he played for made it to a World Series, the 1914 Philadelphia Athletics 
lost to the miracle Boston Braves, while the 1919 Cincinnati Reds won against 
the scandal-tainted Chicago White Sox. Bressler was born in Coder, Pennsylvania 
and grew up in nearby Flemington, Pennsylvania. He played for a company 
team at Renovo, Pennsylvania where he worked in a railroad shop before 
being recruited by Earle Mack, son of Connie Mack after beating Earle's 
All-Stars in a local game in 1912. The following year, Bressler pitched 
for Harrisburg of the Tri-State League and, the year after that, was brought 
to the Philadelphia club as the newest player at the end of the famous 
1910–1914 dynasty. Bressler was assigned to room with future Hall of Fame 
pitcher Chief Bender when he made his big league debut April 24, 1914. 
He posted a respectable 10-4 record and 1.77 ERA for the 1914 American 
League champions, before dropping to a 4-17 record with a 5.20 ERA the 
following year. By 1916, he dropped to 0-2 with a 6.60 ERA and was sent 
down to the minor leagues. But with America's entry into World War I and 
a shortage of qualified professional baseball players, Cincinnati of the 
National League brought him back. His 8-5 record and 2.46 ERA in 1918 earned 
him two more seasons with the club as a pitcher. He finished his pitching 
career in 1920 with a lifetime record of 26-32, and a 3.40 ERA Though Bressler's 
career as a pitcher was short-lived, he would go on to play more than a 
decade as an outfielder and first baseman. In his first season as a position 
player in 1918, Bressler appeared in only three games off the pitcher's 
mound. He split the next two seasons before it became apparent he would 
serve the team better as a slick-fielding, good-hitting position player 
than as an injury-prone pitcher. From 1921 onward, Bressler became a full-time 
position player, never pitching another game in the major leagues. He finished 
his career with 1170 base hits, 586 RBI and a .301 batting average. In 
the final years of his life, Bressler was interviewed by writer Lawrence 
Ritter for Ritter's baseball classic The Glory of Their Times. Bressler 
died in Cincinnati at age 72, one of only a few players in major league 
baseball history to successfully convert from a pitcher to a position player. 
Bressler was inducted into the Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame in 1963. Bressler 
is one of six players since 1900 in the major leagues who started their 
careers as pitchers and ended up as position players while totaling more 
than 50 games pitched and 50 games played at other positions. The others 
include[1] Babe Ruth, Smoky Joe Wood, Johnny Cooney, Reb Russell, and Rick 
Ankiel. Lefty O'Doul was also famous for having switched from pitcher to 
position player, however, he pitched in only 34 games for 77 total innings
