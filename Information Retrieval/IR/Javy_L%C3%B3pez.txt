Javier Torres "Javy" Lopez (born November 5, 1970) is a Puerto Rican former 
catcher in Major League Baseball who played for the Atlanta Braves (1992–2003), 
Baltimore Orioles (2004–2006) and Boston Red Sox (2006). He batted and 
threw right-handed. He was named Ponce, Puerto Rico's Athlete of the Year 
from 1984 to 1987.[citation needed] López (birth name: Javier López Torres 
[note 1]) was signed by the Atlanta Braves in 1987 as an amateur free agent, 
López made his debut on September 18, 1992 against the Houston Astros. 
After sharing duties with Charlie O'Brien and Eddie Pérez for four seasons, 
he established himself as the Braves regular catcher in 1996. The same 
season, he led the Braves to win the National League Championship Series, 
earning the series Most Valuable Player honors. He also made the National 
League All-Star team from 1997–98. Lopez had his best season in 2003 with 
a .328 batting average, 43 home runs and 109 RBI in 129 games, including 
a .378 on-base percentage and a .687 slugging percentage. In that season 
he broke Todd Hundley's record for most home runs hit in a season by a 
catcher (41) and was selected to the All-Star Game, winning the Silver 
Slugger Award and finishing fifth in the National League MVP ballot. While 
with the Braves, López caught Kent Mercker's no-hitter on April 8, 1994.[1] 
Before the 2004 season López signed as a free agent with the Baltimore 
Orioles. He hit .316 with 86 RBI, and the following season hit .278 with 
49 RBI, while seeing a decline in his game time from 150 to 103 games. 
In the 2006 midseason he was acquired by the Boston Red Sox from Baltimore 
in exchange for minor league outfielder Adam Stern and cash consideration.[2] 
López debuted with Boston on the same day after Doug Mirabelli left the 
game early after an ankle injury. On September 8, the Red Sox released 
López due to Jason Varitek returning from the disabled list, which minimized 
his playing time. In January 2007, it was reported that López reached a 
preliminary agreement on a $750,000, one-year contract with the Colorado 
Rockies,[3] but he did not play for them during the regular season.[4] 
Before the 2008 season he signed a minor league deal with an invitation 
to spring training with the Atlanta Braves, in an attempt to return to 
the majors. But after being told he would not make the opening day lineup, 
López retired for good.[5] "I feel perfect physically", he said. "It's 
just that the hitting wasn't there and unfortunately I didn't throw the 
guy out on the stealing attempts. That's a concern. I don't blame them. 
My role as a backup catcher is to be able to throw every single runner 
out."[6] He plans to continue in the Atlanta Braves organization performing 
other duties. In a 15-season career, López posted a .287 average with 260 
home runs and 864 RBI in 1,503 games. His 243 home runs as a catcher ranks 
eighth on the career list at that position. His final game was on September 
2, 2006.[7] López married Analy Hernández. They had two children: Javier 
Alexander (born 11/6/95) and Kelvin Gabrielle (10/17/99). They divorced 
and López married his second wife Gina Brodbeck on June 23, 2004,[8] and
