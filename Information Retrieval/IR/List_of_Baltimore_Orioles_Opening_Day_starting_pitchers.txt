The Baltimore Orioles are a Major League Baseball (MLB) franchise based 
in Baltimore, Maryland. They play in the American League East division. 
The Orioles started playing in Baltimore in 1954, after moving from St. 
Louis, where they were known as the St. Louis Browns.[1] The first game 
of the new baseball season for a team is played on Opening Day, and being 
named the Opening Day starter is an honor, which is often given to the 
player who is expected to lead the pitching staff that season,[2] though 
there are various strategic reasons why a team's best pitcher might not 
start on Opening Day.[3] The Orioles have used 33 different Opening Day 
starting pitchers in their 60 seasons since moving to Baltimore. The 33 
starters have a combined Opening Day record of 22 wins, 18 losses and 17 
no decisions.[4][5][6][7] No decisions are only awarded to the starting 
pitcher if the game is won or lost after the starting pitcher has left 
the game.[8] The first Opening Day for the Orioles was played in Detroit 
against the Detroit Tigers on April 13, 1954.[5][9] Don Larsen was the 
Orioles' Opening Day starting pitcher that day, in a game the Orioles lost 
3–0.[5][9] Jim Palmer and Mike Mussina have made the most Opening Day starts 
for the Baltimore Orioles, with six apiece. Palmer has a record of five 
wins and one loss in his Opening Day starts, and Mussina has a record of 
three wins, two losses and one no decision. Dave McNally made five Opening 
Day starts for the Orioles, with a record of three wins and no losses. 
Other Oriole pitchers who have made multiple Opening Day starts are Steve 
Barber, Rodrigo López, and Jeremy Guthrie, with three apiece, and Milt 
Pappas, Dennis Martínez, Mike Flanagan, Mike Boddicker, and Rick Sutcliffe, 
with two apiece. Flanagan's two Opening Day starts occurred eight years 
apart, in 1978 and 1986.[4] Palmer has the most Opening Day wins for the 
Orioles, with five. McNally's record of three wins and no losses in Opening 
Day starts gave him a 1.000 winning percentage, the highest in Orioles 
history. Flanagan's record of no wins and two losses is the lowest winning 
percentage of any Orioles' Opening Day starting pitcher. Flanagan and Mussina 
are the only pitchers to have two losses for the Orioles in Opening Day 
starts.[4] The Orioles have played in two home ballparks. Memorial Stadium 
was their home park until 1991, and Camden Yards has been their home park 
since 1992. Orioles' Opening Day starting pitchers had a record of eight 
wins, eight losses and eight no decisions in 24 Opening Day starts in Memorial 
Stadium. They have a record of ten wins, four losses and two no decisions 
in 15 Opening Day starts at Camden Yards. This makes their aggregate record 
in Opening Day starts at home 18 wins, 12 losses and 10 no decisions. Their 
record in Opening Day starts on the road is four wins, six losses and seven 
no decisions, for an aggregate Opening Day record of 22 wins, 18 losses 
and 16 no decisions.[4][5][6][7][9][10][11] The Orioles played in the World 
Series in 1966, 1969, 1970, 1971, 1979 and 1983, winning in 1966, 1970 
and 1983.[12] Their Opening Day starting pitchers in those years were Steve 
Barber (1966), Dave McNally (1969, 1970 and 1971), Jim Palmer (1979) and
