Detroit (/dᵻˈtrɔɪt/[6]) is the most populous city in the U.S. state of 
Michigan, the fourth-largest city in the Midwest and the largest city on 
the United States–Canada border. It is the seat of Wayne County, the most 
populous county in the state. The municipality of Detroit had a 2015 estimated 
population of 677,116, making it the 21st-most populous city in the United 
States. The metropolitan area, known as Metro Detroit, is home to 4.3 million 
people and lies at the heart of the Great Lakes Megalopolis area, with 
around 60 million people.[7] Roughly one-half of Michigan's population 
lives in Metro Detroit alone.[4][8] The Detroit–Windsor area, a commercial 
link straddling the Canada–U.S. border, has a total population of about 
5.7 million.[9] Detroit is a major port on the Detroit River, a strait 
that connects the Great Lakes system to the Saint Lawrence Seaway. The 
Detroit Metropolitan Airport is among the most important hubs in the United 
States. The City of Detroit anchors the second-largest economic region 
in the Midwest, behind Chicago, and the thirteenth-largest in the United 
States.[10][11] Detroit and its neighboring Canadian city Windsor are connected 
through a tunnel and various bridges, with the Ambassador Bridge being 
the busiest international crossing in North America.[12] Detroit was founded 
on July 24, 1701 by the French explorer and adventurer Antoine de la Mothe 
Cadillac and a party of settlers. During the 19th century, it became an 
important industrial hub at the center of the Great Lakes region. With 
expansion of the American automobile industry in the early 20th century, 
the Detroit area emerged as a significant metropolitan region within the 
United States. The city became the fourth-largest in the country for a 
period. In the 1950s and 1960s, suburban expansion continued with construction 
of a regional freeway system. A great portion of Detroit's public transport 
was abandoned in favour of becoming an automotive city in the post-war 
period, which has gradually reversed since the 1970s. Due to industrial 
restructuring and loss of jobs in the auto industry, Detroit lost considerable 
population from the late 20th century to present. Between 2000 and 2010 
the city's population fell by 25 percent, changing its ranking from the 
nation's 10th-largest city to 18th.[13] In 2010, the city had a population 
of 713,777, more than a 60 percent drop from a peak population of over 
1.8 million at the 1950 census. This resulted from suburbanization, corruption, 
industrial restructuring and the decline of Detroit's auto industry.[4] 
In 2013, the state of Michigan declared a financial emergency for the city, 
which was successfully exited with all finances handed back to Detroit 
in December 2014.[14] Following the shift of population and jobs to its 
suburbs, other states or nations, the city has focused on becoming the 
metropolitan region's economic and cultural center. The erstwhile rapid 
growth of Detroit left a globally unique stock of architectural monuments 
and historic places of the first half of the 20th century, with many of 
them falling into disrepair or torn down since the 1960s. Conservation 
efforts managed to save many architectural pieces since the 2000s and allowed 
several large-scale revitalisations. Downtown Detroit has held an increased 
role as a cultural destination in the 21st century, with the restoration 
of several historic theatres and entertainment venues, highrise renovations, 
new sports stadiums, and a riverfront revitalization project. More recently, 
the population of Downtown Detroit, Midtown Detroit, and various other 
neighborhoods has increased. Some other neighborhoods remain distressed 
with abandonment of properties, partly revitalised by initiatives like 
Blight Busters, or renovated by new inhabitants for affordable housing 
and homesharing, like students and young entrepreneurs. The first Europeans 
did not penetrate into the region until French missionaries and traders 
worked their way around the hostile League of the Iroquois and other friendlier 
Iroquoian tribes to reach the straits of Detroit in the 1630s.[15] The 
north side of Lake Erie was held by the Huron and Neutral peoples until 
the 1650s, when the Iroquois pushed both and the Erie people away from 
the Lake and beaver rich feeder streams in Beaver Wars during the six years 
1649–1655.[15] By the 1670s, the war weakened Iroquois laid claim to virtually 
all of Northern Ohio and Lake country as far as the City as hunting grounds—even 
south to the Ohio River valley in northern Kentucky,[15] and had absorbed 
many other Iroquoian peoples by adoption, after defeating them in war.[15] 
For the next hundred years, virtually no British, colonial, or French action 
was contemplated without consultation with, or consideration of Iroquois' 
likely response.[15] In practice, the location was too far west of the 
Iroquois' center to prevent settlement and war on others poaching Beaver 
pelts. When French and Indian War evicted France from Canada, it partially 
opened the way for British citizens to migrate west, the Governors wanted 
a British population in the conquered territory, so the population began 
to surge. Furthermore, Britain had solicited countrymen to overshadow the 
French populous in the 1760s (See below and main article). British negotiations 
with the Iroquois would both prove critical and lead to a Crown policy 
limiting the west of the Alleghenies settlements below the Great Lakes— 
which gave many an American migrant-to-be a Casus belli for supporting 
the American Revolution. The 1798 raids and resultant 1799 decisive Sullivan 
Expedition reopened the Ohio Country to westward emigration, which began 
almost immediately, and by 1800 white settlers were pouring westwards into 
and past the city. The city was named by French colonists, referring to 
the Detroit River (French: le détroit du lac Érié, meaning the strait of 
Lake Erie), linking Lake Huron and Lake Erie; in the historical context, 
the strait included the St. Clair River, Lake St. Clair and the Detroit 
River.[17][18] On the shores of the strait, in 1701, the French officer 
Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac, along with fifty-one French people and French 
Canadians, founded a settlement called Fort Pontchartrain du Détroit, naming 
it after Louis Phélypeaux, comte de Pontchartrain, Minister of Marine under 
Louis XIV.[19] France offered free land to colonists to attract families 
to Detroit; when it reached a total population of 800 in 1765, it was the 
largest city between Montreal and New Orleans, both also French settlements.[20] 
By 1773, the population of Detroit was 1,400. By 1778, its population was 
up to 2,144 and it was the third-largest city in the Province of Quebec.[21] 
The region grew based on the lucrative fur trade, in which numerous Native 
American people had important roles. Detroit's city flag reflects its French 
colonial heritage. (See Flag of Detroit). Descendants of the earliest French 
and French Canadian settlers formed a cohesive community who gradually 
were replaced as the dominant population after more Anglo-American settlers 
came to the area in the early 19th century. Living along the shores of 
Lakes St. Clair, and south to Monroe and downriver suburbs, the French 
Canadians of Detroit, also known as Muskrat French, remain a subculture 
in the region today.[22][23] During the French and Indian War (1754–63), 
the North American front of the Seven Years' War between Britain and France, 
British troops gained control of the settlement in 1760. They shortened 
the name to Detroit. Several Native American tribes launched Pontiac's 
Rebellion (1763), and conducted a siege of Fort Detroit, but failed to 
capture it. In defeat, France ceded its territory in North America east 
of the Mississippi to Britain following the war. Following the American 
Revolutionary War and United States independence, Britain ceded Detroit 
along with other territory in the area under the Jay Treaty (1796), which 
established the northern border with Canada.[24] In 1805, fire destroyed 
most of the Detroit settlement, which consisted mostly of wooden buildings. 
A river warehouse and brick chimneys of the former wooden homes were the 
sole structures to survive.[25] From 1805 to 1847, Detroit was the capital 
of Michigan (first the territory, then the state). Detroit surrendered 
without a fight to British troops during the War of 1812 in the Siege of 
Detroit. The Battle of Frenchtown (January 18–23, 1813) was part of a United 
States effort to retake the city, and American troops suffered their highest 
fatalities of any battle in the war. This battle is commemorated at River 
Raisin National Battlefield Park south of Detroit in Monroe County. Detroit 
was finally recaptured by the United States later that year. It was incorporated 
as a city in 1815.[16] As the city expanded, a geometric street plan developed 
by Augustus B. Woodward was followed, featuring grand boulevards as in 
Paris. Prior to the American Civil War, the city's access to the Canada–US 
border made it a key stop for refugee slaves gaining freedom in the North 
along the Underground Railroad. Many went across the Detroit River to Canada 
to escape pursuit by slave catchers.[16] There were estimated to be 20,000 
to 30,000 African-American refugees who settled in Canada.[26] George DeBaptiste 
was considered to be the "president" of the Detroit Underground Railroad, 
William Lambert the "vice president" or "secretary" and Laura Haviland 
the "superintendent".[27] Numerous men from Detroit volunteered to fight 
for the Union during the American Civil War, including the 24th Michigan 
Infantry Regiment (part of the legendary Iron Brigade), which fought with 
distinction and suffered 82% casualties at the Battle of Gettysburg in 
1863. When the First Volunteer Infantry Regiment arrived to fortify Washington, 
DC, President Abraham Lincoln is quoted as saying "Thank God for Michigan!" 
George Armstrong Custer led the Michigan Brigade during the Civil War and 
called them the "Wolverines".[28] During the late 19th century, several 
Gilded Age mansions reflecting the wealth of industry and shipping magnates 
were built east and west of the current downtown, along the major avenues 
of the Woodward plan. Most notable among them was the David Whitney House 
located at 4421 Woodward Avenue, which became a prime location for mansions. 
During this period some referred to Detroit as the Paris of the West for 
its architecture, grand avenues in the Paris style, and for Washington 
Boulevard, recently electrified by Thomas Edison.[16] The city had grown 
steadily from the 1830s with the rise of shipping, shipbuilding, and manufacturing 
industries. Strategically located along the Great Lakes waterway, Detroit 
emerged as a major port and transportation hub. In 1896, a thriving carriage 
trade prompted Henry Ford to build his first automobile in a rented workshop 
on Mack Avenue. During this growth period, Detroit expanded its borders 
by annexing all or part of several surrounding villages and townships. 
In 1903, Henry Ford founded the Ford Motor Company. Ford's manufacturing—and 
those of automotive pioneers William C. Durant, the Dodge Brothers, Packard, 
and Walter Chrysler—established Detroit's status in the early 20th century 
as the world's automotive capital.[16] The growth of the auto industry 
was reflected by changes in businesses throughout the Midwest and nation, 
with the development of garages to service vehicles and gas stations, as 
well as factories for parts and tires. With the rapid growth of industrial 
workers in the auto factories, labor unions such as the American Federation 
of Labor and the United Auto Workers fought to organize workers to gain 
them better working conditions and wages. They initiated strikes and other 
tactics in support of improvements such as the 8-hour day/40-hour work 
week, increased wages, greater benefits and improved working conditions. 
The labor activism during those years increased influence of union leaders 
in the city such as Jimmy Hoffa of the Teamsters and Walter Reuther of 
the Autoworkers. The city became the 4th-largest in the nation in 1920, 
after only New York City, Chicago and Philadelphia, with the influence 
of the booming auto industry. The prohibition of alcohol from 1920 to 1933 
resulted in the Detroit River becoming a major conduit for smuggling of 
illegal Canadian spirits.[29] Detroit, like many places in the United States, 
developed racial conflict and discrimination in the 20th century following 
rapid demographic changes as hundreds of thousands of new workers were 
attracted to the industrial city; in a short period it became the 4th-largest 
city in the nation. The Great Migration brought rural blacks from the South; 
they were outnumbered by southern whites who also migrated to the city. 
Immigration brought southern and eastern Europeans of Catholic and Jewish 
faith; these new groups competed with native-born whites for jobs and housing 
in the booming city. Detroit was one of the major Midwest cities that was 
a site for the dramatic urban revival of the Ku Klux Klan beginning in 
1915. "By the 1920s the city had become a stronghold of the KKK," whose 
members opposed Catholic and Jewish immigrants, as well as black Americans.[30] 
The Black Legion, a secret vigilante group, was active in the Detroit area 
in the 1930s, when one-third of its estimated 20,000 to 30,000 members 
in Michigan were based in the city. It was defeated after numerous prosecutions 
following the kidnapping and murder in 1936 of Charles Poole, a Catholic 
Works Progress Administration organizer. A total of 49 men of the Black 
Legion were convicted of numerous crimes, with many sentenced to life in 
prison for murder. In the 1940s the world's "first urban depressed freeway" 
ever built, the Davison,[31] was constructed in Detroit. During World War 
II, the government encouraged retooling of the American automobile industry 
in support of the Allied powers, leading to Detroit's key role in the American 
Arsenal of Democracy.[32] Jobs expanded so rapidly that 400,000 people 
were attracted to the city from 1941 to 1943, including 50,000 blacks in 
the second wave of the Great Migration, and 350,000 whites, many of them 
from the South. Some European immigrants and their descendants feared black 
competition for jobs and housing. The federal government prohibited discrimination 
in defense work but when in June 1943, Packard promoted three blacks to 
work next to whites on its assembly lines, 25,000 whites walked off the 
job.[33] The Detroit race riot of 1943 took place three weeks after the 
Packard plant protest. Over the course of three days, 34 people were killed, 
of whom 25 were African American, and approximately 600 were injured, 75% 
black people.[30][34] Industrial mergers in the 1950s, especially in the 
automobile sector, increased oligopoly in the American auto industry. Detroit 
manufacturers such as Packard and Hudson merged into other companies and 
eventually disappeared. At its peak population of 1,849,568, in the 1950 
Census, the city was the 5th-largest in the United States, after New York 
City, Chicago, Philadelphia and Los Angeles. As in other major American 
cities in the postwar era, construction of an extensive highway and freeway 
system around Detroit and pent-up demand for new housing stimulated suburbanization; 
highways made commuting by car easier. In 1956, Detroit's last heavily 
used electric streetcar line along the length of Woodward Avenue was removed 
and replaced with gas-powered buses. It was the last line of what had once 
been a 534-mile network of electric streetcars. In 1941 at peak times, 
a streetcar ran on Woodward Avenue every 60 seconds.[35][36] All of these 
changes in the area's transportation system favored low-density, auto-oriented 
development rather than high-density urban development, and industry also 
moved to the suburbs. The metro Detroit area developed as one of the most 
sprawling job markets in the United States by the 21st century, and combined 
with poor public transport, resulted in many jobs beyond the reach of urban 
low-income workers.[37] In 1950, the city held about one-third of the state's 
population, anchored by its industries and workers. Over the next sixty 
years, the city's population declined to less than 10 percent of the state's 
population. During the same time period, the sprawling Detroit metropolitan 
area, which surrounds and includes the city, grew to contain more than 
half of Michigan's population.[16] The shift of population and jobs eroded 
Detroit's tax base. In June 1963, Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. gave a major 
speech in Detroit that foreshadowed his "I Have a Dream" speech in Washington, 
D.C. two months later. While the African-American Civil Rights Movement 
gained significant federal civil rights laws in 1964 and 1965, longstanding 
inequities resulted in confrontations between the police and inner city 
black youth wanting change. Longstanding tensions in Detroit culminated 
in the Twelfth Street riot in July 1967. Governor George W. Romney ordered 
the Michigan National Guard into Detroit, and President Johnson sent in 
U.S. Army troops. The result was 43 dead, 467 injured, over 7,200 arrests, 
and more than 2,000 buildings destroyed, mostly in black residential and 
business areas. Thousands of small businesses closed permanently or relocated 
to safer neighborhoods. The affected district lay in ruins for decades.[38] 
It was the most costly riot in the United States. On August 18, 1970, the 
NAACP filed suit against Michigan state officials, including Governor William 
Milliken, charging de facto public school segregation. The NAACP argued 
that although schools were not legally segregated, the city of Detroit 
and its surrounding counties had enacted policies to maintain racial segregation 
in public schools. The NAACP also suggested a direct relationship between 
unfair housing practices and educational segregation, which followed segregated 
neighborhoods.[39] The District Court held all levels of government accountable 
for the segregation in its ruling. The Sixth Circuit Court affirmed some 
of the decision, holding that it was the state's responsibility to integrate 
across the segregated metropolitan area.[40] The U.S. Supreme Court took 
up the case February 27, 1974.[39] The subsequent Milliken v. Bradley decision 
had wide national influence. In a narrow decision, the Court found that 
schools were a subject of local control and that suburbs could not be forced 
to solve problems in the city's school district. "Milliken was perhaps 
the greatest missed opportunity of that period," said Myron Orfield, professor 
of law at the University of Minnesota. "Had that gone the other way, it 
would have opened the door to fixing nearly all of Detroit's current problems."[41] 
John Mogk, a professor of law and an expert in urban planning at Wayne 
State University in Detroit, says, "Everybody thinks that it was the riots 
[in 1967] that caused the white families to leave. Some people were leaving 
at that time but, really, it was after Milliken that you saw mass flight 
to the suburbs. If the case had gone the other way, it is likely that Detroit 
would not have experienced the steep decline in its tax base that has occurred 
since then."[41] In November 1973, the city elected Coleman Young as its 
first black mayor. After taking office, Young emphasized increasing racial 
diversity in the police department.[42] Young also worked to improve Detroit's 
transportation system, but tension between Young and his suburban counterparts 
over regional matters was problematic throughout his mayoral term. In 1976, 
the federal government offered $600 million for building a regional rapid 
transit system, under a single regional authority.[43] But the inability 
of Detroit and its suburban neighbors to solve conflicts over transit planning 
resulted in the region losing the majority of funding for rapid transit. 
Following the failure to reach an agreement over the larger system, the 
City moved forward with construction of the elevated downtown circulator 
portion of the system, which became known as the Detroit People Mover.[44] 
The gasoline crises of 1973 and 1979 also affected Detroit and the U.S. 
auto industry. Buyers chose smaller, more fuel-efficient cars made by foreign 
makers as the price of gas rose. Efforts to revive the city were stymied 
by the struggles of the auto industry, as their sales and market share 
declined. Automakers laid off thousands of employees and closed plants 
in the city, further eroding the tax base. To counteract this, the city 
used eminent domain to build two large new auto assembly plants in the 
city.[45] As mayor, Young sought to revive the city by seeking to increase 
investment in the city's declining downtown. The Renaissance Center, a 
mixed-use office and retail complex, opened in 1977. This group of skyscrapers 
was an attempt to keep businesses in downtown.[16][46][47] Young also gave 
city support to other large developments to attract middle and upper-class 
residents back to the city. Despite the Renaissance Center and other projects, 
the downtown area continued to lose businesses to the automobile dependent 
suburbs. Major stores and hotels closed and many large office buildings 
went vacant. Young was criticized for being too focused on downtown development 
and not doing enough to lower the city's high crime rate and improve city 
services. Long a major population center and site of worldwide automobile 
manufacturing, Detroit has suffered a long economic decline produced by 
numerous factors.[48][49][50] Like many industrial American cities, Detroit 
reached its population peak in the 1950 census. The peak population was 
1.8 million people. Following suburbanization, industrial restructuring, 
and loss of jobs (as described above), by the 2010 census, the city had 
less than 40 percent of that number, with just over 700,000 residents. 
The city has declined in population in each census since 1950.[51][52] 
High unemployment was compounded by middle-class flight to the suburbs, 
and some residents leaving the state to find work. The city was left with 
a higher proportion of poor in its population, reduced tax base, depressed 
property values, abandoned buildings, abandoned neighborhoods, high crime 
rates and a pronounced demographic imbalance. In 1993 Young retired as 
Detroit's longest serving mayor, deciding not to seek a sixth term. That 
year the city elected Dennis Archer, a former Michigan Supreme Court justice. 
Archer prioritized downtown development and easing tensions with Detroit's 
suburban neighbors. A referendum to allow casino gambling in the city passed 
in 1996; several temporary casino facilities opened in 1999, and permanent 
downtown casinos with hotels opened in 2007–08.[53] Campus Martius, a reconfiguration 
of downtown's main intersection as a new park was opened in 2004. The park 
has been cited as one of the best public spaces in the United States.[54][55][56] 
The city's riverfront has been the focus of redevelopment, following successful 
examples of other older industrial cities. In 2001, the first portion of 
the International Riverfront was completed as a part of the city's 300th 
anniversary celebration, with miles of parks and associated landscaping 
completed in succeeding years. In 2011, the Port Authority Passenger Terminal 
opened with the riverwalk connecting Hart Plaza to the Renaissance Center.[47] 
Since 2006, $9 billion has been invested in downtown and surrounding neighborhoods; 
$5.2 billion of that has come in 2013 and 2014.[57] Construction activity, 
particularly rehabilitation of historic downtown buildings, has increased 
markedly. The number of vacant downtown buildings has dropped from nearly 
50 to around 13.[when?][58] Among the most notable redevelopment projects 
are the Book Cadillac Hotel and the Fort Shelby Hotel; the David Broderick 
Tower; and the David Whitney Building.[46] Little Caesars Arena, a new 
home for the Detroit Red Wings, with attached residential, hotel, and retail 
use is under construction and set to open in fall 2017.[59] The plans for 
the project call for mixed-use residential on the blocks surrounding the 
arena and the renovation of the vacant 14-story Eddystone Hotel. Detroit's 
protracted decline has resulted in severe urban decay and thousands of 
empty buildings around the city. Some parts of Detroit are so sparsely 
populated that the city has difficulty providing municipal services. The 
city has considered various solutions, such as demolishing abandoned homes 
and buildings; removing street lighting from large portions of the city; 
and encouraging the small population in certain areas to move to more populated 
locations.[60][61][62][63][64] Roughly half of the owners of Detroit's 
305,000 properties failed to pay their 2011 tax bills, resulting in about 
$246 million in taxes and fees going uncollected, nearly half of which 
was due to Detroit; the rest of the money would have been earmarked for 
Wayne County, Detroit Public Schools, and the library system.[65] In September 
2008, Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick (who had served for six years) resigned following 
felony convictions. In 2013, Kilpatrick was convicted on 24 federal felony 
counts, including mail fraud, wire fraud, and racketeering,[66] and was 
sentenced to 28 years in federal prison.[67] The former mayor's activities 
cost the city an estimated $20 million.[68] In 2013, felony bribery charges 
were brought against seven building inspectors.[69] In 2016, further corruption 
charges were brought against 12 principals, a former school superintendent 
and supply vendor[70] for a $12 million kickback scheme.[71][72] Law professor 
Peter Henning argues that Detroit's corruption is not unusual for a city 
its size, especially when compared with Chicago.[73] The city's financial 
crisis resulted in the state of Michigan taking over administrative control 
of its government.[74] The state governor declared a financial emergency 
in March 2013, appointing Kevyn Orr as emergency manager. On July 18, 2013, 
Detroit became the largest U.S. city to file for bankruptcy.[75] It was 
declared bankrupt by U.S. District Court on December 3, 2013, in light 
of the city's $18.5 billion debt and its inability to fully repay its thousands 
of creditors.[76] On November 7, 2014 the city's plan for exiting bankruptcy 
was approved. The following month on December 11 the city officially exited 
bankruptcy. The plan allowed the city to eliminate $7 billion in debt and 
invest $1.7 billion into improved city services.[77] One of the largest 
post bankruptcy efforts to improve city services has been work to fix the 
city's broken street lighting system. At one time it was estimated that 
40% of lights were not working. The plan calls for replacing outdated high 
pressure sodium lights with 65,000 LED lights. Construction began in late 
2014 and by the end of 2015 around 60,000 lights have been replaced. Work 
is scheduled to be complete by the end of 2016.[78] In the 2010s, several 
initiatives were taken by Detroit's citizens and new inhabitants to improve 
the cityscape by renovating and revitalising neighbourhoods. Such include 
the Motor City Blight Busters[79] and various urban gardening movements.[80] 
The well-known symbol of the city's decades-long demise, the Michigan Central 
Station, is renovated with new windows, elevators and facilities since 
2015.[81] Several other landmark buildings were fully renovated and transformed 
into condominiums, hotels, offices or for cultural uses. Detroit is mentioned 
as a city of carination and renaissance.[82] Detroit is the center of a 
three-county urban area (population 3,734,090, area of 1,337 square miles 
(3,460 km2), a 2010 United States Census) six-county metropolitan statistical 
area (2010 Census population of 4,296,250, area of 3,913 square miles [10,130 km2]), 
and a nine-county Combined Statistical Area (2010 Census population of 
5,218,852, area of 5,814 square miles [15,060 km2]).[5][8][83] According 
to the U.S. Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 142.87 square miles 
(370.03 km2), of which 138.75 square miles (359.36 km2) is land and 4.12 
square miles (10.67 km2) is water.[3] Detroit is the principal city in 
Metro Detroit and Southeast Michigan situated in the Midwestern United 
States and the Great Lakes region. The Detroit River International Wildlife 
Refuge is the only international wildlife preserve in North America, uniquely 
located in the heart of a major metropolitan area. The Refuge includes 
islands, coastal wetlands, marshes, shoals, and waterfront lands along 
48 miles (77 km) of the Detroit River and Western Lake Erie shoreline. 
The city slopes gently from the northwest to southeast on a till plain 
composed largely of glacial and lake clay. The most notable topographical 
feature in the city is the Detroit Moraine, a broad clay ridge on which 
the older portions of Detroit and Windsor sit atop, rising approximately 
62 feet (19 m) above the river at its highest point.[84] The highest elevation 
in the city is located directly north of Gorham Playground on the northwest 
side approximately three blocks south of 8 Mile Road, at a height of 675 
to 680 feet (206 to 207 m).[85] Detroit's lowest elevation is along the 
Detroit River, at a surface height of 572 feet (174 m).[86] Belle Isle 
Park is a 982-acre (1.534 sq mi; 397 ha) island park in the Detroit River, 
between Detroit and Windsor, Ontario. It is connected to the mainland by 
the MacArthur Bridge in Detroit. Belle Isle Park contains such attractions 
as the James Scott Memorial Fountain, the Belle Isle Conservatory, the 
Detroit Yacht Club on an adjacent island, a half-mile (800 m) beach, a 
golf course, a nature center, monuments, and gardens. The city skyline 
may be viewed from the island. Three road systems cross the city: the original 
French template, with avenues radiating from the waterfront; and true north–south 
roads based on the Northwest Ordinance township system. The city is north 
of Windsor, Ontario. Detroit is the only major city along the Canada–US 
border in which one travels south in order to cross into Canada. Detroit 
has four border crossings: the Ambassador Bridge and the Detroit–Windsor 
Tunnel provide motor vehicle thoroughfares, with the Michigan Central Railway 
Tunnel providing railroad access to and from Canada. The fourth border 
crossing is the Detroit–Windsor Truck Ferry, located near the Windsor Salt 
Mine and Zug Island. Near Zug Island, the southwest part of the city was 
developed over a 1,500-acre (610 ha) salt mine that is 1,100 feet (340 m) 
below the surface. The Detroit Salt Company mine has over 100 miles (160 km) 
of roads within.[87][88] Detroit and the rest of southeastern Michigan 
have a humid continental climate (Köppen Dfa) which is influenced by the 
Great Lakes; the city and close-in suburbs are part of USDA Hardiness zone 
6b, with farther-out northern and western suburbs generally falling in 
zone 6a.[90] Winters are cold, with moderate snowfall and temperatures 
not rising above freezing on an average 44 days annually, while dropping 
to or below 0 °F (−18 °C) on an average 4.4 days a year; summers are warm 
to hot with temperatures exceeding 90 °F (32 °C) on 12 days.[89] The warm 
season runs from May to September. The monthly daily mean temperature ranges 
from 25.6 °F (−3.6 °C) in January to 73.6 °F (23.1 °C) in July. Official 
temperature extremes range from 105 °F (41 °C) on July 24, 1934 down to 
−21 °F (−29 °C) on January 21, 1984; the record low maximum is −4 °F (−20 °C) 
on January 19, 1994, while, conversely the record high minimum is 80 °F 
(27 °C) on August 1, 2006, the most recent of five occurrences.[89] A decade 
or two may pass between readings of 100 °F (38 °C) or higher, which last 
occurred July 17, 2012. The average window for freezing temperatures is 
October 20 thru April 22, allowing a growing season of 180 days.[89] Precipitation 
is moderate and somewhat evenly distributed throughout the year, although 
the warmer months such as May and June average more, averaging 33.5 inches 
(850 mm) annually, but historically ranging from 20.49 in (520 mm) in 1963 
to 47.70 in (1,212 mm) in 2011.[89] Snowfall, which typically falls in 
measurable amounts between November 15 through April 4 (occasionally in 
October and very rarely in May),[89] averages 42.5 inches (108 cm) per 
season, although historically ranging from 11.5 in (29 cm) in 1881−82 to 
94.9 in (241 cm) in 2013−14.[89] A thick snowpack is not often seen, with 
an average of only 27.5 days with 3 in (7.6 cm) or more of snow cover.[89] 
Thunderstorms are frequent in the Detroit area. These usually occur during 
spring and summer.[91] Seen in panorama, Detroit's waterfront shows a variety 
of architectural styles. The post modern Neo-Gothic spires of the One Detroit 
Center (1993) were designed to blend with the city's Art Deco skyscrapers. 
Together with the Renaissance Center, they form a distinctive and recognizable 
skyline. Examples of the Art Deco style include the Guardian Building and 
Penobscot Building downtown, as well as the Fisher Building and Cadillac 
Place in the New Center area near Wayne State University. Among the city's 
prominent structures are United States' largest Fox Theatre, the Detroit 
Opera House, and the Detroit Institute of Arts.[94][95] While the Downtown 
and New Center areas contain high-rise buildings, the majority of the surrounding 
city consists of low-rise structures and single-family homes. Outside of 
the city's core, residential high-rises are found in upper-class neighborhoods 
such as the East Riverfront extending toward Grosse Pointe and the Palmer 
Park neighborhood just west of Woodward. The University Commons-Palmer 
Park district in northwest Detroit, near the University of Detroit Mercy 
and Marygrove College, anchors historic neighborhoods including Palmer 
Woods, Sherwood Forest, and the University District. The National Register 
of Historic Places lists several area neighborhoods and districts. Neighborhoods 
constructed prior to World War II feature the architecture of the times, 
with wood-frame and brick houses in the working-class neighborhoods, larger 
brick homes in middle-class neighborhoods, and ornate mansions in upper-class 
neighborhoods such as Brush Park, Woodbridge, Indian Village, Palmer Woods, 
Boston-Edison, and others. Some of the oldest neighborhoods are along the 
Woodward and East Jefferson corridors. Some newer residential construction 
may also be found along the Woodward corridor, the far west, and northeast. 
Some of the oldest extant neighborhoods include West Canfield and Brush 
Park, which have both seen multimillion-dollar restorations and construction 
of new homes and condominiums.[46][96] Many of the city's architecturally 
significant buildings have been listed on the National Register of Historic 
Places; the city has one of United States' largest surviving collections 
of late 19th- and early 20th-century buildings.[95] Architecturally significant 
churches and cathedrals in the city include St. Joseph's, Old St. Mary's, 
the Sweetest Heart of Mary, and the Cathedral of the Most Blessed Sacrament.[94] 
The city has substantial activity in urban design, historic preservation, 
and architecture.[97] A number of downtown redevelopment projects—of which 
Campus Martius Park is one of the most notable—have revitalized parts of 
the city. Grand Circus Park stands near the city's theater district, Ford 
Field, home of the Detroit Lions, and Comerica Park, home of the Detroit 
Tigers.[94] Other projects include the demolition of the Ford Auditorium 
off of Jefferson St. The Detroit International Riverfront includes a partially 
completed three-and-one-half mile riverfront promenade with a combination 
of parks, residential buildings, and commercial areas. It extends from 
Hart Plaza to the MacArthur Bridge accessing Belle Isle Park (the largest 
island park in a U.S. city). The riverfront includes Tri-Centennial State 
Park and Harbor, Michigan's first urban state park. The second phase is 
a two-mile (3 km) extension from Hart Plaza to the Ambassador Bridge for 
a total of five miles (8 km) of parkway from bridge to bridge. Civic planners 
envision that the pedestrian parks will stimulate residential redevelopment 
of riverfront properties condemned under eminent domain. Other major parks 
include River Rouge (in the southwest side), the largest park in Detroit; 
Palmer (north of Highland Park) and Chene Park (on the east river downtown).[98] 
Detroit has a variety of neighborhood types. The revitalized Downtown, 
Midtown, and New Center areas feature many historic buildings and are high 
density, while further out, particularly in the northeast and on the fringes,[99] 
high vacancy levels are problematic, for which a number of solutions have 
been proposed. In 2007, Downtown Detroit was recognized as a best city 
neighborhood in which to retire among the United States' largest metro 
areas by CNN Money Magazine editors.[100] Lafayette Park is a revitalized 
neighborhood on the city's east side, part of the Ludwig Mies van der Rohe 
residential district.[101] The 78-acre (32 ha) development was originally 
called the Gratiot Park. Planned by Mies van der Rohe, Ludwig Hilberseimer 
and Alfred Caldwell it includes a landscaped, 19-acre (7.7 ha) park with 
no through traffic, in which these and other low-rise apartment buildings 
are situated.[101] Immigrants have contributed to the city's neighborhood 
revitalization, especially in southwest Detroit.[102] Southwest Detroit 
has experienced a thriving economy in recent years, as evidenced by new 
housing, increased business openings and the recently opened Mexicantown 
International Welcome Center.[103] The city has numerous neighborhoods 
consisting of vacant properties resulting in low inhabited density in those 
areas, stretching city services and infrastructure. These neighborhoods 
are concentrated in the northeast and on the city's fringes.[99] A 2009 
parcel survey found about a quarter of residential lots in the city to 
be undeveloped or vacant, and about 10% of the city's housing to be unoccupied.[99][105][106] 
The survey also reported that most (86%) of the city's homes are in good 
condition with a minority (9%) in fair condition needing only minor repairs.[105][106][107][108] 
To deal with vacancy issues, the city has begun demolishing the derelict 
houses, razing 3,000 of the total 10,000 in 2010,[109] but the resulting 
low density creates a strain on the city's infrastructure. To remedy this, 
a number of solutions have been proposed including resident relocation 
from more sparsely populated neighborhoods and converting unused space 
to urban agricultural use, including Hantz Woodlands, though the city expects 
to be in the planning stages for up to another two years.[110][111] Public 
funding and private investment have also been made with promises to rehabilitate 
neighborhoods. In April 2008, the city announced a $300-million stimulus 
plan to create jobs and revitalize neighborhoods, financed by city bonds 
and paid for by earmarking about 15% of the wagering tax.[110] The city's 
working plans for neighborhood revitalizations include 7-Mile/Livernois, 
Brightmoor, East English Village, Grand River/Greenfield, North End, and 
Osborn.[110] Private organizations have pledged substantial funding to 
the efforts.[112][113] Additionally, the city has cleared a 1,200-acre 
(490 ha) section of land for large-scale neighborhood construction, which 
the city is calling the Far Eastside Plan.[114] In 2011, Mayor Dave Bing 
announced a plan to categorize neighborhoods by their needs and prioritize 
the most needed services for those neighborhoods.[115] In the 2010 United 
States Census, the city had 713,777 residents, ranking it the 18th most 
populous city in the United States.[4][51] Of the large shrinking cities 
of the United States, Detroit has had the most dramatic decline in population 
of the past 60 years (down 1,135,791) and the second largest percentage 
decline (down 61.4%, second only to St. Louis, Missouri's 62.7%). While 
the drop in Detroit's population has been ongoing since 1950, the most 
dramatic period was the significant 25% decline between the 2000 and 2010 
Census.[51] The population collapse has resulted in large numbers of abandoned 
homes and commercial buildings, and areas of the city hit hard by urban 
decay.[60][61][62][63][64] Detroit's 713,777 residents represent 269,445 
households, and 162,924 families residing in the city. The population density 
was 5,144.3 people per square mile (1,895/km²). There were 349,170 housing 
units at an average density of 2,516.5 units per square mile (971.6/km²). 
Housing density has declined. The city has demolished thousands of Detroit's 
abandoned houses, planting some areas and in others allowing the growth 
of urban prairie. Of the 269,445 households, 34.4% had children under the 
age of 18 living with them, 21.5% were married couples living together, 
31.4% had a female householder with no husband present, 39.5% were non-families, 
34.0% were made up of individuals, and 3.9% had someone living alone who 
is 65 years of age or older. Average household size was 2.59, and average 
family size was 3.36. There is a wide distribution of age in the city, 
with 31.1% under the age of 18, 9.7% from 18 to 24, 29.5% from 25 to 44, 
19.3% from 45 to 64, and 10.4% 65 years of age or older. The median age 
was 31 years. For every 100 females there were 89.1 males. For every 100 
females age 18 and over, there were 83.5 males. According to a 2014 study, 
67% of the population of the city identified themselves as Christians, 
with 49% professing attendance Protestant churches, and 16% professing 
Roman Catholic beliefs,[118][119] while 24% claim no religious affiliation. 
Other religions collectively make up about 8% of the population. The loss 
of industrial and working-class jobs in the city has resulted in high rates 
of poverty and associated problems.[120] From 2000 to 2009, the city's 
estimated median household income fell from $29,526 to $26,098.[121] As 
of 2010[update] the mean income of Detroit is below the overall U.S. average 
by several thousand dollars. Of every three Detroit residents, one lives 
in poverty. Luke Bergmann, author of Getting Ghost: Two Young Lives and 
the Struggle for the Soul of an American City, said in 2010, "Detroit is 
now one of the poorest big cities in the country."[122] In the 2010 American 
Community Survey, median household income in the city was $25,787, and 
the median income for a family was $31,011. The per capita income for the 
city was $14,118. 32.3% of families had income at or below the federally 
defined poverty level. Out of the total population, 53.6% of those under 
the age of 18 and 19.8% of those 65 and older had income at or below the 
federally defined poverty line. Oakland County in Metro Detroit, once rated 
amongst the wealthiest US counties per household, is no longer shown in 
the top 25 listing of Forbes magazine. But internal county statistical 
methods—based on measuring per capita income for counties with more than 
one million residents—show that Oakland is still within the top 12, slipping 
from the 4th-most affluent such county in the U.S. in 2004 to 11th-most 
affluent in 2009.[123][124][125] Detroit dominates Wayne County, which 
has an average household income of about $38,000, compared to Oakland County's 
$62,000.[126][127] The city's population increased more than sixfold during 
the first half of the 20th century, fed largely by an influx of European, 
Middle Eastern (Lebanese, Assyrian/Chaldean), and Southern migrants to 
work in the burgeoning automobile industry.[131] In 1940, Whites were 90.4% 
of the city's population.[129] Since 1950 the city has seen a major shift 
in its population to the suburbs. In 1910, fewer than 6,000 blacks called 
the city home;[132] in 1930 more than 120,000 blacks lived in Detroit.[133] 
The thousands of African Americans who came to Detroit were part of the 
Great Migration of the 20th century.[134] Detroit remains one of the most 
racially segregated cities in the United States.[135][136] From the 1940s 
to the 1970s a second wave of Blacks moved to Detroit to escape Jim Crow 
laws in the south and find jobs.[137] However, they soon found themselves 
excluded from white areas of the city—through violence, laws, and economic 
discrimination (e.g., redlining).[138] White residents attacked black homes: 
breaking windows, starting fires, and exploding bombs.[135][138] The pattern 
of segregation was later magnified by white migration to the suburbs.[136] 
One of the implications of racial segregation, which correlates with class 
segregation, may be overall worse health for some populations.[136][139] 
While Blacks/African-Americans comprised only 13 percent of Michigan's 
population in 2010, they made up nearly 82 percent of Detroit's population. 
The next largest population groups were Whites, at 10 percent, and Hispanics, 
at 6 percent.[140] According to the 2010 Census, segregation in Detroit 
has decreased in absolute and in relative terms. In the first decade of 
the 21st century, about two-thirds of the total black population in metropolitan 
area resided within the city limits of Detroit.[13][141] The number of 
integrated neighborhoods has increased from 100 in 2000 to 204 in 2010. 
The city has also moved down the ranking, from number one most segregated 
to number four.[142] A 2011 op-ed in The New York Times attributed the 
decreased segregation rating to the overall exodus from the city, cautioning 
that these areas may soon become more segregated. This pattern already 
happened in the 1970s, when apparent integration was actually a precursor 
to white flight and resegregation.[135] Over a 60-year period, white flight 
occurred in the city. According to an estimate of the Michigan Metropolitan 
Information Center, from 2008 to 2009 the percentage of non-Hispanic White 
residents increased from 8.4% to 13.3%. Some empty nesters and many younger 
White people moved into the city while many African Americans moved to 
the suburbs.[143] Detroit has a Mexican-American population. In the early 
20th century thousands of Mexicans came to Detroit to work in agricultural, 
automotive, and steel jobs. During the Mexican Repatriation of the 1930s 
many Mexicans in Detroit were willingly repatriated or forced to repatriate. 
By the 1940s the Mexican community began to settle what is now Mexicantown. 
The population significantly increased in the 1990s due to immigration 
from Jalisco. In 2010 Detroit had 48,679 Hispanics, including 36,452 Mexicans. 
The number of Hispanics was a 70% increase from the number in 1990.[144] 
After World War II, many people from Appalachia settled in Detroit. Appalachians 
formed communities and their children acquired southern accents.[145] Many 
Lithuanians settled in Detroit during the World War II era, especially 
on the city's Southwest side in the West Vernor area,[citation needed] 
where the renovated Lithuanian Hall reopened in 2006.[146][147] In 2001, 
103,000 Jews, or about 1.9% of the population, were living in the Detroit 
area, in both Detroit and Ann Arbor.[148] As of 2002, of all of the municipalities 
in the Wayne County-Oakland County-Macomb County area, Detroit had the 
second largest Asian population. As of that year Detroit's percentage of 
Asians was 1%, far lower than the 13.3% of Troy.[149] By 2000 Troy had 
the largest Asian American population in the tricounty area, surpassing 
Detroit.[150] As of 2002 there are four areas in Detroit with significant 
Asian and Asian American populations. Northeast Detroit has population 
of Hmong with a smaller group of Lao people. A portion of Detroit next 
to eastern Hamtramck includes Bangladeshi Americans, Indian Americans, 
and Pakistani Americans; nearly all of the Bangladeshi population in Detroit 
lives in that area. Many of those residents own small businesses or work 
in blue collar jobs, and the population in that area is mostly Muslim. 
The area north of Downtown Detroit; including the region around the Henry 
Ford Hospital, the Detroit Medical Center, and Wayne State University; 
has transient Asian national origin residents who are university students 
or hospital workers. Few of them have permanent residency after schooling 
ends. They are mostly Chinese and Indian but the population also includes 
Filipinos, Koreans, and Pakistanis. In Southwest Detroit and western Detroit 
there are smaller, scattered Asian communities including an area in the 
westside adjacent to Dearborn and Redford Township that has a mostly Indian 
Asian population, and a community of Vietnamese and Laotians in Southwest 
Detroit.[149] As of 2006[update] the city has one of the U.S.'s largest 
concentrations of Hmong Americans.[151] In 2006, the city had about 4,000 
Hmong and other Asian immigrant families. Most Hmong live east of Coleman 
Young Airport near Osborn High School. Hmong immigrant families generally 
have lower incomes than those of suburban Asian families.[152] Several 
major corporations are based in the city, including three Fortune 500 companies. 
The most heavily represented sectors are manufacturing (particularly automotive), 
finance, technology, and health care. The most significant companies based 
in Detroit include: General Motors, Quicken Loans, Ally Financial, Compuware, 
Shinola, American Axle, Little Caesars, DTE Energy, Lowe Campbell Ewald, 
Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan, and Rossetti Architects. About 80,500 
people work in downtown Detroit, comprising one-fifth of the city's employment 
base.[154][155] Aside from the numerous Detroit-based companies listed 
above, downtown contains large offices for Comerica, Chrysler, HP Enterprise, 
Deloitte, PricewaterhouseCoopers, KPMG, and Ernst & Young. Ford Motor Company 
is located in the adjacent city of Dearborn. Thousands more employees work 
in Midtown, north of the central business district. Midtown's anchors are 
the city's largest single employer Detroit Medical Center, Wayne State 
University, and the Henry Ford Health System in New Center. Midtown is 
also home to watchmaker Shinola and an array of small and startup companies. 
New Center bases TechTown, a research and business incubator hub that is 
part of the WSU system.[156] Like downtown and Corktown, Midtown also has 
a fast-growing retailing and restaurant scene. A number of the city's downtown 
employers are relatively new, as there has been a marked trend of companies 
moving from satellite suburbs around Metropolitan Detroit into the downtown 
core.[citation needed] Compuware completed its world headquarters in downtown 
in 2003. OnStar, Blue Cross Blue Shield, and HP Enterprise Services are 
located at the Renaissance Center. PricewaterhouseCoopers Plaza offices 
are adjacent to Ford Field, and Ernst & Young completed its office building 
at One Kennedy Square in 2006. Perhaps most prominently, in 2010, Quicken 
Loans, one of the largest mortgage lenders, relocated its world headquarters 
and 4,000 employees to downtown Detroit, consolidating its suburban offices.[157] 
In July 2012, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office opened its Elijah J. 
McCoy Satellite Office in the Rivertown/Warehouse District as its first 
location outside Washington, D.C.'s metropolitan area.[158] In April 2014, 
the Department of Labor reported the city's unemployment rate at 14.5%.[159] 
The city of Detroit and other private-public partnerships have attempted 
to catalyze the region's growth by facilitating the building and historical 
rehabilitation of residential high-rises in the downtown, creating a zone 
that offers many business tax incentives, creating recreational spaces 
such as the Detroit RiverWalk, Campus Martius Park, Dequindre Cut Greenway, 
and Green Alleys in Midtown. The city itself has cleared sections of land 
while retaining a number of historically significant vacant buildings in 
order to spur redevelopment;[160] though it has struggled with finances, 
the city issued bonds in 2008 to provide funding for ongoing work to demolish 
blighted properties.[110] Two years earlier, downtown reported $1.3 billion 
in restorations and new developments which increased the number of construction 
jobs in the city.[46] In the decade prior to 2006, downtown gained more 
than $15 billion in new investment from private and public sectors.[161] 
Despite the city's recent financial issues, many developers remain unfazed 
by Detroit's problems.[162] Midtown is one of the most successful areas 
within Detroit to have a residential occupancy rate of 96%.[163] Numerous 
developments have been recently completely or are in various stages of 
construction. These include the $82 million reconstruction of downtown's 
David Whitney Building (now an Aloft Hotel and luxury residences), the 
Woodward Garden Block Development in Midtown, the residential conversion 
of the David Broderick Tower in downtown, the rehabilitation of the Book 
Cadillac Hotel (now a Westin and luxury condos) and Fort Shelby Hotel (now 
Doubletree) also in downtown, and various smaller projects.[164] Downtown's 
population of young professionals is growing and retail is expanding.[165][166][167] 
A study in 2007 found out that Downtown's new residents are predominantly 
young professionals (57% are ages 25 to 34, 45% have bachelor's degrees, 
and 34% have a master's or professional degree),[154][165][168] a trend 
which has hastened over the last decade. John Varvatos is set to open a 
downtown store in 2015, and Restoration Hardware is rumored to be opening 
a store nearby.[169] On July 25, 2013, Meijer, a midwestern retail chain, 
opened its first supercenter store in Detroit,;[170] this was a 20 million 
dollar, 190,000-square-foot store in the northern portion of the city and 
it also is the centerpiece of a new 72 million dollar shopping center named 
Gateway Marketplace.[171] On June 11, 2015, Meijer opened its second supercenter 
store in the city.[172] On May 21, 2014, JPMorgan Chase announced that 
it was injecting $100 million over five years into Detroit's economy, providing 
development funding for a variety of projects that would increase employment. 
It is the largest commitment made to any one city by the nation's biggest 
bank.[citation needed] Of the $100 million, $50 million will go toward 
development projects, $25 million will go toward city blight removal, $12.5 
million will go for job training, $7 million will go for small businesses 
in the city, and $5.5 million will go toward the M-1 light rail project 
(Qline).[173] On May 19, 2015, JPMorgan Chase announced that it has invested 
$32 million for two redevelopment projects in the city's Capitol Park district, 
the Capitol Park Lofts (the former Capitol Park Building) and the Detroit 
Savings Bank building at 1212 Griswold. Those investments are separate 
from Chase's five-year, $100-million commitment.[174] In the central portions 
of Detroit, the population of young professionals, artists, and other transplants 
is growing and retail is expanding.[165][166] This dynamic is luring additional 
new residents, and former residents returning from other cities, to the 
city's Downtown along with the revitalized Midtown and New Center areas.[154][165][166][168] 
A desire to be closer to the urban scene has also attracted some young 
professionals to reside in inner ring suburbs such as Grosse Pointe and 
Royal Oak, Michigan.[175] Detroit's proximity to Windsor, Ontario, provides 
for views and nightlife, along with Ontario's minimum drinking age of 19.[176] 
A 2011 study by Walk Score recognized Detroit for its above average walkability 
among large U.S. cities.[177] About two-thirds of suburban residents occasionally 
dine and attend cultural events or take in professional games in the city 
of Detroit.[178] Known as the world's automotive center,[179] "Detroit" 
is a metonym for that industry.[180] Detroit's auto industry, some of which 
was converted to wartime defense production, was an important element of 
the American "Arsenal of Democracy" supporting the Allied powers during 
World War II.[181] It is an important source of popular music legacies 
celebrated by the city's two familiar nicknames, the Motor City and Motown.[182] 
Other nicknames arose in the 20th century, including City of Champions, 
beginning in the 1930s for its successes in individual and team sport;[183] 
The D; Hockeytown (a trademark owned by the city's NHL club, the Red Wings); 
Rock City (after the Kiss song "Detroit Rock City"); and The 313 (its telephone 
area code).[184][185] Live music has been a prominent feature of Detroit's 
nightlife since the late 1940s, bringing the city recognition under the 
nickname 'Motown'.[186] The metropolitan area has many nationally prominent 
live music venues. Concerts hosted by Live Nation perform throughout the 
Detroit area. Large concerts are held at DTE Energy Music Theatre and The 
Palace of Auburn Hills. The city's theatre venue circuit is the United 
States' second largest and hosts Broadway performances.[187][188] The city 
of Detroit has a rich musical heritage and has contributed to a number 
of different genres over the decades leading into the new millennium.[185] 
Important music events in the city include: the Detroit International Jazz 
Festival, the Detroit Electronic Music Festival, the Motor City Music Conference 
(MC2), the Urban Organic Music Conference, the Concert of Colors, and the 
hip-hop Summer Jamz festival.[185] In the 1940s, Detroit blues artist John 
Lee Hooker became a long-term resident in the city's southwest Delray neighborhood. 
Hooker, among other important blues musicians migrated from his home in 
Mississippi bringing the Delta blues to northern cities like Detroit. Hooker 
recorded for Fortune Records, the biggest pre-Motown blues/soul label. 
During the 1950s, the city became a center for jazz, with stars performing 
in the Black Bottom neighborhood.[16] Prominent emerging Jazz musicians 
of the 1960s included: trumpet player Donald Byrd who attended Cass Tech 
and performed with Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers early in his career 
and Saxophonist Pepper Adams who enjoyed a solo career and accompanied 
Byrd on several albums. The Graystone International Jazz Museum documents 
jazz in Detroit.[189] Other, prominent Motor City R&B stars in the 1950s 
and early 1960s was Nolan Strong, Andre Williams and Nathaniel Mayer – 
who all scored local and national hits on the Fortune Records label. According 
to Smokey Robinson, Strong was a primary influence on his voice as a teenager. 
The Fortune label was a family-operated label located on Third Avenue in 
Detroit, and was owned by the husband and wife team of Jack Brown and Devora 
Brown. Fortune, which also released country, gospel and rockabilly LPs 
and 45s, laid the groundwork for Motown, which became Detroit's most legendary 
record label.[190] Berry Gordy, Jr. founded Motown Records which rose to 
prominence during the 1960s and early 1970s with acts such as Stevie Wonder, 
The Temptations, The Four Tops, Smokey Robinson & The Miracles, Diana Ross 
& The Supremes, the Jackson 5, Martha and the Vandellas, The Spinners, 
Gladys Knight & the Pips, The Marvelettes, The Elgins, The Monitors, The 
Velvelettes and Marvin Gaye. Artists were backed by in-house vocalists 
[191]The Andantes and The Funk Brothers, the Motown house band that was 
featured in Paul Justman's 2002 documentary film Standing in the Shadows 
of Motown, based on Allan Slutsky's book of the same name. The Motown Sound 
played an important role in the crossover appeal with popular music, since 
it was the first African American owned record label to primarily feature 
African-American artists. Gordy moved Motown to Los Angeles in 1972 to 
pursue film production, but the company has since returned to Detroit. 
Aretha Franklin, another Detroit R&B star, carried the Motown Sound; however, 
she did not record with Berry's Motown Label.[185] Local artists and bands 
rose to prominence in the 1960s and 70s including: the MC5, The Stooges, 
Bob Seger, Amboy Dukes featuring Ted Nugent, Mitch Ryder and The Detroit 
Wheels, Rare Earth, Alice Cooper, and Suzi Quatro. The group Kiss emphasized 
the city's connection with rock in the song Detroit Rock City and the movie 
produced in 1999. In the 1980s, Detroit was an important center of the 
hardcore punk rock underground with many nationally known bands coming 
out of the city and its suburbs, such as The Necros, The Meatmen, and Negative 
Approach.[190] In the 1990s and the new millennium, the city has produced 
a number of influential hip hop artists, including Eminem, the hip-hop 
artist with the highest cumulative sales, hip-hop producer J Dilla, rapper 
and producer Esham and hip hop duo Insane Clown Posse. The city is also 
home to rappers Big Sean and Danny Brown. The band Sponge toured and produced 
music, with artists such as Kid Rock and Uncle Kracker.[185][190] The city 
also has an active garage rock genre that has generated national attention 
with acts such as: The White Stripes, The Von Bondies, The Detroit Cobras, 
The Dirtbombs, Electric Six, and The Hard Lessons.[185] Detroit is cited 
as the birthplace of techno music in the early 1980s.[192] The city also 
lends its name to an early and pioneering genre of electronic dance music, 
"Detroit techno". Featuring science fiction imagery and robotic themes, 
its futuristic style was greatly influenced by the geography of Detroit's 
urban decline and its industrial past.[16] Prominent Detroit techno artists 
include Juan Atkins, Derrick May, Kevin Saunderson, and Jeff Mills. The 
Detroit Electronic Music Festival, now known as "Movement", occurs annually 
in late May on Memorial Day Weekend, and takes place in Hart Plaza. In 
the early years (2000-2002), this was a landmark event, boasting over a 
million estimated attendees annually, coming from all over the world to 
celebrate Techno music in the city of its birth. Major theaters in Detroit 
include the Fox Theatre (5,174 seats), Music Hall (1,770 seats), the Gem 
Theatre (451 seats), Masonic Temple Theatre (4,404 seats), the Detroit 
Opera House (2,765 seats), the Fisher Theatre (2,089 seats), The Fillmore 
Detroit (2,200 seats), Saint Andrew's Hall, the Majestic Theater, and Orchestra 
Hall (2,286 seats) which hosts the renowned Detroit Symphony Orchestra. 
The Nederlander Organization, the largest controller of Broadway productions 
in New York City, originated with the purchase of the Detroit Opera House 
in 1922 by the Nederlander family.[185] Motown Motion Picture Studios with 
535,000 square feet (49,700 m2) produces movies in Detroit and the surrounding 
area based at the Pontiac Centerpoint Business Campus for a film industry 
expected to employ over 4,000 people in the metro area.[193] Many of the 
area's prominent museums are located in the historic cultural center neighborhood 
around Wayne State University and the College for Creative Studies. These 
museums include the Detroit Institute of Arts, the Detroit Historical Museum, 
Charles H. Wright Museum of African American History, the Detroit Science 
Center, as well as the main branch of the Detroit Public Library. Other 
cultural highlights include Motown Historical Museum, the Ford Piquette 
Avenue Plant museum (birthplace of the Ford Model T and the world's oldest 
car factory building open to the public), the Pewabic Pottery studio and 
school, the Tuskegee Airmen Museum, Fort Wayne, the Dossin Great Lakes 
Museum, the Museum of Contemporary Art Detroit (MOCAD), the Contemporary 
Art Institute of Detroit (CAID), and the Belle Isle Conservatory. In 2010, 
the G.R. N'Namdi Gallery opened in a 16,000-square-foot (1,500 m2) complex 
in Midtown. Important history of America and the Detroit area are exhibited 
at The Henry Ford in Dearborn, the United States' largest indoor-outdoor 
museum complex.[194] The Detroit Historical Society provides information 
about tours of area churches, skyscrapers, and mansions. Inside Detroit, 
meanwhile, hosts tours, educational programming, and a downtown welcome 
center. Other sites of interest are the Detroit Zoo in Royal Oak, the Cranbrook 
Art Museum in Bloomfield Hills, the Anna Scripps Whitcomb Conservatory 
on Belle Isle, and Walter P. Chrysler Museum in Auburn Hills.[94] The city's 
Greektown and three downtown casino resort hotels serve as part of an entertainment 
hub. The Eastern Market farmer's distribution center is the largest open-air 
flowerbed market in the United States and has more than 150 foods and specialty 
businesses.[195] On Saturdays, about 45,000 people shop the city's historic 
Eastern Market.[196] The Midtown and the New Center area are centered on 
Wayne State University and Henry Ford Hospital. Midtown has about 50,000 
residents and attracts millions of visitors each year to its museums and 
cultural centers;[197] for example, the Detroit Festival of the Arts in 
Midtown draws about 350,000 people.[197] Annual summer events include the 
Electronic Music Festival, International Jazz Festival, the Woodward Dream 
Cruise, the African World Festival, the country music Hoedown, Noel Night, 
and Dally in the Alley. Within downtown, Campus Martius Park hosts large 
events, including the annual Motown Winter Blast. As the world's traditional 
automotive center, the city hosts the North American International Auto 
Show. Held since 1924, America's Thanksgiving Parade is one of the nation's 
largest.[198] River Days, a five-day summer festival on the International 
Riverfront lead up to the Windsor–Detroit International Freedom Festival 
fireworks, which draw super sized-crowds ranging from hundreds of thousands 
to over three million people.[178][185][199] An important civic sculpture 
in Detroit is "The Spirit of Detroit" by Marshall Fredericks at the Coleman 
Young Municipal Center. The image is often used as a symbol of Detroit 
and the statue itself is occasionally dressed in sports jerseys to celebrate 
when a Detroit team is doing well.[200] A memorial to Joe Louis at the 
intersection of Jefferson and Woodward Avenues was dedicated on October 
16, 1986. The sculpture, commissioned by Sports Illustrated and executed 
by Robert Graham, is a 24-foot (7.3 m) long arm with a fisted hand suspended 
by a pyramidal framework.[201] Artist Tyree Guyton created the controversial 
street art exhibit known as the Heidelberg Project in 1986, using found 
objects including cars, clothing and shoes found in the neighborhood near 
and on Heidelberg Street on the near East Side of Detroit.[185] Guyton 
continues to work with neighborhood residents and tourists in constantly 
evolving the neighborhood-wide art installation. Detroit is one of 13 American 
metropolitan areas that are home to professional teams representing the 
four major sports in North America. All these teams but one play within 
the city of Detroit itself (the NBA's Detroit Pistons play in suburban 
Auburn Hills at The Palace of Auburn Hills). There are three active major 
sports venues within the city: Comerica Park (home of the Major League 
Baseball team Detroit Tigers), Ford Field (home of the NFL's Detroit Lions), 
and Joe Louis Arena (home of the NHL's Detroit Red Wings). A 1996 marketing 
campaign promoted the nickname "Hockeytown".[185] The Detroit Tigers have 
won four World Series titles. The Detroit Red Wings have won 11 Stanley 
Cups (the most by an American NHL franchise).[202] The Detroit Pistons 
have won three NBA titles.[185] With the Pistons' first of three NBA titles 
in 1989, the city of Detroit has won titles in all four of the major professional 
sports leagues. Two new downtown stadiums for the Detroit Tigers and Detroit 
Lions opened in 2000 and 2002, respectively, returning the Lions to the 
city proper. In college sports, Detroit's central location within the Mid-American 
Conference has made it a frequent site for the league's championship events. 
While the MAC Basketball Tournament moved permanently to Cleveland starting 
in 2000, the MAC Football Championship Game has been played at Ford Field 
in Detroit since 2004, and annually attracts 25,000 to 30,000 fans. The 
University of Detroit Mercy has a NCAA Division I program, and Wayne State 
University has both NCAA Division I and II programs. The NCAA football 
Little Caesars Pizza Bowl is held at Ford Field each December. The local 
soccer team is called the Detroit City Football Club and was founded in 
2012. The team plays in the National Premier Soccer League, and its nickname 
is Le Rouge.[203] The city hosted the 2005 MLB All-Star Game, 2006 Super 
Bowl XL, 2006 and 2012 World Series, WrestleMania 23 in 2007, and the NCAA 
Final Four in April 2009. The city hosted the Detroit Indy Grand Prix on 
Belle Isle Park from 1989 to 2001, 2007 to 2008, and 2012 and beyond. In 
2007, open-wheel racing returned to Belle Isle with both Indy Racing League 
and American Le Mans Series Racing.[204] In the years following the mid-1930s, 
Detroit was referred to as the "City of Champions" after the Tigers, Lions, 
and Red Wings captured all three major professional sports championships 
in a seven-month period of time (the Tigers won the World Series in October 
1935; the Lions won the NFL championship in December 1935; the Red Wings 
won the Stanley Cup in April 1936).[183] In 1932, Eddie "The Midnight Express" 
Tolan from Detroit won the 100- and 200-meter races and two gold medals 
at the 1932 Summer Olympics. Joe Louis won the heavyweight championship 
of the world in 1937. Detroit has made the most bids to host the Summer 
Olympics without ever being awarded the games: seven unsuccessful bids 
for the 1944, 1952, 1956, 1960, 1964, 1968 and 1972 games.[185] The city 
is governed pursuant to the Home Rule Charter of the City of Detroit. The 
city government is run by a mayor and a nine-member city council and clerk 
elected on an at-large nonpartisan ballot. Since voters approved the city's 
charter in 1974, Detroit has had a "strong mayoral" system, with the mayor 
approving departmental appointments. The council approves budgets but the 
mayor is not obligated to adhere to any earmarking. City ordinances and 
substantially large contracts must be approved by the council.[205] The 
Detroit City Code is the codification of Detroit's local ordinances. The 
city clerk supervises elections and is formally charged with the maintenance 
of municipal records. Municipal elections for mayor, city council and city 
clerk are held at four-year intervals, in the year after presidential elections.[205] 
Following a November 2009 referendum, seven council members will be elected 
from districts beginning in 2013 while two will continue to be elected 
at-large.[206] Detroit's courts are state-administered and elections are 
nonpartisan. The Probate Court for Wayne County is located in the Coleman 
A. Young Municipal Center in downtown Detroit. The Circuit Court is located 
across Gratiot Avenue in the Frank Murphy Hall of Justice, in downtown 
Detroit. The city is home to the Thirty-Sixth District Court, as well as 
the First District of the Michigan Court of Appeals and the United States 
District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan. The city provides 
law enforcement through the Detroit Police Department and emergency services 
through the Detroit Fire Department. Detroit has struggled with high crime 
for decades. Detroit held the title of murder capital between 1985-1987 
with a murder rate around 58 per 100,000.[207] Crime has since decreased 
and, in 2014, the murder rate was 43.4 per 100,000, lower than in St. Louis, 
Missouri.[208] Although the murder rate increased by 6% during the first 
half of 2015, it was surpassed by St Louis and Baltimore which saw much 
greater spikes in violence.[209][210] At year-end 2015, Detroit had 295 
criminal homicides, down slightly from 299 in 2014.[211] Nearly two-thirds 
of all murders in Michigan in 2011 occurred in Detroit.[212] Although the 
rate of violent crime dropped 11 percent in 2008,[213] violent crime in 
Detroit has not declined as much as the national average from 2007 to 2011.[214] 
The violent crime rate is one of the highest in the United States. Neighborhoodscout.com 
reported a crime rate of 62.18 per 1,000 residents for property crimes, 
and 16.73 per 1,000 for violent crimes (compared to national figures of 
32 per 1,000 for property crimes and 5 per 1,000 for violent crime in 2008).[215] 
The city's downtown typically has lower crime than national and state averages.[216] 
According to a 2007 analysis, Detroit officials note that about 65 to 70 
percent of homicides in the city were drug related,[217] with the rate 
of unsolved murders roughly 70%.[120] Areas of the city closer to the Detroit 
River are also patrolled by the United States Border Patrol. In 2012, crime 
in the city was among the reasons for more expensive car insurance.[218] 
Beginning with its incorporation in 1802, Detroit has had a total of 74 
mayors. Detroit's last mayor from the Republican Party was Louis Miriani, 
who served from 1957 to 1962. In 1973, the city elected its first black 
mayor, Coleman Young. Despite development efforts, his combative style 
during his five terms in office was not well received by many suburban 
residents.[220] Mayor Dennis Archer, a former Michigan Supreme Court Justice, 
refocused the city's attention on redevelopment with a plan to permit three 
casinos downtown. By 2008, three major casino resort hotels established 
operations in the city. In 2000, the city requested an investigation by 
the United States Justice Department into the Detroit Police Department 
which was concluded in 2003 over allegations regarding its use of force 
and civil rights violations. The city proceeded with a major reorganization 
of the Detroit Police Department.[221] In March 2013, Governor Rick Snyder 
declared a financial emergency in the city, stating that the city has a 
$327 million budget deficit and faces more than $14 billion in long-term 
debt. It has been making ends meet on a month-to-month basis with the help 
of bond money held in a state escrow account and has instituted mandatory 
unpaid days off for many city workers. Those troubles, along with underfunded 
city services, such as police and fire departments, and ineffective turnaround 
plans from Bing and the City Council[222] led the state of Michigan to 
appoint an emergency manager for Detroit on March 14, 2013. On June 14, 
2013 Detroit defaulted on $2.5 billion of debt by withholding $39.7 million 
in interest payments, while Emergency Manager Kevyn Orr met with bondholders 
and other creditors in an attempt to restructure the city's $18.5 billion 
debt and avoid bankruptcy.[223] On July 18, 2013, the City of Detroit filed 
for Chapter 9 bankruptcy protection.[224][225] It was declared bankrupt 
by U.S. judge Stephen Rhodes on December 3, with its $18.5 billion debt 
he said in accepting the city's contention that it is broke and that negotiations 
with its thousands of creditors were infeasible.[76] Detroit is home to 
several institutions of higher learning including Wayne State University, 
a national research university with medical and law schools in the Midtown 
area offering hundreds of academic degrees and programs. The University 
of Detroit Mercy, located in Northwest Detroit in the University District, 
is a prominent Roman Catholic co-educational university affiliated with 
the Society of Jesus (the Jesuits) and the Sisters of Mercy. The University 
of Detroit Mercy offers more than a hundred academic degrees and programs 
of study including business, dentistry, law, engineering, architecture, 
nursing and allied health professions. The University of Detroit Mercy 
School of Law is located Downtown across from the Renaissance Center. Sacred 
Heart Major Seminary, originally founded in 1919, is affiliated with Pontifical 
University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, Angelicum in Rome and offers pontifical 
degrees as well as civil undergraduate and graduate degrees. Sacred Heart 
Major Seminary offers a variety of academic programs for both clerical 
and lay students. Other institutions in the city include the College for 
Creative Studies, Lewis College of Business, Marygrove College and Wayne 
County Community College. In June 2009, the Michigan State University College 
of Osteopathic Medicine which is based in East Lansing opened a satellite 
campus located at the Detroit Medical Center. The University of Michigan 
was established in 1817 in Detroit and later moved to Ann Arbor in 1837. 
In 1959, University of Michigan–Dearborn was established in neighboring 
Dearborn. With about 66,000 public school students (2011–12), the Detroit 
Public Schools (DPS) district is the largest school district in Michigan. 
Detroit has an additional 56,000 charter school students for a combined 
enrollment of about 122,000 students.[226][227] As of 2009[update] there 
are about as many students in charter schools as there are in district 
schools.[228] In 1999, the Michigan Legislature removed the locally elected 
board of education amid allegations of mismanagement and replaced it with 
a reform board appointed by the mayor and governor. The elected board of 
education was re-established following a city referendum in 2005. The first 
election of the new 11-member board of education occurred on November 8, 
2005.[229] Due to growing Detroit charter schools enrollment as well as 
a continued exodus of population, the city planned to close many public 
schools.[226] State officials report a 68% graduation rate for Detroit's 
public schools adjusted for those who change schools.[230][231] Public 
and charter school students in the city have performed poorly on standardized 
tests. While Detroit public schools scored a record low on national tests, 
the publicly funded charter schools did even worse than the public schools.[232][233] 
Detroit is served by various private schools, as well as parochial Roman 
Catholic schools operated by the Archdiocese of Detroit. As of 2013[update] 
there are four Catholic grade schools and three Catholic high schools in 
the City of Detroit, with all of them in the city's west side.[234] The 
Archdiocese of Detroit lists a number of primary and secondary schools 
in the metro area as Catholic education has emigrated to the suburbs.[235][236] 
Of the three Catholic high schools in the city, two are operated by the 
Society of Jesus and the third is co-sponsored by the Sisters, Servants 
of the Immaculate Heart of Mary and the Congregation of St. Basil.[237][238] 
In the 1964-1965 school year there were about 110 Catholic grade schools 
in Detroit, Hamtramck, and Highland Park and 55 Catholic high schools in 
those three cities. The Catholic school population in Detroit has decreased 
due to the increase of charter schools, increasing tuition at Catholic 
schools, the small number of African-American Catholics, White Catholics 
moving to suburbs, and the decreased number of teaching nuns.[234] The 
Detroit Free Press and The Detroit News are the major daily newspapers, 
both broadsheet publications published together under a joint operating 
agreement called the Detroit Newspaper Partnership. Media philanthropy 
includes the Detroit Free Press high school journalism program and the 
Old Newsboys' Goodfellow Fund of Detroit.[239] In March 2009, the two newspapers 
reduced home delivery to three days a week, print reduced newsstand issues 
of the papers on non-delivery days and focus resources on Internet-based 
news delivery.[240] The Metro Times, founded in 1980, is a weekly publication, 
covering news, arts & entertainment.[241] Also founded in 1935 and based 
in Detroit the Michigan Chronicle is one of the oldest and most respected 
African-American weekly newspapers in America. Covering politics, entertainment, 
sports and community events.[242] The Detroit television market is the 
11th largest in the United States;[243] according to estimates that do 
not include audiences located in large areas of Ontario, Canada (Windsor 
and its surrounding area on broadcast and cable TV, as well as several 
other cable markets in Ontario, such as the city of Ottawa) which receive 
and watch Detroit television stations.[243] Detroit has the 11th largest 
radio market in the United States,[244] though this ranking does not take 
into account Canadian audiences.[244] Nearby Canadian stations such as 
Windsor's CKLW (whose jingles formerly proclaimed "CKLW-the Motor City") 
are popular in Detroit. Hardcore Pawn, an American documentary reality 
television series produced for truTV, features the day-to-day operations 
of American Jewelry and Loan, a family-owned pawn shop on Greenfield Road. 
Within the city of Detroit, there are over a dozen major hospitals which 
include the Detroit Medical Center (DMC), Henry Ford Health System, St. 
John Health System, and the John D. Dingell VA Medical Center. The DMC, 
a regional Level I trauma center, consists of Detroit Receiving Hospital 
and University Health Center, Children's Hospital of Michigan, Harper University 
Hospital, Hutzel Women's Hospital, Kresge Eye Institute, Rehabilitation 
Institute of Michigan, Sinai-Grace Hospital, and the Karmanos Cancer Institute. 
The DMC has more than 2,000 licensed beds and 3,000 affiliated physicians. 
It is the largest private employer in the City of Detroit.[245] The center 
is staffed by physicians from the Wayne State University School of Medicine, 
the largest single-campus medical school in the United States, and the 
United States' fourth largest medical school overall.[245] Detroit Medical 
Center formally became a part of Vanguard Health Systems on December 30, 
2010, as a for profit corporation. Vanguard has agreed to invest nearly 
$1.5 B in the Detroit Medical Center complex which will include $417 M 
to retire debts, at least $350 M in capital expenditures and an additional 
$500 M for new capital investment.[246][247] Vanguard has agreed to assume 
all debts and pension obligations.[246] The metro area has many other hospitals 
including William Beaumont Hospital, St. Joseph's, and University of Michigan 
Medical Center. In 2011, Detroit Medical Center and Henry Ford Health System 
substantially increased investments in medical research facilities and 
hospitals in the city's Midtown and New Center.[246][248] In 2012, two 
major construction projects were begun in New Center, the Henry Ford Health 
System started the first phase of a $500 million, 300-acre revitalization 
project, with the construction of a new $30 million, 275,000-square-foot, 
Medical Distribution Center for Cardinal Health, Inc. [249][250] and Wayne 
State University started construction on a new $93 million, 207,000-square-foot, 
Integrative Biosciences Center (IBio).[251][252] As many as 500 researchers, 
and staff will work out of the IBio Center. [253] With its proximity to 
Canada and its facilities, ports, major highways, rail connections and 
international airports, Detroit is an important transportation hub. The 
city has three international border crossings, the Ambassador Bridge, Detroit–Windsor 
Tunnel and Michigan Central Railway Tunnel, linking Detroit to Windsor, 
Ontario. The Ambassador Bridge is the single busiest border crossing in 
North America, carrying 27% of the total trade between the U.S. and Canada.[254] 
On February 18, 2015, Canadian Transport Minister Lisa Raitt announced 
that Canada has agreed to pay the entire cost to build a $250 million U.S. 
Customs plaza adjacent to the planned new Detroit–Windsor bridge, now the 
Gordie Howe International Bridge. Canada had already planned to pay for 
95 per cent of the bridge, which will cost $2.1 billion, and is expected 
to open in 2020. "This allows Canada and Michigan to move the project forward 
immediately to its next steps which include further design work and property 
acquisition on the U.S. side of the border," Raitt said in a statement 
issued after she spoke in the House of Commons. [255] Mass transit in the 
region is provided by bus services. The Detroit Department of Transportation 
(DDOT) provides service to the outer edges of the city. From there, the 
Suburban Mobility Authority for Regional Transportation (SMART) provides 
service to the suburbs. Cross border service between the downtown areas 
of Windsor and Detroit is provided by Transit Windsor via the Tunnel Bus.[256] 
An elevated rail system known as the People Mover, completed in 1987, provides 
daily service around a 2.94 miles (4.73 km) loop downtown. The QLINE, which 
is expected to open in mid-2017, will serve as a link between the Detroit 
People Mover and Detroit Amtrak station via Woodward Avenue.[257] The SEMCOG 
Commuter Rail line will extend from Detroit's New Center, connecting to 
Ann Arbor via Dearborn, Wayne, and Ypsilanti when it is opened.[258] The 
Regional Transit Authority (RTA) was established by an act of the Michigan 
legislature in December 2012 to oversee and coordinate all existing regional 
mass transit operations, and to develop new transit services in the region. 
The RTA's first project was the introduction of RelfeX, a limited-stop, 
cross-county bus service connecting downtown and midtown Detroit with Oakland 
and Macomb counties via Woodward and Gratiot avenues.[259] Amtrak provides 
service to Detroit, operating its Wolverine service between Chicago and 
Pontiac. The Amtrak station is located in New Center north of downtown. 
The J. W. Westcott II, which delivers mail to lake freighters on the Detroit 
River, is the world's only floating post office.[260] Detroit Metropolitan 
Wayne County Airport (DTW), the principal airport serving Detroit, is located 
in nearby Romulus. DTW is a primary hub for Delta Air Lines (following 
its acquisition of Northwest Airlines), and a secondary hub for Spirit 
Airlines. Coleman A. Young International Airport (DET), previously called 
Detroit City Airport, is on Detroit's northeast side; the airport now maintains 
only charter service and general aviation.[261] Willow Run Airport, in 
far-western Wayne County near Ypsilanti, is a general aviation and cargo 
airport. Metro Detroit has an extensive toll-free network of freeways administered 
by the Michigan Department of Transportation. Four major Interstate Highways 
surround the city. Detroit is connected via Interstate 75 (I-75) and I-96 
to Kings Highway 401 and to major Southern Ontario cities such as London, 
Ontario and the Greater Toronto Area. I-75 (Chrysler and Fisher freeways) 
is the region's main north–south route, serving Flint, Pontiac, Troy, and 
Detroit, before continuing south (as the Detroit–Toledo and Seaway Freeways) 
to serve many of the communities along the shore of Lake Erie.[262] I-94 
(Edsel Ford Freeway) runs east–west through Detroit and serves Ann Arbor 
to the west (where it continues to Chicago) and Port Huron to the northeast. 
The stretch of the current I-94 freeway from Ypsilanti to Detroit was one 
of America's earlier limited-access highways. Henry Ford built it to link 
the factories at Willow Run and Dearborn during World War II. A portion 
was known as the Willow Run Expressway. The I-96 freeway runs northwest–southeast 
through Livingston, Oakland and Wayne counties and (as the Jeffries Freeway 
through Wayne County) has its eastern terminus in downtown Detroit.[262] 
I-275 runs north–south from I-75 in the south to the junction of I-96 and 
I-696 in the north, providing a bypass through the western suburbs of Detroit. 
I-375 is a short spur route in downtown Detroit, an extension of the Chrysler 
Freeway. I-696 (Reuther Freeway) runs east–west from the junction of I-96 
and I-275, providing a route through the northern suburbs of Detroit. Taken 
together, I-275 and I-696 form a semicircle around Detroit. Michigan state 
highways designated with the letter M serve to connect major freeways.[262] 
Detroit has seven sister cities, as designated by Sister Cities International:
