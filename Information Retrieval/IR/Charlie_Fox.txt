Charles Francis Fox (October 7, 1921 – February 16, 2004) was an American 
manager, general manager, scout, coach—and, briefly, a catcher—in Major 
League Baseball. As manager of the National League West Division champion 
San Francisco Giants in 1971, he was named "Manager of the Year" by The 
Sporting News. Born in New York City, Fox appeared in only three games 
as a Major League player—garnering three hits in seven at bats for a career 
batting average of .429—with the 1942 New York Giants. But Fox would spend 
another 33 years in that organization as a minor league catcher and manager 
and as a manager, scout and coach for the Giants, who relocated to San 
Francisco in 1958. Fox spent eight years as manager of the Giants' Class 
C St. Cloud Rox team in the Northern League, scouted from 1957 to 1963, 
then managed the Giants' Triple-A Tacoma affiliate of the Pacific Coast 
League in 1964 before coming to the Major Leagues as a San Francisco coach 
under Herman Franks in 1965. He returned to the PCL to pilot the Giants' 
Phoenix affiliate in 1969–70 until he was summoned to San Francisco on 
May 24, 1970 to replace Clyde King as the manager of the MLB Giants. Fox 
led the Giants to the NL West title in 1971, losing to the eventual world 
champion Pittsburgh Pirates in the National League Championship Series. 
Subsequently, the Giants made a series of bad trades and fell from contention 
thereafter. On June 27, 1974, after compiling a record of 348–327 (.516), 
Fox was replaced as manager by former stalwart Giants catcher Wes Westrum. 
In 1976, he joined the front office of the Montreal Expos as a special 
assignment scout and served as the club's emergency manager when Karl Kuehl 
was fired September 4. After winning only 12 of 34 games to close out the 
season, Fox was named the club's general manager and was succeeded on the 
field by Dick Williams. He held the GM title in Montreal through the 1978 
season. Fox, however, was destined to serve another term as an interim 
manager. In 1983, while working as a special assistant to Chicago Cubs 
general manager Dallas Green, Fox took over from embattled skipper Lee 
Elia on August 22 and managed the Cubs for the final 39 games of the season, 
winning 17 and losing 22. In 1984, he was replaced by Jim Frey. He later 
coached under Green in 1989 with the New York Yankees, and scouted for 
the Houston Astros. Fox's career major league managing record was 377–371
