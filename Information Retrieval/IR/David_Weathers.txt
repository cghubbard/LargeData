John David Weathers (born September 25, 1969) is a former Major League 
Baseball pitcher. He was a part of the New York Yankees' 1996 World Series 
championship over the Atlanta Braves. He bats and throws right-handed. 
Weathers attended Motlow State Community College in Moore County, Tennessee 
and was drafted by the Toronto Blue Jays in the 3rd round of the 1988 Major 
League Baseball Draft. Weathers made his Major League debut with the Blue 
Jays on August 2, 1991, and was drafted by the Florida Marlins in the 1992 
Major League Baseball expansion draft. Weathers played for the Marlins 
until 1996, when he was traded to the New York Yankees for Mark Hutton. 
Weathers won a World Series ring with the Yankees that year. On December 
20, 1997, he was claimed off waivers by the Cincinnati Reds. On June 24, 
1998, Weathers was claimed off waivers by the Milwaukee Brewers. Weathers 
stayed with Milwaukee until July 30, 2001, when he was traded to the Chicago 
Cubs, along with Robert Miniel, for Ruben Quevedo and Pete Zoccolillo. 
He became a free agent at the end of the season and signed with the New 
York Mets. Weathers pitched for the Mets until June 17, 2004, when he and 
Jeremy Griffiths were traded to the Houston Astros for Richard Hidalgo. 
Weathers was released by the Astros on September 7, 2004, and signed with 
the Marlins the very next day. A free agent at the end of the season, Weathers 
signed with the Cincinnati Reds (returning to the team he played for in 
early 1998), where he has had an ERA under 4.00 every year that he was 
with the club. He was the closer for the Reds in 2007 and had 33 saves. 
On August 9, 2009, the Cincinnati Reds traded Weathers to the Milwaukee 
Brewers for a player to be named later. Weathers was quoted as saying of 
Cincinnati, "I really felt like this is probably where I would end my career, 
and I really wanted to. But in this game, things don't go like you want 
them or how you plan them. It's a good day but, to be honest with you, 
it's a tough day emotionally because you form a lot of bonds, a lot of 
trust with guys you've been with for five or six years. You just don't 
find that every day, especially in this game."[1] Weathers played 25 more 
games with the Brewers before playing in his final Major League game on
