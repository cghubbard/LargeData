As player As manager As coach Robert Ralph Skinner (born October 3, 1931) 
is a retired American outfielder-first baseman, manager, coach and scout 
in Major League Baseball. Skinner spent over 50 years in the game. Bob 
Skinner, a left-handed hitter who threw right-handed, played most of his 
career with the Pittsburgh Pirates (1954; 1956–63). He spent his last 3½ 
years as a pinch hitter and backup outfielder for the Cincinnati Reds (1963–64) 
and St. Louis Cardinals (1964–66). During his best season, 1962 with the 
Pirates, he batted .302 and hit 20 home runs. Over his 12-year career, 
he batted .277 with 103 homers. Skinner played for two World Series champions 
in two tries. Although he hit only .200 for Pittsburgh as a regular during 
the 1960 World Series, as a pinch hitter for St. Louis during the 1964 
World Series, Skinner hit safely in two of three at-bats for a .667 average. 
In 1967, Skinner retired from playing and became manager of his hometown 
team, the San Diego Padres of the Triple-A Pacific Coast League, the top 
farm club of the Philadelphia Phillies. He led San Diego to an 85–63 record 
and the 1967 PCL championship, winning Minor League Manager of the Year 
honors from The Sporting News. In 1968, he began the year at San Diego 
but was soon called to the Phillies to replace Gene Mauch as manager with 
the Phils in fifth place with a record of 27–27. It was a disastrous move 
for the Phils; under Skinner, the team plunged to eighth place, with a 
48–59 record, and when they performed even worse in 1969, at 44–64, and 
in fifth place in the new NL East Division, Skinner was replaced by his 
third-base coach, George Myatt. He remained in the game, however, as a 
coach for the National League Padres, who came into being in 1969, Pirates, 
California Angels and Atlanta Braves. He also managed the Houston Astros' 
Tucson Toros PCL franchise from 1989–92 before becoming a Houston scout. 
His career record as a manager, including a one-game interim stint with 
the 1977 Padres, was 93–123 (.431). In 1976, Skinner was also inducted 
by the San Diego Hall of Champions into the Breitbard Hall of Fame honoring 
San Diego's finest athletes both on and off the playing surface.[1] Skinner
