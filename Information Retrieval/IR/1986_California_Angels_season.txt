The California Angels' 1986 season was the franchise's 26th season and 
ended with the Angels losing the American League Championship Series in 
dramatic fashion. The regular season ended with the Angels finishing 1st 
in the American League West with a record of 92-70, earning the franchise's 
third division title. After jumping to a 3-1 series lead over the Boston 
Red Sox in the best-of-seven ALCS, the Angels blew a 3-run lead in the 
9th inning of Game 5 that included giving up a two-out, two-strike home 
run to Boston's Dave Henderson (in other words, the Angels were 1 strike 
away from the World Series). The Angels went on to lose Game 5 in extra 
innings, and eventually lost the next two games and the series. After 1986, 
the Angels went into a lengthy playoff drought, not returning to the postseason 
until their championship season of 2002 (though they did come close in 
1995). They would not win a division title again until 2004. [1] [2] [3]
