As player As coach William Richard "Bill" Mueller (/ˈmɪlər/;[1] born March 
17, 1971) is an American retired professional baseball third baseman who 
formerly served as the first base coach for the St. Louis Cardinals of 
Major League Baseball (MLB). Mueller's MLB playing career was spent with 
the San Francisco Giants (1996–2000, 2002), Chicago Cubs (2001–2002), Boston 
Red Sox (2003–2005), and Los Angeles Dodgers (2006). A number of Mueller's 
accomplishments came during the 2003 season, when he won the American League 
batting title and a Silver Slugger Award. A switch hitter, he became the 
only player in major league history to hit one grand slam from both sides 
of the plate in the same game on July 29, 2003. He was the starting third 
baseman for the Red Sox' 2004 World Series championship team. He throws 
right-handed. Since his playing career, he has served in MLB as a front 
office assistant and hitting coach. Mueller was born in Maryland Heights, 
Missouri and attended De Smet Jesuit High School and Southwest Missouri 
State University. He was drafted by the San Francisco Giants in the 15th 
round of the 1993 MLB draft. Mueller made his professional debut with the 
Giants low A team, the Everett Giants, in 1993 and quickly rose through 
the Giants farm system, with stops in San Jose, Shreveport, and Phoenix 
before making his major league debut with the Giants as a pinch hitter 
on April 18, 1996 against the Chicago Cubs. He got his first career hit 
the following day, also as a pinch hitter, against Terry Adams. He played 
third base for the Giants fairly regularly for five seasons, until he was 
traded to the Chicago Cubs before the 2001 season for pitcher Tim Worrell. 
(Given that Mueller had by then settled into the Bay Area year-round, the 
Giants, out of respect for Mueller, delayed the trade several days so that 
Mueller could attend the Cal-Stanford football game one last time as a 
local star.[2]) He returned to San Francisco in September 2002 in a trade 
for pitcher Jeff Verplancke. Before the 2003 season, Mueller was signed 
by the Boston Red Sox as a free agent. In his first year in Boston, he 
won the American League batting title with a .326 average. He also set 
career highs in the power department that season, belting out 45 doubles 
and 19 home runs. He had never previously hit more than 10 home runs or 
29 doubles in any season. He contributed nearly half of his career home 
runs during his three years with the Red Sox. Mueller developed a reputation 
for consistency throughout the major leagues. In fact, for five of his 
ten years in the major leagues, his batting average was between .290 and 
.295. His minor league numbers were very much the same, consistently between 
.290 and .310. Mueller joined the Los Angeles Dodgers for the 2006 season 
and was reunited with Nomar Garciaparra, but played only 32 games before 
undergoing his third knee surgery, which would prove to be career-ending. 
Doctors have ruled out all known procedures to repair the deteriorating 
condition in his right knee.[3] On November 17, 2006, the Dodgers announced 
that Mueller was retiring from baseball and had been hired as a special 
assistant to the GM.[4] On June 15, 2007, Mueller was named Los Angeles 
Dodgers interim hitting coach when Eddie Murray was fired. After a month 
on the job, manager Grady Little announced that the Dodgers would be removing 
the "interim" tag and that Mueller would remain the teams's hitting coach 
through the end of the season.[5] After the season, it was announced that 
Mueller would be giving up his role as hitting coach to return to a front 
office position.[6] Mueller served as a special assistant to General Manager 
Ned Colletti through the 2012 season, when he left that position to become 
a full-time scout.[7] On November 22, 2013, Mueller was named hitting coach 
of the Chicago Cubs under new manager Rick Renteria. On October 7, 2014, 
he subsequently resigned that position, a week after his assistant, Mike 
Brumley, was dismissed by the Cubs.[8] On November 17, 2014, Cardinals 
GM John Mozeliak announced "We have an upcoming deal with Billy Mueller."
