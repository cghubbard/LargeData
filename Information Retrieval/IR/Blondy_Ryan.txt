John Collins "Blondy" Ryan (January 4, 1906 – November 28, 1959) was an 
American shortstop in Major League Baseball who is remembered primarily 
for his fielding and his starring for the New York Giants' 1933 World Series 
winners. Born in Lynn, Massachusetts, Ryan graduated from Holy Cross in 
1930, where he established himself as an outstanding two-sport athlete 
for the Crusaders. In 1926, as a member of the football team, Ryan tossed 
two touchdown passes to Hymie Shanahan against Harvard in a 19-14 HC victory. 
It was, however, in baseball where Ryan gained the most fame, as he was 
the star shortstop on Crusader teams that won the Eastern Intercollegiate 
Championship in 1929 and 1930. The team posted a 45-5-1 record in those 
years. Ryan was inducted into the Holy Cross Varsity Club Hall of Fame 
posthumously in 1964. After college graduation, Ryan signed with the Chicago 
White Sox and hit a home run in his first time at bat at Comiskey Park. 
In 87 at bats, however, Ryan batted only .207 that year and showed little 
of the fielding range that later became his hallmark. In 1932, he was traded 
to the Giants for Doc Marshall. The Giants won the World Series in 1933 
and Ryan, batting .238 in 146 games, finished ninth in National League 
MVP voting. An AP piece appearing in the New York Herald Journal January 
28, 1934, celebrating the signing of Ryan's contract for that year said, 
"Ryan, only 26 years old and not long out of Holy Cross, was a sensation 
in his first full year as a major leaguer. He not only plugged the hole 
at shortstop left by Jackson, but had much to do with instilling a conviction 
they could win the pennant. Typical of this inspiration was the telegram 
he sent to (Giants’ manager Bill) Terry, at a time when the team was in 
a bad slump in the West, Ryan out of the game with a spike wound. The telegram 
said, ‘They cannot beat us. En route. J.C. Ryan.’" The next year he was 
at his best. Ryan's fielding range factor was 0.47 above the league average. 
He had 125 hits, batting .242 in 110 games. But the Giants traded him in 
a four-player deal to get All-Star shortstop Dick Bartell. Ryan did not 
sustain the form he had shown in 1934, however. After a respectable 1935 
season in backup roles for the Philadelphia Phillies and New York Yankees, 
he did not play in 1936 but spent 1937 and 1938 back with the Giants. After 
his Major League career ended in 1938, Ryan joined the Navy and served 
in World War II with Naval Intelligence. He later married and raised a 
family in Swampscott, Massachusetts, where, in 1959, he died at age 53.
