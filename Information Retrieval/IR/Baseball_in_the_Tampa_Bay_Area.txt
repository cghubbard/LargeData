Baseball in the Tampa Bay Area, both amateur and professional, has had 
a long and storied history, even though the Tampa Bay Rays are one of the 
two youngest franchises in Major League Baseball. In 1913, the Chicago 
Cubs moved their spring training site to the city of Tampa. St. Petersburg 
soon followed, becoming a spring training host for the first time in 1914 
when the St. Louis Browns came to town. Since 1914, more Major League spring 
training games have been played in St. Petersburg than any other city. 
*Note: In 1951, the New York Giants, whose normal spring training site 
was in Phoenix, Arizona, swapped locations with the New York Yankees so 
Yankees' co-owner Del Webb could oversee both his team and a growing real 
estate business concurrently. The teams returned to their typical training 
sites in 1952. Tampa has hosted spring training for seven teams: the Boston 
Red Sox, Chicago Cubs, Chicago White Sox, Cincinnati Reds, Detroit Tigers, 
Washington Senators, and the New York Yankees, who currently call Tampa 
their spring training home. Dunedin has been the only spring training home 
to the Toronto Blue Jays since the franchise's inception. The Tampa Bay 
area has had a long association with minor league baseball. The first modern 
example was the 1919 Tampa Smokers, a charter member of the original Class 
D Florida State League (FSL). The expansion St. Petersburg Saints joined 
the FSL in 1920. After the Smokers folded in 1954, the Tampa Tarpons played 
in the FSL from 1957 until 1989. Tampa, St. Petersburg, and other nearby 
communities also fielded teams in a variety of defunct minor leagues, including 
the Florida International League, the Florida State Negro League, and the 
short-lived Florida West Coast League. The Tampa Bay area is currently 
home to several teams in the Florida State League (which is now a Class-A 
Advanced circuit), including the Tampa Yankees, the Clearwater Threshers, 
the Dunedin Blue Jays, the Bradenton Marauders, and the Lakeland Flying 
Tigers. Several major league organizations also field squads in the rookie-level 
Gulf Coast League and the Florida Instructional League. Besides hosting 
actual baseball games, the corporate offices of Minor League Baseball have 
been located in St. Petersburg since 1973.[2] St. Petersburg was the home 
of the St. Petersburg Pelicans in the short-lived Senior Professional Baseball 
Association in 1989–1990. The league featured former major league players 
who were age 35 or older. The Pelicans won the only league championship. 
Several notable ballplayers have come from the college and university baseball 
programs in the Tampa Bay Area. Players and managers have reached the Major 
Leagues from the University of South Florida, University of Tampa, St. 
Petersburg College and Eckerd College. Other schools in the area with baseball 
programs include Pasco-Hernando Community College, Saint Leo University, 
Hillsborough Community College, and Clearwater Christian College The University 
of Tampa Spartans baseball program has won six Division II national championships: 
1992, 1993, 1998, 2006, 2007, and 2013.[3] Amateur baseball also has a 
long tradition in the Tampa Bay area. This tradition began in the ballfields 
of Ybor City and West Tampa, two neighborhoods originally founded in the 
late 1800s by immigrants from Cuba, Spain, and Italy. The neighborhoods 
were home to many social clubs, many of which sponsored highly competitive 
teams that inspired much local support. Today, high school and AAU baseball 
in the area is very competitive, with many players drafted out of high 
school into the major leagues every year. Little League Baseball teams 
from the area have excelled in the Little League World Series, finishing 
as Runners-Up in the 1948, 1975, 1980 & 1981 Little League World Series 
tournaments.[4] Tampa Bay area teams have won the state Little League tournament 
in 1967, 1969–1975, 1977, 1980–1981, 1988–1991, 1994, 2006, 2008, 2011, 
and 2012.[5] In addition, local teams have won Junior League championships 
in 1982, 1985, 2004, and 2011.[6] Little League Baseball's headquarters 
for the Southern Region was located in Gulfport until 2009. Al López, the 
first area native to play and manage in the major leagues and the first 
to be enshrined in the Baseball Hall of Fame, came out of the leagues of 
Ybor City in the early 20th century. Since then, many current and former 
major league players and managers such as Lou Piniella, Fred McGriff, Gary 
Sheffield, Tino Martinez, Luis Gonzalez, Dwight Gooden, Howard Johnson, 
Brad Radke, Craig Lefferts, Tony La Russa, Matt Joyce, Chone Figgins, Ryan 
Raburn and Hall of Famer Wade Boggs (among many others) have gotten their 
start on local baseball programs around the area. The Tampa Baseball Museum 
is scheduled to open in Tampa's Ybor City in 2014. It aims to explain and 
celebrate the Tampa Bay area's rich baseball history with memorabilia and 
exhibits. The museum building was once the childhood home of Al López, 
which was moved to its present location across the street from the Ybor
