Wade Allen Davis (born September 7, 1985) is an American professional baseball 
pitcher for the Kansas City Royals of Major League Baseball. From 2009 
through 2012, he played for the Tampa Bay Rays. Born and raised in the 
small town of Lake Wales, Florida, Davis attended Lake Wales High School. 
After high school, Davis originally committed to attend the University 
of Florida, but later turned down the offer to play professional baseball.[1] 
Davis was drafted in the third round (75th overall) of the 2004 amateur 
entry draft by the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. In the minors, he sported a 93–94 mph 
fastball, and an excellent spike curveball.[2][3] Davis has expanded his 
repertoire to include a two-seam fastball, a slider, and a changeup.[4] 
Davis made his major league debut on September 6, 2009, against the Detroit 
Tigers. He earned a no-decision after pitching seven innings, allowing 
one run, with nine strikeouts. Davis was the July 2010 AL Rookie Pitcher 
of the Month, after posting a 4–0 record with a 3.03 ERA in five starts.[5] 
He was named a starting pitcher on Baseball America's 2010 All-Rookie Team.[6] 
The Tampa Bay chapter of the Baseball Writers' Association of America also 
named Davis the Most Outstanding Rookie of the Tampa Bay Rays for the 2010 
season.[7] He came in 4th in the voting for 2010 AL Rookie of the Year.[8] 
After two years in the Rays' starting rotation, Davis spent 2012 coming 
out of the Rays' bullpen and had a strong season. On December 9, 2012 Davis 
was traded to the Kansas City Royals (along with James Shields) in exchange 
for Wil Myers, Jake Odorizzi, Mike Montgomery and Patrick Leonard.[9] Davis 
spent most of 2013 in the Royals' rotation and compiled a 6–10 record through 
the end of August. He moved to the bullpen for September 2013 and remained 
in the bullpen through 2014. In 2014, Davis posted one of the most dominant 
seasons ever by a reliever. From June 25 to September 16, Davis did not 
give up an earned run. On September 15, his ERA was an astonishing 0.69. 
On September 22, 2014, Davis struck out Yan Gomes for Davis' 104th strikeout 
of the season, breaking the Royals record for most strikeouts by a relief 
pitcher, which was 103 and had been shared by Jim York (1971) and Greg 
Holland (2013). Davis finished the regular season with a 9-2 record, posting 
a 1.00 ERA. He struck out 109 batters and walked 23. He did not give up 
a home run in 2014. This dominance continued through the postseason, with 
Davis posting a 2-0 record and an ERA of 0.63. He struck out 20 batters 
and walked only 2. In 2015, Davis has continued his dominance in the bullpen, 
pitching almost exclusively in the 8th inning, much like 2014. On June 
28, Davis' homerless streak almost ended, giving up a double off the top 
of the wall at O.co Coliseum to Marcus Semien. On August 1, Davis' homerless 
streak ended at 125.2 innings, giving up a home run to the Blue Jays' José 
Bautista. His streak was the second longest in Royals history, and the 
longest such streak by a reliever.[10] On September 22, Davis was selected 
by manager Ned Yost as the Royals' new closer, as the Royals announced 
that Greg Holland was done for the year and possibly all of 2016 due to 
pending Tommy John surgery.[11] On October 23, Davis forced Blue Jays slugger 
and 2015 American League MVP candidate Josh Donaldson to ground out to 
Mike Moustakas at third base, which was the final out to secure the Royals' 
second consecutive American League Championship Series title.[12] Davis 
later recorded the final three outs of the 2015 World Series, as the Royals 
defeated the New York Mets in five games. In the 2015 MLB postseason, Davis 
went 1-0 and picked up four saves in four opportunities. He struck out 
18 batters while allowing zero earned runs over 10 2/3 innings pitched. 
This performance earned him the 2015 Babe Ruth Award, recognizing Davis 
as the most valuable player in the MLB postseason. On July 5, Davis was 
placed on the 15-day disabled list due to a right forearm strain.[13] On 
October 10th, 2016 the Kansas City Royals picked up Davis's 2017 option. 
As a starter, Davis threw five pitches (four-seam fastball, cut fastball, 
curveball, slider and changeup). As a relief pitcher, he has relied primarily 
on three pitches: a four-seam fastball in the 95–98 MPH range (topping 
out at 99 MPH), a cut fastball that averages 92–93 MPH, and a knuckle curve 
in the mid-80s that he started throwing in 2013.[14] Davis is the second-cousin 
of former Major League Baseball player Jody Davis.[15] Wade Davis married 
long time girlfriend, Katelyn Casey, in November 2009 in front of 200 guests 
in her hometown of Marlboro, NY. A graduate of the University of Tampa 
and aspiring interior designer, Katelyn also runs the couples' non-profit 
organization Full Kount which benefits children age 18 and younger who 
use sports as a positive influence in their lives. The couple have three 
dogs: Abagail, Charlie, and Ruth. In the summer of 2013, the couple gave
