Félix Heredia Pérez (born June 18, 1975) is a former Major League Baseball 
relief pitcher. On October 18, 2005, he became the 11th MLB player to be 
suspended for testing positive for steroids.[1] He is also known as "El 
Gato Flaco" (Skinny Cat in Spanish) and, "The Run Fairy" (a nickname sarcastically 
lampooning his poor performances in the latter part of his career).[2] 
Heredia attended Escuela Dominical in Barahona. He was signed as a free 
agent by the Florida Marlins in 1993 and made his major league debut with 
the Marlins on August 9, 1995. Heredia went on to pitch for the Chicago 
Cubs and Toronto Blue Jays before having his best season in 2003 with the 
Cincinnati Reds and New York Yankees. That year, he was 5–3 with one save 
and a 2.69 ERA in 69 relief appearances. However, his performance declined 
rapidly in 2004 with the Yankees, who traded him to the New York Mets for 
Mike Stanton prior to the 2005 season. However, he made just three appearances 
with the Mets in 2005 before going on the disabled list with an aneurysm 
in his left shoulder in June, and he missed the rest of the season. The 
following off-season, he signed with Arizona, but was released during spring 
training. Four days later, Heredia signed with the Cleveland Indians, appearing 
in eight games for their Triple-A affiliate, the Buffalo Bisons, before 
being released on May 12. On December 16, 2006, the Detroit Tigers signed 
him to a minor league deal, but despite a 2.00 ERA in spring training, 
Heredia was released. Heredia is married with three children and resides
