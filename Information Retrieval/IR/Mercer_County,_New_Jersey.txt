Mercer County is a county located in the U.S. state of New Jersey. Its 
county seat is Trenton, the state capital.[2][5] The county constitutes 
the Trenton-Ewing, NJ Metropolitan Statistical Area[6] and is considered 
part of the New York Combined Statistical Area by the United States Census 
Bureau,[7] but also directly borders the Philadelphia metropolitan area 
and is included within the Federal Communications Commission's Philadelphia 
Designated Market Area.[8] As of 2015, Mercer County's Census-estimated 
population was 371,398, an increase of 1.3% from the 2010 United States 
Census, when its population was enumerated at 366,513,[4] in turn an increase 
of 15,752 (4.5%) from the 350,761 enumerated in the 2000 Census,[9] retaining 
its position as the 12th-most populous county in the state.[10][11] Mercer 
County stands among the highest-income counties in the United States, with 
the Bureau of Economic Analysis having ranked the county as having the 
78th-highest per capita income of all 3,113 counties in the United States 
(and the sixth-highest in New Jersey) as of 2009.[12] The county was formed 
by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on February 22, 1838, from portions 
of Burlington County (including Nottingham Township), Hunterdon County 
(including Ewing Township, Lawrence Township, Trenton City and portions 
of Hopewell Township), and Middlesex County (including West Windsor Township 
and portions of East Windsor Township).[13] The old Keith Line bisects 
the county and is the boundary between municipalities that previously had 
been separated into West Jersey and East Jersey. It was named for Continental 
Army General Hugh Mercer, who died as a result of wounds received at the 
Battle of Princeton on January 3, 1777.[14] The Mercer Oak, against which 
the dying general rested as his men continued to fight, appears on the 
county seal and stood for 250 years until it collapsed in 2000.[15] Mercer 
County is home to Princeton University, Princeton Theological Seminary, 
the Institute for Advanced Study, Rider University, The College of New 
Jersey, Thomas Edison State College and Mercer County Community College.[16] 
Founded February 22, 1838, from portions of surrounding counties, Mercer 
County has a historical impact that reaches back to the pivotal battles 
of the American Revolutionary War. On the night of December 25–26, 1776, 
General George Washington led American forces across the Delaware River 
to attack the Hessian barracks in Trenton on the morning of December 26. 
Following the battle, Washington crossed back to Pennsylvania. He crossed 
a third time in a surprise attack on the forces of General Charles Cornwallis 
at the Second Battle of Trenton on January 2, 1777, and at the Battle of 
Princeton on January 3. The successful attacks built morale among the pro-independence 
colonists.[17] Mercer County has the distinction of being the famed landing 
spot for a fictional Martian invasion of the United States. In 1938, in 
what has become one of the most famous American radio plays of all time, 
Orson Welles acted out his The War of the Worlds invasion. His imaginary 
aliens first "landed" at what is now West Windsor Township. A commemorative 
monument is erected at Grover's Mill park.[18] There were 27 Mercer County 
residents killed during the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks in Lower 
Manhattan. A 10-foot (3.0 m) long steel beam weighing one ton was given 
to the county by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey in March 
2011 and is now displayed at Mercer County Park.[19] According to the 2010 
Census, the county had a total area of 228.89 square miles (592.8 km2), 
including 224.56 square miles (581.6 km2) of land (98.1%) and 4.33 square 
miles (11.2 km2) of water (1.9%).[20] The county is generally flat and 
low-lying on the inner coastal plain with a few hills closer to the Delaware 
River. Baldpate Mountain, near Pennington, is the highest hill, at 480 
feet (150 m) above sea level.[21] The lowest point is at sea level along 
the Delaware. At the 2010 United States Census, there were 366,513 people,

County has a county executive form of government, in which the County Executive 
performs executive functions, administering the operation of the county, 
and a Board of Chosen Freeholders acts in a legislative capacity. The seven-member 
Board of Chosen Freeholders is elected at-large to serve three-year staggered 
terms of office on a staggered basis, with either two or three seats up 
for election each year. The Board is led by a Freeholder Chair and Vice-Chair, 
selected from among its members at an annual reorganization meeting held 
in January. The Freeholder Board establishes policy and provides a check 
on the powers of the County Executive. The Board approves all county contracts 
and gives advice and consent to the County Executive's appointments of 
department heads, and appointments to boards and commissions. The Freeholder 
Board votes to approve the budget prepared by the Executive after review 
and modifications are made.[28] As of 2016[update], the County Executive 
is Democrat Brian M. Hughes, who was re-elected to a fourth four-year term 
in November 2015 and is serving a term of office ending December 31, 2019.[29] 
Mercer County's Freeholders are:[30][31][32] Mercer County's constitutional 
officers are County Clerk Paula Sollami-Covello (D, 2018),[40] Sheriff 
John A. "Jack" Kemler (D, 2017)[41] and Surrogate Diane Gerofsky.[42] Mercer 
County constitutes Vicinage 7 of the Superior Court of New Jersey.[43] 
The vicinage courthouses are located in Trenton, the county seat, and the 
Assignment Judge for Mercer County is Mary C. Jacobson.[44][45] Law enforcement 
on the county level is provided by the Mercer County Sheriff's Office and 
the Mercer County Prosecutor's Office. Portions of the 4th and 12th Congressional 
Districts cover the county.[46][47] New Jersey's Fourth Congressional District 
is represented by Christopher Smith (R).[48] New Jersey's Twelfth Congressional 
District is represented by Bonnie Watson Coleman (D, Ewing Township).[49] 
The county is part of the 14th, 15th and 16th Districts in the New Jersey 
Legislature.[50] In the 2004 U.S. Presidential election, John Kerry carried 
Mercer County by a 23.4% margin over George W. Bush, with Kerry carrying 
the state by 6.7% over Bush.[51] In 2008, the county voted for Barack Obama 
by a 35.4% margin over John McCain, with Obama winning New Jersey by 14.4% 
over McCain.[52] Mercer County has county routes, state routes, U.S. Routes 
and Interstates that all pass through. As of 2010[update], the county had 
a total of 1,524.30 miles (2,453.12 km) of roadways, of which 1,216.48 
miles (1,957.73 km) were maintained by the local municipality, 175.80 miles 
(282.92 km) by Mercer County, 118.99 miles (191.50 km) by the New Jersey 
Department of Transportation and 13.03 miles (20.97 km) by the New Jersey 
Turnpike Authority.[53] The county roads that traverse through are County 
Route 518 (only in the Hopewells), County Route 524, County Route 526, 
County Route 533, County Route 535, County Route 539, County Route 546, 
County Route 569, County Route 571 and County Route 583. The state routes 
that pass through Mercer are Route 27 (only in Princeton), Route 29, Route 
31, Route 33, Route 129, and Route 133. There are three US Routes that 
pass through Mercer County, which are: U.S. Route 1 (which bisects the 
county), U.S. Route 130 and U.S. Route 206. Mercer County houses a few 
limited access roads, such as Interstate 295, Interstate 195, and Interstate 
95 (which is also designated along the New Jersey Turnpike). (Mercer is 
the only county in the state that hosts I-95 and both its auxiliary routes.) 
Two turnpike interchanges are located in Mercer: Exit 7A in Robbinsville 
and Exit 8 in East Windsor. Interstate 95 abruptly ends at the interchange 
with US 1 and I-295 in Lawrence Township, and becomes I-295 south. Signs 
direct motorists to the continuation of I-95 by using I-295 to I-195 east 
to Interstate 95 / New Jersey Turnpike. This is all due in part to the 
cancellation of the Somerset Freeway that was supposed to go from Hopewell 
in Mercer County up to Franklin in Somerset County. The 95 shields on the 
"Trenton section" are to re-numbered as part of I-295 when a direct interchange 
with Interstate 95 in Pennsylvania and Interstate 276 is built (which will 
not be until 2017).[54] This planned interchange indirectly prompted another 
project: the New Jersey Turnpike Authority extended the 'dual-dual' configuration 
(inner car lanes and outer truck / bus / car lanes) to Interchange 6 in 
Mansfield Township, Burlington County from its former end at Interchange 
8A in Monroe Township, Middlesex County. This widening was completed in 
early November 2014.[55] Mercer hosts several New Jersey Transit stations, 
including Trenton, Hamilton, and Princeton Junction on the Northeast Corridor 
Line.[56] SEPTA provides rail service to Center City Philadelphia from 
Trenton and West Trenton. Long-distance transportation is provided by Amtrak 
train service along the Northeast Corridor through the Trenton Transit 
Center. NJTransit's River Line connects Trenton to Camden, with three stations 
in the county, all within Trenton city limits, at Cass Street, Hamilton 
Avenue and at the Trenton Transit Center.[57] Mercer County's only commercial 
airport, and one of three in the state, is Trenton-Mercer Airport in Ewing 
Township, which is served by Frontier Airlines, offering nonstop service 
to and from points nationwide.[58] Municipalities in Mercer County (with 
2010 Census data for population, housing units and area) are:[59] Allens
