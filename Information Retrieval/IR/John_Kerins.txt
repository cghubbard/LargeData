John Nelson Kerins (July 15, 1858 â€“ September 19, 1919) was an American 
Major League Baseball player born in Indianapolis, Indiana, who played 
mainly at first base, but played significant time at catcher. John began 
his major league career with the 1884 Indianapolis Hoosiers of the American 
Association. After the season, the Hoosiers folded, and John moved on to 
the Louisville Colonels, where he spent the next four full seasons, and 
one partial season in 1889. He finished that season off with the Baltimore 
Orioles, then played his last season in 1890 for the St. Louis Browns.[1] 
In addition to playing, twice he was named interim manager, once each with 
the Colonels in 1888 and in his one season with the Browns.[2] John died 
in Louisville, Kentucky at the age of 61, and was buried at Cave Hill Cemetery
