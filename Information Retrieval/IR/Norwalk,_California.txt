Norwalk is a suburban city in Los Angeles County, California, United States. 
The population is estimated to be 107,096 as of 2014.[8] It is the 58th 
most densely-populated city in California.[9] Founded in the late 19th 
century, Norwalk was incorporated as a city in 1957. It is located 17 miles 
(27 km) southeast of downtown Los Angeles and is part of the Greater Los 
Angeles area. Norwalk is a member of the Gateway Cities Council of Governments. 
Norwalk's sister cities are Morelia, Michoacán, and Hermosillo, Sonora, 
in Mexico.[10] [11] The area known as "Norwalk" was first home to the Shoshonean 
Native American tribe. They survived primarily on honey, an array of berries, 
acorns, sage, squirrels, rabbits and birds. Their huts were part of the 
Sejat Indian village. In the late 1760s, settlers and missions flourished 
under Spanish rule with the famous El Camino Real trail traversing the 
area. Manuel Nieto, a Spanish soldier, received a Spanish land grant (Rancho 
Los Nietos) in 1784 that included Norwalk. After the Mexican-American War 
in 1848, the Rancho and mining days ended. Portions of the land were subdivided 
and made available for sale when California was admitted into the union 
of the United States. Word of this land development reached the Sproul 
Brothers in Oregon. They recalled the fertile land and huge sycamore trees 
they saw during an earlier visit to the Southern California area. In 1869, 
Atwood Sproul, on behalf of his brother, Gilbert, purchased 463 acres (1.87 km2) 
of land at $11 an acre ($2700/km²) in an area known as Corazon de los Valles, 
or "Heart of the Valleys". By 1873, railroads were being built in the area 
and the Sprouls deeded 23 acres (93,000 m²) stipulating a "passenger stop" 
clause in the deed. Three days after the Anaheim Branch Railroad crossed 
the "North-walk" for the first time, Gilbert Sproul surveyed a town site. 
In 1874, the name was recorded officially as Norwalk. While a majority 
of the Norwalk countryside remained undeveloped during the 1880s, the Norwalk 
Station allowed potential residents the opportunity to visit the "country" 
from across the nation. What are known as the "first families" to Norwalk 
(including the Sprouls, the Dewitts, the Settles, and the Orrs) settled 
in the area in the years before 1900. D.D. Johnston pioneered the first 
school system in Norwalk in 1880. Johnston was also responsible for the 
first real industry in town, a cheese factory, by furnishing Tom Lumbard 
with the money in 1882. Norwalk's prosperity was evident in the 1890s with 
the construction of a number of fine homes that were located in the middle 
of orchards, farms and dairies. Headstones for these families can be found 
at Little Lake Cemetery, which was founded in 1843 on the border between 
Norwalk and Santa Fe Springs at Lakeland Road. At the turn of the 19th 
century, Norwalk had become established as a dairy center. Of the 50 local 
families reported in the 1900 census, most were associated with farming 
or with the dairy industry. Norwalk was also the home of some of the largest 
sugar beet farms in all of Southern California during this era. Many of 
the dairy farmers who settled in Norwalk during the early part of the 20th 
century were Dutch. After the 1950s, the Hispanic population in Norwalk 
grew significantly as the area became increasingly residential. In February 
1958, two military aircraft, a Douglas C-118 A military transport and a 
U.S. Navy P2V-5F Neptune patrol bomber, collided over Norwalk at night. 
47 servicemen were killed as well as a civilian 23-year-old woman on the 
ground who was hit by falling debris. A plaque commemorating the disaster 
erected by the American Legion in 1961 marks the spot of the accident, 
today a mini-mall at the corner of Firestone Boulevard and Pioneer Boulevard. 
Built in 1891 by the D.D. Johnston family, the Hargitt House was built 
in the architectural style of Victorian Eastlake. The Hargitt House Museum, 
located at 12426 Mapledale, was donated to the people of Norwalk by Charles 
("Chun") and Ida Hargitt. The museum is open on the first and third Saturday 
of the month from 1:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m.[12] Norwalk is located at 33°54′25″N
