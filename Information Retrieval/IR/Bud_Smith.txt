Robert Allan "Bud" Smith (born October 23, 1979 in Torrance, California) 
is a retired American baseball player. Smith was active at the major league 
level in 2001 and 2002, playing for the St. Louis Cardinals. In 2000, Smith 
led the minor league Cardinal organization with a 2.26 ERA (among starters) 
and 17 wins (5 with AAA Memphis and 12 with AA Arkansas) and threw two 
no-hitters of the seven-inning variety against Midland and San Antonio. 
His 2000-year performance earned him Baseball Weekly's Minor League Pitcher 
of the Year award.[1] Smith's major league career was short but notable, 
as he became the 18th rookie since 1900 to throw a no-hitter. Smith's Cardinals 
defeated the San Diego Padres 4–0 on September 3, 2001, with the rookie 
hurler giving up four walks but no hits, while throwing 134 pitches in 
the game.[2] Due to Smith's high pitch count entering the later innings, 
Cardinal pitching coach Dave Duncan was actually hoping someone would break 
up the no-hitter, fearing that his young pitcher might tire, although he 
went against that judgment in allowing Smith to finish the game. As of 
October 2015[update], Smith's no-hitter is the last one for a Cardinals 
pitcher.[3] Smith had an impressive rookie season in 2001, compiling a 
6–3 record and 3.83 earned run average in 16 games, good for 4th in Rookie 
of the Year voting. However, after posting a dreadful 6.94 era in his sophomore 
season, he never pitched at the major league level again. Smith has the 
distinction of being the last member of the Cardinals to wear the number 
51. In his major league debut, he donned the number associated with retired 
fan favorite Willie McGee, upsetting many fans. Shortly thereafter, Smith 
agreed to change his number to 52 and no one has used 51 since. For his 
career, Smith was 7–8 with a 4.95 earned run average in 132.7 innings. 
He made 27 appearances with 24 starts, with one complete game shutout. 
On July 29, 2002 he was traded to the Philadelphia Phillies along with 
infielder Plácido Polanco and relief pitcher Mike Timlin for third baseman 
Scott Rolen, relief pitcher Doug Nickle and cash. Smith never made a major 
league appearance for the Phillies, and on October 15, 2004 was granted 
free agency. He later signed with the Minnesota Twins on December 14, 2004. 
Smith was most recently a member of the Long Beach Armada of the independent
