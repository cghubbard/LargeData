ParticipACTION is a national non-profit organization, originally launched 
as a Canadian government program in the 1970s, to promote healthy living 
and physical fitness. It shut down due to financial cutbacks in 2001, but 
was revived on February 19, 2007 with a grant of $5 million from the Canadian 
federal government.[1][2] ParticipACTION emerged from Sport Participation 
Canada, a non-profit private company formed on July 12, 1971. Lester B. 
Pearson chaired the board while Philippe de Gasp√© Beaubien served as president. 
In 1972, the company was nationalized by then-prime minister Pierre Trudeau 
to battle exorbitant health care costs. The resulting government program 
was renamed ParticipACTION. ParticipACTION is well known for its television 
public service announcements and segments such as Body Break during the 
1970s, 1980s and 1990s. A 1973 commercial, comparing the health of a 30-year-old 
Canadian to a 60-year-old Swede, started a national discussion on the state 
of physical education in Canada. ParticipACTION was led by President and 
CEO Kelly Murumets from 2007 until 2014,[3] when Elio Antunes was named 
to lead the organization.[4] Body Break is a series of 90-second television 
programs dedicated to informing television audiences of ways to "keep fit 
and have fun". Funded in part by ParticipACTION for only 2 years, the programs 
are hosted by Hal Johnson and Joanne McLeod and air regularly on Canadian 
television. The programs are designed to briefly introduce tips for healthy 
living to a television audience. Both Hal and Joanne are accomplished athletes 
with backgrounds in sports medicine and nutrition. Johnson, a native of 
Toronto, Ontario, was an all-star baseball player while he attended the 
University of Colorado on athletic scholarship, and was among his team 
leaders in the Big 8 conference in home runs, RBIs, and batting average. 
He finished his business degree. Formerly an expert golfer now plays golf 
at a recreational level. In 1992, a Body Break fitness video was released 
through Quality Music & Video. It was a smash, selling about 30,000 copies. 
The two hosts of Body Break married in 1999, having kept their relationship 
secret from the public for several years.[5] The couple participated in 
the first Amazing Race Canada, being eliminated in the fifth leg. Lack
