The Tampa Tarpons were a minor league baseball team based in Tampa, Florida. 
They played in the Class A Florida State League from 1957–1988, when they 
were sold, relocated, and renamed the Sarasota White Sox. During their 
run in Tampa, they won three FSL league championships, in 1957, 1959 and 
1961. The team was established in 1957 to join the Florida State League, 
then a Class D minor league.[1] Tampa had been without a professional baseball 
team since 1954, when the Florida International League folded, taking with 
it the Tampa Smokers. From their inception, the Tarpons played all their 
home games at Al Lopez Field in Tampa, built in 1955. The Tarpons were 
affiliated with the Philadelphia Phillies from 1957-1960. In 1961 they 
began a long affiliation with the Cincinnati Reds. They won three league 
championships, in 1957, 1959 and 1961.[2] In 1964 minor league baseball 
was realigned, and the Florida State League became a Class A league (now 
Class A-Advanced). During the 1980s talk spread of a major league team 
coming to the Tampa Bay Area, which would threaten the viability of the 
Tarpons and other minor league teams in the region.[3] Prior to the 1988 
season the Reds moved their spring training from Tampa to Plant City, Florida, 
and moved their Class A franchise to Greensboro, North Carolina (the Greensboro 
Hornets). The Chicago White Sox subsequently moved their Class A affiliation 
to Tampa for the 1988 season, amid rumors that the White Sox themselves 
would be moving to the area. That season the club, renamed the Tampa White 
Sox, drew 55,900 fans, seventh in the 14-team FSL, and went 35-35 in the 
first half before they won the western division second-half title at 36-24. 
They fell in the second round of the playoffs to the St. Lucie Mets 2 games 
to 0. The club was managed by Marv Foley and had one FSL All-Star, pitcher 
Jerry Kutzler. Foley won FSL Manager of the Year honors.[4] After the 1988 
season, owner Mitchell Mick sold his franchise to the Chicago White Sox, 
who relocated the club to Sarasota, Florida as the Sarasota White Sox.[5] 
The franchise exchanged major league affiliates and nicknames several times 
before 2010, when they became an affiliate of the Pittsburgh Pirates and 
were moved and renamed the Bradenton Marauders. Meanwhile, Tampa was without 
professional baseball until the Tampa Yankees joined the Florida State 
League in 1994. The Tarpons had many famous players that went on to play 
in the major leagues, including many who eventually became important parts 
of Cincinnati's Big Red Machine of the 1970s. In 1961 Pete Rose led the 
first place Tarpons with a .331 batting average and 30 triples – still 
a FSL record.[6] Other Reds players from that era who started with the 
Tarpons include Ken Griffey, Sr., Johnny Bench, Dan Driessen, Rawly Eastwick, 
and Dave Concepcion. When the Reds won their next world series in 1990 
with manager (and Tampa native) Lou Piniella, they again had several former 
Tarpons on the roster, including Tom Browning, Rob Dibble, and Paul O'Neill. 
Another notable former Tarpon was Randy Poffo, who finished a nondescript 
minor league baseball career with the team in 1974.[7] Poffo went on to 
a much more successful career in professional wrestling, where he came 
to fame while using the name "Macho Man" Randy Savage. In 2006 the Tampa 
Bay Devil Rays embarked on a rebranding effort that would include a name 
change; they considered adopting the Tampa Bay Tarpons name in honor of 
the minor league team before making the less radical change to their current 
name, Tampa Bay Rays.[8][9] The Rays have worn Tampa Tarpons uniforms for
