The Philadelphia Phillies annual franchise awards have been given since 
2004 by the Philadelphia chapter of the Baseball Writers Association of 
America to four members of the Philadelphia Phillies franchise for "season-ending 
achievements." The awards were created by Bucks County Courier Times[1] 
Phillies beat writer Randy Miller, who also served as the chairman of the 
BBWAA's Philadelphia chapter. Winners receive a glass trophy shaped like 
home plate. In 2014, a fifth award was added: the Charlie Manuel Award
