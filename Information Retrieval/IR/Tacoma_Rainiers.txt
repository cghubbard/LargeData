The Tacoma Rainiers are a Minor League Baseball team that plays in the 
Pacific Coast League (PCL) and is the Triple-A affiliate of Major League 
Baseball's Seattle Mariners. A team located in Tacoma, Washington has been 
in the PCL every year since 1960, for the longest current active streak 
of membership in the league. The Rainiers are based only 36 miles south 
of Seattle, the shortest distance between a Triple-A team and its major-league 
parent. Tacoma's first team in the PCL was the Tacoma Tigers, who joined 
the league in 1904, having moved from Sacramento after the 1903 season. 
The 1904 Tigers won Tacoma's first PCL pennant, finishing first in both 
halves of the split season schedule, seven games (annualized) over the 
runner-up Los Angeles Angels. The 1905 Tigers won the first-half championship, 
then moved back to Sacramento, finishing out the season as the Sacramento 
Solons, and losing the postseason series to the Angels. The PCL would not 
return to Tacoma for another 55 years; however, another Tacoma Tigers franchise 
operated in the Western International League from the 1930s until 1951. 
The current PCL franchise was founded in 1960 when the Phoenix Giants, 
an affiliate of the San Francisco Giants, moved to Tacoma and became the 
Tacoma Giants. The Giants were the first team to play at brand-new Cheney 
Stadium. The Giants' first win at Cheney Stadium came on April 16, 1960—an 
11–0 victory over Portland in game two of a doubleheader. Future National 
Baseball Hall Of Fame pitcher Juan Marichal worked the victory, giving 
Tacoma their first franchise shutout performance. The 1961 iteration of 
the club posted a 97–57 record under manager Red Davis, who steered a team 
led by Gaylord Perry, Ron Herbel, Eddie Fisher, and Dick Phillips. Following 
a season in which he hit .264 with 16 home runs and 98 RBI, Phillips was 
named the 1961 PCL Most Valuable Player – he remains the only player in 
franchise history to earn the PCL MVP award. In 1965, the Giants decided 
to move the team back to Phoenix, however, the Chicago Cubs decided to 
move their affiliate, the Salt Lake Bees, to Tacoma exactly the same year 
and renamed the team the Tacoma Cubs. The club played as a Cubs affiliate 
for six season, compiling a 410–466 (.468) record. The Tacoma Cubs were 
managed by Whitey Lockman for their first four seasons, including a 1969 
PCL Championship after finishing the year 86-60. The 1969 Cubs pitching 
staff compiled a 3.01 team ERA, and bested Eugene for the league championship 
3–2 in a best-of-five series. Following the 1971 season, the Chicago Cubs 
left town. Local businessmen Stan Naccarato and Clay Huntington spearheaded 
a group of local investors who purchased the franchise and secured an affiliation 
with the Minnesota Twins, who renamed the team the Tacoma Twins. Through 
six seasons as a Twins affiliate, Tacoma compiled a 422-441 (.489) record 
with no league championships. During the Twins era, infielder Rick Renick 
(1973–76) slugged his way to 72 home runs, giving him the most career home 
runs in franchise history. In the midst of a 1977 season in which he hit 
.321 with 25 home runs and 117 RBI, first baseman Randy Bass notched four 
home runs on June 9, 1977 at Phoenix – he is one of only six players in 
PCL history to send out four or more home runs in a single contest. For 
one season, the Tacoma franchise found themselves affiliated with the New 
York Yankees. While the Yankees compiled a 100-win 1978 season that culminated 
in an American League East title over the Boston Red Sox, the Tacoma Yankees 
compiled an 80–57 record and advanced to the league championship. After 
the 1978 PCL Championship series with Albuquerque was cancelled due to 
rain, Tacoma and Albuquerque were named PCL Co-Champions. Following an 
affiliation change to the Cleveland Indians, a local contest was held and 
long-time Tacoma resident, Gary W. Grip won with his entry, the Tacoma 
Tugs. Grip drew his inspiration for the name from the many tugboats in 
the Tacoma waters. The franchise was renamed the Tacoma Tugs, marking the 
first time the team's nickname did not align with its major league club. 
After one season as the Tugs, the team returned to the Tigers nickname 
in 1980. The team finished with nearly identical records in both years 
as a Cleveland affiliate, going 74–73 in 1979, and 74–74 in 1980. Following 
their brief stints with the Yankees and Indians, the team moved their affiliation 
to the Oakland A's, a partnership that would last 14 seasons. While the 
affiliation with Oakland provided five playoffs appearances for Tacoma 
fans, it produced no league championships. Future American League Rookies 
of the Year Walt Weiss, Jose Canseco, and Mark McGwire all spent time in 
Tacoma during this period. Scott Brosious, Tacoma's current hitting coach, 
also played for Tacoma during the Oakland era. The team became associated 
with the nearby Seattle Mariners in 1995, whose Triple-A team for the previous 
ten seasons had been the Calgary Cannons. Tacoma adopted the Rainiers name 
in part as a tribute to the Seattle Rainiers minor league teams that played 
in Seattle from 1938 to 1964 in the PCL, and again from 1972 to 1976. The 
Tacoma Rainiers play their home games at Cheney Stadium, which hosted the 
baseball portion of the 1990 Goodwill Games. The Mariners' Safeco Field 
is about 30 miles (48 km) to the north. Since the affiliation with the 
Mariners, nearly all of the organization's home-grown prospects have passed 
through Tacoma, including Alex Rodriguez, Jay Buhner and Ken Griffey Jr. 
(both on rehab assignments), Raul Ibanez, Felix Hernandez, J.J. Putz, and 
more. Tacoma was managed by Dan Rohn from 2001–2005, a three-time PCL Manager 
of the Year recipient. Under Rohn's direction, the Rainiers compiled a 
record of 375–340 (.524). Tacoma shared a PCL Championship in 2001 with 
New Orleans after the September 11 attacks forced the cancellation of the 
championship series. The Rainiers advanced to the championship series in 
2005, but was swept by Nashville, before winning their most recent league 
championship in 2010. The Rainiers are broadcast on KHHO 850 AM by play-by-play 
announcer Mike Curto, who has been with the club since 1999. When they 
were called the Tacoma Twins, Jerry Howarth, Toronto Blue Jays broadcaster, 
broadcast games for them. The 1961 Tacoma Giants finished the season with 
a record of 97–58 (.630), which still stands as the best season in the 
club's PCL history. No playoffs were held in 1961- instead, the Giants 
clinched the league championship by earning the top spot in the league's 
sole, eight-team division. The club finished the season going 57–10 over 
their final 67 games, including a 16-game winning streak, believed to be 
a franchise-record streak. The 1969 Tacoma Cubs finished the season with 
an 86–60 (.589) record, and earned the franchise's second league championship. 
The Cubs won the four-team Northern Division by 14 games to advance to 
the league championship. After going down 0–2 in the championship series 
to Eugene, then a Philadelphia Phillies affiliate, the Cubs rallied to 
win three straight games, clinching the five-game series. Cubs pitcher 
Archie Reynolds fired a complete game, two-hit shutout in game four to 
force a deciding fifth game. The 1969 Cubs were the first Tacoma team to 
win a championship playoff series. The Tacoma Cubs compiled a record of 
78–65 (.545) and returned to the PCL Championship Series just two short 
years after winning the league title. This time, the Cubs would fall to 
the Salt Lake Angels, three games to one. After falling behind 0–1 in the 
series, Cubs starting pitcher Jim Colborn fired a 10-inning, complete-game 
winning effort in game two, surrendering only one run and evening the series. 
Tacoma played the series without Adrian Garrett, who had hit a franchise 
record 43 home runs during the regular season before being sold to Oakland 
on August 31. Tacoma finished with a record of 80–57 (.584) during their 
only season as a Yankees affiliate and was declared PCL Co-Champions, along 
with Albuquerque, after inclement weather in the Pacific Northwest forced 
the league office to cancel the playoffs. For the first time since the 
PCL switched to a split-season format, Tacoma made the playoffs after finishing 
43–27 in the second half to win the Northern Division. The Tigers defeated 
Hawaii, winners of the first half, two games to one to advance to the PCL 
Championship Series against Albuquerque. The Dukes would go on to sweep 
the Tigers 3–0 on a combined score of 22–7 to win the PCL Championship. 
While the Seattle Mariners compiled a Major League record 116 wins, the 
Rainiers put together an 85–59 (.590) record to win the Northern Division 
by 12.5 games. The 2001 Rainiers led the Pacific Coast League with a 3.74 
team ERA, while the offense finished fifth in the league in runs scored. 
Tacoma defeated Sacramento 3–2, after falling behind in the series 2–1, 
to move on to the Championship Series. Tacoma and New Orleans were scheduled 
to begin the Championship Series on September 11, before the series was 
cancelled in the aftermath of the September 11 terrorist attacks in New 
York City and Washington D.C. The PCL league office announced that Tacoma 
and New Orleans would be declared "Co-Champions" of the 2001 season. The 
2005 Rainiers finished 80–64 (.556) under the guidance of manager Dan Rohn. 
The Rainiers clinched the Northern Division crown on the second-to-last 
day of the season, eliminating a Salt Lake team that had won their final 
nine games of the season. Tacoma dropped the first two games of the five-game 
division series at home against Sacramento, before taking the final three 
games at Raley Field to advance to the championship. After falling behind 
0–1 in the series to Nashville, a season-high five errors in game two sunk 
the Rainiers and gave the Sounds a 2–0 series advantage. In the 13th inning 
of game three, eventual series MVP and current Seattle Mariners Nelson 
Cruz launched a three-run home run to give Nashville a 5–2 victory and 
the PCL Championship. The 2009 Rainiers, guided by manager Daren Brown, 
worked a record of 74–70 to sneak into the postseason. Tacoma was quickly 
eliminated from championship contention after dropping the division series 
to Sacramento 3–1. The Rainiers went into playoffs with its home ballpark, 
Cheney Stadium, under construction. Displaced from its home field, Rainiers 
were forced to look for other venues to play its playoff home games. The 
first round of playoff game against Sacramento Rivercats saw the Rainiers 
winning two straight on the road, then coming "home" to the ballpark of 
its parent club, the Seattle Mariners, at Safeco Field. The Rainiers then 
dropped two straight games at Safeco Field, before winning Game 5 to advance 
to the PCL Championship Series against the Memphis Redbirds. Due to Safeco 
Field not being available for the Championship Series and no other ball 
park in the Pacific Northwest meeting PCL requirements, the Rainiers were 
forced to play all games in the PCL Championship Series on the road. For 
Games 1 and 2 (the Rainiers' "home" games) the team batted second against 
the "visiting" Memphis Redbirds, with AutoZone Park in Memphis, Tennessee 
(the Redbirds' home park) hosting all the games. Having a hostile crowd 
even in its "home" games, the Rainiers nonetheless swept the Redbirds in 
three games to win the 2010 PCL Championship. The Columbus Clippers defeated 
the Rainiers 12–6 on September 21, 2010, to win the Triple-A Baseball National 
Championship Game in Oklahoma City. Since its opening in 1960, Cheney Stadium 
has welcomed more than 14 million fans through the gates to watch PCL baseball 
in Tacoma. The club has posted season-long attendance totals in excess 
of 300,000 fans in 25 separate seasons, including in each of the last 15 
seasons.[when?] Attendance at Cheney Stadium during the 2015 season approached 
record highs for the Rainiers. A total of 352,521 fans came to the stadium 
during the course of the club's 72-game home schedule, the second-highest 
mark in club history and the highest since renovated Cheney's Stadium's 
inaugural season in 2011. The team averaged 4,965 fans per game in 2015—a 
five percent increase from 2014—and filled Cheney to 76 percent capacity 
on average, the fifth-highest mark in the PCL.[1] In March 2015, the Tacoma 
Rainiers announced a set of new logo marks and additions to the club's 
uniform set.[2] An updated version of the team's script logo, introduced 
in 1995, became the club's primary logo mark. A long-standing fan-favorite, 
the standalone "R" logo, became the team's secondary mark. In addition 
to the logo marks, a new look was given to the club's home alternate, away, 
and batting practice uniforms.[3] A red alternate jersey, worn with a new 
red hat, was added to the rotation of uniform sets. The club's new road 
uniform was modeled after the Tacoma Giants uniforms of the 1960s with 
a gray color scheme and block letters on the front. The final addition 
to the uniform set was a new batting practice cap, adorned with a mountain 
outline and a climbing axe with a baseball bat handle. Pitchers Catchers
