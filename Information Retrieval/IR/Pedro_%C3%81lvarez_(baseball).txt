Pedro Manuel Álvarez Jr. (born February 6, 1987) is a Dominican-American 
professional baseball designated hitter who is a free agent. He has played 
in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Pittsburgh Pirates and Baltimore 
Orioles. Álvarez has been nicknamed El Toro, Spanish for "the bull", because 
of his strength and muscular physique. He stands 6'3" and weighs 250 lbs. 
He has one younger brother, Luis Fernandez. A third baseman until late 
2014, Alvarez transitioned to first base for the Pirates in 2015, but was 
not offered a contract and became a free agent at the end of the 2015 season. 
Upon being signed by the Orioles in 2016, Alvarez became the team's designated 
hitter. Álvarez was born in the Dominican Republic to Pedro and Luz Alvarez. 
Alvarez also has a sister. Father of Wilfredo Alvarez. As a young boy, 
he grew up in the Washington Heights neighborhood in the New York City 
borough of Manhattan.[1][2][3][4][5] Álvarez first attended the Mott Hall 
School for gifted and talented students in Morningside Heights, where he 
was an A student. He then attended Horace Mann School[1] in the Bronx, 
where he holds numerous baseball records, most notably home runs, batting 
average, on-base percentage, slugging percentage, and RBIs.[6] Álvarez 
was named Athlete of the Year his senior season. Though he attended a private 
school, Álvarez's abilities attracted the attention of scouts throughout 
the New York City area, especially after he led his club team, the Bayside 
Yankees, to a national title in 2005. In recognition of his success, Louisville 
Slugger crowned him the Player of the Year in New York and also named him 
to its All-America team. After graduating from high school, Álvarez was 
drafted in the 14th round of the 2005 major league draft by the Boston 
Red Sox. Though offered a substantial signing bonus,[7] Álvarez instead 
chose to play college baseball for the Vanderbilt Commodores of the Southeastern 
Conference. Álvarez started slowly and had some trouble adjusting to the 
college game. However, after growing comfortable, he became an integral 
member of the Commodore lineup. Álvarez put up some of the best offensive 
numbers in the history of Vanderbilt, setting single-season school records 
in home runs (22) and second in RBIs to Warner Jones. These stats earned 
Álvarez National Freshman of the Year honors from several publications, 
including Baseball America. Álvarez was then selected to the USA National 
team, leading the team in batting average. Baseball America ranked him 
as the 2nd best pro prospect on the squad. In addition, Sports Illustrated 
ranked him as the best pro prospect on the team and said that he was the 
"early favorite to be drafted first in 2008", due to his impressive performance 
over the summer and as a freshman.[8] Before the 2007 season began Álvarez 
was named to the watchlist for the SEC and national player of the year 
awards. He was also chosen as a 1st team pre-season All-American. During 
the season, Álvarez had great success, hitting .397 with 17 home runs, 
65 RBI, 72 runs, an on-base percentage of .467, and a slugging percentage 
of .706 for the 51-11 Commodores. His strong play was one of the key reasons 
Vanderbilt captured its first ever SEC regular-season championship. During 
the SEC Tournament, Álvarez powered Vanderbilt to a come-from-behind championship 
despite the team dropping the tournament's first game. No other team in 
SEC history had ever come back to win after losing its first game, and 
Álvarez was named Tournament MVP. Álvarez was invited back to Team USA 
after his strong performance in 2006 and would prove to be a leader on 
the field. He led the team in homers, RBI, batting average, hits, and slugging 
percentage. Álvarez was drafted by the Pittsburgh Pirates in the first 
round (second overall) in the 2008 Major League Baseball draft. He agreed 
to a $6 million minor league contract with the Pirates on August 15, minutes 
before the deadline but did not immediately sign it.[9] He was placed on 
the restricted list after the Major League Baseball Players Association 
filed a grievance against Major League Baseball over draft picks being 
signed minutes after the August 15 deadline. On September 22, Álvarez agreed 
to renegotiated terms on a four-year major league contract at $6.4 million.[citation

assigned to the minor league's spring training on March 16, 2009.[10] After 
playing several months with the Pirates High-A affiliate, Lynchburg Hillcats, 
Álvarez was assigned to Double-A Altoona Curve in late June. Álvarez performed 
extremely well between the two levels, leading the Pirates organization 
in home runs and RBI with 27 and 95 respectively. He also batted .288 with 
an .917 OPS.[11] Álvarez started the 2010 season with the Pirates Triple-A 
affiliate, the Indianapolis Indians, as the 8th-best prospect in Baseball 
America's 2010 rankings. In 66 games with the Indians, he hit .277 with 
13 home runs, 53 RBI and 4 stolen bases. Álvarez was called up to the MLB 
on June 16, 2010 and made his Major League debut against John Danks of 
the Chicago White Sox. He went 0-for-2 with a walk, a strikeout, and a 
run scored. His first Major League hit came against the Cleveland Indians 
on June 19, 2010, an RBI double over the left-field wall off Indians starter 
David Huff. The following several weeks of his career did not go so smoothly, 
however. He struck out at least once in each of his first 10 games, capped 
off by a 4-strikeout game in a 14-4 loss to the Oakland Athletics on June 
25, 2010. Pirates manager John Russell then gave him a day off.[12] His 
first Major League home run came against the Philadelphia Phillies on July 
3, 2010, a solo shot to left field off of Phillies starter Kyle Kendrick. 
Following his benching, Álvarez responded with an eight-game hitting streak 
from June 28 – July 6 that included 2 home runs, 3 runs scored and 4 RBI. 
Álvarez recorded his first career multi-homer game on July 20, 2010 against 
the Milwaukee Brewers. He hit a grand slam in the first inning off Brewers 
starter Dave Bush and then followed with a solo home run in the following 
inning. He finished the game 2-for-4 with two runs and five RBIs, helping 
the Pirates to an 11-9 win.[13] He hit two home runs again the next night 
against the Brewers, going 3-for-5 with 3 RBIs as part of a 15-3 Pirate 
victory. The home runs came against Milwaukee starter Randy Wolf and reliever 
Kameron Loe. After the game, Álvarez had raised his batting average over 
60 points, from .197 on July 9 to .259. "Obviously, those first few weeks, 
it's a million miles an hour, and as time goes on you get used to it a 
little bit more and more." said Álvarez of his early struggles. "It's very 
fun to go out there and play some good baseball and come out winning. It 
makes it that much better when you have a good day that you can celebrate 
with your teammates."[14][15] On August 7, 2010 Pedro hit a walk-off 3 
run home run against the Colorado Rockies closer Huston Street.[16] Álvarez 
was named National League Player of the Week for September 20–26 for his 
performances. He finished the week 10-for-24 (.417) with 2 home runs and 
13 RBIs.[17] Álvarez continued his hot streak, going 4-for-5 with 5 RBIs 
on September 30 against the Florida Marlins while raising his season batting 
average 8 points from .249 to .257.[18] Álvarez finished the season by 
winning the NL Rookie of the Month Award for September, hitting .311 and 
leading all Major League rookies with 26 RBIs in his final 27 games.[19] 
Álvarez did not immediately continue his late 2010 performance, compiling 
a .208 batting average and a .587 OPS in 36 games. On May 21, 2011 Álvarez 
was placed on the 15-day disabled list. After being reinstated from the 
DL on July 9, 2011 he was optioned to the AAA Indianapolis Indians. Álvarez 
decided not to spend the 2011–2012 offseason playing winter league ball.[citation 
needed] After the first nine games of the 2012 season, he struck out 13 
times in his first 27 at-bats. In an interleague series against the Cleveland 
Indians, Álvarez hit two home runs in back-to-back games on June 16 and 
17, making him only the second Pirates' player with multi-home run games 
in back-to-back games since 1918, with Ralph Kiner being the other player.[20] 
Álvarez hit a go-ahead home run in the 19th inning against the St. Louis 
Cardinals on August 19, the longest game in the majors to that point in 
the season and tied for the longest in terms of time at 6 hours, 7 minutes.[21] 
Álvarez hit a 469-ft home run, the longest hit by a Pittsburgh Pirate in 
the history of PNC Park at the time, in a two home run game against the 
St. Louis Cardinals on August 28.[22] Alvarez was selected to the National 
League All-Star team. He also participated in the Home Run Derby, where 
he hit six home runs. On September 13, he hit an inside-the-park home run. 
He finished the 2013 season with 36 home runs, which was tied for most 
in the National League and third-most in the majors, and 100 RBI, which 
was tied for fifth-most in the NL. On October 9, 2013, he became the first 
player in baseball history to record an RBI in each of his first 6 postseason 
games. The 2014 season saw Alvarez's defense struggle, with an MLB-leading 
24 errors by August 3. As a result, Alvarez was removed from the everyday 
lineup and utility player Josh Harrison received the starting job at third 
base for an indefinite time period. This led to the Pirates' considering 
a move for Alvarez from third base to first base in order to keep his offensive 
capabilities in the lineup. On August 18, Alvarez made his first Major 
League appearance at first base against the Atlanta Braves at PNC Park.[23][24] 
The Pirates announced on September 10 that Alvarez had been diagnosed with 
a stress fracture in his left foot stemming from an injury he sustained 
in-game on August 26.[25] He missed the remainder of the regular season, 
and was left off of the Wild Card Game roster against the San Francisco 
Giants. To begin the 2015 season, Álvarez transitioned to first base full-time. 
Álvarez played 150 games in 2015, hitting .243 with 27 HRs and 77 RBIs. 
However, he also made 23 errors in 124 games at first base. On December 
2, 2015, Álvarez was non-tendered by the Pirates, making him a free agent 
for the first time in his career.[26] On March 10, 2016, the Baltimore 
Orioles signed Álvarez to a one-year, $5.75 million deal, which also includes 
performance bonuses between $1.25 million and $1.5 million.[27] Alvarez 
got off to a slow start with the O's, as he was hitless in his first 12 
at-bats, while hitting only .182 over his first 15 games. His struggles 
continued, as he hit just .194 through the end of May while playing in 
34 games. On April 30, he had a season-high three hits and hit his first 
home run as an Oriole. On May 5th, Alvarez hit a walk off sacrifice fly 
in a 1-0 win over the Yankees. In June, Alvarez slashed .294/.333/.621 
and hit six homers to raise his average up to .230. At the All-Star break, 
he slashed .249/.320/.462 while hitting nine homers and driving in 26 runs. 
In August, Alvarez slashed .297/.357/.641 and hit six homers. On September 
2 in a 8-0 win over the Yankees, he hit his 20th home run of the season, 
becoming the six Oriole to hit 20+ homers on the year. It was his second 
career home run to land on Eutaw Street. Pedro has been married to his 
wife Keli since 2011. Keli is the daughter of former San Diego Padres manager
