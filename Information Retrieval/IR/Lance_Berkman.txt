William Lance Berkman (born February 10, 1976), nicknamed "Big Puma", is 
an American former professional baseball outfielder and first baseman. 
He played 14 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Houston Astros, 
New York Yankees, St. Louis Cardinals and Texas Rangers. Berkman is a six-time 
MLB All-Star and won a World Series championship and the National League 
Comeback Player of the Year Award with the Cardinals in 2011. He stands 
6 feet 1 inch (1.85 m), and weighs 220 pounds (100 kg). Berkman has spent 
various seasons of his career as a regular at all three outfield positions. 
A standout baseball player at Canyon High School, Berkman attended Rice 
University, where he played college baseball for the Owls. Named the 1997 
National College Player of the Year, the Astros selected Berkman in the 
first round of that year's amateur draft, and he debuted in the major leagues 
in 1999. He joined the Astros' vaunted "Killer B's" lineup that included 
Jeff Bagwell and Craig Biggio as all three players were instrumental in 
the club's playoff success. The Astros traded Berkman to the Yankees at 
the 2010 trade deadline. He signed with the Cardinals as a free agent for 
the 2011 and 2012 seasons. He played the 2013 season with the Rangers before 
signing a one-day contract with Houston to officially retire as an Astro. 
After his playing career, Berkman became a coach at Rice and at Second 
Baptist School. Active in charity work, Forbes recognized him on their 
list of "50 most generous celebrities" in 2012. He has led a group called 
"Berkman's Bunch," an outreach for 50 underprivileged kids to meet Berkman 
before each Saturday home game for autographs and other gifts. In 2013, 
he purchased a fire truck and donated it to the City of West, Texas, after 
the West Fertilizer Company explosion. Berkman was born in Waco, Texas, 
the son of Cynthia Ann (née Thomas) and Larry Gene Berkman.[1][2][3] His 
paternal grandfather, whose family's surname was originally "Bjorkman", 
was of Swedish descent.[3] Berkman graduated from Canyon High School in 
New Braunfels, Texas, in 1994. Berkman then attended Rice University playing 
on the Owls baseball team, where he was named the 1997 National College 
Player of the Year, playing for the legendary Wayne Graham, as well as 
named a first team All-America by Collegiate Baseball Magazine, Baseball 
America and The Sporting News.[4] He was invited to visit the White House 
and dined with President Clinton along with the rest of the Baseball America 
honorees. Throughout college, he batted a collective .385 with 67 home 
runs and 272 RBI. His 41 home runs in 1997 ranked third-most in NCAA history. 
That year he also made the all-time record book in RBIs (2nd-134), slugging 
percentage (6th-1.031) and total bases (4th-263) while leading the Rice 
Owls to their first College World Series appearance.[5] Berkman returned 
to Rice in 2014 to finish his degree.[6] The Houston Astros of Major League 
Baseball (MLB) selected Berkman in the first round, with the 16th overall 
selection, of the 1997 MLB draft. The team assigned him to play with the 
Kissimmee Cobras, their Class A-Advanced affiliate, of the Florida State 
League. In 53 games, he hit .293 with 12 home runs and 35 RBI. In 1998, 
his second minor league season, the Astros promoted Berkman to the Jackson 
Generals of the Class AA Southern League. His potential was beginning to 
show, as he hit .306 with 24 home runs and 89 RBI over 122 games. The Astros 
granted him a mid-season promotion to the New Orleans Zephyrs of the Class 
AAA Pacific Coast League. He played 17 games in New Orleans, and 1998 would 
prove to be his last full season in the minor leagues. In 1999, Berkman 
was midway through a great season in New Orleans when he was called up 
to the parent club, the Houston Astros. Prior to the promotion, he had 
been hitting .323 with 8 home runs and 49 RBI through 64 games. Throughout 
his entire high school, college, and minor league career, Berkman had almost 
exclusively played first base. The Astros, who called him up to the major 
leagues for the first time in 1999 and already had Jeff Bagwell entrenched 
at first, shifted Berkman to the outfield so he could regularly hit in 
the starting lineup. Because of his last name and reputation as a strong 
hitter, Berkman gained distinction as one of the Astros' "Killer B's" early 
in his career, which included Bagwell and Craig Biggio, two formidable 
veteran players who helped established the club as perennial playoff contenders 
in the 1990s and 2000s. In fact, journalist Dayn Perry jocosely noted in 
1999 that the Astros, "in pursuit of arcane history, used eight players 
whose last names began with 'B.'"[7] The eight included Bagwell, Paul Bako, 
Glen Barker, Derek Bell, Sean Bergman, Berkman, Biggio, and Tim Bogar.[8] 
After appearing in 34 games in 1999, Houston demoted Berkman to the minor 
leagues for more seasoning. The demotion proved brief, however; 31 games 
into the 2000 season, Houston again promoted Berkman. Moving from left 
field to right field, he dramatically increased his offensive production 
by hitting .297 with 21 HR and 67 RBI, resulting in him became a starter 
for the rest of his career in Houston. In 2001, Berkman hit .331, fourth 
in the National League (NL), posted a .430 on-base percentage (OBP) (5th 
in the NL), and drove in 126 runs (7th in the league). He also scored 110 
runs and hit 34 home runs, while his 55 doubles led the league. 2001 also 
marked his first All-Star appearance (he would repeat in 2002, 2004, 2006, 
and 2008) and he was 5th in Most Valuable Player voting.[9] 2002 saw his 
batting average drop to .292, although he kept his OBP high at .405. His 
power output increased also, resulting in 42 home runs. Berkman scored 
106 runs and drove in 128, good enough to lead the league. He made his 
second All-Star appearance and was third in the NL in the Most Valuable 
Player voting.[9] In 2003, Berkman's batting average dipped to .288, but 
his OBP remained high at .412. He hit 25 home runs, and drove in 93 runs, 
scoring 110. In the field, he played every game in left field, moving to 
center field once.[9] Berkman also continued his reputation for being colorful 
and outspoken, advocating for the use of instant replay in games.[10] In 
May 2004, Berkman produced a .785 slugging percentage with 24 RBI winning 
the National League Player of the Month honors for the first time in his 
career.[11] Berkman made the All-Star team, his third All-Star appearance,[9] 
and placed second in the 2004 Home Run Derby behind Miguel Tejada.[12] 
He hit the longest home run of the tournament at 497 feet (151 m).[13] 
Berkman's average for the season increased to .316 from the year before, 
and his OBP was .450, having walked 127 times. He hit 30 home runs, drove 
in 106, and scored 104 runs. He also hit 40 doubles and appeared in 160 
games, the most in his career for a single season. Defensively, Berkman 
split 2004 between left and right field. Berkman signed a six-year, $85-million 
deal in March 2005.[14] He moved to first base early in the 2005 season 
while Bagwell spent a significant portion of the season injured. Berkman 
ended the season with 24 home runs and 82 RBIs. In Game 4 of the 2005 National 
League Division Series against the Atlanta Braves, Berkman hit a grand 
slam in the 8th inning. That brought the score to 6–5 in favor of the Braves, 
but the game was tied in the next inning on a two-out solo home run by 
Brad Ausmus. The teams then battled for 9 more innings in what became the 
longest game in Major League Baseball playoff history, with the Astros 
eventually winning the game (and the series) in the bottom of the 18th 
inning on a Chris Burke home run. Burke had replaced Berkman as a pinch 
runner in the 10th. In the 2005 World Series, Berkman's first, the Astros 
were swept by the Chicago White Sox in four games, though Berkman compiled 
a .385 average with two doubles. His six RBIs during that series were the 
most of any of the Astros' hitters. On Mother's Day, May 14, 2006, Berkman 
was one of more than 50 hitters who brandished a pink bat to benefit the 
Breast Cancer Foundation.[15] On September 13, 2006, Berkman became only 
the second switch hitter in Major League history to hit 40 or more homers 
in multiple seasons, with Mickey Mantle being the first.[16] During the 
2006 season, Berkman hit 45 home runs and had 136 RBI. He broke the Astros' 
single season record for RBI, previously set by Bagwell in 1997 with 135.[17] 
He also had a .315 batting average, an on-base percentage of .420, as well 
as a slugging percentage of .621.[9] He also hit a career high 5 home runs 
from the right side of the plate.[18] He finished third in the MVP voting 
behind Ryan Howard and Albert Pujols.[19] Berkman started the 2007 season 
in a bit of a slump,[20] batting .261, well below his career average, but 
rebounded for a strong second half of the season. Berkman finished the 
2007 season with a .278 batting average, 34 home runs and 102 RBIs, along 
with 7 stolen bases. Berkman started the 2008 season batting well above 
.385 through April, won the NL Player of the Month in May and two separate 
Player of the Week awards, one which he went 29–32 (batted .906) with 6 
home runs, including a McCovey Cove splash landing.[21] At the All-Star 
break, he was in the NL's top four in batting average, with 22 home runs, 
and was on pace for 130+ RBIs. However, despite the rest of the team picking 
up steam behind the likes of Roy Oswalt, Wandy Rodríguez, Hunter Pence, 
and Ty Wigginton's rebound second half, Berkman's individual performance 
dipped significantly, and by season's end, he batted .312, with 29 home 
runs (7 of which were right-handed, setting a new career high), and 106 
RBI. Berkman was fifth in the voting for the 2008 NL MVP award, behind 
Albert Pujols, Ryan Howard, Ryan Braun, and Manny Ramirez.[22] Berkman 
hit his 300th home run against Arizona Diamondbacks starter Jon Garland 
on June 13, 2009.[23] On July 31, 2010, Berkman was traded to the New York 
Yankees for minor leaguers Jimmy Paredes and Mark Melancon.[24][25] He 
served as both a designated hitter and back-up first baseman during his 
tenure with New York. During the 2010 ALCS, Berkman served first base for 
the rest of the post-season when Mark Teixeira went on the disabled list 
due to a hamstring injury. The Yankees eventually lost the ALCS to the 
Texas Rangers in 6 games. The Yankees announced on October 27 that the 
club declined to exercise their option for Berkman for 2011.[26] Berkman 
was under contract with the Cardinals for the 2011 and 2012 seasons. On 
July 5, 2011, Berkman hit his 350th career home run, and his long-ball 
was the second farthest home run ever hit in the new Busch Stadium. 2011 
became a comeback year for Berkman, as he was one of the team leaders in 
batting average, home runs and RBI. He was named the NL Comeback Player 
of the Year. Berkman made key contributions in Game 6 of the 2011 World 
Series vs the Texas Rangers. He hit his first home run in a World Series 
game in the first inning and in the ninth, with St. Louis down to their 
final strike before elimination, Berkman was driven home followed by Albert 
Pujols after a game-tying 2-run triple by David Freese.[27] After Texas 
scored two runs in the top of the tenth and Ryan Theriot hit a run-scoring 
groundout, Berkman hit a two-out two-strike RBI single scoring Jon Jay 
to tie the game. Berkman won his first World Series championship as the 
Cardinals defeated the Texas Rangers in the series in 7 games. On April 
22, 2012, Berkman was placed on the disabled list due to a calf injury. 
On May 21, 2012, Berkman was again placed on the disabled list due to right 
knee injury. An MRI revealed that there was significant cartilage damage 
to both sides of the knee and a torn meniscus, requiring arthroscopic surgery. 
Berkman returned on July 14, 2012. He was then placed on the 15-day disabled 
list on August 3, 2012 due to knee inflammation. It was the third time 
Berkman went on the DL in the 2012 season. On September 10, 2012, he was 
again put on the disabled list after having to go for a secondary meniscus 
surgery in the same knee. On October, 3rd, 2012, Berkman had his last at 
bat as a Cardinal. He spent the 2012 postseason on the physically unable 
to perform list as the Cardinals won the 2012 NLDS against the Washington 
Nationals but lost the 2012 NLCS against the San Francisco Giants. On January 
5, 2013, Berkman agreed to a one-year contract with the Texas Rangers for 
approximately $10 million.[28] On October 31, the Rangers declined his 
option, which made him a free agent.[29] On January 29, 2014, he decided 
to retire.[30] Berkman, along with former teammate Roy Oswalt signed a 
one-day contract with Houston to officially retire as Astros on April 5, 
2014.[31] In 2009, Berkman stated that after his major league career he 
would like to coach baseball at the University of Texas at Austin even 
though he attended Rice University. Since he didn't finish his degree at 
Rice, he would need to return to school and complete three more semesters 
to earn a business degree with a minor in sports management. He hypothesized 
then that "I know [Texas Coach Augie] Garrido's going to coach four or 
five more years. I figured that might dovetail nicely with the end of my 
career." [32] With Berkman's retirement in 2014, however, it is at his 
alma mater, Rice, that the former Owl has spent time assisting young hitters. 
Rice Coach Wayne Graham has made clear that Rice would be interested, stating 
that "[i]t sounds like he wants to coach. Hopefully at one time or another 
it will be here. We’ll manage to always find a place for him."[33] As of 
2015, Berkman is serving as the head baseball coach at Second Baptist School 
in Houston, Texas, along with his former Astros teammate Andy Pettitte 
serving as assistant coach.[34] Notes: Per Baseball-Reference.com. Berkman 
and his wife, Cara, live in Houston with their four daughters. Berkman 
has been very outspoken about his Christian beliefs throughout his career.[37][38] 
Berkman uses his position as a professional athlete to discuss his religious 
beliefs with others. He told The 700 Club in May 2007: "What you’re running 
after, what you’re trying to find will not provide you with any lasting 
fulfillment. The only place you can find that is Jesus Christ. It's in 
the service of God you’ll find that lasting fulfillment."[39] In 2001, 
Berkman began leading a charity called "Berkman's Bunch" where 50 underprivileged 
kids could meet Berkman before each Saturday home game for autographs and 
other gifts.[40] In April 2012, Forbes named Berkman one of the 30 most 
generous celebrities as he and his wife had donated $2,412,245 to a foundation 
they established called To The Lord's Fund.[41] In July 2013, Berkman purchased 
a fire truck and had it overhauled by the City of Arlington. He then donated 
it to the City of West, Texas, in the wake of the West Fertilizer Company 
explosion that took place earlier in the year. The fire truck is white 
with a red Maltese cross on the doors and the name Berkman over the cross 
with his number "17" encircled within the cross.[42] Berkman filmed an 
advertisement against Houston Equal Rights Ordinance, which was aimed at 
protecting LGBT individuals from discrimination but also controversially 
sought to remove gender restrictions on public city bathrooms. The ordinance 
was widely rejected by Houston voters in a ballot initiative in November 
2015.[43][44][45] He is most popularly known as "Fat Elvis" and "The Big 
Puma." Before the 2006 season started, in an interview with a local Houston 
sports radio station, Lance joked "I'm more like a puma so I'm not sure 
why people call me Fat Elvis."[46] The show's hosts, John Granato and Lance 
Zierlein, ran with the moniker and Houston fans and media latched onto 
"The Big Puma." When questioned further, Berkman explained the nickname 
is simply logical. "Agile, athletic, sleek ... all the things that describe 
my game", he said, somewhat tongue-in-cheek.[47] With his outstanding start 
in 2008, this nickname also became known on a national level.[48] That 
same year, a Lance Berkman fan club calling themselves "The Little Pumas" 
emerged. During Berkman's long tenure with the Astros, they could be seen 
wearing puma costumes and foam puma paws at most Astros home games near 
the Conoco Pump in left-center field. The group became relatively well-known 
among Astros fans, as they were shown often during Astros broadcasts on 
Fox Sports Houston.[49] Berkman was also one of the Astros' "Killer B's" 
in the mid-2000s, along with Jeff Bagwell, Carlos Beltrán, Craig Biggio,
