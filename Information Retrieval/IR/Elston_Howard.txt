As player As coach Elston Gene "Ellie" Howard (February 23, 1929 â€“ December 
14, 1980) was an American professional baseball catcher, left fielder and 
coach. During a 14-year baseball career, he played in the Negro leagues 
and Major League Baseball from 1948 through 1968, primarily for the New 
York Yankees. He also played for the Kansas City Monarchs and the Boston 
Red Sox. The first African American player on the Yankees roster in 1955, 
he was named the American League's Most Valuable Player for the 1963 pennant 
winners after finishing third in the league in slugging average and fifth 
in home runs, becoming the first black player in AL history to win the 
honor. He won Gold Glove Awards in 1963 and 1964, in the latter season 
setting AL records for putouts and total chances in a season. His lifetime 
fielding percentage of .993 was a major league record from 1967 to 1973, 
and he retired among the AL career leaders in putouts (7th, 6,447) and 
total chances (9th, 6,977). One of the most regular World Series participants 
in history, he appeared in ten of them, winning four, and ranks among Series 
career leaders in several categories. He also won two World Series as a 
coach. His lifetime slugging average of .427 ranked fourth among AL catchers 
at the time of his retirement. Howard was born in St. Louis, Missouri to 
Travis Howard and Emaline Hill, a nurse at a local hospital. At the age 
of six, his parents divorced and his mother remarried.[1] Howard was a 
standout athlete at Vashon High School. In 1948, the nineteen-year-old 
turned down scholarship offers from Big Ten universities, instead entering 
the Negro Leagues, playing for the Kansas City Monarchs, under manager 
Buck O'Neil, for three years as an outfielder, and rooming with Ernie Banks. 
He was signed by the Yankees on July 19, 1950, after being purchased along 
with Frank Barnes and they were assigned to the Muskegon Clippers, the 
Yankees' farm team in the Central League. Howard missed the 1951 and 1952 
seasons due to his military service in the United States Army. In 1953, 
Howard played for the Kansas City Blues of the Class AAA American Association. 
The next year, the Yankees invited Howard to spring training and began 
to convert him into a catcher, despite the presence of Yogi Berra as the 
Yankees' starting catcher.[2] He played for the Toronto Maple Leafs of 
the Class AAA International League in 1954. He led the league in triples 
and won the league's MVP award. The Yankees assigned Bill Dickey to work 
with Howard in order to develop his catching skills.[3] Howard made the 
Yankees' major league roster at the start of the 1955 season. On April 
14, 1955, the second game of the season, Howard made his major league debut, 
entering the game as a left fielder in the sixth inning. Howard hit a single 
in his only plate appearance of the day. He became the first African American 
to play for the Yankees.[2] Howard was known to be very slow afoot. This 
caused Casey Stengel, the Yankees' manager, to say, "Well, when they finally 
get me a nigger, I get the only one who can't run." When Howard first came 
to the Yankees, Stengel referred to him as "Eightball".[4] Howard made 
his first start on April 28,[2] as it was difficult to find room for Howard 
in the lineup; Berra won his third MVP award in 1955, and Mickey Mantle 
and Hank Bauer were solid outfield regulars. Stengel used Howard as a backup 
catcher and occasional outfielder, competing for playing time with Norm 
Siebern and Enos Slaughter. He hit .290 with 10 home runs and 43 runs batted 
in (RBIs) in 97 games played for the season.[2] In the 1955 World Series 
against the Brooklyn Dodgers, Howard hit a home run in his first at bat, 
off Don Newcombe in the second inning of Game 1, which tied the game 2-2; 
the Yankees won 6-5, but it was Howard's ground ball out to Pee Wee Reese 
in Game 7 that ended the Series, the first time in six meetings that the 
Yankees lost to Brooklyn. In the 1956 World Series against Brooklyn he 
played only in Game 7, but his solo home run off Newcombe in the fourth 
inning was one of four Yankee HRs in the 9-0 victory. Against the Milwaukee 
Braves in the 1957 World Series, his three-run homer off Warren Spahn with 
two outs in the ninth inning of Game 4 tied the score 4-4, though Milwaukee 
won 7-5 in the 10th inning. As the Yankees again met the Braves in the 
1958 World Series, his impact did not become notable until Game 5, when 
he caught Red Schoendienst's sinking fly ball in the sixth inning and made 
a throw to catch Bill Bruton off first base for a double play, preserving 
a 1-0 lead. In Game 6, he threw Andy Pafko out at the plate in the second 
inning, and singled and scored with two out in the tenth inning for a 4-2 
Yankee lead; the run proved decisive, as the Braves came back to score 
once in the bottom of the frame. In Game 7, his two-out RBI single scored 
Berra for a 3-2 lead in the eighth inning, with New York going on to a 
6-2 win, completing only the second comeback by a team from a 3-1 deficit 
in a Series. Howard was later given the Babe Ruth Award, presented by the 
New York chapter of the Baseball Writers' Association of America, as the 
top player in the Series, although the World Series MVP Award was won by 
teammate Bob Turley. By 1959, Howard was often playing at first base in 
order to remain in the lineup. Despite not finding a regular position yet, 
he was first selected to the All-Star team in 1957, the first of nine consecutive 
years through 1965 in which he made the squad; he would appear in six of 
the games (1960 to 1964), including both 1961 contests. In 1960, Howard 
finally took over the majority of the catching duties from Berra, although 
his .245 batting average was his lowest to date. The Yankees met the Pittsburgh 
Pirates in the 1960 World Series, and Howard's two-run pinch-hit homer 
off Roy Face in the ninth inning of Game 1 brought the Yankees within two 
runs, though they lost 6-4. Howard hit .462 in the Series, but did not 
play in Game 7 after being hit on the hand by a pitch in the second inning 
of Game 6, and could only watch as the Pirates won the Series, 10-9, on 
Bill Mazeroski's home run leading off the bottom of the ninth. In 1961 
he raised his average 103 points to a career-best .348 mark on a team that 
featured Roger Maris' record 61-home run season; Howard also enjoyed his 
first 20-homer campaign, along with 77 RBI, as the Yankees set a major 
league record with 240 HRs. He finished tenth in the MVP voting that year, 
won by Maris. Meeting the Cincinnati Reds in the 1961 Series, he and Bill 
Skowron had solo home runs in the 2-0 Game 1 victory, and he scored three 
runs in the final 13-5 win in Game 5. He followed up with a 1962 season 
in which he batted .279 with a career-best 91 RBI, again hitting over 20 
homers, and collecting eight RBI in an August 19 game in Kansas City which 
the Yankees won, 21-7. Although Howard batted only .143 in the 1962 World 
Series against the San Francisco Giants, the Yankees won in seven games. 
In his 1963 MVP season, he batted .287 with 28 home runs, 85 RBI and a 
.528 slugging average, also winning his first Gold Glove. The Yankees were 
swept by the Los Angeles Dodgers in the 1963 Series, though Howard hit 
.333 and drove in the only Yankee run of Game 2. He batted .313 (just ten 
points behind batting champion Tony Oliva) with 84 RBI in 1964, again winning 
the Gold Glove and placing third in the MVP vote as Berra took over Ralph 
Houk's post as manager. His totals of 939 putouts and 1,008 total chances 
broke the AL records of 872 and 963 set by Earl Battey with the 1962 Minnesota 
Twins; Bill Freehan would top Howard's marks with the 1967 Detroit Tigers. 
Howard also led the AL in fielding average in 1964 with a .998 mark. Playing 
in his ninth World Series in ten years against the St. Louis Cardinals, 
he batted .292 though the Yankees were overcome in seven games; he tied 
a Series record with three passed balls, including two in the 9-5 Game 
1 loss. In 1965, Howard injured his elbow during spring training. He played 
in four games through April, and then had surgery, missing five more weeks.[5] 
Howard struggled in 1967. Backing up Jake Gibbs, Howard batted only .198 
through the start of August. On August 3, 1967, Howard was traded to the 
Boston Red Sox for Pete Magrini and a player to be named later (Ron Klimkowski).[6] 
Though he batted only .147 for Boston, he was effective in handling the 
pitchers; teammate Tony Conigliaro noted, "I don't think I ever saw a pitcher 
shake off one of his signs. They had too much respect for him." In 1967, 
Howard also took over Sherm Lollar's major-league record for career fielding 
average; Freehan moved ahead of him in 1973. Howard had his last postseason 
highlight in the 1967 World Series against the Cardinals when his bases-loaded 
single in the ninth inning of Game 5 drove in two runs for a 3-0 lead. 
The hit was crucial, as former teammate Maris homered in the bottom of 
the inning for the Cardinals before the Red Sox closed out the 3-1 win. 
St. Louis, however, won the Series in seven games. It was the sixth losing 
World Series team Howard played on; he and Pee Wee Reese have the dubious 
distinction for playing on the most losing World Series teams. On October 
29, 1968, Howard was released by the Red Sox. Over his 14-year career, 
he batted .274 with 167 home runs, 1,471 hits, 762 RBI, 619 runs, 218 doubles, 
50 triples and nine stolen bases in 1,605 games. His .427 slugging average 
trailed those of only Dickey (.486), Berra (.482) and Mickey Cochrane (.478) 
among AL catchers. His 54 total World Series games placed him behind only 
teammates Berra and Mantle. Howard is also credited with being the first 
to use the extended index and pinky finger (corna) to indicate that there 
were two out in the inning, this being more visible to teammates in the 
outfield than the usual "two" gesture of the index and middle fingers. 
The next year he returned to the Yankees, where he served as first-base 
coach from 1969 to 1979. He was the first black coach in the American League. 
The team became World Series champions in 1977 and 1978 and AL champions 
in 1976. In 1977 during a game against the Boston Red Sox at Fenway Park, 
Howard and Yogi Berra were peacemakers during a dugout incident between 
Yankees player Reggie Jackson and Yankees manager Billy Martin. After his 
coaching career ended, he became an administrative assistant with the Yankees; 
however, that position did not last long owing to declining health. Howard 
was diagnosed with myocarditis, a rare heart disease which causes rapid 
heart failure.[7] He was considering a heart transplant, but his condition 
quickly deteriorated.[7] After staying a week at Columbia Presbyterian 
Hospital in New York City, Howard died of the heart ailment in 1980. He 
was interred at George Washington Memorial Park in Paramus, New Jersey. 
Red Smith, a columnist for The New York Times, reacted by writing, "The 
Yankees' organization lost more class on the weekend than George Steinbrenner 
could buy in 10 years."[8] In Howard's memory, the Yankees wore black armbands 
on their sleeve during the 1981 season. On July 21, 1984, the Yankees retired 
Howard's uniform number 32 and dedicated a plaque in his honor for Monument 
Park at Yankee Stadium. On that day the Yankees also gave the same honors 
to Maris who, unlike Howard, was still living. Howard's plaque describes 
him as "A man of great gentleness and dignity" and "one of the truly great 
Yankees." Howard is credited with inventing the batting "donut", a circular 
lead weight with a rubber shell used by waiting batters in the on-deck 
circle by placing it around a bat to make it feel heavier, so that the 
bat will feel lighter at the plate and easier to swing. Its widespread 
use caused the discontinuation of the practice of hitters swinging multiple 
bats at the same time while waiting to hit. Howard helped two New Jersey 
entrepreneurs, Frank Hamilton and Vince Salvucci, to market the bat weight 
and lent his name to the product.Template:Elston and Me: The Story of the
