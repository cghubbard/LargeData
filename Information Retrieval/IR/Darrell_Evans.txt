Darrell Wayne Evans (born May 26, 1947) is a former third baseman and first 
baseman in Major League Baseball who played from 1969 to 1989 with the 
Atlanta Braves (1969–76, 1989), San Francisco Giants (1976–83) and Detroit 
Tigers (1984–88). He is also the former manager and director of player 
personnel for the Victoria Seals of the Golden Baseball League. Overshadowed 
in his prime by fellow National League third baseman Mike Schmidt, he has 
been described by author Bill James as "the most underrated player in baseball 
history, absolutely number one on the list",[1] primarily because his defensive 
skill, home run power, and ability to draw walks in a long career were 
offset by a low career batting average of .248. He remains one of the few 
players to have hit over 400 career home runs without being seriously considered 
for induction into the Baseball Hall Of Fame. Evans became the first player 
to hit 40 home runs in both leagues, and at age 38 became the oldest player 
ever to lead the American League in home runs (40 in 1985). Evans hit over 
20 home runs in 10 different seasons and drew over 100 walks five times, 
with a career high 126 in 1974. He currently ranks 11th all-time in walks 
among major leaguers, ahead of the likes of Pete Rose, Willie Mays, Stan 
Musial and Hank Aaron. In 1988, Evans hit his 400th home run, becoming 
the 22nd player to reach that milestone. He retired after having joined 
Reggie Jackson in becoming only the second player to hit 100 home runs 
with three different teams, and ranking in 11th place among all-time walks 
leaders. Evans hit 60 home runs after reaching age 40, at the time a major 
league record. He later served as a coach with the New York Yankees in 
1990. A two-time All-Star (1973 and 1983), Evans was selected as the third 
baseman on the 1973 Sporting News National League All-Star team. He won 
the 1983 Willie Mac Award for his spirit and leadership. He earned a World 
Series ring with the 1984 Detroit Tigers. Evans began his minor league 
managing career with the Tyler (Texas) Wildcatters in the Texas-Louisiana 
league in 1997. Evans worked for a time as the manager for the Long Beach 
Armada, a team in the independent Golden Baseball League for which José 
Canseco once played. He managed the Armada to the GBL championship series 
in his final year with the team in 2007. On November 25, 2008, Evans became 
the first manager and director of player personnel for the expansion Victoria 
Seals of the Golden Baseball League. The team began play in April 2009.[2] 
On March 3, 2010 Evans was fired as the Manager of the Victoria Seals.[3] 
Evans currently manages the St. George RoadRunners in the Golden Baseball 
League.[4] In 2009 Evans managed the Palm Springs Chill in the California 
Winter League.[5] He is currently the commissioner of the league.[6] Evans
