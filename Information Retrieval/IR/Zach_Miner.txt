Zachary Charles "Zach" Miner (born March 12, 1982) is an American professional 
baseball relief pitcher who is currently a free agent. Standing at 6 foot 
3 inches and 205 pounds, Miner had no previous college experience before 
playing minor and major league baseball. He did, however, play high school 
baseball for Palm Beach Gardens Community High School. Miner was a fourth 
round pick by the Atlanta Braves, and in 2000, he received the second-team 
All-American pitcher award, and had been offered a full ride to Miami University.[1] 
Miner spent 2001–2004 in the Braves minor league system, pitching for the 
Single-A Jamestown Jammers (2001), Class-A Macon Braves (2002), Single-A 
Myrtle Beach Pelicans (2003), and Double-A Greenville Braves (2004). 2005 
found him with the Double-A Mississippi Braves, but after four games he 
was promoted to the Triple-A Richmond Braves. Miner started 17 games for 
the Braves, going 2–7 with a 4.23 ERA. On July 31, 2005, the Braves traded 
Miner along with relief pitcher Román Colón to the Detroit Tigers for setup 
man/closer Kyle Farnsworth.[2] Miner did not make the 25-man roster at 
the end of the 2006 spring training, but he was called up to the Tigers 
in May 2006 to replace the injured Mike Maroth. He was a reliable 5th starter 
but was moved to the bullpen near the end of the season. He was on the 
Tigers playoff roster as a reliever. He pitched once in the 2006 World 
Series against the St. Louis Cardinals. In 2007 Zach started the season 
in Triple A Toledo, but was called up on May 17, and made a spot start 
against the Boston Red Sox in place of the sick Mike Maroth. After a brief 
return to Toledo, Miner was called up to help in the bullpen. He finished 
the season 3–4 while pitching in 34 games. Zach allowed 2 runs, 18 earned, 
through 53⅔ innings. Miner started the 2008 season with the Tigers, but 
was sent to Toledo July 2 after walking four batters in two innings in 
a loss to the Minnesota Twins.[3] On July 21, Miner returned to the Tigers 
as a starter against the Kansas City Royals. Miner pitched six shutout 
innings in the Tigers 19–4 victory.[4] In April 2009, Miner came off a 
strong start in his first outing of the season to being roughed up in his 
second outing against the White Sox. In this game, he allowed back to back 
home runs to Jermaine Dye and Paul Konerko - the 300th of each man's career.[5] 
Miner underwent Tommy John surgery in June, 2010 and missed the entire 
2010 season, after which he was designated for assignment.[6] Miner signed 
a minor league contract with the Kansas City Royals on December 31, 2010.[7] 
On April 20, 2012, Miner was traded back to the Detroit Tigers for cash 
considerations.[8] Miner signed a minor league contract with Philadelphia 
in December 2012.[9] He received a call up to the big leagues on August 
3, and on September 20, joined the Phillies starting rotation after Kyle 
Kendrick was shut down for the remainder of the season. He elected free 
agency on October 8.[10] He was outrighted off the roster on October 3, 
2013. Miner signed a minor league deal with the Seattle Mariners on February
