1963 to 1973 for the St. Louis Cardinals, Houston Colt .45s/Astros, Milwaukee/Atlanta

in Grove, Oklahoma[1] and Oklahoma State University before being signed 
by the Cardinals in 1957. He was the father of former minor league baseball 
player Kash Beauchamp. He was 6'2' and weighed 205 pounds. He is a direct 
descendant of John Beauchamp of the Plymouth Company and pronounced his 
name as /ˈbiː-tʃʌm/ (BE-chum). A power hitting minor leaguer, Beauchamp 
had perhaps the best year of his professional career in 1963 for the Double-A 
Tulsa Oilers, batting .337 with 31 home runs and 105 RBI. He also collected 
35 doubles and 10 triples while scoring 95 runs. Beauchamp won the 1963 
Texas League MVP Award, and a sign showing him in his batting stance stood 
outside Tulsa's Oiler Park until the stadium was demolished in 1980.[1] 
He earned a short call up to the majors in 1963, making his major league 
debut on September 22 at the age of 24, going hitless in three major league 
at-bats. Beauchamp was traded to the Houston Colt .45s in February 1964

hit .319 with 25 home runs and 77 RBI in 115 games for the Richmond Braves 
in 1966. He did not appear in the Majors that season. He spent most of 
the 1967 season in the minors as well, hitting 25 home runs and driving 
in 63 runs for Richmond. His averaged dropped to .233. He appeared in four 
games in the Majors for the Braves that year, collecting no hits in three

and Dooley Womack. He hit .192 in 31 games for the Astros that year, and 
was traded to the Cardinals – another one of his former teams. He was sent 
with Leon McFadden to the Cardinals for George Culver. He hit .259 in 44 
games for the Cardinals, and overall he hit .238 on the season. He spent 
all of 1971 with the Cardinals, hitting .235 in 77 games. After the season, 
he was traded by the Cardinals with Chip Coulter, Harry Parker, and Chuck 
Taylor to the Mets for Art Shamsky, Jim Bibby, Rich Folkers, and Charlie 
Hudson.[2] He played his final two seasons with the Mets, hitting .242 
in 58 games for them in 1972 and .279 in 50 games in 1973. He played his 
final game on September 20, 1973, almost exactly 10 years after his big 
league debut. Beauchamp appeared in four games in the 1973 World Series 
for the Mets, going hitless in four at-bats. He was released by the Mets 
in March of 1974. Overall, Beauchamp played in 393 Major League games, 
collecting 153 hits in 661 at-bats for a .231 batting average. He hit 18 
doubles, four triples and 14 home runs while driving in 90 RBI. He walked 
54 times and struck out 150 times. He had a .979 fielding percentage. After 
his playing days ended, Beauchamp managed in the minors from 1975 to 1990. 
He managed the Columbus Astros in 1975, the Memphis Blues in 1976, the 
Charleston Charlies from 1977 to 1979, the Syracuse Chiefs from 1982 to 
1984, the Greenville Braves from 1985 to 1987 and the Richmond Braves from 
1988 to 1990. From 1991 to 2001, he was the Atlanta Braves' bench coach, 
and after 2002 he was the team's minor league outfield coordinator. In 
2002, Beauchamp was present with family and friends when he was honored 
in his hometown of Grove, Oklahoma by naming the new Grove City Baseball 
Field after him nearly five decades after his high school graduation. "Jim 
Beauchamp Field" is home to the Qualate-Pritchard American Legion Baseball 
team, and the Ridgerunner Baseball team of Grove High School, where Beauchamp 
was an Oklahoma All-State Athlete. Beauchamp's boyhood home was across 
the street where the new ballpark now stands. After the presentation, an 
emotional Beauchamp expressed to those present that it was the highest 
honor he had ever received. Coincidentally, "beau champ" in French translates 
as "beautiful field." On Christmas Day, 2007, Beauchamp died following 
a long battle with leukemia at the age of 68. In his honor, the Atlanta 
Braves wore a memorial patch emblazoned with his nickname, "Beach", during 
the 2008 season. He was survived by his wife Pam; five children Kash, Tim, 
Ann Rene, Shanna and Lauren; six grandchildren; sister Patti Crockett;
