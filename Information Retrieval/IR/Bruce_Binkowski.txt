Robert Bruce "Bink" Binkowski (born April 6, 1949) is the retired executive 
director ][1] of the San Diego Bowl Game Association (SDBGA) which annually 
produces two major college football bowl games, the Holiday Bowl[2] and 
the Poinsettia Bowl.[3] A native of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Binkowski 
moved with his family to San Diego in 1960. He attended San Diego City 
College majoring in radio broadcasting and graduated in 1971 from the University 
of San Diego with a degree in United States History. Binkowski retired 
in early 2016 after working for 38 years with the SDBGA and was the first 
paid employee of the Holiday Bowl for the inaugural game in 1978. He began 
as the part-time Public Relations Director (1978–84); then began his full-time 
employment with the bowl game in 1985 as Director of Marketing and Public 
Relations (1985–93). As the bowl game grew in stature and prestige Binkowski’s 
expertise in managing one of America’s Most Exciting Bowl Games, (a label 
the Holiday Bowl earned after the 1980 game) he was named Assistant Executive 
Director (1994–96), then Associate Executive Director (1997-2000). Binkowski 
took over managing the bowl game as Executive Director[4] in 2001. With 
his new position and responsibilities as Executive Director, Binkowski 
had to give up a 36-year career as a public address announcer, which began 
in high school in 1965. Binkowski’s skill set has allowed him to wear many 
hats during the years including public address announcer, public relations, 
morning sports radio, and a short stint as a radio DJ. His voice is highly 
recognizable and during those years he gained the reputation as the “Voice 
of San Diego”. He can be heard on a posted YouTube video announcing the 
starting lineup for MLB's 1992 All Star Game held at San Diego's Jack Murphy 
Stadium. Binkowski started his public address career as a senior in high 
school in December 1965, working a Christmas basketball tournament at the 
University of San Diego High School. In the summer of 1968 Binkowski worked 
at SeaWorld as a dolphin show announcer. In 1973, Binkowski began working 
as a backup public address announcer for San Diego Padres baseball games. 
He was the backup through 1985 and began as the full-time Padres public 
address announcer in 1986, working 1,101 consecutive games through the 
1999 season. He was also the public address announcer for the NFL San Diego 
Chargers beginning in 1977 and continued through 1999. Binkowski announced 
San Diego State football and basketball games between 1980 and 2000. He 
was public address announcer for the San Diego Mariners (World Hockey Association), 
San Diego Clippers (NBA), San Diego Friars (World Team Tennis), San Diego 
Sockers (North American Soccer League, Major Indoor Soccer League). In 
1988, Binkowski made a cameo appearance as a "Daddy" in the cult classic 
Return of the Killer Tomatoes.[5] Binkowski’s philosophy as an announcer 
was not to be a cheerleader, but to be part of the game. During a Public 
Address Seminar[6] he taught in San Diego for over 50 practicing announcers, 
he stated, “the biggest compliment I get is when people tell me they really 
didn’t notice my announcing. That would tell me I was giving them the information 
and not trying to put on a show. The best announcer is one no one notices.” 
Binkowski credits his style as being patterned after John Ramsey, a longtime 
voice of the Los Angeles Angels, Oakland Raiders, Los Angeles Lakers, Los 
Angeles Rams, and Los Angeles Dodgers. Binkowski was the public address 
announcer for the San Diego Padres in the 1984 and 1998 World Series; the 
1992 All-Star Baseball Game in San Diego; and the 1988 and 1993 Super Bowl 
games. He was also the public address announcer for the Western Athletic 
Conference basketball tournament (1992-1998). Binkowski began his radio 
broadcasting career as a DJ in 1969 for San Diego radio stations KFMX. 
In 1984-85 he was a weekend newscaster at KOGO-AM and a weekend country 
music DJ in 1986-87 for KSON-FM. In September 1987, while continuing his 
Holiday Bowl duties, Binkowski worked as a morning sports reporter for 
KSDO 1130 AM and KOGO radio stations in San Diego, a position he held until 
2000. He began his sports career as a public relations assistant with the 
San Diego Rockets of the National Basketball Association in 1970-71. The 
franchise moved to Houston, Texas, in the summer of 1971, and Binkowski 
served in the same capacity for the Houston Rockets for the 1971-72 season. 
In the summer of 1972, Binkowski was hired as public relations director 
of the San Diego Gulls of the Western Hockey League. When the Gulls and 
the Western Hockey League ceased operations in 1974, Binkowski was then 
hired by the San Diego Conquistadors of the American Basketball Association. 
The Conquistadors disbanded in the summer of 1975 and Binkowski worked 
as an advertising manager of a local weekly newspaper until he was hired 
as the Public Relations Director of the San Diego Mariners of the World 
Hockey Association in January 1977, a position he held until the team disbanded 
in May of that year. As a public address announcer, he has witnessed some 
of the most memorable moments in San Diego sports history including the 
Chargers-Raiders “Holy Roller” (1978), San Diego Chicken Grand Hatching 
(1979), Steve Garvey's walk-off home run in game 5 of the 1984 playoffs 
against the Cubs, and Roseanne Barr's infamous National Anthem (1990). 
Perhaps his most memorable moment came in 1999 as part of his last game 
as announcer for the San Diego Padres. While preparing for the ceremony, 
he noticed the new announcer carrying a brand-new microphone. He mentioned 
to his wife Christina that despite announcing 1,101 games, “he” never received 
a new microphone. As part of the gifts he received that day (including 
a signed jersey by the Padres, a San Diego City proclamation declaring 
April 6, 1999 as Bruce Binkowski Day and a Gold Rolex watch) was “his” 
microphone cast in bronze, commemorating his 1,101 games. It was truly 
a special and memorable moment for the “Voice of San Diego”. In 2013, Binkowski 
marked a 40-year career working at Qualcomm Stadium a place where he has 
called his home away from home. He has clocked over 75,000 hours working 
at the stadium. During Binkowski’s tenure as executive director of the 
San Diego Bowl Game Association, a second game, the Poinsettia Bowl, was 
created in 2005 and has become very successful. Producing two nationally 
recognized bowl games within a week of each other every December is ample 
proof of Binkowski's skills as a manager and organizer of his staff. The 
SDBGA is an organization that manages, along with the two bowl games, various 
festivities during the year including; Jack-in-the-Box Hoops at the Beach 
3 on 3 basketball tournament, Golf Tournament, Weiner Dog races, a Million 
Dollar Hole in One contest, Big Bay Balloon Parade and provide hospitality 
to the visiting football teams annually. It has a staff of 8, 150 Committee 
and Board members known as the Redcoat Committee and over 1500 volunteers.
