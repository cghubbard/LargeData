The 1959 San Francisco Giants season was the Giants' 77th year in Major 
League Baseball and their second year in San Francisco since their move 
from New York following the 1957 season. The team finished in third place 
in the National League with an 83-71 record, 4 games behind the World Champion 
Los Angeles Dodgers. It was the team's second and final season at Seals 
Stadium before moving their games to Candlestick Park the following season. 
In his major league debut on July 30, Willie McCovey went four-for-four 
against future Hall-of-Famer Robin Roberts en route to a .354 batting average. 
McCovey went on to win National League Rookie of the Year honors while 
playing in just 52 games. Infielders Other batters Coaches Note: Pos =
