The 1949 Cleveland Indians season was the 49th in franchise history. The 
club entered the season as the defending World Champions. On March 5, 1949, 
Indians minority owner Bob Hope donned a Cleveland Indians uniform and 
posed with manager Lou Boudreau and vice president Hank Greenberg as the 
World Series champions opened spring training camp in Tucson, Arizona.[1] 
During the season, Indians fan Charlie Lupica spent 117 days on a flagpole, 
waiting for the Indians to regain first place. They never did, and he gave 
up his pursuit when the Indians were mathematically eliminated on September 
25.[6] [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] Infielders Other batters Coaches
