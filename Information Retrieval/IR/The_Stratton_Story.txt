The Stratton Story is a 1949 film directed by Sam Wood which tells the 
true story of Monty Stratton, a Major League Baseball pitcher who pitched 
for the Chicago White Sox from 1934-1938. This is the first of three movies 
that paired stars Jimmy Stewart and June Allyson, the others being The 
Glenn Miller Story and Strategic Air Command. Stratton commented that Mr. 
Stewart "did a great job of playing me, in a picture which I figure was 
about as true to life as they could make it". The Stratton Story was a 
financial success and won the Academy Award for best Writing â€” Motion Picture 
Story. Texas farm boy Monty Stratton (Stewart) demonstrates a knack for 
throwing a baseball. He manages to get a tryout with the Chicago White 
Sox that is followed by a contract. A teammate introduces him to a young 
woman named Ethel (Allyson) and soon they are married and raising a family. 
In the off-season of 1938, Stratton accidentally shoots himself in his 
right leg while on a hunting trip. When his leg has to be amputated, it 
looks as though his pitching career is over. Nevertheless, with a wooden 
leg and the support of his wife, Stratton is able to make a successful 
minor league comeback in 1946. Ronald Reagan had sought the title role 
but was under contract with Warner Bros., which did not want to release 
Reagan for the film because they thought the movie would be a failure. 
Van Johnson was also announced at one stage to play the lead.[2] |image=
