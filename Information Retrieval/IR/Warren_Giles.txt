Warren Crandall Giles (May 28, 1896 – February 7, 1979) was an American 
professional baseball executive. He spent 33 years in high-level posts 
in Major League Baseball, as club president and general manager of the 
Cincinnati Reds (1937–51) and president of the National League (1951–69), 
and was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame. Born in Tiskilwa, 
Illinois,[1] Giles attended Washington & Lee University[2] and served as 
an infantry officer in France during World War I. Before becoming a full-time 
baseball executive he worked as a football and basketball official in the 
Missouri Valley Conference, a major U.S. college sports league.[3] Giles 
was elected president of the Moline, Illinois, Plowboys baseball club in 
the Class B Three-I League at age 23 in 1919, beginning his 50-year career 
in baseball. He then joined the St. Louis Cardinals' organization and rose 
to prominence as the president and business manager of their top-level 
farm teams, the Syracuse Stars (1926–27) and Rochester Red Wings (1928–36) 
of the International League. As a foreshadowing of his most powerful position 
in professional baseball, Giles spent part of the 1936 season as president 
of the International League. Upon the recommendation of Cardinals' executive 
Branch Rickey, Powel Crosley, Jr., owner of the Cincinnati Reds, appointed 
Giles as his club's general manager and president on November 1, 1936, 
succeeding Larry MacPhail.[4] While the 1937 Reds won only 56 games and 
slid into the basement of the National League, the 1938 edition improved 
by 26 games to finish in the first division, earning Giles the 1938 Major 
League Executive of the Year award from The Sporting News. That season, 
he hired a future Hall of Fame manager, Bill McKechnie, to take charge 
of the Reds on the field. Then, on June 13, 1938, Giles swung one of the 
most successful trades in Cincinnati history, when he obtained starting 
pitcher Bucky Walters from the Philadelphia Phillies for catcher Spud Davis, 
pitcher Al Hollingsworth and cash. Walters would help lead the Reds of 
1939 and 1940 to back-to-back National League championships. The 1939 Reds—with 
Walters winning 27 games and the league Most Valuable Player award—captured 
the NL pennant by 4½ games, but they were swept by the New York Yankees 
in the World Series. Unfazed, the 1940 Reds won 100 games (with Walters 
accounting for 22 victories and leading the NL in earned run average for 
a second straight season) to repeat as league champions by a 12-length 
margin. Then, behind Walters' two complete game victories, the Reds defeated 
the Detroit Tigers in a seven-game World Series for the second world title 
in modern club history. The Reds boasted .500 or above teams through 1944, 
but declined beginning in 1945 and during the postwar era finished in the 
NL's second division and posted losing records for Giles' last seven seasons 
as the Reds' top executive.[5] Nevertheless, Giles was a leading candidate 
to become baseball's third commissioner after Happy Chandler was fired 
in 1951. He was runner-up in the commissioner balloting to Ford Frick but 
succeeded Frick as president of the Senior Circuit on October 8, 1951.[3][6] 
During his 18-year reign as chief executive of the National League (including 
the full seasons of 1952–69), Giles presided over several historic events. 
The NL opened the West Coast and Southeastern United States territories 
by approving the transfers of the Los Angeles Dodgers and San Francisco 
Giants in 1958, and the Atlanta Braves in 1966. Giles' first full season, 
1952, was the last in which the eight-team league operated in the same 
cities as it had since 1900. In March 1953, the Braves pulled up stakes 
in Boston, where they had played since they were charter members of the 
Senior Circuit in 1876, and moved to Milwaukee. That transfer—initially 
wildly successful, although the Braves' tenure there would last only 13 
seasons—was the first in the series of franchise moves that shook Major 
League Baseball for the next two decades. In addition, Giles' National 
League expanded to 12 teams by adding two clubs in both 1962 and 1969. 
Although "who says you have to have a team in New York [City]?"[3] was 
Giles' notorious reply when asked if his league would seek to replace the 
Dodgers and Giants in New York, the 1962 expansion, which created the Mets, 
returned the Senior Circuit to the city. The same expansion brought Major 
League Baseball to Texas, with the Houston Colt .45s. In 1969, Giles' last 
year in office, his league expanded into Canada with the Montreal Expos, 
adopted divisional play, and played the first National League Championship 
Series, between the Braves and Mets. Between 1952 and 1969, the NL's member 
clubs, with the exception of the Chicago Cubs, also opened or were planning 
to open new stadiums. Giles' presidency also saw the National League widen 
its advantage over the American League in the signing of African-American 
and Latin American players, resulting in a three-decade-long dominance 
of the Major League Baseball All-Star Game. In clubhouse meetings before 
the midsummer classic, Giles famously would exhort the NL's players to 
uphold their league's honor. During his tenure, the National League won 
16 of 22 All-Star games played, with one tie. (Two games were played each 
year from 1959 to 1962.) The NL also won ten of 18 World Series during 
Giles' term. In addition, Giles worked vigorously to keep premier players 
in his league. After the advent of interleague trading without waivers 
in November 1959, he lobbied against the trade of National League superstars 
to the American League to preserve the NL's hegemony. He was successful 
until his former team, the Reds, traded Frank Robinson to the Baltimore 
Orioles after the 1965 season. During the early weeks of the 1963 season, 
Giles became a figure of some controversy after he instructed the NL's 
umpires to strictly enforce the balk rule then in place. In response, the 
Senior Circuit's arbiters called 74 balks from the opening of the season 
on April 8 until April 26, when Giles announced a relaxation of the policy.[3][7] 
Only two balks were called in the American League over the same period.[7] 
Giles, then 73, announced his intention to retire after the 1969 season 
and on December 5, Giants' executive Chub Feeney was elected to succeed 
him. Under Feeney, league president through 1986, the NL's All-Star Game 
dominance would continue, with 14 triumphs in 17 games. Giles was elected 
to the Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame in 1969 and the Baseball Hall of Fame 
by the Veterans Committee in 1979 shortly after his death in Cincinnati 
at age 82. Giles is interred in Riverside Cemetery in Moline, Illinois. 
The National League Championship Series trophy is named in his honor.[8] 
Also, Minor League Baseball gives out the Warren Giles Award to outstanding 
minor league presidents.[9][10][11] His son, Bill Giles, has also had a 
50-year baseball career. After serving as an executive with the Reds, Houston 
Colt .45s/Astros and Phillies, he became a part-owner of the Phillies in 
1981, and served as their club president until 1997 before becoming board 
chairman and then chairman emeritus. Following in his father's footsteps,
