Howard Dean Reed (December 21, 1936 – December 7, 1984) was an American 
professional baseball player, a right-handed pitcher who appeared in 229 
Major League games over ten seasons (1958–60; 1964–67; 1969–71) for the 
Kansas City Athletics, Los Angeles Dodgers, California Angels, Houston 
Astros and Montreal Expos. Listed at 6 feet 1 inch (1.85 m) tall and 195 
pounds (88 kg), Reed was born in Dallas, Texas, and attended Woodrow Wilson 
High School and the University of Texas at Austin. Reed signed with the 
Athletics in September 1957 and made his pro debut the following year. 
He spent most of the 1958 minor league season with the Albany Senators 
of the Class A Eastern League, winning ten games for a last-place team 
with a solid 3.14 earned run average. Recalled by the Athletics in September 
1958, he was unscored upon in two relief appearances and was rewarded with 
his first big-league start on September 27 against the Chicago White Sox. 
Reed proceeded to throw a five-hit, complete game victory, winning 2–1 
and gaining the decision over eventual Hall of Famer Early Wynn.[1] But 
Reed failed to stick with Kansas City in both 1959 and 1960, getting into 
only seven total games and going winless in three decisions. He did post 
winning campaigns at the Triple-A level, however, and at the close of spring 
training in 1961, the Dodgers acquired him for right-hander Ed Rakow. Reed 
then spent almost 3 1⁄2 seasons pitching for the Dodgers' Triple-A affiliate, 
the Spokane Indians of the Pacific Coast League, winning 45 games—including 
19 in 1963. The Dodgers recalled him in June 1964 and used him in 26 games, 
including seven starting assignments, through the rest of the season. Reed 
won a spot on the 1965 Dodgers' roster and contributed to their National 
League pennant-winning season. He appeared in 38 games, five as a starter. 
He won a career-high seven contests (losing five), picked up a save and 
registered a creditable 3.12 earned run average. He then pitched in two 
games against the Minnesota Twins during the 1965 World Series; he hurled 
1 1⁄3 scoreless innings in Game 1, but was treated roughly in Game 6 when 
he allowed a three-run home run to the opposing pitcher, Mudcat Grant. 
The Dodgers prevailed in seven games, earning Reed a World Series ring. 
The following May, however, he was traded to the Dodgers' American League 
neighbors, the California Angels. He worked in only 20 big-league games 
(19 with the Angels), and spent part of the year in the minor leagues. 
Traded to the Astros during the off-season, Reed was assigned to the Triple-A 
Oklahoma City 89ers and in 1967 he notched another 19-game-winning season. 
The Astros auditioned him in four September 1967 games, but sent him back 
to Oklahoma City for 1968, when he won another 15 games for the 89ers. 
The following season, 1969, saw four expansion teams enter the Major Leagues, 
two in each circuit. Houston sold Reed and two other pitchers to the fledgling 
Montreal Expos on April 3. Although Reed began the year back in the Pacific 
Coast League, he was recalled to Montreal in June and spent the next 2 
1⁄2 seasons on the Expos' big-league roster, getting into 131 games, 115 
in relief. Reed won 14 games an Expo, and saved six more. He played one 
more year, 1972, in the minor leagues before retiring from baseball. As 
a Major Leaguer, Reed allowed 510 hits and 208 bases on balls in 515 1⁄3 
innings pitched, with 268 strikeouts. He added nine saves to his 26–29 
lifetime win–loss record. He won 127 games in the minor leagues. He remained 
in Montréal for two seasons after his playing retirement, working for Seagram's 
and hosting Expo-related radio and television shows.[2] But Reed began 
to experience heart troubles, and returned to his farm in Mathis, Texas, 
where he raised cotton and grain, and where he died from heart failure
