Jonathan Rafael Villar Roque (born May 2, 1991) is a Dominican professional 
baseball shortstop for the Milwaukee Brewers of Major League Baseball (MLB). 
He previously played in MLB for the Houston Astros. Villar signed with 
the Philadelphia Phillies as an international free agent. Before the 2011 
season, the Phillies traded Villar, J. A. Happ and Anthony Gose to the 
Houston Astros for Roy Oswalt.[1] Villar was named the 94th best prospect 
in baseball by Baseball America prior to the 2011 season. He was invited 
to Astros' spring training in 2012. Villar played for the Oklahoma City 
RedHawks in 2013, and was named the Astros' minor league hitter of the 
month for June 2013.[2] On July 21, the Astros promoted Villar to the major 
leagues.[3] On July 30, 2013, Villar stole home against the Baltimore Orioles.[4] 
His strong finish to 2013 made him the team's Opening Day starter in 2014, 
but struggled offensively in 2014 as well as 2015. Nevertheless, he was 
named to the Astros' roster for the 2015 American League Wild Card Game. 
In the seventh inning, he pinch-ran for Chris Carter, stole second base, 
and scored on a single by Jos√© Altuve to make the score 3-0, which ended 
up being the final score of the game. The Astros traded Villar to the Milwaukee 
Brewers for Cy Sneed on November 19, 2015.[5] Villar impressed Brewers 
manager Craig Counsell in Spring Training, and became the Brewers' Opening 
Day shortstop. Villar played very well for the first half of the season 
despite the team's struggles, posting a .298 batting average, 6 home runs 
and a league-leading 19 stolen bases before the All-Star Break. [6] He 
finished the year with 62 stolen bases, leading the league, four more than 
Billy Hamilton of the Reds, along with a .285 average, 62 RBIs, and 19
