Thomas Mitchell Herr (born April 4, 1956, in Lancaster, Pennsylvania) is 
a former second baseman in Major League Baseball who played from 1979 to 
1991 for the St. Louis Cardinals, Minnesota Twins, Philadelphia Phillies, 
San Francisco Giants, and New York Mets. Herr started his minor league 
career with Johnson City in 1975. Two years later, he led the league with 
156 hits, 80 runs, 50 stolen bases, and 515 at-bats while playing for St. 
Petersburg.[1] Herr played in the 1982, 1985, and 1987 World Series – all 
with Cardinals, finishing fifth in the MVP voting and making his only appearance 
in the All-Star Game in 1985. During the 1985 season, he set career highs 
in nearly every statistical category, including an amazing 110 RBI which 
came along with only 8 home runs. A rare feat in the modern era of baseball, 
Herr remains the last NL player to drive in 100 or more runs in a season 
while hitting fewer than 10 home runs. Paul Molitor is the most recent 
AL and MLB player to drive in 100 or more runs in a season while hitting 
fewer than 10 home runs (9 home runs, 113 RBI in 1996). Early in the 1988 
season he was traded to the Twins for Tom Brunansky. In a 13-season career, 
he batted .271 with 28 home runs and 574 RBIs in 1514 games. He had 1450 
career hits in 5349 at bats. He is perhaps best remembered for hitting 
a walk-off grand slam in extra innings against the New York Mets on April 
18, 1987. After Herr hit the grand slam many fans at Busch Stadium threw 
their stadium give-away seat cushions onto the field in celebration. The 
grand slam is also well known for Jack Buck's memorable call on KMOX radio. 
Herr was hired in November 2004 as the first manager of his hometown Lancaster 
Barnstormers, a team in the independent Atlantic League of Professional 
Baseball, and led the team to the 2006 Atlantic League championship. His 
success in Lancaster piqued the interest of the Washington Nationals, resulting 
in a managerial position with the Single-A Hagerstown Suns for the 2007 
season. The Suns finished last in the Southern Atlantic League in 2007 
with a 55–81 record. Following the 2007 season, Herr left the Nationals 
organization after his request to manage their Double-A affiliate, the 
Harrisburg Senators, was refused. After leaving the Nationals, he sought 
employment with other major league organizations, including the St. Louis 
Cardinals, without success. Herr then sought to return to the Barnstormers 
as their manager for the 2008 season, but lost out to Von Hayes. In December 
2008, the Barnstormers announced that Von Hayes has hired Herr to be his 
bench coach in 2009. Tom Herr's oldest son, Aaron, was drafted by the Atlanta 
Braves in the first round during the 2001 season. He played the 2005 season 
with the Springfield Cardinals, the Double-A affiliate of the St. Louis 
Cardinals. Aaron was later traded to the Cincinnati Reds in 2006, and allocated 
to their former class AA team, the Chattanooga Lookouts. In mid-2006, he 
was promoted to the class AAA Louisville Bats, where he played his best 
season. Aaron had a short stint with the class AAA Buffalo Bisons, but 
a severe groin injury caused him to be reassigned to the Bats for 2008. 
On March 5, 2009, Aaron joined Tom with the Lancaster Barnstormers for 
2009. Jordan Herr, also one of Tom's sons, played for the Lancaster Barnstormers 
for the 2008 season. At the conclusion of the season, the Chicago White 
Sox signed him to their Rookie-level affiliate, the Great Falls Voyagers.
