George Walborn Staller (April 1, 1916 – July 3, 1992) was an American outfielder, 
scout and coach in Major League Baseball. He served as first base coach 
on Earl Weaver's Baltimore Orioles staff from July 11, 1968, through 1975, 
working on the Orioles' three consecutive American League championship 
teams (1969, 1970 and 1971) and Baltimore's 1970 World Series champion. 
Born in Rutherford Heights, Dauphin County, Pennsylvania, Staller threw 
and batted left-handed and stood 5 ft 11 in (1.80 m) (180 cm) tall and 
weighed 200 pounds (91 kg). He originally signed with the Brooklyn Dodgers 
in 1937 and progressed as far as the top-level Montreal Royals in 1940–41, 
where he led the International League in doubles (40) and triples (12) 
in 1940. But his only Major League service occurred in 1943, when he was 
purchased by the Philadelphia Athletics from the minor league version of 
the Baltimore Orioles after leading the 1943 IL in runs batted in (with 
98). Staller appeared in 21 games with the 1943 A's, batting .271 with 
23 hits in 85 at bats, including three home runs and 12 RBI. He then joined 
the armed forces, serving as a United States Marine in the Pacific Theater 
of Operations[1] and missing the 1944–45 seasons. Staller was a minor league 
manager for 14 seasons, 1948 through 1961. He began in the A's system (1948–53), 
then moved with Philadelphia general manager Arthur Ehlers to the American 
League Orioles organization in its first season in Baltimore, 1954. Staller 
reached the Triple-A level for one season, in 1960 with the Vancouver Mounties; 
his career managing record was 922 wins, 1,043 losses (.469). Staller's 
first term as an Orioles coach came in 1962, when he served one year under 
skipper Billy Hitchcock. Then, after 5½ seasons as a Baltimore scout, he 
rejoined the Orioles staff when Weaver was promoted from first-base coach 
to manager in July 1968. Staller served until his retirement from the field 
at the close of the 1975 season. He was listed as a scout for the Seattle 
Mariners for the expansion team's inaugural American League season, 1977.
