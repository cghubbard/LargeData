Charles Lee Glenn Carr, Jr. (born August 10, 1967) is a former Major League 
outfielder for the New York Mets (1990–91), St. Louis Cardinals (1992), 
Florida Marlins (1993–95), Milwaukee Brewers (1996–97) and Houston Astros 
(1997). Carr topped the National League with 58 stolen bases in 1993. He 
later helped the Astros win the 1997 National League Central Division. 
In an eight-season career, he played in 507 games, had 1,713 at-bats, 254 
runs, 435 hits, 81 doubles, seven triples, 13 home runs, 123 RBI, 144 stolen 
bases, 149 walks, a .254 batting average, .316 on-base percentage, .332 
slugging percentage, 569 total bases, 30 sacrifice hits, 10 sacrifice flies 
and four Intentional walks. Carr is perhaps remembered most for his hasty 
departure from the Brewers in 1997. After popping out to third base on 
a two balls, no strike count, after being signalled to take the next pitch, 
Carr was questioned by manager Phil Garner. Carr reportedly replied to 
Garner by saying in the third person: "That ain't Chuckie's game. Chuckie 
hacks on 2-0." He was released from the club shortly thereafter.[1][2]
