Nicholas William "Nick" Markakis (/mɑːrˈkeɪkɪs/ mar-KAY-kis);[1] (born 
November 17, 1983) is an American professional baseball right fielder for 
the Atlanta Braves of Major League Baseball (MLB). He previously played 
for the Baltimore Orioles from 2006 to 2014. Markakis is a two-time Gold 
Glove Award winner. Markakis was born in Glen Cove, New York, but moved 
to Woodstock, Georgia when his family, which includes his parents, Dennis 
and Mary Lou and his brothers Dennis, Greg and Michael relocated. He is 
of Greek and German descent.[2] Markakis was originally drafted in 2001 
by the Cincinnati Reds, from Woodstock High School in Woodstock, Georgia 
but did not sign. Markakis instead attended Young Harris College, where 
he played college baseball for the Young Harris Mountain Lions baseball 
team. The Reds drafted him again in 2002, but he returned to Young Harris.[3] 
Markakis played as both an outfielder and a pitcher, hitting .439 with 
21 home runs and 92 RBIs, while also gathering a 12–0 win–loss record as 
a pitcher with 1 save and a 1.68 earned run average in 15 games.[4] He 
was twice named Georgia Junior College Player of the Year and was awarded 
Baseball America's 2002 National JUCO Player of the Year.[5][6] In August 
2003, he played in the European National Championships, winning a silver 
medal with Team Greece.[7] He also played for the Greek Olympic baseball 
team in the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens, Greece.[8] Markakis was the Orioles' 
first-round draft pick, seventh overall in the 2003 Major League Baseball 
Draft. Owning a fastball that was clocked as high as 96 miles per hour, 
Markakis was widely viewed as a pitching prospect but the Orioles preferred 
his potential as a hitter. Markakis spent his first year with the Aberdeen 
IronBirds and then the Delmarva Shorebirds in 2004, where he hit .299, 
11 homers and led the team with 64 RBI despite missing the last month of 
the season playing for Greece in the Olympics. In 2005, Markakis started 
the year with the Frederick Keys and was named the top Orioles prospect 
by Baseball America. He won the Carolina/California League All-Star Game 
Home Run Derby, and followed that up by being named MVP of the All-Star 
game after hitting two homers. He was promoted a short time later to the 
Bowie Baysox and was ultimately named to the Second Team in the 2005 Minor 
League All-Star Roster.[1] He also received the Brooks Robinson Award as 
the organization’s Minor League Player of the Year. Markakis began his 
first spring training with the Orioles in 2006, and immediately established 
himself by reaching base 9 out of his first 10 plate appearances. He eventually 
earned an Opening Day roster spot. Markakis made his major league debut 
on April 3, 2006, when he was used as a late-inning defensive replacement 
against the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. He received his first start and plate 
appearances two days later. Hitting second and playing left field, he drew 
three walks in his first three plate appearances and hit a 400-foot home 
run for his first major league hit in the 16–6 win.[9] On August 22, 2006, 
Markakis went 3 for 4 with 3 home runs in an Orioles 6–3 win at Camden 
Yards. Not only was it his first three-home run game, became the 18th Oriole 
to do so and the first since 1999. The feat prompted a curtain call from 
the dugout, earning him a feat that The Washington Post called "an ovation 
that is rarely seen in these parts anymore. Curtain calls are for Yankee 
Stadium and Fenway Park, not Camden Yards."[10] Markakis finished his rookie 
season with a .291 average, 16 homers, 62 RBI and 2 stolen bases. On defense, 
he put up impressive stats in defensive ratings such as range factor and 
fielding percentage, ranking second among major league right fielders. 
Markakis started the season as the starting right fielder.[11] He finished 
the season with a .300 average, 23 home runs, 112 RBI and 18 stolen bases. 
His home run and RBI totals ranked first on the team.[12] He was 3rd in 
the AL in games played (161), 7th in at-bats (637), 6th in doubles (43), 
7th in hits (191), 8th in RBIs (112) and 3rd in grounding into double plays 
(22). Markakis also continued to play good defense as finished 5th in the 
league with 13 assists, 6th with a .994 fielding percentage. He was charged 
with just 2 errors in 318 total chances. At the end of the season, Markakis 
could not agree to a contract extension with the Orioles and his contract 
was automatically renewed for another year at the baseline value of $455,000.[13] 
He became eligible for arbitration after the 2008 season, and in the absence 
of a contract extension, would have become a free agent in 2011. Markakis 
began the season as the team's #3 hitter and starting right fielder. He 
played well early in the year, but as the season went into the summer months, 
Orioles manager Dave Trembley opted to move him into the #2 hole, placing 
Melvin Mora behind him. Impressively, Markakis finished the season in the 
top 10 in the American League in AVG, OBP, OPS, G, R, H, 2B, BB, *OPS+, 
RC (runs created). He also led the league in times on base.[14] He raised 
his batting average to .306, slugged 20 home runs, hit 48 doubles (3rd 
in the major leagues), recorded 87 RBI, scored 106 runs and stole 10 bases 
on the season. He also had another stellar year in right field, notching 
17 assists, which led the majors. Markakis signed a 6-year, $66.1 million 
extension through 2014 on January 22, 2009.[15] Markakis has also been 
honored with his very own shirt this season called "Nick the Stick, Camden's 
Finest."[16] He finished the season with a .293 average, 18 home runs, 
45 doubles (7th in the majors), 101 RBI, 94 runs and 6 stolen bases, in 
addition to being 4th in the majors with 14 outfield assists. Markakis 
had a stellar 2010 season with the Orioles. He finished with a respectable 
.297 average, recording 45 doubles (5th in the majors), 60 RBI, 79 runs 
and 7 stolen bases. Markakis got his 1000th hit against the Cleveland Indians 
on July 15.[17] He was also awarded a Gold Glove.[18] After surgery to 
remove part of the hamate bone in his right wrist, Markakis was placed 
on the disabled list for the first time in his career on June 1.[19][20] 
He began his minor league rehab games with the Double-A Bowie Baysox on 
July 7,[21] and returned to the Orioles on July 13.[22] On September 8, 
2012, Markakis was hit by a pitch by Yankees pitcher CC Sabathia and suffered 
a fractured thumb.[23] He then missed the rest of the season and postseason. 
He later said that he would have been ready to play had the Orioles made 
it to the World Series—the team was eliminated in five games by the New 
York Yankees in the American League Division Series.[24] During the 2013 
campaign, Markakis was hampered by his wrist injury from the previous season. 
Markakis had a career low in batting average (.271) and home runs (10), 
along with 59 runs batted in which was also far below his 162-game average 
of 81. However, he continued to play stellar defense, committing no errors 
for a perfect 1.000 fielding percentage. Coming off his worst offensive 
season, Markakis added 16 pounds of muscle in the off season.[25] April 
26, Markakis got the start at first base against the Kansas City Royals 
due to an injury to teammate Chris Davis in the previous game. It was the 
first appearance at first base for Markakis since 2011. During the game, 
Markakis went 2-5 with 2 RBIs including a game winning walk-off single 
in the bottom of the 10th inning.[26] Through his first 102 games, Markakis 
had a .290 batting average with 34 runs batted in, 50 runs scored, and 
7 home runs, and continued his errorless streak. On August 3, 2014. Markakis 
collected his 1,500th career hit against Seattle Mariners pitcher Hisashi 
Iwakuma in the Bottom of the third inning at Oriole Park at Camden Yards. 
In his previous at-bat he collected his first career lead-off home run, 
a solo shot to right field to give the Orioles a 1-0 lead in the first 
inning.[27] On December 3, 2014, Markakis agreed to a four-year $44 million 
contract with the Atlanta Braves.[28] On June 18, 2015, Markakis passed 
Darren Lewis for the record of most errorless games by an outfielder in 
a game against the Boston Red Sox.[29] The streak later ended on June 25, 
2015, during a game against the Washington Nationals at 398 games.[30] 
On July 20, Markakis hit his first home run as a Brave against the Los 
Angeles Dodgers, off of Brandon Beachy.[31] He hit two more home runs over 
the course of the season for a career low total of three. His 181 total 
hits ranked fourth in the National League.[32] Growing up, Markakis was 
a Boston Red Sox fan.[33] He wore #21 while with the Orioles in honor of 
Roger Clemens,[34] but changed to #22 upon joining the Braves, as #21 is 
retired for Warren Spahn. Coincidentally, #22 was the number of right fielder 
Jason Heyward, who was traded from the Braves to the St. Louis Cardinals 
before the 2015 season, and replaced by Markakis.[35][36] Markakis and 
his wife, Christina, had their first child on March 11, 2009. A baby boy, 
Taylor Jason Markakis, weighed in at 7 pounds, 1 ounce.[37] Christina gave 
birth to the couple's second child, Tucker Edward, weighing in at 7 pounds, 
1 ounce, on May 27, 2010.[38] The couple's third son, Toby, weighing at 
8 pounds, was born on September 11, 2013.[39] The couple live year-round 
in Monkton, Maryland, where Markakis purchased a home during the 2008 season. 
He also owns a house in Waynesville, NC.[40][41] He has decided to donate 
75,000 dollars per season towards the funds. His other outreach activities 
involve 'Going to Bat Against Breast Cancer', Prostate Cancer Foundation, 
and the Home Run Challenge. Nick was also nominated for the Roberto Clemente 
Award on September 2, 2009.[42] The Right Side Foundation was started by 
Nick and his wife Christina on May 28, 2009. The foundation was created 
to help distressed children, whether they are disadvantaged, sick, lonely, 
or grieving throughout Maryland. “Christina and I have adopted Maryland 
as our new home and believe that establishing our Foundation is the most 
effective way to formalize our charitable efforts and have the greatest 
impact on children in Maryland,” stated Nick.[43] Christina and Nick explained 
that their love of children, and the birth of their son, Taylor, helped 
decide that the foundation would be based on helping children because they 
feel that every child deserves to enjoy promise and innocence. “Nick and 
I have always loved children. As new parents, we see great promise in our 
son and want to do our part to ensure that other children in Maryland have 
opportunities to grow and enjoy life," Christina explained.[44] The Markakis 
family suspended their charity in 2013[45] and continued philanthropic
