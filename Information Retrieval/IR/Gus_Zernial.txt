Gus Edward Zernial (June 27, 1923 – January 20, 2011)[1] was a professional 
baseball outfielder. A right-handed batter, he played eleven seasons in 
Major League Baseball for the Chicago White Sox (1949–51), Philadelphia 
Athletics (1951–54), Kansas City Athletics (1955–57) and Detroit Tigers 
(1958–59), primarily as a left fielder. He was billed as the "New Joe DiMaggio."[citation 
needed] Nicknamed "Ozark Ike" after the popular comic strip character, 
Zernial was one of the most feared sluggers in the 1950s, joining hall 
of famers Mickey Mantle, Yogi Berra and Larry Doby in the American League 
for most home runs in the decade. Before being called up to the major leagues, 
Zernial played in the Pacific Coast League, the highly successful minor 
league circuit. In the HBO series When It Was a Game, Zernial states that 
he took a pay cut to come to the majors. After he hit 29 homers for the 
White Sox in 1950, Zernial was sent to the Athletics in a trade that brought 
Minnie Miñoso to Chicago in 1951. That year Zernial led the league in home 
runs (33), runs batted in (129), extra base hits (68), and 17 assists in 
the outfield. In 1952 he hit 29 homers with 100 RBI, 42 and 108 in 1953. 
Zernial was the first major leaguer to hit four home runs in the month 
of October during the regular season,[citation needed] which he accomplished 
during a doubleheader on October 1, 1950. Ron Kittle would become the second 
player to do this in 1985. Zernial and Al Zarilla and teamed up in April 
1951 to become the only players whose last names started with "Z" to play 
together in the same outfield. Zernial and Zarilla and played left and 
right field, respectively, as part of a White Sox outfield unit in four 
games before Zernial was traded to the Philadelphia A's at the end of April. 
An aggressive fielder, Zernial twice (1949 and 1954) broke his collarbone 
while making diving catches. He finished his career in Detroit, primarily 
as a pinch hitter, hitting .323 with 10 home runs in his new role. Zernial 
was a career .265 hitter (1093-for-4131) with 237 home runs, 776 RBI, 572 
runs, 159 doubles, 22 triples, and 15 stolen bases in 1234 games. Zernial 
is featured in one of the most unusual baseball cards of all time. His 
1952 Topps card shows Zernial holding a bat that has six baseballs attached 
to it.[2] This photo recognized that he had tied an American League record 
by hitting six home runs in three consecutive games from May 13–16, 1951. 
The day after the picture was taken, he hit his seventh home run in a fourth 
consecutive games. Zernial has the second most home runs of all time among 
players whose last name begins with the letter Z. His 237 are second only 
to Todd Zeile who finished his career with 253.[3] Zernial was the first 
player to hit three home runs in the final game of a season, a record equalled 
by Dick Allen in 1968 and Evan Longoria and Dan Johnson in 2012.[4] In 
a postscript to his acclaim noted above as the "new DiMaggio", Zernial 
figured, coincidentally, in Joe DiMaggio meeting his legendary future wife 
Marilyn Monroe. The "handsome" young Zernial was chosen to pose with rising 
star Monroe in a movie-studio publicity shot. DiMaggio was so struck by 
Marilyn in the photo, as well as so envious of Zernial's opportunity, that 
he asked the rival outfielder how to reach Marilyn.[5] When the Oakland 
Athletics played the Philadelphia Phillies for the first time in interleague 
play in June 2003 at Veterans Stadium, the Phillies invited former Philadelphia 
A's Eddie Joost and Zernial to the games and recognized them prior to the 
first game.[6] Zernial was diagnosed with cancer in 1990. He died at a 
Fresno hospice care center from the effects of congestive heart failure. 
"When my dad passed away he had his entire family around him", said his 
daughter, Lisa Pearlstein. "For the past year he'd been in and out of the
