As Player As Manager Herman Louis Franks (January 4, 1914 – March 30, 2009)[1][2] 
was a catcher, coach, manager, general manager and scout in American Major 
League Baseball. He was born in Price, Utah, to Italian-American immigrant 
parents[3] and attended the University of Utah. A left-handed hitter who 
threw right-handed, Franks was listed at 5 feet 10 inches (1.78 m) tall 
and 187 pounds (85 kg). He broke into professional baseball with the Hollywood 
Stars of the Pacific Coast League in 1932, but he was soon acquired by 
the St. Louis Cardinals and joined their vast farm system. He made the 
Cardinals for just 17 games and 17 at-bats in 1939, before being drafted 
by the Brooklyn Dodgers, where he served as a second-string catcher in 
1940–41 and began his long association with Leo Durocher, then Brooklyn's 
manager. As a Dodger, Franks caught Tex Carleton's no-hitter on April 30, 
1940.[4] Franks missed 3½ seasons during World War II, when he served in 
the United States Navy in the Pacific Theater of Operations and attained 
the rank of lieutenant (junior grade).[5] He resumed his playing career 
in 1946 with the Triple-A Montreal Royals, then became the playing manager 
of the Dodgers' St. Paul Saints affiliate in the Triple-A American Association 
in 1947. In August of that season, however, he resigned his post to return 
to the Major Leagues as a backup catcher with the Philadelphia Athletics, 
where he appeared in 48 games in 1947–48 and batted .221. In 1949, Franks 
received his first coaching assignment, as an aide to Durocher with the 
New York Giants, and was activated for one final MLB game on August 28, 
1949—going 2-for-3 against the Cincinnati Reds in a 4–2 New York triumph.[6] 
As a New York Giant, he was a member of two National League championship 
clubs (1951, 1954) and one World Series (1954) title team through 1955. 
According to author Joshua Prager in his 2006 book The Echoing Green, Franks 
played a critical role in the Giants' Bobby Thomson's famous pennant-winning 
home run in the 1951 NL playoffs—Baseball's Shot Heard Round The World. 
According to Prager, Franks was stationed in the Giants' center-field clubhouse 
at the Polo Grounds, their home field, stealing the opposing catcher's 
signs through a telescope and relaying them through second-string catcher 
Sal Yvars (positioned in the bullpen) to the Giants' coaches and hitters.[7] 
When asked where he was when Thomson hit his home run, Franks said, in 
1996, that he was "doing something for Durocher" at the time.[7] Whatever 
his role may have been on that day, Franks was known as a devotee of Durocher-style, 
win-at-any-cost baseball, including intimidation through flying spikes 
and brushback pitching. Dodger outfielder Carl Furillo told author Roger 
Kahn that Franks was known to poke his head into the Brooklyn clubhouse 
before games, to taunt Furillo that Giant pitchers were planning to throw 
at his head in the upcoming contest. Furillo, whose hatred for Durocher 
was so intense that he would engage Durocher in a fistfight in a Giant 
dugout filled with enemy players, said of the Giants, in Peter Golenbock's 
book Bums: An Oral History of the Brooklyn Dodgers, "They were dirty ballplayers 
... They all wanted to be like Durocher, to copy Durocher. That Herman 
Franks, he was another one." Durocher quit the Giants after the 1955 season, 
and the team relocated to San Francisco after 1957. From 1956 to 1964, 
Franks was briefly a Giants' scout, then the general manager of the PCL 
Salt Lake City Bees. He also spent two additional one-year terms (in 1958 
and 1964) as a San Francisco Giants' coach before succeeding Alvin Dark 
as the club's manager after the 1964 season. Even though the team featured 
future Hall of Famers Willie Mays, Willie McCovey, Juan Marichal and Gaylord 
Perry, Franks' four seasons (1965–68) managing the Giants each produced 
frustrating second-place finishes in the National League. The club lost 
close pennant races to the Los Angeles Dodgers by two games in 1965 and 
1½ games in 1966. It finished farther behind the Cardinals the next two 
years, 10½ lengths out in 1967 and nine back in 1968. After he stepped 
down as skipper following the conclusion of the 1968 season, he was quoted 
as saying, " Is finishing second so evil?" He was replaced by Clyde King.[8] 
A highly successful businessman off the field, Franks spent the next eight 
years out of the Major League spotlight, apart from a partial season (August 
and September 1970) as a pitching coach under Durocher with the Chicago 
Cubs. After the 1976 campaign, Franks returned to the Major Leagues when 
he replaced Jim Marshall as manager of the Cubs. In 1977, he led the Cubs 
back to the .500 level, but the team lost ground in 1978 and was just one 
game above the break-even mark in September 1979 when Franks resigned (issuing 
a number of complaints about certain players [1]). He was the interim general 
manager of the Cubs from May through November 1981. However, most of his 
tenure was taken up by the 1981 players' strike. He lost his chance to 
be named full-time general manager when the Tribune Company bought the 
Cubs and replaced him with Dallas Green. Although Franks compiled a poor 
record as a player (a batting average of .199 with three home runs in 188 
games over parts of six seasons), he notched a winning record as a manager:
