Saltaire is a village on Fire Island in the southern part of the Town of 
Islip in Suffolk County, New York, United States. The year-round population 
was 37 at the 2010 census,[2] which, as a summer beach community, increases 
many times over in the summer. Saltaire was founded in 1910 and incorporated 
in 1917.[citation needed] The village was heavily damaged and six residents 
killed in the Hurricane of 1938.[3] In early 2009 the village underwent 
a beach restoration project.[4] The village sustained damage in Hurricane 
Sandy in 2012.[5] An individual has three ways to get to the community 
(and the island in general). One could ride the Fire Island Ferries, arrive 
by private boat or travel by car (restricted). Use of the ferries is by 
far the most popular means of getting to Saltaire. It is also possible 
to reach Saltaire by foot or bicycle from other Fire Island communities, 
by one of the inland walks or on the beach. The village is located on the 
western part of Fire Island between the Great South Bay and the Atlantic 
Ocean and between the hamlets of Kismet (to the west) and Fair Harbor (to 
the east). According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has 
a total area of 0.27 square miles (0.7 km2), of which 0.23 square miles 
(0.6 km2) is land and 0.04 square miles (0.1 km2), or 18.04%, is water.[2] 
Among other things, Saltaire is known for its great softball league in 
the summer. The village encompasses the widest portion of Fire Island at 
approximately 0.5 miles (0.80 km). There are 459 housing units in the community,[2] 
as well as a Village Hall and Court, general market, Fire House, two churches, 
and a members yacht club. Saltaire is the second largest Fire Island community, 
and it is situated on the widest area on the Fire Island (approximately 
one-half mile). Fire Island Ferry service to Saltaire leaves from the Bay 
Shore Fire Island ferry terminal. Saltaire, like most of Fire Island's 
communities, consists of boardwalks, concrete walks, and sand paths. Not 
many full-sized cars are found on the roads. Bicycles are the main form 
of transportation. The following demographics represent year-round Saltaire

Company, Inc., was established in 1969 to provide fire suppression services 
to the village. In 1986, the fire company became the first Fire Island 
fire department to provide Emergency Medical Services to the village and 
surrounding communities. The department currently has two (pumper) engines, 
one utility rescue truck, two fire/EMS first response mules, one ambulance 
and a Chief's/Staff vehicle. These vehicles are often modified for use 
in the unique Fire Island geography with four-wheel drive, lifted suspensions, 
and large-diameter tires. Children of year-round residents attend the Fire 
Island School District in Ocean Beach until grade 6, at which point they 
are bussed to Long Island for grades 7-12, usually to Bay Shore Middle 
School and High School, or to one of the many private and parochial schools 
on the mainland. The Saltaire Yacht Club, founded in 1911, used to be the 
social center of the village, but due to hurricane sandy damage and building 
of a new baseball field, it is now only the main social center for adults 
with kids. The yacht club is undergoing rebuilding in winter 2015, along 
with the saltaire market. Architecture by rise projects. and all property 
owners and renters in the village are eligible to join. The club has five 
Har-Tru tennis courts which can be used by tennis members and their house 
guests. In addition, it has a bar and the only restaurant in the village 
which serves dinner six nights a week. Each summer it offers a wide variety 
of activities and in the past has featured Broadway comedians, singers 
and entertainers. The club owns a fleet of boats and offers sailing lessons 
to children during the week. Adult members may take private sailing lessons 
on the weekend, and competent sailors are permitted to use the club boats. 
Approximately 250 of the 400 households in the village are members of the 
club. The club and the village are separate organizations but work closely 
together. The club permits the village to host its annual Labor Day show 
put on by the children in the village, show children's movies once a week,
