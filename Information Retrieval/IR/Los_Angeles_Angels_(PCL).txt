The Los Angeles Angels were a Minor League Baseball team based in Los Angeles 
that played in the "near-major league" Pacific Coast League from 1903 through 
1957. The next year, Los Angeles became the host city to the first western 
Major League Baseball (MLB) team, the Los Angeles Dodgers, after the Brooklyn 
Dodgers moved to Los Angeles. This move brought MLB competition into PCL's 
region and it would eventually become a minor league affiliate of MLB. 
The Angels were the Dodgers' PCL affiliate in 1957 and transferred north 
in 1958 to Spokane, Washington, to become the Spokane Indians, the Dodgers' 
top affiliate for fourteen years, through the 1971 season. From 1903 through 
1957, the Los Angeles Angels, a PCL team, were one of the mainstays of 
the Pacific Coast League, winning the PCL pennant 12 times. The Angels, 
along with the Portland Beavers, Oakland Oaks, Sacramento Solons, San Francisco 
Seals, and Seattle Indians were charter members of the Pacific Coast League 
which was founded in 1903. From 1903 through 1925, the team played at 15,000-seat 
Washington Park (also known as Chutes Park), just south of downtown Los 
Angeles. Both the team and the park were founded by James Furlong "Jim" 
Morley (1869–1940), an entrepreneur involved in bowling, prize fighting, 
billiards, and gemstones as well as baseball.[1] During this time, the 
Angels (or Looloos[2] or Seraphs as they were sometimes called), won pennants 
in 1903, 1905, 1907, 1908, 1916, 1918, and 1921. In 1918, the team finished 
second in regular season play, but won the postseason series against their 
cross-town rivals at the time, the Vernon Tigers. During the period 1915 
to 1921, the Angels were owned by John F. "Johnny" Powers, Los Angeles 
socialite. The 1916 team was managed by Frank Chance, baseball Hall of 
Famer, noted as part of "Tinker to Evers to Chance" In 1921, the team was 
purchased by chewing-gum magnate William Wrigley Jr., the owner of the 
Chicago Cubs of the National League. When Wrigley could not get the city 
of Los Angeles to make the improvements to Washington Park he requested, 
he began construction of his own 21,000-seat stadium, appropriately named 
Wrigley Field, at 42nd Place and Avalon Boulevard in what is now known 
as South Central Los Angeles. The Angels began play at Wrigley in 1926, 
and responded by winning their eighth PCL pennant, finishing 10 1⁄2 games 
ahead of the second-place Oakland Oaks. Wrigley Field was famous for being 
the setting for the show "Home Run Derby". The Seraphs won the pennant 
again in 1933. In 1934, they fielded what is regarded as one of the greatest 
teams in the history of baseball.[3] The 1934 Angels finished at 137-50 
(.733) — 35 1⁄2 games ahead of the Mission Reds on an annualized basis 
(the PCL used a split season format that year). They were so good that 
their opponent in the postseason series (which the Angels won) was an all-star 
team composed of players from the other seven PCL teams. The team won pennants 
in 1938, 1943, 1944, and 1947, with the 1943 team being considered among 
the best in league history. For the next eight years, however, the Angels 
struggled to remain mediocre at best. In 1949, the Seraphs finished in 
last place, for only the third time in 47 years. Then, after finishing 
third in 1955, the Angels won what would be their last pennant in the PCL 
in 1956. Led by their portly, popular first baseman Steve Bilko, the Seraphs 
finished 101-61 (.637), 16 games in front of the runner-up Seattle Rainiers. 
The franchise history after leaving Los Angeles includes stays in Spokane, 
Washington as the "Indians" from 1958–1971 and Albuquerque, New Mexico 
(where it assumed the name Albuquerque Dukes, a venerable baseball franchise 
name in the "Duke City") from 1972 to 2000. The franchise was sold and 
became the third incarnation of the Portland Beavers from 2000 to 2010. 
In 2010, the franchise was purchased by San Diego Padres principal owner 
Jeff Moorad, after the Portland City Council chose to build a new soccer-only 
facility over a proposed joint-use baseball and soccer stadium.[4] Moorad 
intended to have the team play in Escondido, California starting in 2013; 
however, those plans fell through.[5] The franchise was temporarily relocated 
to Tucson, Arizona for the 2013 season, and nicknamed the Tucson Padres.[6] 
In 2014, they moved to El Paso, Texas[7] where they are known as the El 
Paso Chihuahuas.[8] In 1909, the PCL added two teams to become a six-team 
league (in 1919 it added two more). One of the new teams was located in 
the nearby town of Vernon, and the Angels had their first cross-town rival 
in the Vernon Tigers. Vernon, a small town, was one of only two cities 
in Los Angeles County that had legalized the sale of alcohol—with alcoholic 
beverages as an attraction, the Tigers attracted big crowds by the standards 
of the day, and won three pennants during their 17-year history. In 1919, 
the Tigers were purchased by Roscoe "Fatty" Arbuckle. Opening day in 1919 
featured a preliminary "game" which included Arbuckle, Tom Mix, and Buster 
Keaton. With the ratification of the 18th Amendment and the criminalizing 
of alcohol consumption, however, crowds became sparse and the Tigers were 
sold to San Francisco interests and moved there for the 1926 season. The 
move of the Tigers prompted the owner of the Salt Lake Bees to move his 
team to Los Angeles for the 1926 season, where the team began play as the 
Hollywood Bees, but soon changed their name to the Hollywood Stars. This 
first version of the Stars, though supposedly representing Hollywood, actually 
played home games as tenants of the Angels at Wrigley Field. Though the 
Stars won pennants in 1929 and 1930, they never developed much of a fan 
base. They were merely a team to watch when the Angels were on the road. 
After the 1935 season, the Angels doubled the Stars’ rent, whereupon the 
Stars moved to San Diego for the 1936 season, becoming the San Diego Padres, 
and Los Angeles became a one-team city once more for the 1936 and 1937 
seasons. In 1938, the old Vernon Tigers, who had played in San Francisco 
as the Mission Reds since 1926, moved back to Los Angeles, this time as 
the second version of the Hollywood Stars and, like their predecessors, 
played their 1938 home games in Wrigley Field. After one season, though, 
the team was sold to new owners, among them Robert H. Cobb, owner of the 
Brown Derby restaurant and for whom the Cobb salad is named. They sold 
stock in the team to movie stars, movie moguls, and Hollywood civic leaders. 
Moreover, the team actually played in the Hollywood area, beginning in 
1939 when Gilmore Field was opened in the Fairfax District adjacent to 
Hollywood. The new Stars (or "Twinks") caught on and became a very popular 
team, winning three pennants before 1958. They were genuine rivals to the 
Angels, and it was not uncommon for fights between the teams to break out 
during games. In fact, on August 2, 1953, a brawl between the two teams 
lasted 30 minutes, broken up only when 50 riot police were sent to Gilmore 
Field by Chief of Police William Parker, who was at home watching the game 
on television when the fight started. Early in 1957, Philip Wrigley, who 
had inherited the team from his father, sold the Angels and Wrigley Field 
to Brooklyn Dodgers owner Walter O'Malley for the then-astronomical sum 
of $3,000,000 ($25,318,700 today) and ownership of the Fort Worth Panthers 
of the Texas League. O’Malley assured the PCL owners that he intended to 
operate the Angels as a PCL team as had the Wrigleys. He kept his promise 
– for only one season. The ownership of the minor league team also gave 
O'Malley exclusive rights to major league baseball in Los Angeles and he 
used this to relocate the Dodgers. After the 1957 season the Angels and 
the Stars were relocated when the Dodgers confirmed their long-rumored 
move to Los Angeles for the 1958 season. The Angels became the Spokane 
Indians in 1958. The Stars, in a sense, "returned" to Salt Lake City (whence 
the original Stars had moved in 1926), becoming the Salt Lake Bees once 
more. The new Los Angeles Dodgers would adopt the interlocking "LA" cap 
logo of the Angels, with a color change to Dodger Blue and white. The Angels
