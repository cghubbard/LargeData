After getting off to a dismal 1-8 start, the season began to turn when 
Mike Schmidt hit his 500th career home run in Pittsburgh on April 18. Schmidt 
cracked the milestone long ball on a 3-0 count off the Pirates' Don Robinson 
with two men on base in the ninth inning, which rallied the club from a 
one-run deficit to an eventual 8-6 victory. Schmidt slammed three home 
runs in an 11-6 victory over the Expos on June 14 in Montreal, eventually 
finishing the season with 35 and 530 career homers. Phillies pitcher Kevin 
Gross was pitching against the Chicago Cubs on August 10, 1987. Gross was 
caught with sandpaper in his glove and suspended for 10 games.[3] After 
going as high as six games over .500 in late August, the team crashed to 
a 13-21 finish and tied for fourth place in the NL East with the Pirates.
