The Somerset Patriots is an American professional baseball team based in 
Bridgewater Township, New Jersey. They are a member of the Liberty Division 
of the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball, which is not affiliated 
with Major League Baseball. From the 1999 season to the present, the Patriots 
have played their home games at TD Bank Ballpark. The Patriots are the 
winningest franchise of the Atlantic League, capturing six Championship 
Series titles in 2001, 2003, 2005, 2008, 2009, and most recently, 2015. 
The "Patriots" name refers to the Middlebrook encampment where the first 
official flag of the United States was unfurled, after a law to adopt a 
national flag had been passed by Congress on June 14, 1777. By special 
order of Congress, a 13-star flag is flown 24 hours a day at the Washington 
Camp Ground, part of the former Middlebrook encampment, in Bridgewater 
Township. The Somerset Patriots were one of the founding members of the 
Atlantic League in 1998. However, the team spent its inaugural season as 
a road team while TD Bank Park was being constructed. In the 1999 season, 
the Patriots opened their ballpark, where they quickly became one of the 
most successful franchises of the league in both of the win and attendance 
columns. For spring training in 2009, the Somerset Patriots became the 
first Atlantic League team to hold its spring training in its own locale, 
at the Jack Cust Baseball Academy in nearby Flemington, instead of the 
traditional site in Lakeland, Florida. The Lancaster Barnstormers and the 
York Revolution followed suit in 2009, primarily because of the 2008 economic 
recession.[1] The Somerset Patriots, and then Manager Sparky Lyle, won 
their 1,000th game on July 24, 2012. The Patriots defeated the Sugar Land 
Skeeters with a score of 6-5, in the day game of a day/night doubleheader. 
On November 27, 2012 it was announced Current Somerset Pitching Coach & 
former major league pitcher Brett Jodie will become the new manager with 
Lyle becoming Manager Emeritus.[2] The Somerset Patriots official colors 
are navy blue, maroon, and silver. The primary logo depicts a Continental 
soldier in navy blue with white stars on his shoulder and maroon stripes 
flowing to his left, a reference to the U.S. flag. Centered below the soldier 
is the wordmark in navy blue underlined by a silver baseball bat outlined 
in navy blue. The word "Somerset" is centered above the wordmark in maroon. 
The Patriots wear caps produced by Under Armour and uniforms by Majestic 
Athletic. The caps are navy blue throughout with the cap logo centered 
on the front. The cap logo consists of the Continental soldier's head outlined 
in white and maroon. The Patriots also have an alternate cap that has a 
navy blue crown with a maroon brim and button. The cap logo on the alternate 
cap consists of a scripted "S" in maroon with white outline and the Patriot-head 
cap logo superimposed. The home jersey includes maroon piping and the "Patriots" 
wordmark centered across the front in navy blue and maroon. The away jersey 
also features maroon piping and the "Somerset" wordmark. The belt, socks, 
and undershirt are navy blue. The Patriots alternate jersey is navy blue 
with silver piping. The "Patriots" wordmark is centered on the chest in 
maroon with white outline, and a white star in the underscore. |- All of 
the Patriots' games are broadcast on WCTC 1450 AM, with former Miami Hurricanes 
Play by Play announcer and new "Voice of the Patriots" Justin Antweil. 
Antweil has drawn many comparisons to CBS sport's Ian Eagle for his quick 
wit and fun, but informative, approach to play calling. The Somerset Patriots 
created their own media network, SPN.tv., in 2014. SPN.tv covers 20 live-steam 
home games during the season, along with various original programming that 
features the players, team, front office, fans, community involvement and 
more. The network is live all year long on www.spn.tv so everyone can enjoy 
the Somerset Patriots 365 days/year. One of the Somerset Patriots' official 
mascots is an anthropomorphic dog named Sparkee. He wears the team's home 
uniform with white sneakers. The mascot debuted on July 11, 1998 at the 
Atlantic League's first All-Star Game at Bernie Robbins Stadium in Atlantic 
City, New Jersey. Sparkee's name refers to the Patriots first manager, 
Sparky Lyle.[3] The team also employs another character of unknown species 
(although many speculate it to be either Felidae-cat or Ursidae-bear) named 
Slider. After training with Sparkee for several months, he debuted in the 
2007 season. Slider wears the Patriots' navy blue alternate jersey with 
gray pants.[4] A mascot named "TD" (after the stadium's sponsor) debuted 
in the June 30th, 2010 game against the Camden Riversharks. Also the team 
has a live mascot known as 'General Admission' who wears the traditional 
uniform donned by those fighting for the colonies during the American Revolution 
complete with the three cornered hat and musket. Pitchers Catchers Infielders
