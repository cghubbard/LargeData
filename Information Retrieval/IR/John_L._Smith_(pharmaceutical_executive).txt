John Lawrence Smith (February 10, 1889 – July 10, 1950) was a German-born 
American chemist, pharmaceutical executive, and sportsman. He was born 
Johann Schmitz in Krefeld, Prussia, in Imperial Germany; his family emigrated 
to the United States when Schmitz was three years old, settling in Stonington, 
Connecticut.[1] He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1908 and the family 
legally changed its name to Smith in 1918.[1] Smith first joined Charles 
Pfizer and Company at age 17 while he was studying at night at Cooper Union 
(he received his degree in chemistry in 1911),[2] and would spend almost 
his entire business career at Pfizer. He rose to the positions of director 
(1918), secretary (1925), vice president (1929), president (1945) and chairman 
of the board (1949). His only absence from Pfizer, from 1913–18, came when 
he was a general superintendent at E. R. Squibb and Sons.[2] In the early 
1940s, he supervised Pfizer's successful development of a process for the 
large-scale manufacturing of penicillin[2][3] and is credited as having 
led the transformation of Pfizer from a chemicals supplier to a research-based 
pharmaceuticals company.[3] Smith, a baseball player as a youth in Connecticut 
and a lifelong fan, became an investor in the Brooklyn Dodgers of Major 
League Baseball in 1944, and the following year he became a one-quarter 
owner of the franchise, along with Dearie and James Mulvey, Walter O'Malley 
and Branch Rickey. Under the quartet, the Dodgers won two National League 
pennants (1947; 1949), and made history by breaking the six-decade-old 
baseball color line with the 1947 debut of Baseball Hall of Famer Jackie 
Robinson. But O'Malley and Rickey clashed over control of the Dodgers and 
developed a deep animosity; over time, Smith became more sympathetic with 
the O'Malley position. In February 1950, newly turned 61, Smith was stricken 
with lung cancer. Surgery proved unable to halt the spread of the disease 
and he died at his Prospect Park West home in Park Slope, Brooklyn, on 
July 10.[2] His illness and death coincided with a critical period for 
the Dodgers. Rickey's five-year contract as club president and general 
manager was due to expire at the end of October 1950. O'Malley secured 
the support of Smith's widow, Mary Louise, and refused to renew Rickey's 
contract, effectively forcing him to sell his shares in the Brooklyn club. 
O'Malley then acquired Rickey's one-quarter interest, making him the team's 
largest shareholder with 50 percent. He purchased Mrs. Smith's stock in 
January 1958—the Dodgers' debut season in Los Angeles—to gain 75 percent
