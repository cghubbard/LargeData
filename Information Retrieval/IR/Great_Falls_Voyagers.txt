The Great Falls Voyagers are a minor league baseball team based in Great 
Falls, Montana. The team has played continuously in the Pioneer League 
since 1969,[1] and previously played in the league from 1948 to 1963. The 
Voyagers have been the Advanced Rookie affiliate of the Chicago White Sox 
since 2003. Previously, the team was affiliated with the Los Angeles Dodgers 
(1984–2002), San Francisco Giants (1969–83), and Brooklyn/Los Angeles Dodgers 
(1952–63). The team was not affiliated with any Major League Baseball team 
from 1964 to 1968. The Voyagers play their home games at Centene Stadium. 
The "Voyagers" name refers to the Mariana UFO incident in August 1950 when 
Nicholas "Nick" Mariana, the general manager of the Great Falls Electrics, 
saw two spinning objects approaching at a seemingly high speed. Mariana 
recorded 16 seconds of footage of the unidentified flying objects at Legion 
Park.[2] On December 18, 2012, Pete Rose, Jr., the son of major league 
career hits leader Pete Rose, was named the Voyagers' manager. He replaced 
Ryan Newman.[3] Under Rose Jr. the Voyagers held a 48-28 record and made 
it to the Pioneer League playoffs where they were eliminated by the Helena 
Brewers. On January 20, 2014 it was announced that then hitting coach Charlie 
Poe would manage the Voyagers for the 2014 season, ending Rose Jr.'s tenure 
as manager. Pitchers Catchers Infielders Outfielders Manager Coaches 7-day
