The Women's Baseball World Cup is an international tournament in which 
national women's baseball teams from around the world compete. Through 
its 2012 edition, it was sanctioned by the International Baseball Federation; 
following the 2013 merger of the IBAF with the International Softball Federation, 
future tournaments will be sanctioned by the World Baseball Softball Confederation 
(WBSC). In the seven times it has been held, the tournament has been won 
twice by United States and five consecutive times by Japan in 2008, 2010, 
2012, 2014, and 2016. The inaugural Women's Baseball World Cup was held 
in Edmonton, Canada from July 30 to August 8, 2004 after having been chartered 
by the International Baseball Federation in 2002. Before this tournament 
the only other international women's baseball tournament was the Women's 
World Series, which usually involved only three or four nations, usually 
Australia, Canada, Japan and occasionally the USA. All competing nations 
played one game versus each opponent. The top four teams advanced to the 
semifinals. Ties in standings were broken by head-to-head record. The first 
place team played versus the fourth place team and the second place team 
played the third place team. The semifinal losers then played bronze medal 
game, with the winner earning third place and the loser receiving fourth 
place. The semifinal winners play in the finals, with the winner earning 
first place and the loser receiving second place. All regulation games 
are seven innings in length with the exception to the mercy rule applied 
to a ten run lead after 5 innings or 4 innings with a twelve run lead.
