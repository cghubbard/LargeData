William Edward Wagner (born July 25, 1971), nicknamed "Billy the Kid", 
is a former Major League Baseball relief pitcher. He pitched for the Houston 
Astros (1995–2003), the Philadelphia Phillies (2004–2005), the New York 
Mets (2006–2009), the Boston Red Sox (2009), and the Atlanta Braves (2010). 
Wagner is one of only six Major League relief pitchers to accumulate a 
total of 400 or more saves in his baseball career. Wagner was a natural-born 
right-handed person, but after breaking his right arm twice in accidents 
as a young boy, he taught himself to throw baseballs using his left arm 
by throwing balls against the wall of a barn, and then fielding the rebounds.[1] 
Wagner graduated from Tazewell High School in Tazewell, Virginia, compiling 
a .451 batting average, 23 stolen bases, 29 runs batted in, 116 strikeouts 
in 46 innings, a 7-1 pitching record and a 1.52 ERA in his senior season 
of baseball.[2] He next attended Ferrum College, a small liberal arts college 
in Ferrum, Virginia. Wagner set single-season NCAA records for strikeouts 
per nine innings, with 19⅓ in 1992, and fewest hits allowed per nine innings, 
with 1.88.[3] In 2012, Wagner was inducted into the Virginia Sports Hall 
of Fame. Wagner was selected in the first round of the Major League Baseball 
draft in June 1993 by the Houston Astros. He pitched exclusively as a starting 
pitcher in Minor League Baseball until his major league debut. In 1994, 
Wagner led all North American minor league pitchers in strikeouts, with 
204.[4] Wagner made his first Major League appearance with the Astros, 
as a late-season promotion from AAA baseball, on September 13, 1995, pitching 
against one batter late in a 10–5 defeat by the New York Mets. This was 
his only opportunity to pitch for the Astros that season. Wagner began 
in 1996, once again in the minor leagues as a starting pitcher, but he 
finished the season by becoming a relief pitcher for the Astros. He accumulated 
a 6–2 record with a 3.28 ERA, in twelve starts for the AAA Tucson Toros. 
His baseball contract was purchased by the Astros on June 2, 1996, and 
Wagner was then assigned exclusively as a short-relief pitcher by the Astros 
manager. He finished the Major League season with nine saves in 13 opportunities, 
allowed 28 hits, and he struck out 67 hitters in 51⅔ innings – giving him 
a rate of 11.7 strikeouts per nine innings pitched. His opponents had a 
batting average of .165 against him. In 1997, Wagner played his first full 
season in the Major Leagues. He accumulated 23 saves from 29 save opportunities, 
and he struck out 106 batters in 66⅓ innings. This set a Major League record 
of 14.4 strikeouts per nine innings, which broke the old record of 14.1 
set by the former Cincinnati Reds relief pitcher Rob Dibble in 1992 (with 
110 strikeouts in 70⅓ innings).[citation needed] Wagner struck out the 
side 13 times in his 66 innings pitched, and his season total of 106 strikeouts 
set a Houston Astros record for relief pitchers. In 1998, Wagner posted 
a 4–3 record with a 2.70 ERA and 97 strikeouts in 60 innings pitched. He 
saved 30 games, which was the third-best single season in team history.[citation 
needed] He converted 19 consecutive save chances between his first blown 
save against the Los Angeles Dodgers, on April 12, and then his second 
one facing the St. Louis Cardinals on July 11. On July 15, 1998, while 
protecting an 8–7 lead over the Arizona Diamondbacks, he was struck by 
a batted ball on the left side of his head behind his ear. Wagner was alert 
and conscious on the ground, and his vital signs remained good. He was 
carried off the baseball diamond on a stretcher, and it was found that 
he had suffered a concussion. He spent the night in the hospital. On the 
next day, he flew home to Houston, and he was also immediately placed on 
baseball's 15-day disabled list. Wagner worked on his balance and coordination 
for weeks before he was cleared by the team physicians to embark on a rehabilitation 
assignment with a minor-league team. After pitching there in three games, 
Wagner was recalled to the Astros on August 6, and he completed the rest 
of the baseball season there without incident. The Astros won a franchise-best 
102 games while winning the National League Central division title and 
leading the league in runs scored. Their season ended by defeat to the 
San Diego Padres in the National League Division Series (NLDS).[5] Wagner 
had an outstanding 1999 season. He captured the Relief Man of the Year 
Award in the National League. He saved 39 games and struck out 124 in 74 
innings (15 SO/9), establishing a new major league record for strikeouts 
per 9 innings (50 innings minimum),[citation needed] including the side 
15 times.[citation needed] Wagner posted a 4–1 record with an ERA of 1.57, 
and had more saves than hits allowed (in 74⅔ innings, he allowed 35 hits). 
The 2000 season started off in typical fashion for Wagner, who saved three 
of the Astros' first four wins while retiring 16 of the first 20 batters 
he faced.[citation needed] However, after recording a save on May 4 against 
the Chicago Cubs, he suffered back-to-back blown saves on May 12–13 against 
the Reds. While he was still occasionally throwing 100 m.p.h. as measured 
by radar, he wasn't throwing his slider at 85 to 90 m.p.h. as much as had. 
Wagner continued to struggle before going on the disabled list with a torn 
flexor tendon in his pitching arm and would miss the final three and a 
half months of the season. He finished with 2–4 record, a 6.18 ERA, and 
six saves in 15 opportunities, striking out 28 and walking 18 in 27⅔ innings. 
He would rebound in 2001. Coming off elbow surgery, he posted a record 
of 2–5 with 39 saves in 41 chances, and an ERA of 2.73. He was one of the 
leading candidates for TSN Comeback Player of the Year in the National 
League.[citation needed] In 62⅔ innings, he struck out 79 hitters. In 2002, 
Wagner went 4–2 with a 2.52 ERA, 88 strikeouts, and 35 saves in 75 innings. 
Then, he enjoyed his best season in 2003, when he reached career-highs 
in saves (44), innings pitched (86) and games (78), and got 105 strikeouts 
while leading the league in games finished. In that year, he also cemented 
his status as the hardest-throwing man in baseball by leading the major 
leagues with 159 pitches at 100 mph or above.[citation needed] Second on 
the list was starter Bartolo Colón with 12. On June 11, 2003, Wagner closed 
out a no-hitter thrown by a record six pitchers against the New York Yankees.[6] 
Following the World Series, Wagner criticized the Astros front office for 
not building a playoff worthy team. On November 3, Billy Wagner was informed 
that he had been traded to the Philadelphia Phillies.[7] Wagner was traded 
to Philadelphia before the 2004 season, only to have his season shortened 
by a strain in his hand. He had the best ERA of his career in 2005 and 
again led the league in games finished. Wagner became a free agent after 
the 2005 season and signed a four-year, $43 million contract and a one-year 
club option with the New York Mets.[8] In a May 7, 2006 interview, Wagner 
stated that he was confronted by all of his former Phillies teammates in 
September 2005 after Wagner criticized their performance in the media by 
repeatedly saying that the Phillies had "no chance" of making the playoffs, 
with Phillies left fielder Pat Burrell reportedly calling Wagner a "rat." 
The confrontation reportedly was one of several factors that drove Wagner 
from Philadelphia in the 2005–2006 offseason.[9] Wagner finished 2006 with 
40 saves and a 2.24 ERA and recorded his milestone 300th career save. His 
performance contributed to the New York Mets first division championship 
in 18 years. However, Wagner did not have a hot post-season performance: 
he recorded three saves, but he lost one game and allowed six runs in the 
5⅔ innings that he pitched – an ERA of 10.40. Wagner had a good first half 
of the season in 2007. He was successful in 17 out of 18 save chances, 
and his ERA was 1.94. July was his best month, when he recorded eight saves 
in eight chances; did not allow a run scored; and he won the D.H.L. "Delivery 
Man of the Month" Award. During this month, Wagner's ERA was 0.00, he gave 
up two hits, and he pitched enough innings to be equivalent to a complete 
game pitched. His performance in 2007 was earned him a slot on the National 
League All-Star Team. The second half of Wagner's baseball season was not 
nearly as successful. He converted 13 out of 17 save chances, and his ERA 
was 3.90. Wagner's pitching performance declined during the final two months 
of the season. On August 30, Wagner failed to save the crucial fourth game 
of a four-game series between the Phillies and Mets. The final result was 
four game sweep by the Phillies in this series. This sweep turned out to 
be the difference in the season: the Mets finished one game behind the 
Phillies at the end of the regular season. One more win against the Phillies 
would have allowed the Mets to win the division that year. Wagner had an 
ERA of 6.23 in August of that season, and he suffered from back spasms 
during September. On May 15, 2008, Wagner issued a tirade full of profanity 
against his teammates and coaches following the Mets' 1–0 loss in a game 
against the Washington Nationals.[citation needed] Some people have speculated 
that this was directed in particular toward his teammates Carlos Beltran 
and Carlos Delgado about their not being available for interviews with 
the press following games.[citation needed] However, Wagner's pitching 
performance in April, May, and June was good enough to find him chosen 
by the All-Star Game's National League manager for his pitching staff. 
During this All-Star Game, Wagner, pitching late in the game, surrendered 
a game-tying double to the American league's third baseman, Evan Longoria, 
and then the National League lost the ballgame in 15 innings. In September 
2008, the Mets announced that Wagner had torn the ulnar collateral ligament 
of his left elbow and also his flexor pronator tendon. These injuries required 
Tommy John surgery. This surgery, and its recovery, put Wagner out of play 
for a calendar year.[10] Wagner had a guaranteed-payment baseball contract, 
and he was paid a total of $10.5 million by the Mets in 2009. For the baseball 
year 2010, his contract gave the Mets an option to pay him $8.0 million 
for the season, or else to pay him a $1.0 million to terminate the contract.[11] 
In the news conference following the announcement of his major elbow injury, 
Wagner vowed that he would return to playing Major League Baseball. Although 
he had previously stated that he would not pitch anymore following 2009, 
Wagner amended this by saying that he did not wish to end his baseball 
career in this fashion – ending it on a major injury. He also said that 
he had dreams of winning a World Series, and also of reaching a total of 
about 420 saves in his career.[12] However, Wagner stated furthermore that 
he had "played his last [baseball] game as a Met". Wagner explained that 
it would not make good business sense for the Mets to guarantee him $8.0 
million for 2009, pitching or not pitching.[13] Despite these statements, 
Wagner remained on the Mets' 40-man roster on the disabled list at the 
beginning of the season in 2009, and still drawing his salary.[citation 
needed] He pitched for the first time in 2009 for the Mets late in the 
season on August 20, in a game against the Atlanta Braves. He pitched one 
inning with two strikeouts and giving up no hits or walks. On August 21, 
2009, it was reported that the Boston Red Sox claimed Wagner off waivers 
from the Mets.[14] After initial reports suggested Wagner would invoke 
his no-trade clause to veto a trade, he agreed to be traded on August 25 
for Chris Carter and Eddie Lora, with the added stipulation that the Red 
Sox could not exercise his $8 million option for 2010, but could offer 
him salary arbitration.[15] The Red Sox did offer Wagner arbitration, but 
he declined[16] so the Red Sox received the first-round draft pick from 
the team that signed Wagner (Atlanta Braves) and a sandwich pick in the 
2010 rookie draft. On December 2, 2009, Wagner and the Atlanta Braves agreed 
on a one-year contract worth $7 million that included a $6.5 million vesting 
option for the 2011 season.[17] On April 30, 2010, Wagner revealed that 
he would retire at the end of the 2010 season to spend more time with his 
family.[18] In a game against the Detroit Tigers on June 25, Wagner achieved 
his 400th career save. After the game, he told reporters that he still 
planned to retire after the 2010 season.[19] On July 11, Wagner was selected 
as an injury replacement to the 2010 National League All Star roster, which 
he declined due to an ankle injury.[20] He played his final regular season 
game on October 3, 2010, and struck out the final four batters he faced 
– the last three of whom struck out looking.[21] Wagner made his final 
major league appearance on October 8 in Game 2 of the NLDS against the 
San Francisco Giants. Wagner suffered an injury to his left oblique and 
left the game after facing just two batters. The Braves eventually lost 
the series before Wagner could recover. [22] Wagner retired to Crozet, 
Virginia following the 2010 season. On February 12, 2011, Wagner reiterated 
his intention to retire, stating, "I’m totally content with not playing 
baseball," Wagner said. "I love watching it, I love talking about it. If 
I miss anything, it would be some of the guys I played with and actually 
competing on the field, but other than that, you can keep it."[23] On March 
30, 2011, the Braves officially released Wagner.[24] Billy Wagner is currently 
the Baseball Coach for the private Miller School. He coached against his 
high school alma mater and his own high school coach on April 6, 2013.[25]
