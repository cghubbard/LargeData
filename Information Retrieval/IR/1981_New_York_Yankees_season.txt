for the Yankees. In the ALCS, the Yankees swept the Oakland Athletics for 
their only pennant of the 1980s. However, they lost in the World Series 
in 6 games to the Los Angeles Dodgers. New York was managed by Gene Michael 
and Bob Lemon. The Yankees played at Yankee Stadium. The team finished 
in first place in the American League East for the first half of the season

record, for an overall record of 59-48. The season was suspended for 50 
days due to the infamous 1981 players strike and the league chose as its 
playoff teams, the division winners from the first and second halves of
