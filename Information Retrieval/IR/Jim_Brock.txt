Jim Brock (July 24, 1936 [1] – June 12, 1994) was the head coach of the 
Arizona State Sun Devils baseball team for 23 years from 1972 until his 
death in 1994.[2] During his first year as head coach, Brock managed his 
team to a 64-6 record. That mark remains the NCAA record for all-time winning 
percentage in a single season (.914). Jim Brock's record at ASU was 1,100-440 
(.714), and he also led ASU to thirteen College World Series appearances. 
In 1994, Brock battled liver and colon cancer that would take his life 
one day after the conclusion of the College World Series. Though his strength 
was waning, Brock did not miss a conference game through the '94 season. 
He led his team through the regional tournament at Knoxville, Tennessee, 
and was in the dugout when the Sun Devils beat University of Miami, 4-0, 
in the opener of the College World Series. Speaking in little more than 
a whisper, he gave his team an inspirational pep talk after a scoreless 
first inning when he sensed that the Sun Devils were flat. "You can make 
an assumption that you'll be up because it's the College World Series," 
Brock said, "But you spend so much emotion in the final game of the regional 
that you sometimes have to find a way to regain that emotion." On his way 
to Rosenblatt Stadium (home of the College World Series), for the second 
game of the Series, Brock's condition worsened. The Sun Devils went on 
to lose to the University of Oklahoma, 4-3, in the home half of the eleventh 
inning. Brock was airlifted from Omaha to a Mesa hospital shortly before 
game number three. His Sun Devils went on to hit five home runs to eliminate 
top seeded Miami, 9-5, presenting him with his 1,100th coaching victory. 
Later, Oklahoma eliminated ASU from the series and went on to capture the 
national title. On June 12, 1994, three days after his team's season ended, 
Brock died of colon cancer. He was 57. Brock was posthumously voted into 
the College Baseball Hall of Fame in 2007. Brock coached ASU to two College 
World Series Championships in 1977 and 1981, and was named National Coach 
of the Year four different times in his career (1977, 1981, 1984, 1988). 
Brock sent 175 players into professional baseball—an average of almost 
eight per year. Brock coached seven first round picks and all of ASU's 
three Golden Spike winners. He was a five-time winner of the Pacific-10 
Conference (Pac-10) Coach of the Year. Jim Brock's No. 33 is retired by 
ASU, and in 2006, Bobby Winkles Field-Packard Stadium at Brock Ballpark
