Brian McGuire Cashman (born July 3, 1967) is an American baseball executive 
for the New York Yankees of Major League Baseball. He has served as the 
General Manager and Senior Vice President of the Yankees since 1998. During 
Cashman's tenure as Assistant GM and VP/General Manager, the Yankees have 
won seven American League pennants and five World Series championships. 
Cashman was born in Rockville Centre, New York, and raised in Washingtonville, 
New York. He was raised in an Irish Catholic family,[1][2] as the middle 
of five children born to Nancy and John Cashman.[3] The Cashman family 
moved to Lexington, Kentucky, where his father managed Castleton Farm, 
raising standardbreds for harness racing.[4] Cashman described moving out 
of Washingtonville before starting high school as "the best thing to happen 
to [him], to get out of there."[5] He attended Lexington Catholic High 
School before moving to the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area. He graduated 
from Georgetown Preparatory School in 1985. Cashman played baseball and 
junior varsity basketball at both schools, and added football in his senior 
year.[6] The Catholic University of America offered Cashman the opportunity 
to play college baseball for the Catholic Cardinals, competing in the National 
Collegiate Athletic Association's Division III, guaranteeing him playing 
time as a freshman.[3] He was a four-year starter at second base and the 
team's leadoff hitter. He set a school record for most hits in a season, 
which has since been broken. He earned a bachelor's degree with a major 
in history in 1989.[3][4] Yankees' owner George Steinbrenner met Cashman's 
father while John Cashman managed Pompano Park in Pompano Beach, Florida, 
and the two became friends.[3] Cashman started with the New York Yankees 
organization as an intern in 1986.[7] After he graduated from Catholic, 
the Yankees offered Cashman a position as a baseball operations assistant, 
which he accepted.[3] Steinbrenner was banned from baseball in July 1990 
for hiring a gambler to investigate Dave Winfield. Gene Michael, then the 
Yankees' General Manager, took over daily operations of the Yankees, and 
Cashman assisted him. Michael named Cashman an Assistant General Manager 
in 1992.[3] In February 1998, Cashman was named Senior Vice-President and 
General Manager, succeeding Bob Watson.[8] He agreed to a one-year contract 
for $300,000, and became the second-youngest General Manager in MLB history.[3][9] 
The Yankees won 114 games during the 1998 season, and won the 1998 World 
Series. In 1999, Cashman traded fan favorite David Wells to the Toronto 
Blue Jays to acquire Roger Clemens. The next year, he acquired David Justice, 
who won the American League Championship Series (ALCS) Most Valuable Player 
Award for his play in the 2000 ALCS. The Yankees won the 2000 World Series, 
making Cashman the first General Manager to win World Series titles in 
his first three years. In 2004, Cashman arranged the trade of Alfonso Soriano 
for Alex Rodriguez.[3] Despite the team's success, Cashman considered leaving 
the Yankees in 2005 due to conflicts with Steinbrenner and organizational 
disputes between team officials in New York City and Tampa, Florida.[10] 
The Washington Nationals were rumored to be interested in hiring Cashman, 
which would have brought him back to the city where he attended school. 
Instead, Cashman agreed to a new contract with the Yankees following the 
conclusion of the 2005 season which gave him more authority in personnel 
decisions and paid him an average of $1.3 million more over the following 
three years.[11] With the increased authority, Cashman created a department 
of professional scouting, and tabbed Billy Eppler as its director.[12] 
Later, Eppler would move on to become the General Manager of the Los Angeles 
Angels of Anaheim. [13]On September 30, 2008, Cashman signed a three-year 
contract to stay with the Yankees through the 2011 season.[14] Following 
the 2008 season, when the Yankees failed to make the playoffs, Cashman 
signed CC Sabathia, A. J. Burnett, and Mark Teixeira to long-term free 
agent contracts and traded for Nick Swisher. These four players played 
a significant role in the 2009 Yankees season,[15] culminating with a victory 
in the 2009 World Series. The Yankees went on to make the playoffs again 
following the 2010 season, but lost to the Texas Rangers in the 2010 American 
League Championship Series. Following the 2010 season, Cashman held a hard 
line with Derek Jeter during contract negotiations, reportedly telling 
Jeter that he would prefer to have Troy Tulowitzki as the Yankees' starting 
shortstop,[16] though a deal was eventually made for three years and $45 
million. Yankees ownership agreed to sign Rafael Soriano in January 2011 
without Cashman's approval. Cashman stated at Soriano's introductory press 
conference that he disagreed with the deal.[17] The Yankees re-signed Cashman 
to a three-year contract in November 2011.[18] During 2013, Rodriguez composed 
a tweet saying that he had been cleared to play by his doctors after his 
hip surgery. Cashman claimed that the doctors did not give such authority 
to clear Rodriguez to play after seeking a second opinion with them, and 
that Rodriguez should "shut the fuck up".[3][19] After the 2013 season, 
the Yankees signed Masahiro Tanaka, Jacoby Ellsbury, Brian McCann, and 
Carlos Beltrán to contracts that totaled $438 million. However, the Yankees 
missed the playoffs for the second consecutive year. On October 10, 2014, 
the Yankees signed Cashman to another three-year deal through the 2017 
season.[20] That offseason, Cashman prioritized restructuring the Yankees 
roster with younger players. He replaced the retired Jeter with Didi Gregorius 
and acquired Nathan Eovaldi,[21] both of whom improved during the season.[22] 
Further on in the season, he traded Carlos Beltran to the Texas Rangers, 
Andrew Miller to the Cleveland Indians, and Aroldis Chapman to the eventual 
World Series Champion Chicago Cubs to bolster the Yankees farm system. 
Cashman was selected As Major League Baseball Executive of the Year for 
2009 by the Boston Chapter of the Baseball Writers' Association of America.[23] 
Cashman was named to Crain's New York Business 40 under 40 list for 1999.[24] 
Cashman was also involved in the developing of the video game MLB Front 
Office Manager.[25] Cashman lives in Darien, Connecticut.[26] Cashman's 
wife, Mary, filed for divorce in February 2012; they had been reportedly 
separated for a year. The day prior, prosecutors charged a woman with stalking 
Cashman in an attempt to extort money regarding an extramarital affair.[27] 
Cashman is a Kentucky Wildcats and New Jersey Devils fan.[6][28] Cashman 
has referred to himself as an "adrenaline junkie".[3] In December 2010, 
Cashman rappelled from a 350-foot (110 m) building in Stamford, Connecticut, 
as part of an annual Stamford Christmas celebration.[29] He jumped from 
an airplane with members of the United States Army Parachute Team to raise 
awareness for the Wounded Warrior Project, but broke his right fibula and 
dislocated his right ankle in the process.[30] In November 2014, Cashman 
slept on a New York City sidewalk to raise awareness on behalf of homeless
