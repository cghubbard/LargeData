Brian Lee Hunter (born March 25, 1971) is a former center fielder in Major

over 70 bases in 1997.[1] Hunter was born on March 25, 1971 in Portland, 
Oregon. He graduated from Fort Vancouver High School in Vancouver, Washington.[2] 
Hunter, who threw and batted right-handed, was drafted by the Houston Astros 
in the 2nd round (35th Overall) of the 1989 amateur draft. Hunter spent 
a little over five and a half seasons in the minor leagues. He began his 
pro career with the Gulf Coast League Astros in 1989. Hunter then went 
on to spend the next three seasons in class A playing for the Asheville 
Tourists of the South Atlantic League in 1990 and then the Osceola Astros 
of the Florida State League for two seasons 1991–1992. After a season in 
Class AA with the Jackson Generals of the Texas League, Hunter moved up 
to Class AAA and played part of the season with the Pacific Coast League's 
Tucson Toros in 1994. Hunter made his major league debut for the Astros 
on June 27, 1994 against the Cincinnati Reds. In five at bats he contributed 
with one hit, and stole his first base in this game. He played with Houston 
through the 1996 season. On December 10 of that year he was traded along 
with Orlando Miller, Todd Jones and Doug Brocail, as well as cash, to the 
Detroit Tigers for Daryle Ward, C. J. Nitkowski, Trever Miller, José Lima 
and Brad Ausmus. He played for Detroit from 1997–1999. In 1997 he led the 
American League with 74 stolen bases,[2] and was caught stealing 18 times.[3] 
He played in all 162 games that year; he also led the league in putouts, 
and committed only four errors. As a batter, Hunter set the Tigers all-time 
record for outs with 525, which still stands today. On April 28, during 
the 1999 season, he was traded to the Seattle Mariners for Andy Van Hekken 
and a minor leaguer. He again led the AL in stolen bases, this time with 
44, in 1999.[2] On March 27, 2000 he was released by the Mariners, and 
four days later he signed with the Colorado Rockies[4] who traded him to 
the Reds on August 6.[2] On November 27 he was released by the Reds, and 
on January 10, 2001 Hunter signed with the Philadelphia Phillies who in 
turn granted him free agency on November 5, which allowed him to play 2002-03 
and finish his career where it began, with the Astros, where he retired. 
Because of his proclivity to steal bases, ESPN's Chris Berman nicknamed 
him, Brian "Deer" Hunter. Is currently Hitting coach for Everett Aqua Sox
