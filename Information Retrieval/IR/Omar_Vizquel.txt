As player As coach Omar Enrique Vizquel González (Spanish pronunciation: [oˈmar 
βisˈkel]; born April 24, 1967), nicknamed "Little O", is a Venezuelan former 
professional baseball shortstop. During his 23-year Major League Baseball 
(MLB) career, Vizquel played for the Seattle Mariners, Cleveland Indians, 
San Francisco Giants, Texas Rangers, Chicago White Sox, and Toronto Blue 
Jays. In Venezuela he played for Leones del Caracas. Since 2014, he has 
been the Detroit Tigers' first-base, infield and baserunning coach. Vizquel 
is considered one of baseball's all-time best fielding shortstops, winning 
nine consecutive Gold Gloves (1993–2001) and two more in 2005 and 2006. 
He tied Cal Ripken, Jr.'s American League record, since surpassed, for 
most consecutive games at shortstop without an error (95, between September 
26, 1999 and July 21, 2000).[1] Currently, his .985 career fielding percentage 
is the highest of all-time for a shortstop in Major League history. On 
May 25, 2008, Vizquel became the all-time leader in games played at shortstop, 
passing Luis Aparicio. Vizquel is the all-time leader in double plays made 
while playing shortstop. He has the most hits recorded by any player from 
Venezuela (2,877; 40th all-time), surpassing Aparicio's record of 2,677 
on June 25, 2009. On May 24, 2010, Vizquel became the shortstop with the 
third most hits all time, behind second place Derek Jeter and Honus Wagner. 
Vizquel is the sacrifice hit leader of the live-ball era. At the time of 
his retirement, Vizquel was the oldest player in the Major Leagues, and 
the only active player with service time in the 1980s. He is one of only 
29 players in baseball history to play in Major League games in four decades, 
and the only one who played shortstop. On May 7, 2012, Vizquel became the 
oldest player to play at shortstop in the Major League history, surpassing 
Bobby Wallace, who played 12 games with the St. Louis Cardinals at the 
age of 44 in 1918.[2] Vizquel started his career with the Leones del Caracas 
of the Venezuelan Winter League together with Tony Armas, Bo Díaz and Andrés 
Galarraga. Originally signed by the Mariners as a non-drafted free agent 
in 1984, Vizquel made his Major League debut on April 3, 1989. At the end 
of the 1993 season, Vizquel was traded by the Mariners to the Indians for 
Félix Fermín, Reggie Jefferson, and cash. The specialized sports press, 
such as Sports Illustrated, The Sporting News and Baseball Digest, and 
sports observers, including writers Dom Forker, Cliff Eastham, Wayne Stewart, 
Michael Pellowski and others, have recognized Vizquel and second baseman 
Roberto Alomar as one of the top all-time defensive duos in the history 
of baseball. During Vizquel's career in Cleveland, the Indians made it 
to the World Series twice, losing to the Atlanta Braves in 1995 and to 
the Florida Marlins in 1997. Vizquel is a lifetime .250 hitter in 57 postseason 
games. Vizquel won nine consecutive Gold Gloves with the Mariners and Indians, 
starting with his first in 1993 with Seattle and continuing until 2001. 
Alex Rodriguez broke Vizquel's streak and won the award in 2002. Vizquel 
won two additional Gold Gloves in 2005 and 2006 with the San Francisco 
Giants. In 1999, Vizquel hit over .300 and scored 100 runs for the first 
time in his career, finishing the season with a .333 batting average and 
112 runs scored for an Indians team that scored a league-leading 1,009 
runs. Vizquel hit second in the line-up between lead-off man Kenny Lofton 
and third-place hitter Alomar in the most productive offensive line-up 
in Cleveland baseball history. This line-up also included power hitters 
Jim Thome and Manny Ramirez. On August 5, 2001, Vizquel hit a three-run 
triple in the ninth inning against the Seattle Mariners to tie the game 
14–14, capping a comeback from a 14–2 deficit. The Indians went on to win 
15–14 in eleven innings, tying the record for the largest comeback win 
in history. Vizquel reached career highs in 2002 hitting 14 homers and 
72 RBI, but his success was interrupted by the need for surgery on his 
right knee. He tied the 2002 All-Star Game 7–7 with an RBI triple in the 
eighth inning. As a result of his knee injury in 2002 and a follow-up operation, 
he appeared in only 64 games in 2003. In a game on May 27, 2003, Vizquel 
had a straight steal of home against the Detroit Tigers. He caught Tigers 
pitcher Steve Avery by surprise and made it home without a throw. Vizquel 
returned in 2004 to hit .291 in 148 games. At the end of the season, Vizquel 
was signed by the Giants as a free agent. On June 23, 2007 the Hispanic 
Heritage Baseball Museum Hall of Fame inducted Vizquel, along with former 
Giants outfielder Matty Alou, into its Hall of Fame during an on-field, 
pre-game ceremony. Vizquel underwent arthroscopic knee surgery on February 
27, 2008. He started the 2008 season on the disabled list and played in 
his first game on May 10. Vizquel stole home for the second time in his 
career against Oakland Athletics pitcher Greg Smith on June 13. Vizquel 
won the Hutch Award and the Willie Mac Award, and was a finalist for the 
Heart & Hustle Award. Only two other players, Dave Dravecky and Craig Biggio, 
have won more than one of these awards, although Willie McCovey himself 
won the Hutch Award before having the Willie Mac Award named for him. Vizquel 
was Greg Maddux's 3000th strikeout victim on July 26, 2005.[3] On January 
21, 2009, Vizquel signed a minor league contract with the Texas Rangers[4] 
and made the team's major league roster. He served mainly as a backup middle 
infielder. On November 23, 2009, Vizquel agreed to a one-year contract 
with the Chicago White Sox worth $1.4 million.[5] After making the deal 
official, former shortstop and White Sox legend Luis Aparicio asked that 
his number 11 be temporarily "unretired" for Vizquel during the 2010 season,[6] 
mostly due to the fact that White Sox manager Ozzie Guillén — like Vizquel 
and Aparicio, a Venezuelan shortstop — had rights to #13, the number Vizquel 
has worn through his career. On May 25, 2010, Vizquel became the shortstop 
with the second most hits all time, behind Derek Jeter. On June 25, he 
hit his first home run of 2010, putting him on the short list of players 
who have hit home runs in four different decades (with Ted Williams, Willie 
McCovey, and Rickey Henderson). On November 2, 2010, Vizquel signed a one-year 
deal to remain in Chicago.[7] On April 3, 2011, Vizquel got a single for 
his 2,800th career hit. Despite being well into his forties, Vizquel was 
still regarded as one of the better defensive shortstops in the game and 
seen by his former White Sox teammates as one of the most physically fit.[8] 
Vizquel signed a 1-year minor league contract with the Toronto Blue Jays 
for the 2012 season. He made the team out of spring training, and made 
his first appearance on Opening Day, against his former club, the Cleveland 
Indians. His first start came on April 22, against the Kansas City Royals. 
Vizquel was ejected from a game against the Texas Rangers on May 1, arguing 
with the home plate umpire from the bench. Vizquel jokingly danced to mock 
the umpire before exiting the dugout.[9] Vizquel hinted at retirement upon 
the conclusion of the 2012 season. Despite being 45 years of age and appearing 
in only five games at that point in the season with the Blue Jays, he stated 
"I feel excited about coming to the ballpark. Maybe not every day, because 
there are going to be some days you're going to be sore. But I still feel 
I want to be here. I want to compete."[10] In a game against the Detroit 
Tigers on July 27, Vizquel hit his first two extra-base hits of the season, 
a double and triple. Vizquel became the third oldest player to hit a triple 
(behind Julio Franco and Nick Altrock) and became the oldest player in 
major league history to hit a double and a triple in the same game.[11] 
In the first game of a day-night doubleheader against the New York Yankees 
on September 19, Vizquel recorded his 2,874th career hit, passing Babe 
Ruth for 41st all-time.[12] In the final game of the 2012 season, Brett 
Lawrie wore a #17 jersey as opposed to his usual #13. This allowed Vizquel 
to wear #13 (the number he wore through most of his career) when he played 
his final game on October 3, 2012. Vizquel went 1 for 3, hitting a single 
in his last at bat, the 2,877th hit of his career moving him ahead of Mel 
Ott for 40th position on the all-time hits list. Vizquel retired after 
the season and was the last position player born in the 1960s, as well 
as the last to play in the 1980s, to retire. On January 30, 2013, Vizquel 
was hired by the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim to become a co-infield coach 
with Bobby Knoop, to replace Dick Schofield, whose contract was not renewed 
for 2013.[13] On November 18, 2013, the Detroit Tigers named Vizquel as 
their new first-base coach, replacing Rafael Belliard. Under first-year 
manager Brad Ausmus, Vizquel also serves as the Tigers infield and baserunning 
instructor.[14] Vizquel is active in community service, having served as 
an honorary spokesperson for "Young Audiences", an arts education organization 
in Cleveland, and "Schools Now", which raises funds through the sale of 
entertainment booklets. Following the 1999 Vargas mudslide disaster that 
killed 25,000 in his native Venezuela, Vizquel volunteered for the relief 
effort and helped raise over $500,000 for the cause.[15] Vizquel has held 
various charitable events in downtown Cleveland such as Tribe Jam, where 
he and some other teammates get together with each other or with retired 
singers and sing some of their favorite songs. His 2002 autobiography, 
Omar!: My Life on and Off the Field, which he co-wrote with Bob Dyer,[16] 
spent four weeks on the New York Times Best Seller List. It was released 
in paperback in 2003. Vizquel is referenced in an episode of The Simpsons 
entitled "Bart's Friend Falls in Love" (May 1992). In the episode, Bart 
takes a distracted Milhouse's Carl Yastrzemski baseball card in exchange 
for one of Vizquel with the head cut out.[17] Vizquel married Nicole, a 
Seattle native, in 1992.[18] They later divorced, and Vizquel married Blanca 
Garcia in July 2014.[19] A long-running and well-publicized feud erupted 
between Vizquel and former teammate and friend José Mesa. In 2002, following 
the publication of his autobiography, Omar! My Life On and Off the Field, 
Vizquel criticized Mesa's performance in Game 7 of the 1997 World Series: 
"The eyes of the world were focused on every move we made. Unfortunately, 
Jose's own eyes were vacant. Completely empty. Nobody home. You could almost 
see right through him. Not long after I looked into his vacant eyes, he 
blew the save and the Marlins tied the game." [20] Mesa reacted furiously, 
pledging to hit Vizquel upon every subsequent opportunity: "Even my little 
boy told me to get him. If I face him 10 more times, I'll hit him 10 times. 
I want to kill him." On June 12, 2002, Mesa hit Vizquel with a pitch in 
the ninth inning. Mesa was not ejected and finished the game.[21] They 
did not face each other again until 2006; by then, Vizquel was with the 
San Francisco Giants and Mesa was playing for the Colorado Rockies. When 
Vizquel came to bat against Mesa in Denver on April 22, Mesa hit him again. 
Meeting three more times in 2006, however, Vizquel escaped being hit by 
his former teammate, with two groundouts and an RBI single. Vizquel batted
