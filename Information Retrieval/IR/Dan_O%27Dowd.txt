Dan O'Dowd (born September 6, 1959)[1] was the General Manager of the Colorado 
Rockies from September 20, 1999 to October 8, 2014. Before being hired 
by the Rockies, he spent 15 years working for the Baltimore Orioles and 
Cleveland Indians, working his way from Accounts Manager to Director of 
Baseball Operations / Assistant General Manager.[2] O'Dowd was raised in 
Montville, New Jersey.[3] The results of O'Dowd's GM career have been mixed. 
Upon taking over the team, he traded fading stars Dante Bichette, Vinny 
Castilla, and Darryl Kile, opting to build a team around pitching, speed 
and defense. The following season, after a surprising 82-80 run, O'Dowd 
signed pitchers Denny Neagle and Mike Hampton to long-term contracts. The 
acquisitions turned out to be disastrous for the club and were two of the 
worst free-agency signings in baseball history.[4] Afterwards, O'Dowd attempted 
to shed salary and build a foundation of young talent around franchise 
cornerstone Todd Helton. Under his watch, the team developed players such 
as Matt Holliday, Troy Tulowitzki, Jeff Francis, and Ubaldo Jim√©nez. The 
2007 season was arguably the most surprising run by any Rockies team, as 
the team won 21 of their last 22 games to make it to a tiebreaker against 
the San Diego Padres. The Rockies, who were making their first playoff 
appearance in 12 years, swept both the Philadelphia Phillies and Arizona 
Diamondbacks en route to the 2007 World Series, before losing to the Boston 
Red Sox. O'Dowd was rewarded with a contract extension following the team's 
successful playoff run.[citation needed] As the Rockies struggled in 2012, 
the Rockies restructured their front office, making Bill Geivett their 
director of major league operations, though O'Dowd retained the title of 
general manager. [5][6] O'Dowd currently serves as an analyst for MLB Network.[7]
