Team was also referred to at times as the Troy Trojans The Troy Haymakers 
were an American professional baseball team. Established in 1860 as the 
Union Base Ball Club Lansingburgh, located in neighboring Lansingburgh, 
New York, the Haymakers participated in the first professional pennant 
race of 1869 and joined the first professional league, the 1871 National 
Association of Professional Base Ball Players (NAPBBP). They disbanded 
halfway through the 1872 season "on account of an empty treasury."[1] By 
1868 the "Troy Haymakers" nickname for Union of Lansingburgh was common, 
although the team was sometimes called the Trojans.[2] On the field it 
was one of the strongest teams in the nominally amateur National Association 
of Base Ball Players. Some players were from New York City; presumably 
the club compensated them. When the Association permitted openly professional 
teams for the 1869 season, the Haymakers were one of twelve to go pro. 
Evidently they were fifth in playing strength for they finished with a 
12–8–1 record including two wins, eight defeats, and one tie (2–8–1) against 
the four strongest teams and ten wins in ten matches with the others.[3] 
By playing strength they ranked about the same among fifteen professional 
teams in 1870, at 11–13–1.[4] During the former season, a forfeit win over 
the Haymakers on August 26 in Cincinnati was the only blemish on the record 
of the first professional team, the undefeated 1869 Red Stockings. (The 
Haymakers withdrew from the field with the score 17 to 17 in the sixth 
inning.) Along with two newcomers, seven of the professional teams from 
1870 established a new all-professional National Association early in 1871, 
known today as the first professional sports league. The rival amateur 
Association declined rapidly and soon left the government of baseball to 
the sole leadership of the professionals, but the early pros from Troy/Lansingburgh 
did not survive to take part. During the two NAPBBP season, home games 
were played at Haymakers' Grounds in Troy, New York. The Haymakers were 
managed by Lip Pike, Bill Craver, and Jimmy Wood; they won 28 games and 
lost 25 for a winning percentage of .528. Their 15–10 record in 1872 was 
one of the best for any major team to go out of business. In baseball history 
today, the 1879–1882 National League club in Troy is sometimes called the 
Haymakers. There is now a team in the Albany Twilight League known as the
