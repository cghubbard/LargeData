Harry David Brecheen (October 14, 1914 – January 17, 2004), nicknamed "The 
Cat", was an American left-handed pitcher in Major League Baseball who 
played most of his career for the St. Louis Cardinals. In the late 1940s 
he was among the team's stars, becoming the first left-hander ever to win 
three games in a single World Series in 1946 and later leading the National 
League in several categories in 1948. His career World Series earned run 
average of 0.83 was a major league record from 1946 to 1976. From 1951 
to 1971 he held the Cardinals franchise record for career strikeouts by 
a left-hander, and he also retired with the fourth-highest fielding percentage 
among pitchers (.983), then the top mark among left-handers. Born in Broken 
Bow, Oklahoma and nicknamed for his fielding ability, he was acquired by 
the Cardinals in 1938 after two minor league seasons, but did not get a 
chance to start for the team until 1943. He was nicknamed "The Cat" because 
of his ability to cover bunts.[1] He appeared in three innings in 1940. 
Exempted from military service during World War II with a 4-F classification 
due to a spinal malformation and a boyhood ankle injury, he pitched in 
the 1943 and 1944 World Series. In 1943, Breechen pitched in 29 games, 
starting 13 of them. He went 9-6 with a 2.29 earned run average in 135 
innings pitched. The next season he went 16-5. He won game four of the 
1944 World Series against the St. Louis Browns. He was key to the Cardinals' 
upset win over the Boston Red Sox in the 1946 World Series. He won three 
games during the series.[1] He recorded his finest season in 1948, posting 
a win-loss record of 20–7 with 21 complete games and led the league in 
earned run average (2.24), strikeouts (149) and shutouts (7).[1] A two-time 
All-Star, his overall career record was 133 wins and 92 losses, with 901 
strikeouts. After breaking Bill Sherdel's club record for career strikeouts 
by a left-hander in 1951, he held the mark until Steve Carlton surpassed 
it in 1971. His 25 career shutouts remain the Cardinal record for left-handers. 
His career World Series ERA of 0.83 stood as the record (with at least 
25 innings) until Jack Billingham broke it in 1976 with a mark of 0.36. 
Playing his entire career for St. Louis teams, Brecheen ended his career 
in 1953 as a playing coach with the St. Louis Browns; it was that team's 
final season in the city before their move to Baltimore.[1] He won his 
only start of the 1944 Series, which matched the city's two teams. During 
his career, he had a 133-92 win-loss record with a 2.92 earned run average.[1] 
Brecheen's screwball was ranked the eighth-best of all time by Bill James 
and Rob Neyer.[2] Following his playing career, Brecheen remained with 
the Browns when they became the Baltimore Orioles, and was their pitching 
coach from 1954 to 1967. He was voted into the Oklahoma Sports Hall of 
Fame in 1997. He died at age 89 in a nursing facility in Bethany, Oklahoma.[1]
