Jason Alan Bartlett (born October 30, 1979) is an American former professional 
baseball shortstop in Major League Baseball. He played for the Minnesota 
Twins, Tampa Bay Rays and San Diego Padres. Bartlett grew up in Lodi, California 
and attended St. Mary's High School in Stockton, California. Bartlett went 
to San Joaquin Delta College and the University of Oklahoma, where he played 
for the Oklahoma Sooners baseball team. Bartlett was drafted by the San 
Diego Padres in the 13th round (390th overall) of the 2001 Major League 
Baseball Draft. In July 2002, he was traded to the Minnesota Twins for 
Brian Buchanan after the Padres had drafted shortstop Khalil Greene in 
the first round.[1] Bartlett made his MLB debut on August 3, 2004. He recorded 
his first five-hit game in the Twins' 11-5 victory over the Kansas City 
Royals on August 6, 2006.[2] When on the Twins, Bartlett was one of four 
players known for speed and small ball, nicknamed "The Piranhas" by Chicago 
White Sox manager Ozzie Guill√©n. The Twins embraced the term during the 
2006 season. The other Piranhas were Jason Tyner, Luis Castillo, and Nick 
Punto. In 2007 he led all major league shortstops in errors with 26. On 
November 28, 2007, the Twins traded Bartlett along with Matt Garza and 
Eduardo Morlan to the Tampa Bay Rays for Delmon Young, Jason Pridie, and 
Brendan Harris. On October 22, 2008, Bartlett stole a base in the fifth 
inning of Game 1 of the World Series, earning America a free taco from 
Taco Bell.[3] Bartlett finished the season batting .286 with one home run, 
and was voted by local Tampa sportswriters as the Rays' MVP for the year.[4] 
On July 5, 2009, Bartlett was selected to represent Tampa Bay in the 2009 
All Star Game. He finished the year batting .320, which was, at the time, 
the highest batting average in the relatively short history of the Rays.[1] 
Bartlett played in 135 games for the Rays in 2010 and posted a batting 
line of .254/.324/.350. On December 17, 2010, Bartlett was traded to the 
San Diego Padres for Adam Russell, Cesar Ramos, Brandon Gomes, and Cole 
Figueroa.[1] Bartlett was the Padres regular shortstop in 2011 and finished 
the season batting .245 with 2 home runs and 23 stolen bases. He had the 
lowest slugging percentage of all major league ballplayers with 512 or 
more plate appearances, at .307.[5] The Padres opened 2012 with Bartlett 
again as their everyday shortstop but he played his last game for the team 
on May 14, batting .133 with 4 RBI over 29 games. Three days later he was 
moved to the disabled list with a right knee strain. On the same day, his 
fellow middle infielder Orlando Hudson was released and the Padres brought 
up Everth Cabrera and Alexi Amarista in corresponding moves.[6] On August 
20, 2012, the Padres requested unconditional release waivers on Bartlett. 
After sitting out the 2013 season, he signed a non roster contract with 
the Minnesota Twins on November 11, 2013.[7] After playing in three games 
for the Twins, Bartlett retired on April 19, 2014.[8] Bartlett is Filipino-American 
on his mother's side according to an interview leading up to the 2008 World 
Series. He married Kelly Chevez on November 15, 2008. They have two sons, 
Jayden Bartlett, born June 25, 2008, and Jagger Bartlett, born July 17,
