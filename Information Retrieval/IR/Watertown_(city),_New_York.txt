Watertown is a city in the state of New York and the county seat of Jefferson 
County. It is situated approximately 20 miles (35 km) south of the Thousand 
Islands, and 70 miles north of Syracuse, NY. As of the 2010 census, it 
had a population of 27,023, an increase of 1.2% since 2000. The U.S. Army 
post Fort Drum is near the city. Named after the many falls located on 
the Black River, the city developed early in the 19th century as a manufacturing 
center. From years of generating industrial wealth, in the early 20th century 
the city was said to have more millionaires per capita than any other city 
in the nation. Geographically, Watertown is located in the central part 
of Jefferson County. It lies 72 miles (116 km) northeast of Syracuse, New 
York and 31 miles (50 km) south of the Ontario border. The city is served 
by Watertown International Airport. The city claims to be the birthplace 
of the five and dime store and the safety pin, and is the home of Little 
Trees air fresheners. It manufactured the first portable steam engine. 
It has the longest continually operating county fair in the United States 
and holds the Red and Black football franchise, the oldest surviving semi-professional 
team in the United States. The city of Watertown was settled in 1800 by 
pioneers from New Hampshire, most notably Hart Massey, Henry Coffeen, and 
Zachariah Butterfield, part of a large migration into New York from New 
England after the American Revolutionary War. These pioneers chose the 
area due to the Black River. The pioneers' vision was for an industrial 
center that would draw power from the Black River. All the land was rough 
and unclear. Elevation was also a problem. The western end of the town 
was 12 to 15 feet (3.7 to 4.6 m) higher than the eastern end, with a large 
depression in the middle. A small stream also passed through the town. 
Within a few years, the center of town was cleared for the ambitious Public 
Square.[3] Together with the 19th century structures that created a streetscape 
around it, this has been designated a historic district listed on the National 
Register of Historic Places. As industry and businesses flourished, residents 
built substantial retail buildings, churches and private residences. The 
Paddock Arcade, built in 1850 according to European and US models, is the 
oldest continuously operating enclosed mall in the United States. It is 
listed on the National Register of Historic Places, as are several significant 
churches and private mansions. The drop in the Black River at Watertown's 
location provided abundant water power for early industry. By the mid-19th 
century, entrepreneurs had built paper mills and major industries, including 
the first portable steam engine in 1847. In 1851, the city was joined to 
the state by the railroad. Other mills rapidly joined the business base 
and generated revenue to support early public works projects like the water 
system and illuminating gas works in 1853, and a telephone system in 1879. 
Watertown claims that Rodman native Frank W. Woolworth conceived the idea 
of his mercantile chain while working there in 1878. Woolworth, employed 
as a clerk in Moore's Store, set up a successful clearance display of low-priced 
items. This led to his idea of a store specializing in fixed-price, cut-rate 
merchandise. Woolworth left Watertown and opened his first store in Utica, 
New York in 1879. Among the many manufacturing businesses was the Davis 
Sewing Machine Company, which originated in Watertown. It was predecessor 
to George P. Huffman's Huffy Corporation (NYSE: HUF), now an American maker 
of bicycles and other sporting goods. In 1805 Watertown became the county 
seat of Jefferson County, New York, and it was made an incorporated village 
in 1816. In 1869, Watertown was incorporated as a city. In 1920, the city 
adopted a city manager style of government. The Jefferson County Courthouse 
Complex is an example of the substantial architecture of the city, and 
is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. An early industrial 
city that earned great wealth for many of its citizens by the turn of the 
20th century, Watertown also developed an educated professional class of 
doctors and lawyers. A number of factors affected Watertown's progress. 
The economic center of the country kept moving west, and Chicago drew off 
many of its younger people for business and professional opportunities. 
Industrial technology shifted and jobs changed. In the deindustrialization 
of the mid-20th century, Watertown suffered economic and population declines. 
The city has been working in recent decades to redevelop its downtown and 
revive the heart of the city. It is capitalizing on its rich architectural 
heritage, compact and walkable retail center, and well-designed residential 
areas. Today the city serves as the commercial and financial center for 
a large rural area. It is the major community closest to Fort Drum and 
the post's large population. Since the city is located just 25 miles (40 km) 
from the international boundary via the Thousand Islands Bridge, shopping 
by Canadian visitors is an important part of the local economy. Watertown, 
South Dakota was named in the city's honor. In addition to the Paddock 
Arcade and Public Square, Emerson Place, Roswell P. Flower Memorial Library, 
Jefferson County Courthouse Complex, Paddock Mansion, Saint Paul's Episcopal 
Church, Emma Flower Taylor Mansion, Thomas Memorial AME Zion Church, Trinity 
Episcopal Church and Parish House, and Watertown Masonic Temple are listed 
on the National Register of Historic Places.[4] According to the United 
States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 9.3 square miles (24 km2). 
9.0 square miles (23 km2) of it is land and 0.3 square miles (0.78 km2) 
of it (3.45%) is water. The Black River flows westward through the city 
toward Lake Ontario. The Black River is a world-renowned kayaking destination. 
Competition-level kayaking events, such as the Blackwater Challenge, have 
been held on the river. By tradition, the city's name was derived from 
the abundant water power available from the river. Businesses harnessed 
water power to create one of the early industrial centers in New York. 
Paper mills were historically a major industry for the city and contributed 
to its 19th-century wealth. Jefferson Community College (JCC) is located 
in the western part of the city near the fairgrounds. Watertown has a humid 
continental climate (Köppen: Dfb), with cold, snowy winters and warm, wet 
summers.[5] Unless otherwise noted, all figures cited below are from the 
GHCN station located closer to downtown. Winters can be very cold: temperatures 
remain at or below the freezing mark on an average 54 days annually, and 
fall to 0 °F (−18 °C) or below on an average 20 nights.[6] Moreover, Watertown 
is located in plant hardiness zone 4b, which means that one can expect 
the temperature to drop below −20 °F (−29 °C) at least once per year.[7] 
Summers are mild to warm, and temperatures of 90 °F (32 °C) or above on 
average occur on only 3.1 days annually. Record temperatures range from 
−39 °F (−39 °C) on December 29, 1933, up to 99 °F (37 °C) on July 20 and 
27, 1894, although the airport has dropped to as low as −43 °F (−42 °C) 
on January 16, 1994. Precipitation averages 43.1 inches (1,090 mm), and 
is distributed fairly uniformly throughout the year, with slightly more 
during autumn and slightly less during spring and late winter.[6] Since 
Watertown is situated near the eastern edge of Lake Ontario, it receives 
a bountiful amount of lake-effect snow, averaging 112 inches (280 cm) of 
snowfall per winter. As of the census[1] of 2000, there were 26,705 people, 
11,036 households, and 6,500 families residing in the city. The population 
density was 2,981.3 per square mile (1,150.8/km²). There were 12,450 housing 
units at an average density of 1,389.9 per square mile (536.5/km²). The

0.54% Native American, 1.16% Asian, 0.11% Pacific Islander, 1.67% from 
other races, and 2.45% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any 
race were 3.59% of the population. In 2009, the population was estimated

the city was $16,354. About 14.4% of families and 19.3% of the population 
were below the poverty line, including 25.2% of those under age 18 and 
11.8% of those age 65 or over. Watertown is served by the Watertown City 
School District. The elementary schools are North, Ohio, Knickerbocker, 
Sherman and Starbuck. The higher level schools are H.T. Wiley Intermediate 
School, Case Middle School, Watertown High School, and Immaculate Heart 
Central Elementary, Intermediate, and Junior and Senior High Schools, the 
Catholic and secular educational institutions.[21] There is also a Faith 
Fellowship Christian School. Jefferson Community College is a two-year 
college located in the city as well. The local newspaper, the Watertown 
Daily Times, is published seven days a week and serves Jefferson, St. Lawrence 
and Lewis counties. The Fort Drum Mountaineer is a weekly newspaper for 
Fort Drum soldiers and their dependents. The Watertown market is served 
by three commercial television stations. The oldest is Carthage-licensed, 
CBS-affiliated WCNY-TV (channel 7), put on the air in 1954 by the publishers 
of the Watertown Daily Times. The station changed its call letters to WWNY-TV 
in 1965. After an unsuccessful struggle against the Federal Communications 
Commission and its directive for newspapers to divest themselves of television 
stations held within the same market, the Daily Times sold WWNY-TV to United 
Communications Corporation of Kenosha, Wisconsin in 1981. In 2001, United 
Communications entered into an agreement with Smith Broadcasting to operate 
a Fox network affiliate with low power transmitters in Watertown and Massena. 
After a year of joint operation, UCC took complete ownership of WNYF-CD 
(channel 28). Watertown is also served by PBS station WPBS-TV (channel 
16) and ABC affiliate WWTI-TV (channel 50), which also operates the area's 
CW affiliate through The CW Plus. NBC affiliate WSTM-TV (channel 3) and 
MyNetwork TV affiliate WNYS-TV (channel 43), both in Syracuse, serve as 
the de facto affiliates of those networks in the area; however the northern 
fringe of the latter's signal ends just south of the city proper. Similarly, 
WSTM-TV is carried on cable systems in the area, but WNYS-TV is not. Meanwhile, 
in the northern portion of the market, fellow NBC affiliate WPTZ (channel 
5) in Plattsburgh is also available on cable. On December 1, 2016, the 
Watertown area will become the last market in New York to have full network 
service when WVNC-LD (channel 45) signs on as the market's first full-time 
NBC affiliate.[22] Interstate 81 runs through the Watertown area. It is 
a north-south route that runs from near Dandridge, Tennessee north to Hill 
Island, Ontario, connecting via the Thousand Islands Bridge and a short 
connecting road to Highway 401 across the Canada–US border. Interstate 
81 passes just to the west of the city of Watertown, near Salmon Run Mall. 
U.S. Route 11 runs from eastern New Orleans, Louisiana, to its northern 
terminus at the Canada–US border in Rouses Point, New York. US 11 runs 
north-south through the city of Watertown. Many state highways converge 
on the city. New York State Route 3 is an east-west route that begins in 
Sterling and heads north and east to Watertown. NY 3 interchanges with 
I-81 at the city line. NY 3 heads east into Watertown, overlapping with 
both US 11 and NY 12 through downtown prior to leaving the city to the 
northeast to head through the Adirondacks to Plattsburgh. New York State 
Route 12 is a north-south route through the city, extending northward to 
Clayton then following the St. Lawrence Seaway to Morristown. A spur, NY 
12E, takes a slightly-longer path through Cape Vincent before rejoining 
NY 12. New York State Route 12F is a spur connecting NY 12 in downtown 
Watertown to NY 180 near the Watertown International Airport in Dexter. 
Adirondack Trailways serves both Syracuse, to the south, and Potsdam, to
