The Valparaiso Crusaders, often referred to as Valpo, is the name of the 
athletic teams from Valparaiso University in Valparaiso, Indiana, United 
States. The Crusaders compete in the National Collegiate Athletic Association 
(NCAA) at the Division I level as members of the Horizon League in all 
sports except for football and bowling, neither of which is sponsored by 
the conference. The football team competes in the Football Championship 
Subdivision (FCS) of Division I as a member of the Pioneer Football League, 
and the women's bowling team competes in the Southland Bowling League.[2] 
The Crusaders first joined a Division I conference in 1982 when the men's 
basketball team joined the Mid-Continent Conference. Other sports joined 
conferences in later years. Valparaiso University sponsors teams in ten 
men's and eleven women's NCAA sanctioned sports:[3] Men's Intercollegiate 
Sports Women's Intercollegiate Sports VU plays its home football games, 
as well as men's and women's soccer games, at Brown Field, which has a 
seating capacity of 5,000 people and opened in 1919. Surrounding Brown 
Field is the Warren G. Hoger Track, home to the track and field teams. 
The basketball, swimming, and volleyball teams play at the adjacent Athletics-Recreation 
Center (ARC), which has a capacity of 5,000. The Crusaders' baseball team 
plays at Emory G. Bauer Field. The tennis teams use the Valparaiso University 
Tennis Complex. The cross country teams compete at Sunset Hills Farm. After 
years of going without one, Valparaiso University pursued a mascot in 1931. 
The Uhlan was chosen over the Dunesmen and the Vandals.[4] After debate 
in 1941 over choosing a mascot less proximate to the Nazi cause, the Crusader 
was chosen as the new mascot in 1942. The original illustrated mascot was 
penned by a Disney artist and patented in 1951, and used until 2010, when 
the school rebranded itself athletically and academically. Owing to the 
Post-9/11 controversy over the “Crusaders” nickname,[5] only Valpo and 
the College of the Holy Cross maintain Crusaders at the NCAA Division I 
level. The Valparaiso football program was started in 1919, as prior to 
this point the administration believed athletics were a distraction from 
academic pursuits. George Keogan, who also coached the men's basketball 
team, was the first coach. The first game was October 4 at Brown Field, 
a win over the Chicago YMCA team 26-0. The team had a 5-3 record that year.[6] 
In 1943 and 1944, the Crusaders did not field a football team due to World 
War II. The Crusaders resumed their football program in 1945. That year, 
they joined their first conference, the Indiana Collegiate Conference, 
their home until 1976. The post-war years began a tremendous run of coaching 
stability. They hired Emory Bauer in 1946. Bauer would coach the team until 
1967. Walt Reiner would also coach the team from 1957 until 1964. Until 
2006, only four other men would coach the Crusaders. This includes Stacy 
Adams who in 2005 became the university's first African American head coach. 
In 1977, the Crusaders joined the Heartland Collegiate Conference. In 1990, 
the Crusaders moved to the Midwest Intercollegiate Football Conference. 
During their time in these conferences, they would lose more often than 
win. In 1993, the NCAA mandated that schools playing Division I basketball 
may only play football in Division I. The Crusaders along with five other 
schools formed the Pioneer Football League, where they remain today. Playing 
primarily against non-scholarship teams, the Crusaders' reversed their 
fortunes. They won their first outright championship in 2003, when they 
won the PFL championship game. The Crusaders basketball program began in 
1917. Since then, they have won 8 conference championship tournaments and 
appeared in the NCAA tournament 7 times. They are currently coached by 
Bryce Drew (son of former coach Homer Drew) and play their home games at 
the Athletics-Recreation Center. The Crusaders baseball team advanced to 
the NCAA Tournament in 2012, where they lost to play Purdue and Kentucky 
in the Gary Regional. The regional was played at the U.S. Steel Yard. The 
Crusaders advanced in 2013 after winning their second straight Horizon 
League title, where they lost to Indiana, eliminated Florida, and lost 
to Austin Peay in the Bloomington Regional. The Crusaders women's basketball 
team started play during the 1971-1972 season. The team joined the North 
Star Conference for the 1987-1988 season. In 1990-1991, the Crusaders reached 
the finals of the North Star Conference Tournament before losing to DePaul. 
The Crusaders' best season in the North Star Conference was 1991-1992. 
That year, they finished with a record of 20-9. The 1992-1993 season was 
their first season in the Mid-Continent Conference. The Crusaders advanced 
to the NCAA Tournament in 2003 and 2004 seasons under coach Keith Freeman. 
The Crusaders lost in the first round each of these years, to Purdue and 
Kansas State, respectively. Marlous Nieuwveen is the only Crusader to appear 
in a WNBA game. Debbie Bolen (1989–1993) and hall of fall class of 1999, 
is the current holder of 18 single game records, season and career women's 
basketball individual records including points scored, scoring average, 
most field goals, most free throws, assists, and steals. The women's volleyball 
team has appeared in the NCAA Tournament in 1994, 1995 and 2003–2005. In 
2005, the Crusaders advanced to the NCAA Tournament. In 1996, the Crusaders 
advanced to the NCAA Tournament. The Crusaders softball team advanced to 
the NCAA Tournament in 2012, where they lost to Louisville in the first 
round of the Louisville Regional. In the second round, the Crusaders lost 
to Kentucky. The Crusaders softball team advanced to the NCAA Tournament 
in 2013, where they lost to Michigan in the first round of the Ann Arbor 
Regional. In the second round, the Crusaders eliminated Central Michigan. 
However, they lost to California in the third round. In 2007, the women's 
team finished in third place in the Mid-Continent Conference championships, 
only losing to Southern Utah and Oral Roberts. The men's team finished 
fifth. In addition, sophomore Laura Rolf was named an All-American in the 
mile run, finishing tenth at the NCAA Indoor Track and Field Championship.[7] 
On October 11, 2014 the Warren G. Hoger Track was officially dedicated 
by University President Mark Heckler, donor Jay Christopher, Warren Hoger, 
athletic director Mark LaBarbera, head coach Ryan Moore and athlete Alex 
Vasile. The ribbon was cut at on Brown Field during the halftime of the 
Crusader football game. The Valparaiso University Track and Field team 
is made of men and women competing in different events including sprints, 
distance, jumps and throws. The team competes in an indoor and outdoor 
season both leading up to the Horizon League Conference Championships.
