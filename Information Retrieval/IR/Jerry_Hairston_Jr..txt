Jerry Wayne Hairston Jr. (born May 29, 1976) is an American former professional 
baseball infielder and outfielder. Hairston played in Major League Baseball 
from 1998 to 2013 with the Baltimore Orioles, Chicago Cubs, Texas Rangers, 
Cincinnati Reds, New York Yankees, San Diego Padres, Washington Nationals, 
Milwaukee Brewers, and Los Angeles Dodgers. He played every position except 
pitcher and catcher during his baseball career. He is the grandson of former 
major leaguer Sam Hairston, the son of former major leaguer Jerry Hairston 
Sr., and the brother of Scott Hairston.[1][2] He helped the Yankees win 
the 2009 World Series, beating the Philadelphia Phillies, giving him his 
only World Series title. In High School, he was a two-time All-State selection 
at Naperville North High School in baseball and an all-area selection in 
basketball. He was drafted in the 42nd round of the 1995 Major League Baseball 
draft by the Baltimore Orioles but chose instead to go to college. Hairston 
played college ball at Southern Illinois University in 1996 and 1997, where 
he batted .360 for his career and was the Missouri Valley Conference Freshman 
of the Year in 1996. He was later inducted as a member of the Southern 
Illinois Baseball Hall of Fame. Hairston was drafted in the 11th round 
of the 1997 Major League Baseball draft by the Baltimore Orioles. He made 
his professional debut in 1997 with the rookie-league Bluefield Orioles, 
where he hit .330 in 59 games. In 1998, he made a fast rise up the farm 
system, starting in A with the Frederick Keys, where he played in 80 games 
and hit .302, then he was promoted to the AA Bowie Baysox, where he hit 
.326 in 55 games and received a September promotion to the Major Leagues. 
He made his major league debut with the Orioles on September 11, 1998 against 
the Anaheim Angels at second base, he was hitless in three at-bats in that 
game. He appeared in a total of 7 games in 1998, primarily as a pinch runner 
or late inning defensive replacement, and did not get a hit in 7 at-bats. 
In 1999 and 2000, he split his time between the AAA Rochester Red Wings 
and the Orioles. He recorded his first Major League hit on June 27, 1999 
off of New York Yankees pitcher Orlando Hernández and his first home run 
came off of Joey Hamilton of the Toronto Blue Jays on July 1, 1999. He 
had fairly regular playing time with the Orioles in 2001 and 2002 and was 
used more as a utility player in 2003 and 2004. In his seven seasons with 
Baltimore, he played in 558 games, batting .261. He was traded (along with 
Oriole prospects Mike Fontenot and David Crouthers) to the Chicago Cubs 
in the 2005 offseason for Sammy Sosa. The Cubs attempted to use Hairston 
as a leadoff man, but he finished the 2005 season with an unremarkable 
on-base percentage of .336 and stole only 8 bases in 17 attempts. Even 
though most Cubs fans initially welcomed the dismissal of Sosa—whose performance 
was on the decline and was seen as a problematic teammate—the poor play 
of Hairston would eventually cause many fans to sour on this particular 
trade. In two seasons with the Cubs, he hit .251 in 152 games. Hairston's 
statistics declined further at the start of the 2006 season, and on May 
31, he was traded to the Texas Rangers for Phil Nevin. Hairston was released 
from the Rangers after the 2006 season but re-signed to a minor league 
contract with an invitation to spring training. Hairston won a spot on 
the opening day roster, as a reserve outfielder and utility player. A series 
of injuries to teammates Hank Blalock, Ian Kinsler, Mark Teixeira, and 
Frank Catalanotto, as well as the trades of Teixeira and Kenny Lofton, 
led to Hairston playing on a regular basis throughout the 2007 season. 
Hairston became a free agent after the season. In his two seasons with 
Texas, he hit .194 in 136 games. On March 3, 2008, Hairston signed a minor 
league contract with the Cincinnati Reds. On April 21, his contract was 
purchased by the Reds and was added to the roster. He was re-signed after 
the season, on January 7, 2009, to a one-year contract; the contract contained 
$2 million in guaranteed money.[3] In two seasons with the Reds, he hit 
.287 in 166 games. Hairston represented Mexico at the 2009 World Baseball 
Classic alongside his brother Scott. Hairston's mother was born in Mexico, 
making him eligible to play for the Mexican team.[4][5] He had 4 hits in 
14 at-bats in the Classic. On July 31, 2009, he was traded to the New York 
Yankees for minor league catcher Chase Weems. On August 1, 2009, Hairston 
got his first hit and RBI as a Yankee. On October 17, 2009, he got his 
first career post-season hit in his first career post-season at-bat and 
later ended a 13-inning ALCS Game 2 by scoring on an error by the Angels' 
Maicer Izturis. This gave the Yankees a 2–0 advantage going into the third 
game of the series. He had 1 hit in 6 at-bats for the Yankees in the 2009 
World Series. In his half season with the Yanks, he hit .237 in 45 games. 
On January 18, 2010, Hairston signed a one-year, $2.15 million contract 
with the San Diego Padres, the same team as his brother, Scott Hairston, 
was playing on.[6] Hairston's 2010 season was cut short in September with 
a fractured right tibia, but he still played in 119 games with the Padres, 
hitting .244. On January 19, 2011, Hairston agreed to a one-year, $2 million 
contract with the Washington Nationals that included over $1 million in 
incentives.[7] He played in 75 games for them, hitting .268. On July 30, 
2011, Hairston was traded to the Milwaukee Brewers for Double-A outfielder 
Erik Komatsu.[8] He played in 45 games for the Brewers, hitting .274. On 
December 5, 2011, the Los Angeles Dodgers signed Hairston to a two-year 
contract worth $6 million.[9] On June 1, 2012 Hairston was part of a Dodgers 
lineup that featured the sons of five former Major Leaguers (along with 
Tony Gwynn Jr., Iván DeJesús Jr., Dee Gordon and Scott Van Slyke). This 
was the first time in Major League history that this had occurred. It was 
also the first time a starting infield of four major league sons had ever 
occurred: first baseman Van Slyke, second baseman Hairston, third baseman 
De Jesus and shortstop Gordon.[10] On August 22, it was determined that 
Hairston would need surgery on his left hip. The injury had bothered him 
for some time before he finally went on the disabled list on August 13. 
The surgery would sideline him for the rest of the season.[11] In 78 games 
with the Dodgers in 2012, Hairston hit .273 while playing numerous different 
positions. In 2013, Hairston was a key reserve for the Dodgers, playing 
28 games at third base, 23 in left field, 4 in right field, 13 at first 
base and 1 at second base. He struggled with the bat however, hitting just 
.211. On December 11, 2013, it was announced that Hairston would be retiring 
as an active player to join the Dodgers pre and post game broadcasting 
crew on SportsNet LA.[12] According to Luis Fernando Llosa and L. Jon Wertheim, 
Hairston received genotropin, human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), and clomiphene 
citrate in 2004. One of Hairston's prescriptions was written by "A. Almarashi." 
Investigators believe Almarashi is an alias for a Queens, N.Y., doctor 
stripped of her medical license in 1999. She is awaiting trial on multiple 
charges after allegedly writing bogus prescriptions for thousands of online 
customers she never examined. Hairston denied any connection, stating "Not 
one time have I taken steroids or anything like that. [ . . .] I would 
never do anything like that to jeopardize my career or my family's name." 
On December 13, 2007, he was cited in the Mitchell Report to the Commissioner 
of Baseball of an Independent Investigation Into the Illegal Use of Steroids 
and Other Performance Enhancing Substances by Players in Major League Baseball.[13] 
Jerry's brother Scott is also a professional baseball player. Their father 
Jerry Hairston Sr. and grandfather Sam Hairston were also major league 
players, making him the first African American to be a third-generation 
major-leaguer. Hairston's heritage is also Mexican American on his mother's 
side.[4] His uncle Johnny Hairston also played in the majors. Several other 
family members have also played in the minor leagues. He attended Naperville 
North High School in Naperville, Illinois and Southern Illinois University.
