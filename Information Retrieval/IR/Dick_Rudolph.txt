Richard Rudolph (August 25, 1887, in New York City â€“ October 20, 1949, 
in Bronx, New York), was a pitcher in the Major Leagues from 1910 to 1927. 
He played for the New York Giants and Boston Braves. He was an alumnus 
of Fordham University. Rudolph was known for throwing the spitball, and 
he was one of the 17 pitchers allowed to continue throwing the pitch after 
it was outlawed in 1920. In 1914, Rudolph was a member of the Braves team 
that went from last place to first place in two months, becoming the first 
team to win a pennant after being in last place on the Fourth of July.[1] 
The team then went on to defeat Connie Mack's heavily favored Philadelphia 
Athletics in the 1914 World Series, with Rudolph winning two of the games.
