James Gorman Thomas III (born December 12, 1950) is an American former 
professional baseball player. He played Major League Baseball (MLB) as 
a center fielder and right-handed hitter. Thomas played in the American 
League (AL) with the Milwaukee Brewers (1973–76, 1978–83, 1986), Cleveland 
Indians (1983) and Seattle Mariners (1984–86).[1] With the Brewers, Thomas 
was one of the franchise's most popular players. He was a leading home 
run hitter in the late 1970s and early 1980s, though he hit for a low batting 
average and frequently struck out. Thomas had good fielding skills and 
his throwing arm was strong until shoulder surgery in 1984, after which 
he became a designated hitter until his retirement in 1986. Thomas was 
born in Charleston, South Carolina. His father, Gorman Sr, was a postal 
worker and a former minor league pitcher.[2] Thomas was raised in nearby 
James Island. He attended James Island High School.[3] In high school, 
Thomas earned 14 letters in four sports - baseball, football, basketball 
and track. He was the first draft pick of the Seattle Pilots in 1969.[4] 
In 1971, Thomas played Class A baseball in the Milwaukee system. With the 
Danville Warriors that year, Thomas led the Midwest League in both home 
runs and strikeouts.[5] The next year with the Class AA San Antonio Brewers, 
Thomas led the Texas League in the same two categories, registering 26 
home runs versus 171 strikeouts.[6] Thomas spent parts of 1973 and 1974 
in the major leagues with the Brewers, but he mostly played Class AAA baseball 
during those seasons. With the Sacramento Solons of the Pacific Coast League 
in 1974, Thomas finished second in the league in home runs (51), third 
in RBI (122), fourth in walks (93), third in runs scored (117) and first 
in strikeouts (175).[7] He spent most of the next two years on the bench 
with the Brewers, but he enjoyed being teammates with Hank Aaron during 
Aaron's last two MLB seasons.[2] Thomas played in Class AAA for the entire 
1977 season. After the season, Thomas was traded to the Texas Rangers as 
the player to be named later in an earlier trade for Ed Kirkpatrick. Rangers 
executive Dan O'Brien Sr. explained the move as a temporary "friendship 
deal". Brewers general manager Harry Dalton needed to open up a roster 
spot over the winter, and he asked O'Brien to hold Thomas on the Texas 
roster for a few months. In February 1978, O'Brien sold Thomas back to 
Milwaukee before he appeared in any games with the Rangers.[8] Becoming 
an everyday center fielder for the Brewers in 1978, Thomas hit 32 home 
runs to go along with 86 RBI. In 1979, Thomas enjoyed his best MLB season, 
compiling career high numbers in home runs (45, first in the AL), RBI (123), 
runs scored (97), hits (136), doubles (29), walks (98), on-base percentage 
(.356), total bases (300), slugging percentage (.539) and OPS (.895). He 
finished seventh in MVP Award voting. Thomas was affectionately known as 
"Stormin' Gorman."[9] In 1980, Thomas had another productive season, hitting 
38 home runs to go along with 105 RBI, while playing in every game. Gorman 
followed that up in 1981 by finishing second in the AL in home runs with 
21 and being named to the AL All-Star Team. He finished eighth in MVP Award 
voting that year. In 1982, Thomas hit an AL-high 39 home runs (tying with 
Reggie Jackson for the league lead) and drove in 112 runs to help the Brewers 
win the American League Championship and face the Cardinals in the World 
Series. The Brewers lost to the Cardinals in seven games, with Thomas striking 
out against Bruce Sutter to end the Series. In June 1983, Thomas, Jamie 
Easterly, and Ernie Camacho were traded to the Cleveland Indians in exchange 
for Rick Manning and Rick Waits.[10] Thomas's play had declined late in 
the 1982 season; he hit .181 after September 1, and he had only four hits 
in more than 40 at bats in the 1982 postseason. After the announcement 
of the trade, angry Brewers fans flooded the team's switchboard with phone 
calls criticizing the transaction. [11] After the 1983 season, Thomas expressed 
his desire for another trade, saying that he did not feel comfortable playing 
in Cleveland.[12] Thomas had hit more home runs during the period from 
1978 to 1983 than any other player in the AL (197). Traded to the Seattle 
Mariners for the 1984 season, Thomas played in only 53 games for the team 
that year before he underwent season-ending rotator cuff surgery in June. 
In spring training before the 1985 season, Thomas had some difficulty with 
the timing of his swing, but he was able to swing without pain and he was 
looking forward to assuming Seattle's designated hitter role.[13] Thomas 
was selected as The Sporting News AL Comeback Player of the Year in 1985, 
hitting 32 home runs and 87 RBI.[14] However, Thomas - normally a practical 
joker - began to feel alienated from his teammates. At a team tenth anniversary 
party, Thomas was left out of a 1985 Mariners highlight video. Mariners 
executives said they tried to trade him away but that there was minimal 
interest in Thomas because of his age and his limitation to the designated 
hitter role.[15] After Dick Williams took over as the manager in Seattle 
toward the beginning of the 1986 season, Thomas saw decreased playing time. 
By late June, he was hitting .192 with 10 home runs and 26 RBI, and the 
team decided to release him. Thomas was making $650,000 that season and 
Mariners owner George Argyros had to absorb the loss of $361,000 that was 
still owed to Thomas under that contract.[16] Thomas contemplated retirement, 
and he turned down a contract offer from the Detroit Tigers, but he signed 
with the Brewers a couple of weeks later to fill a designated hitter and 
pinch hitter role.[17][18] Thomas retired after the 1986 season.[19] He 
was a career .225 hitter with 268 home runs and 782 RBI in 1435 games. 
In retirement, Thomas played amateur golf and he spent time hunting and 
carving duck decoys. In the early 1990s, he collected limited-edition prints 
and considered opening an art gallery.[19] Thomas works under a personal 
services contract with the Brewers to make appearances in the community 
and welcome visitors to Gorman's Grill at Miller Park. He was elected to
