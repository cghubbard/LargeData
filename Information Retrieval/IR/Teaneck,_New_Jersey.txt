Teaneck /ˈtiːnɛk/ is a township in Bergen County, New Jersey, United States, 
and a suburb in the New York metropolitan area. As of the 2010 United States 
Census, the township's population was 39,776,[10][11][12] reflecting an 
increase of 516 (+1.3%) from the 39,260 counted in the 2000 Census, which 
had in turn increased by 1,435 (+3.8%) from the 37,825 counted in the 1990 
Census.[21] As of 2010 it was the second-most populous among the 70 municipalities 
in Bergen County, behind Hackensack, which had a population of 43,010.[22] 
Teaneck was created on February 19, 1895 by an act of the New Jersey Legislature 
from portions of Englewood Township and Ridgefield Township, both of which 
are now defunct (despite existing municipalities with similar names), along 
with portions of Bogota and Leonia.[23] Independence followed the result 
of a referendum held on January 14, 1895, in which voters favored incorporation 
by a 46–7 margin.[24] To address the concerns of Englewood Township's leaders, 
the new municipality was formed as a township, rather than succumbing to 
the borough craze sweeping across Bergen County at the time.[24] On May 3, 
1921, and June 1, 1926, portions of what had been Teaneck were transferred 
to Overpeck Township.[25] Teaneck lies at the junction of Interstate 95 
and the eastern terminus of Interstate 80.[26] The township is bisected 
into north and south portions by Route 4 and east and west by the CSX Transportation 
River Subdivision. Commercial development is concentrated in four main 
shopping areas, on Cedar Lane, Teaneck Road, DeGraw Avenue, West Englewood 
Avenue and Queen Anne Road, more commonly known as "The Plaza".[27] Teaneck's 
location at the crossroads of river, road, train and other geographical 
features has made it a site of many momentous events across the centuries. 
After the American defeat at the Battle of Fort Washington, George Washington 
and the troops of the Continental Army retreated across New Jersey from 
the British Army, traveling through Teaneck and crossing the Hackensack 
River at New Bridge Landing, which has since been turned into a state park 
and historic site commemorating the events of 1776 and of early colonial 
life. In 1965, Teaneck voluntarily desegregated its public schools, after 
the Board of Education approved a plan to do so by a 7–2 vote on May 13, 
1964.[28][29] Teaneck has a diverse population, with large Jewish and African 
American communities, and growing numbers of Hispanic and Asian residents.[30] 
The origin and meaning of the name "Teaneck" is not known, but speculation 
is that it could come from various Dutch or English words, or it could 
be Native American in origin, meaning "the woods".[31] An alternative is 
from the Dutch "Tiene Neck" meaning "neck where there are willows" (from 
the Dutch "tene" meaning willow).[25] The earliest uses of the word "Teaneck" 
were in reference to a series of Lenni Lenape Native American camps near 
the ridge formed by what became Queen Anne Road. Chief Oratam was the leader 
of a settlement called "Achikinhesacky" that existed along Overpeck Creek 
in the area near what became Fycke Lane.[32] A neighborhood variously called 
East Hackensack or New Hackensack was established along a ridge on the 
east bank of the Hackensack River, site of a Native American trail that 
followed the river's path along what is now River Road, with the earliest 
known buildings constructed dating back as far as 1704. Other early European 
settlements were established along what became Teaneck Road, which is the 
site of a number of Dutch stone houses that remain standing since their 
construction in the 1700s, several of which have been added to the National 
Register of Historic Places.[33] During November 1776, General George Washington 
passed through Teaneck in the aftermath of the Battle of Fort Lee, as part 
of the hasty retreat of ragtag Colonial forces from Fort Lee on the Hudson 
River in the wake of the successful British invasion and defeat of Continental 
Army forces in Manhattan on the opposite side of the river during the Battle 
of Fort Washington. Early on the morning of November 20, 1776, Washington 
rode by horseback from his headquarters in Hackensack through Teaneck and 
across Overpeck Creek to Fort Lee. There he watched as 6,000 British troops 
travel up the river by boat. He had his troops abandon their position on 
the Palisades in a poorly organized retreat in which most of their supplies 
were abandoned, with Washington's troops moving inland across Overpeck 
Creek and through Teaneck to New Bridge Landing (in what is now Brett Park) 
and crossing the bridge, one of the few available at the time. The soldiers, 
many poorly dressed, ill-equipped and without shoes, faced the cold rain, 
leading Thomas Paine to compose the pamphlet, The American Crisis, in which 
he captured the depth of the defeat by describing those days with the words 
"These are the times that try men's souls". Throughout the war, both British 
and American forces occupied local homesteads at various times, and Teaneck 
citizens played key roles on both sides of the conflict.[33] After the 
war, Teaneck returned to being a quiet farm community. Fruits and vegetables 
grown locally were taken by wagon to markets in nearby Paterson and New 
York City. New growth and development were spurred in the mid-19th century 
by the establishment of railroads throughout the area. Wealthy New Yorkers 
and others purchased large properties on which they built spacious mansions 
and manor houses. They traveled daily to work in New York City, thus becoming 
Teaneck's first suburban commuters.[33] The largest estate built in Teaneck 
belonged to William Walter Phelps, the son of a wealthy railroad magnate 
and New York City merchant. In 1865, Phelps arrived in Teaneck and enlarged 
an old farmhouse into a large Victorian mansion on the site of the present 
Municipal Government Complex. Phelps' "Englewood Farm" eventually encompassed 
nearly 2,000 acres (8.1 km2) of landscaped property within the central 
part of Teaneck, on which some 600,000 trees were planted.[30] Subsequent 
development and house construction were focused along the perimeters of 
the township, with the central part of the community remaining a large 
property crisscrossed by roads and trails. The Township of Teaneck was 
established on February 19, 1895 and was composed of portions of Englewood 
Township, Ridgefield Township and Bogota.[23] Teaneck's choice to incorporate 
as a township was unusual in an era of "Boroughitis", in which a flood 
of new municipalities were being formed using the borough form of government.[24] 
The other two municipalities formed in Bergen County in 1895 were both 
boroughs, in addition to the 26 boroughs that were formed in the county 
in 1894 alone.[34] At a referendum held on January 14, 1895, 46 of 53 voters 
approved incorporation as a Borough. Citizens of Englewood Township challenged 
the creation of a borough, but accepted the new municipality as a township, 
given its more rural character. A bill supporting the creation of the Township 
of Teaneck was put through the New Jersey General Assembly on February 
18, 1895, and the New Jersey Senate on the next day. Governor of New Jersey 
George Werts signed the bill into law, and Teaneck was an independent municipality.[24] 
At its incorporation, Teaneck's population was 811. William W. Bennett, 
overseer of the Phelps Estate, was selected as chairman of the first three-man 
Township Committee, which focused in its early years on "construction of 
streets and street lamps (originally gaslights), trolley lines (along DeGraw 
Avenue), telephones and speeding traffic."[35] The opening of the Phelps 
Estate in 1927 led to substantial population growth.[36] The George Washington 
Bridge was completed in 1931, and its connection to Teaneck via Route 4 
brought thousands of new home buyers. From 1920 and 1930, Teaneck's population 
nearly quadrupled, from 4,192 to 16,513.[37] Rapid growth led to financial 
turmoil, and inefficiencies in the town government resulted in the adoption 
of a new nonpartisan Council-Manager form of government under the 1923 
Municipal Manager Law in a referendum on September 16, 1930. A full-time 
Town Manager, Paul A. Volcker, Sr. (father of future Chairman of the Federal 
Reserve Paul A. Volcker, Jr.), was appointed to handle Teaneck's day-to-day 
business affairs. During his 20-year term, from 1930 to 1950, Volcker implemented 
prudent financial management practices, a development plan that included 
comprehensive zoning regulations, along with a civil service system for 
municipal employees and a professional fire department.[33] The New Jersey 
Supreme Court issued a ruling in 1942 upholding a Teaneck ordinance that 
had banned pinball machines on the grounds that they were gambling devices 
rather than a form of amusement.[38] Teaneck was selected in 1949 from 
over 10,000 communities as America's model community. Photographs were 
taken and a film produced about life in Teaneck, which were shown in Occupied 
Japan as a part of the United States Army's education program to show democracy 
in action.[39] After World War II, there was a second major spurt of building 
and population growth. The African American population in the northeast 
corner of Teaneck grew substantially starting in the 1960s, accompanied 
by white flight triggered by blockbusting efforts of township real estate 
agencies.[40] In 1965, after a struggle to address de facto segregation 
in housing and education, Teaneck became the first community in the nation 
where a white majority voluntarily voted for school integration, without 
a court order requiring the district to implement the change. The sequence 
of events was the subject of a book titled Triumph in a White Suburb written 
by township resident Reginald G. Damerell (New York: William Morrow & Company, 
Inc., 1968).[41][42] As de facto racial segregation increased, so did tensions 
between residents of the northeast and members of the predominantly white 
male Teaneck Police Department. On the evening of April 10, 1990, the Teaneck 
Police Department responded to a call from a resident complaining about 
a teenager with a gun. After an initial confrontation near Bryant School 
and a subsequent chase, Phillip Pannell, an African American teenager, 
was shot and killed by Gary Spath, a white Teaneck police officer. Spath 
said he thought Pannell had a gun and was turning to shoot him. Witnesses 
said Pannell was unarmed and had been shot in the back. Protest marches, 
some violent, ensued; most African Americans believed that Pannell had 
been killed in cold blood, while other residents insisted that Spath had 
been justified in his actions. Testimony at the trial claimed that Pannell 
was shot in the back, and that he was carrying a gun. A police officer 
testified to finding a modified starter's pistol with eight cartridges 
in Pannell's jacket pocket.[43] Spath was ultimately acquitted on charges 
of reckless manslaughter in the shooting. Some months after Spath had been 
cleared, he decided to retire from law enforcement. The incident was an 
international news event that brought Reverend Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson 
to the community and inspired the 1995 book Color Lines: The Troubled Dreams 
of Racial Harmony in an American Town, by Mike Kelly.[44] Teaneck, and 
the neighboring communities of Bergenfield and New Milford, has drawn a 
large number of Modern Orthodox Jews who have established at least fourteen 
synagogues and four yeshivas (three high schools and one for young men).[45][46] 
It is the functional center of the northern New Jersey Orthodox community, 
with nearly twenty kosher shops (restaurants, bakeries and supermarkets).[47] 
It is within ten minutes' driving time of Yeshiva University in New York 
City. This community tends to be involved with Religious Zionist causes 
and offers strong support of Israel. Several homes in Teaneck date back 
to the colonial era or the period subsequent to American Revolutionary 
War and have been preserved and survive to this day. Teaneck sites on the 
National Register of Historic Places and (other historic homes) include:[48][49][50] 
According to the United States Census Bureau, the township had a total 
area of 6.226 square miles (16.127 km2), including 6.006 square miles (15.557 km2) 
of land and 0.22 square miles (0.57 km2) of water (3.54%).[1][2] Teaneck 
is bordered to the west by River Edge and Hackensack which lie across the 
Hackensack River, to the north by New Milford and Bergenfield, to the east 
by Englewood and Leonia, and to the south by Ridgefield Park and Bogota.[62] 
Unincorporated communities, localities and place names located partially 
or completely within the township include New Bridge and West Englewood.[63] 
English is spoken by 74.3% of residents. Other languages (accounting for 
more than 1% of residents) include Spanish (10.5%), Hebrew (2.8%), Tagalog 
(1.9%), Urdu (1.2%) and Russian (1.1%).[72] At the 2010 United States Census, 
there were 39,776 people, 13,470 households, and 10,129 families residing 
in the township. The population density was 6,622.2 per square mile (2,556.8/km2). 
There were 14,024 housing units at an average density of 2,334.8 per square 
mile (901.5/km2). The racial makeup of the township was 53.33% (21,214) 
White, 27.69% (11,013) Black or African American, 0.28% (113) Native American, 
9.11% (3,622) Asian, 0.06% (25) Pacific Islander, 6.04% (2,403) from other 
races, and 3.48% (1,386) from two or more races. Hispanics or Latinos of 
any race were 16.53% (6,575) of the population.[10] There were 13,470 households, 
of which 34.1% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 58.0% 
were married couples living together, 13.4% had a female householder with 
no husband present, and 24.8% were non-families. 20.8% of all households 
were made up of individuals, and 10.5% had someone living alone who was 
65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.88 and the average 
family size was 3.37.[10] In the township, 25.0% of the population were 
under the age of 18, 9.4% from 18 to 24, 23.1% from 25 to 44, 27.7% from 
45 to 64, and 14.8% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 
39.3 years. For every 100 females there were 89.0 males. For every 100 
females age 18 and over, there were 84.7 males.[10] The Census Bureau's 
2006–2010 American Community Survey showed that (in 2010 inflation-adjusted 
dollars) median household income was $92,107 (with a margin of error of 
+/- $3,556) and the median family income was $108,777 (+/- $5,024). Males 
had a median income of $74,055 (+/- $5,587) versus $54,959 (+/- $4,129) 
for females. The per capita income for the township was $42,335 (+/- $2,061). 
About 5.7% of families and 6.9% of the population were below the poverty 
line, including 8.9% of those under age 18 and 7.2% of those age 65 or 
over.[73] Same-sex couples headed 126 households in 2010, an increase from 
the 80 counted in 2000.[74] As of the 2000 United States Census,[18] there 
were 39,260 people, 13,418 households, and 10,076 families residing in 
the township. The population density was 6,486.2 people per square mile 
(2,505.5/km2). There were 13,719 housing units at an average density of 
2,266.5 per square mile (875.5/km2). The racial makeup of the township 
was 56.3% White, 28.8% African American, 0.2% Native American, 7.1% Asian, 
<0.1% Pacific Islander, 4.2% from other races, and 3.5% from two or more 
races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 10.5% of the population.[70][71] 
There were 13,418 households out of which 34.9% had children under the 
age of 18 living with them, 59.3% were married couples living together, 
12.3% had a female householder with no husband present, and 24.9% were 
non-families. 21.2% of all households were made up of individuals and 10.5% 
had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average 
household size was 2.86 and the average family size was 3.34.[70][71] In 
the township the population was spread out with 25.8% under the age of 
18, 8.5% from 18 to 24, 26.1% from 25 to 44, 25.3% from 45 to 64, and 14.2% 
who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 38 years. For every 
100 females there were 89.9 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, 
there were 84.9 males.[70][71] The median income for a household in the 
township was $74,903, and the median income for a family was $84,791. Males 
had a median income of $53,327 versus $40,085 for females. The per capita 
income for the township was $32,212. About 2.4% of families and 4.2% of 
the population were below the poverty line, including 3.7% of those under 
age 18 and 6.7% of those age 65 or over.[70][71] Ancestry information reported 
in the 2000 Census reflects the diversity of Teaneck residents, with no 
single country accounting for more than a small fraction of the population. 
Residents listed Italian (6.2%), German (6.0%), Russian (5.3%), Irish (5.1%) 
and Polish (4.2%) as the most common countries of ancestry, and an additional 
4.3% listed United States. 6.3% of residents identified themselves as being 
of West Indian ancestry, of which 3.4% were from Jamaica.[75] After its 
founding as a township, Teaneck saw rapid growth in its population during 
the first half of the 20th century. As Teaneck changed from a sparsely 
populated rural area into a suburb, particularly after development of property 
that had been part of the Phelps Estate started in the late 1920s, Teaneck's 
population grew rapidly, far outpacing the growth of Bergen County. After 
World War II, the 1950 Census showed growth in Teaneck (33.6%) pacing Bergen 
County overall (31.6%). Starting in 1960, a substantial decline in the 
rate of growth compared to Bergen County occurred as Teaneck reached the 
limits of developable land, and the township neared its peak population. 
Population growth in the 1970 Census was small, but positive, with Teaneck 
reaching its historical maximum of 42,355. Absolute declines in population 
followed in both the 1980 (−7.9%) and 1990 (−3.0%) data. The 2000 Census 
showed recovery in Teaneck's population to 39,260, though growth (3.8%) 
was smaller than in Bergen County overall (7.1%).[70] With almost no land 
left to develop for housing, Teaneck's population is likely to remain stable 
for the foreseeable future. A reluctance to permit high-rise development 
as a means to increase population density also places a limit on growth. 
Changes in family size and the possibility of zoning changes to allow denser 
construction are some of the few influences that may affect population 
over time. According to the FBI's 2011 Uniform Crime Report, there were 
604 crimes in the township in 2011 (vs. 678 in 2010), of which 70 were 
violent crimes (vs. 79 in 2010) and 534 non-violent crimes (vs. 599 in 
the previous year). The 2011 total crime rate per thousand residents was 
15.2 (vs. 17.0 in 2010), compared to 13.6 in Bergen County and 24.7 statewide. 
The violent crime rate was 1.8 per thousand in 2011 (down from 2.0 in the 
previous year), while the rate was 1.0 in the county and 3.1 in New Jersey.[76] 
Gang violence hit Teaneck in July 2006 with the death of Ricky Lee Smith, 
Jr., a teenager shot outside a house party by a member of the Bloods gang 
who had attended the party. In June 2007, the Township Council approved 
the hiring of five additional officers after the Chief of Police had requested 
the addition of 14 new officers to Teaneck's existing 98-member police 
force to establish a gang unit.[77][78][79] Teaneck has received attention 
in the media due to sexual crimes committed against minors by New Jersey 
educators. Joseph White, former principal of Teaneck High School, pleaded 
guilty to official child endangerment in June 2006 and was sentenced to 
one year in prison. White had been charged in 2002 with fondling a 17-year-old 
student and was subsequently acquitted.[80] James Darden, an award-winning 
former eighth grade teacher at Thomas Jefferson Middle School, was charged 
with sexual assault and misconduct in June 2007. He pleaded guilty on December 
2007 to a charge of aggravated sexual assault and faces up to 8½ years 
in prison when sentenced on January 18, 2008.[81] The December 1975 murder 
of Jean Diggs and her four children has never been solved.[82] Police reported 
in 1977 that they had been unable to identify a perpetrator after two years 
and thousands of hours spent investigating the crime.[83] A pair of killings 
hit Teaneck in 2010, with council watcher Joan Davis and software engineer 
Robert Cantor both killed in their homes, in cases that had not been solved 
in more than a year after the incidents.[84] The murder of Robert Cantor 
has since been solved. Major institutions in Teaneck include Holy Name 
Medical Center and the Metropolitan Campus of Fairleigh Dickinson University, 
the largest private university in the state.[85] The Teaneck Armory is 
the home of the New Jersey National Guard's 50th Main Support Battalion.[86] 
Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation, a major multinational provider 
of high-technology services, maintains its global headquarters operations 
in Teaneck,[87] located in the Glenpointe Centre, Teaneck's largest single 
group of commercial ratable entities, which includes a 350-room Marriott 
Hotel and 650,000 square feet (60,000 m2) of Class A office space at the 
intersection of Interstate 95 and Interstate 80.[88][89] Teaneck has four 
main commercial districts: Cedar Lane, north Teaneck Road, West Englewood 
Avenue/The Plaza and Queen Anne Road/DeGraw Avenue.[90] Cedar Lane underwent 
a $3.9 million Streetscape project, completed in 2006, designed to attract 
additional business to the area through new sidewalk paving with brick 
edging, bump-outs to allow easier pedestrian crossing, old-fashioned lamp 
posts and street plantings.[91] The Givaudan Fragrances Corporation Creative 
Fragrances Centre, a division of Givaudan, was constructed in 1972 from 
a design by Der Scutt, architect of the Trump Tower.[92] Givaudan Roure 
vacated the building in 2009 and the facility was acquired by World of 
Wings, which renovated the building for use as a butterfly exhibition aimed 
at families.[93] The Puffin Foundation and its Puffin Cultural Forum have 
been leading supporters and producers of art in Teaneck, sponsoring plays 
and art exhibitions at it location on Puffin Way.[94] Teaneck is home to 
the Ethical Culture Society of Bergen County, founded in 1953. The Bergen 
Society is a member organization of the American Ethical Union.[95] The 
Teaneck Community Band presents a series of outdoor band concerts at the 
Votee Park Bandshell each summer. The 69th annual series, in 2013, was 
sponsored by the Puffin Foundation.[96][97] 2013–14 will mark the 78th 
season of the Bergen Philharmonic Orchestra, which performs in the auditorium 
of Benjamin Franklin Middle School, having been founded in 1938 as the 
Teaneck Symphony Orchestra.[98][99] The now-defunct Teaneck Cultural Arts 
Coalition had organized many community-wide cultural events, including 
an annual First Night community celebration of the arts held for several 
years through New Year's 2005.[100] The Garage Theatre Group, Bergen County's 
first non-profit, professional theatre company, stages fully professional 
productions, with members of Actors Equity, as well as youth conservatory 
productions at the Becton Theatre on the campus of Farleigh Dickinson University.[101] 
Teaneck New Theatre, founded in 1986, performs productions at St. Mark's 
Church in Teaneck and at the Hackensack Cultural Arts Center.[102] Black 
Box Studios is a theater group based in Congregation Beth Shalom, that 
has a relationship with the Bergen PAC in Englewood. The actors are mostly 
children and teens ages 10–16, with a 7–9 year old workshop, and an adult 
workshop. There are two to three performances presented in the first two 
or three weeks of January, and the first two weeks of June. Drama and musical 
theatre summer camps are offered.[103] Cedar Lane Cinema had been the township's 
lone movie theater, and had also hosted live performances on its stage 
by local performance groups, until it closed its doors in November 2012, 
with theater operator Majestic Entertainment citing costs that could run 
to as much as $500,000 to modernize the projection systems on all four 
screens to use digital technology rather than 35mm reels of film.[104] 
New owner Matthew Latten signed a lease in April 2013 and undertook extensive 
renovations that included new seating, modern digital projection systems 
and digital signage.[105] After hosting the Teaneck International Film 
Festival in November, the reopening of the renamed Teaneck Cineams was 
delayed until December 2013, with added time needed to complete the work 
needed to add modern features and conveniences while retaining the Art 
Deco character of a theater first constructed in 1937.[106] Teaneck has 
been the site of many films, including The Family Man, the 2000 film starring 
Nicolas Cage.[107] The Teaneck Armory has been used for films including 
Sweet and Lowdown, and for interior scenes of You've Got Mail.[108][109] 
In 2007, two non-fiction volumes appeared dealing, inter alia, with Teaneck's 
Orthodox Jewish community. In Foreskin's Lament, writer Shalom Auslander 
describes living in Teaneck and finding the Jewish community stifling and 
claustrophobic.[110] In contrast, Rifka Rosenwein, in Life in the Present 
Tense, describes the close-knit community as a gift she couldn't imagine 
when living in Manhattan.[111] The Brooklyn Nets NBA pro basketball team 
were founded as the New Jersey Americans in Teaneck for the 1967–68 season, 
as charter members of the American Basketball Association. The team played 
their home games at the Teaneck Armory for that one season, and was scheduled 
to play a one-game playoff at the armory. However, the circus had been 
booked for the week, and the game was relocated to a court in Commack, 
New York that was unplayable, and the game had to be forfeited. After the 
one season in Teaneck, the team relocated to Long Island and was renamed 
the New York Nets.[112] Following the Long Island run, the Nets moved back 
to New Jersey in 1977 to be named as the New Jersey Nets until 2012 before 
they became the Brooklyn Nets.[113] Portions of Fairleigh Dickinson University's 
Metropolitan Campus are located in Teaneck, with most of the school's athletic 
facilities located across the river in Hackensack. The school's University 
Stadium, home for its men's and women's soccer teams, lies on the Hackensack 
River, just north of Route 4. The 1,100-seat stadium has hosted NCAA Men's 
Soccer Tournament games in recent years.[114] The natural grass field was 
resurfaced with FieldTurf in 2004.[115] The Naimoli Family Baseball Complex 
is situated between Route 4 and University Stadium. Fairleigh Dickinson 
received a $1 million bequest from FDU alumnus Vince Naimoli, founding 
owner of the Tampa Bay Rays, to establish a 500-seat stadium with artificial 
turf and lighting on the site of the current facility.[116] Teaneck has 
24 municipal parks, of which 14 are developed.[117] Votee Park, the township's 
largest, covers 40.51 acres (16.39 ha), surrounded by Queen Ann Road, Palisade 
Avenue, Court Street and Colonial Court. Including baseball fields, soccer 
fields, playgrounds and the township's inground swimming facility, the 
park was renamed in honor of former mayor Milton Votee in 1958.[118] A 
Sportsplex was opened at the southern end of Votee Park in 2014, which 
includes two synthetic turf full-size soccer fields, one of which is also 
lined for use for football.[119] The Friends of the Hackensack River Greenway 
Through Teaneck work to preserve and develop the 3.5 miles (5.6 km) greenway 
along the Hackensack River from Terhune Park at the Bogota border in the 
south north to Brett Park on the New Milford border, encouraging the growth 
of native plants and providing a verdant area along the river for residents 
and visitors.[120] A series of 16 laminated signs were created by Teaneck 
artist Richard Mills along the Greenway, depiciting details of history 
and the flora and fauna of the river in a series called "Hackensack River 
Stories" that was installed in 2000.[121] The Greenway in Teaneck became 
the fourth National Recreation Trail in the state when it received the 
designation by the United States Department of the Interior at ceremonies 
held in Brett Park in June 2009.[122] Established in 2001 in conjunction 
with the Puffin Foundation, the Teaneck Creek Conservancy has restored 
a plot of degraded land east of Teaneck Road near the intersection of Interstates 
80 and 95, removing decades of debris and creating a network of 1.3 miles 
(2.1 km) of trails.[123] Overpeck County Park, along the shores of Overpeck 
Creek, a tributary of the Hackensack River, is more than 800 acres (3.2 km2) 
in size, of which about 500 were donated by Teaneck, and which is also 
in portions of Englewood, Leonia, Ridgefield Park and Palisades Park.[124][125] 
Teaneck is governed within the Faulkner Act (formally known as the Optional 
Municipal Charter Law) under the Council-Manager form of government (Plan 
12), implemented by direct petition as of July 1, 1988.[126] Following 
its founding in 1895, Teaneck used the traditional township form of government, 
led by a three-member Township Committee (later expanded to five seats) 
elected on a partisan basis. On September 16, 1930, Teaneck residents voted 
to establish a nonpartisan Council-Manager form of government under the 
terms of the 1923 Municipal Manager Law, with five members elected concurrently 
on an at-large basis. In 1962, the Council expanded to its current size 
of seven members and the position of Deputy Mayor was created. In 1987, 
a referendum to alter the form to a Faulkner Act Council-Manager form of 
government was approved, providing for staggered terms for the Council. 
With this change, Council elections now take place in even years on the 
second Tuesday in May. The Council's seven members are elected at-large 
in nonpartisan elections to serve staggered, four-year terms of office. 
The four seats elected in 2010 will expire in 2014 and the seats of the 
three who took office in 2012 will expire in 2016, etc.[8][127] The Township 
Council serves as Teaneck's governing body, setting policies and passing 
ordinances. It adopts an annual budget and approves contracts and agreements 
for services. The Council appoints the Manager, Clerk, Auditor, Attorney, 
Magistrate and Assessor. The Council appoints seven members of the Planning 
Board, the members of the Board of Adjustment, and all other statutory 
and advisory boards.[128] As of 2013[update], members of the Teaneck Township 
Council are Mayor Mohammed Hameeduddin (term as mayor ends June 30, 2014; 
term as council member ends June 30, 2016), Deputy Mayor Adam Gussen (2014), 
Elie Y. Katz (2014), Lizette Parker (2014), Henry Pruitt (2016), Mark Schwartz 
(2016) and Yitz Stern (2014).[129][130][131] In May 2000, three women ran 
for Township Council, and all three, incumbent Jackie Kates and newcomers 
Marie Warnke and Deborah Veach, were elected.[132] Kates, Warnke and Veach 
completed their four-year terms and then ran for re-election in May 2004.[133] 
Jackie Kates and Deborah Veach were re-elected and became Mayor and Deputy 
Mayor, respectively. Ms. Veach resigned her position in October 2005 and 
was appointed to be the Township's Municipal Prosecutor, a position in 
which she continues to serve.[134] On May 13, 2008, the township voted 
to re-elect Monica Honis to the council (with 2,981 votes). Elnatan Rudolph 
(2,852) lost his bid for re-election, falling 38 votes behind his running 
mate. Barbara Toffler (leading the voting with 3,356 votes) and Mohammed 
Hameeduddin (2,890) were elected and took office on July 1, 2008, filling 
the seats left by Rudolph and former mayor Jackie Kates, who did not run 
for re-election.[135] In the 2010 municipal elections, Adam Gussen, Elie 
Katz and Lizette Parker were re-elected to office, with former councilmember 
Yitz Stern taking the seat vacated by former mayor Kevie Feit, who did 
not run for a second term. At its July 1, 2010, reorganization meeting 
the council selected Mohammed Hameeduddin to serve as mayor, making him 
one of the state's first Muslim mayors, while Adam Gussen was chosen as 
deputy mayor.[136][137] In the May 2012 municipal election, Mohammed Hameeduddin 
won a second term in office (with 4,374 votes) and was the only incumbent 
to win re-election, with challengers Mark Schwartz (3,150) and Henry Pruitt 
(2,872) taking the seats of Barbara Toffler (2,526) and Monica Honis (2,238), 
who lost their bids for re-election and came in fourth and fifth respectively, 
while Alexander Rashin came in sixth (1,049).[138] On July 1, following 
a municipal election, the Township Council holds an Organizational Meeting 
where the candidates elected (or re-elected) to serve on the Council are 
sworn in and begin their terms of office. The newly inducted council selects 
one of its members to serve as Mayor, and another to serve as Deputy Mayor, 
who presides in the absence of the Mayor.[139] The Mayor, elected by the 
Council from among its members after each biennial election, serves for 
a two-year term of office which expires upon the selection of a mayor at 
the subsequent reorganization meeting. The Mayor presides over all meetings 
and votes on every issue as a regular member. The Mayor is an ex officio 
member of the Planning Board and the Library Board. The Mayor appoints 
the members of the Library Board, and one member of the Planning Board. 
The Mayor executes bonds, notes, contracts and written obligations of the 
Township and is empowered to perform marriages.[139] The Municipal Manager 
is appointed by the Council to serve as a full-time professional chief 
executive officer. The Manager implements Council policies, enforces ordinances 
and coordinates the activities of all departments and employees and is 
responsible for preparing and submitting a budget to the Council. The Manager 
makes recommendations to the Council on relevant matters, appoints and 
removes Township employees and investigates and acts on complaints. The 
Manager appoints the Municipal Courts Prosecutor and Public Defender, members 
of the Rent Board and one member of the Teaneck Economic Development Corporation, 
and one member of the Civilian Complaint Review Board.[4] Teaneck is split 
between the 5th and 9th Congressional Districts[140] and is part of New 
Jersey's 37th state legislative district.[11][141][142] Prior to the 2010 
Census, all of Teaneck had been part of the 9th Congressional District, 
a change made by the New Jersey Redistricting Commission that took effect 
in January 2013, based on the results of the November 2012 general elections, 
making Teaneck one of 14 municipalities (and the only one in Bergen County) 
to be split across districts, down from the 29 that had been split after 
the 2000 Census.[143][144] As part of the redistricting that took effect 
in 2013, 32,023 (about 80%) of Teaneck residents were placed in the new 
5th District, with the remaining 7,753 residents (about 20%) mostly in 
areas of the township east of Teaneck Road and south of Bedford Avenue 
placed in the 9th District.[145] New Jersey's Fifth Congressional District 
is represented by Scott Garrett (R, Wantage Township).[146] New Jersey's 
Ninth Congressional District is represented by Bill Pascrell (D, Paterson).[147] 
New Jersey is represented in the United States Senate by Cory Booker (D, 
Newark, term ends 2021)[148] and Bob Menendez (D, Paramus, 2019).[149][150] 
For the 2016–2017 session (Senate, General Assembly), the 37th Legislative 
District of the New Jersey Legislature is represented in the State Senate 
by Loretta Weinberg (D, Teaneck) and in the General Assembly by Valerie 
Huttle (D, Englewood) and Gordon M. Johnson (D, Englewood).[151] The Governor 
of New Jersey is Chris Christie (R, Mendham Township).[152] The Lieutenant 
Governor of New Jersey is Kim Guadagno (R, Monmouth Beach).[153] Bergen 
County is governed by a directly elected County Executive, with legislative 
functions performed by a seven-member Board of Chosen Freeholders.[154] 
As of 2015[update], the County Executive is James J. Tedesco III (D, Paramus; 
term ends December 31, 2018).[155] The seven freeholders are elected at-large 
in partisan elections on a staggered basis, with two or three seats coming 
up for election each year, with a Chairman, Vice Chairman and Chairman 
Pro Tempore selected from among its members at a reorganization meeting 
held each January.[156] Bergen County's Freeholders are Freeholder Chairwoman 
Joan Voss (D, 2017; Fort Lee),[157] Vice Chairman Steve Tanelli (D, 2015; 
North Arlington)[158] Chairman Pro Tempore John A. Felice (R, 2016; River 
Edge),[159] David L. Ganz (D, 2017; Fair Lawn),[160] Maura R. DeNicola 
(R, 2016; Franklin Lakes)[161] Thomas J. Sullivan Jr., (D, Montvale, 2015; 
serving the unexpired term of office that had been occupied by James Tedesco 
before he was sworn in as County Executive)[162][163] and Tracy Silna Zur 
(D, 2015; Franklin Lakes).[164][165] Countywide constitutional officials 
are County Clerk John S. Hogan (D, Northvale),[166] Sheriff Michael Saudino 
(R)[167] and Surrogate Michael R. Dressler (D, Cresskill).[168][169][154]

The Tax Foundation determined that Bergen County had the third-highest 
median property tax burden in the nation ($8,708 vs. a New Jersey median 
of $6,579 and a national median of $1,917) and the fourth-highest level 
of property taxes as a percentage of median income (8.59% vs. 7.45% statewide 
and 3.03% nationally), based on an analysis of data from the 2009 American 
Community Survey conducted by the United States Census Bureau for all 792 
counties in the United States with more than 20,000 residents.[180] As 
of 2010, Teaneck's effective tax rate of $2.492 per $100 of equalized value 
was the 12th-highest of the 70 municipalities in Bergen County, which had 
a countywide median effective rate of $2.115 per $100, ranging from a low 
of $.596 in Alpine to a high of $3.005 in Ridgefield Park.[181] As of 2013[update], 
just under 55% of a Teaneck property owner's real estate taxes goes to 
support the local school system, 36.7% goes to municipal taxes (including 
an open space tax) and the remaining 8.4% to cover county services (which 
also assesses an open space tax). In the decade from 2003 to 2013, municipal 
taxes had risen at an annual rate of just over 4.5% and school taxes by 
almost 2.8%, while the Consumer Price Index for the New York-Northern New 
Jersey-Long Island area had gone up 2.6% during that time span.[182] The 
2013 tax rate was set at $2.486 per $100 of assessed value (an overall 
increase of 3.7% from 2012), which is composed of school taxes of $1.365 
(up almost 3.3%), municipal taxes of $0.871 (an increase of 5.8%), a library 
tax of $.031 (down 3.1%) and county taxes of $0.206 (down 0.5%), plus a 
municipal open space tax of $0.010 and a county open space tax of $0.003 
(both unchanged).[182][183][184] The owner of a median-valued home in Teaneck, 
assessed at $465,300, paid 2011 property taxes of $11,190, which would 
include $6,244 in school taxes, $3,992 in municipal taxes and $949 to the 
county (including open space levies).[184][185] During 2006, Teaneck underwent 
a revaluation of all privately owned real estate, as required periodically 
by the state. This revaluation adjusted property values to market prices, 
ensuring that taxes are equitably allocated. The average property in Teaneck 
was assessed at approximately $417,900, an increase of 132.1% from the 
prior year's average. The new valuations took effect for the 2007 tax year.[186] 
In the wake of the revaluation implemented in 2007, a wave of tax appeals 
hit the township, resulting in a loss of about $110 million in ratables 
and costs to the township of $2.2 million for the 2012 tax year.[187] The 
township agreed to complete a revaluation by October 2014 that would go 
into effect in 2015, awarding a $710,000 contract to perform the necessary 
home visits and determine property values.[188] The Teaneck Public Schools 
had a Budgetary Per Pupil Cost of $18,417 in its 2012–13 budget, 26.8% 
higher than the average of $14,519 budgeted that year by districts in the 
same grouping of grades and enrollment, ranked as the 101st highest among 
the 106 K-12 districts in the state with more than 3,500 students.[189] 
At the April 2006 school elections, voters rejected the proposed $84.8 
million budget for the Teaneck Public Schools for the 2006–07 school year 
by a 1,644 to 1,336 margin. Based on recommendations specified by the Township 
Council, the Board of Education approved $544,391 in cuts.[190] The school 
budget was rejected again in 2009, with the Council cutting $1 million 
from the $94.8 million originally proposed.[191] After the 2010 school 
budget failed, the Township Council removed $6.1 million from the $95 million 
budget proposed by the school district, zeroing out what would have been 
an 8.2% increase in the school tax levy.[192] The school board eliminated 
77 positions to meet the cuts approved by the council.[193] The Teaneck 
Public Schools serves students in pre-Kindergarten through twelfth grade. 
As of the 2011–12 school year, the district's 7 schools had an enrollment 
of 3,845 students and 333.8 classroom teachers (on an FTE basis), for a 
student–teacher ratio of 11.52:1.[194] Schools in the district (with 2011–12 
enrollment data from the National Center for Education Statistics[195]) 
are Bryant School[196] (344 students; pre-K and Kindergarten), Hawthorne

(368; 1–4), Benjamin Franklin Middle School[200] (570; 5–8), Thomas Jefferson 
Middle School[201] (598; 5–8) and Teaneck High School[202] with 1,308 students 
in grades 9–12.[203] Longfellow Elementary school was closed in 1998. Other 
elementary schools that closed prior to 1998 included Emerson and Eugene 
Field School, which is used by the Board of Education for its Central Administrative 
Offices. 2011–12 total spending for the district was $91,382,911, a Total 
Spending per Pupil of $22,894 based on 3,991.6 students, ranking 96th highest 
of the 106 K-12 districts statewide with more than 3,500 students, with 
the average district spending $18,047 per pupil. Based on the 2012–13 budget, 
the district planned to spend a Budgetary Per Pupil Cost of $18,417 (a 
measure that excludes out-of-district tuition payments for special education, 
transportation costs, legal judgments and certain other expenditures), 
ranking 101st highest among its grouping of districts, compared to a statewide 
average of $14,519. Of the 2012–13 Budgetary Per Pupil Cost, $11,394 per 
student was allocated to classroom instruction (104th highest of K–12 districts 
in the state with more than 3,500 students, with a statewide average of 
$8,588), $3,012 per student to Total Support Services (ranked 96th, average 
of $2,338), $1,662 to Total Administrative Costs (ranked 93rd, average 
of $1,448) and $2,031 to Total Operations and Maintenance of Plant (ranked 
89th, average of $1,787). The district's 2012–13 Median Classroom Teacher 
Salary of $77,614 is ranked 98th in the state in its grouping, the Median 
Support Service Salary was $92,539 (97th), while the Median Administrator 
Salary was $140,497 (95th).[189][204][205] As of the 2010 No Child Left 
Behind (NCLB) Report, Teaneck High School had satisfied the Adequate Yearly 
Progress measure and had a graduation rate of 97.0% for the class of 2009–10, 
compared to a statewide average of 94.7%. On the High School Proficiency 
Assessment (HSPA), 9.4% were partial proficient, 79.5% proficient and 11.1% 
advanced proficient in Language Arts Literacy (vs. statewide averages of 
10.3% partial, 75.7% proficient and 14% advanced). In Mathematics, 24.8% 
were partial proficient, 61.8% proficient and 13.4% advanced proficient 
(vs. statewide averages of 18.4% partial, 57.9% proficient and 23.7% advanced).[206] 
The Teaneck Community Charter School (TCCS) had a 2011–12 enrollment of 
306 students in Kindergarten through eighth grade with 26.0 classroom teachers 
(on an FTE basis), for a student–teacher ratio of 11.77:1.[207] TCCS is 
a charter school that operates independently of the Teaneck Public Schools 
under a charter granted by the Commissioner of the New Jersey Department 
of Education, which was renewed for five years in 2012.[208] Admission 
is open to the public for available slots (after returning students and 
siblings of existing students are entered) and offers an after school program 
and summer camp. As the school is a public school, no tuition is charged. 
Funding comes from the Teaneck Public Schools (and the home districts of 
non-resident students), which provides 90% of its cost per pupil in the 
district; the balance of funding comes directly from the state of New Jersey.[209] 
The school moved to a new building at 563 Chestnut Avenue in the 2009–10 
school year, from a space it had rented on Palisade Avenue.[210] 2009–10 
total spending for the TCCS was $5,050,613, a Total Spending per Pupil 
of $16,614 based on 304 students, ranking 51st highest of the 77 charter 
schools statewide, with the average district spending $17,836 per pupil. 
Based on the 2010–11 budget, the TCCS planned to spend a Budgetary Per 
Pupil Cost of $14,210, ranking 54th highest among the 77 districts, compared 
to a statewide average of $13,609. Of the 2010–11 Budgetary Per Pupil Cost,

Public school students from the township, and all of Bergen County, are 
eligible to attend the secondary education programs offered by the Bergen 
County Technical Schools, which include the Bergen County Academies in 
Hackensack, and the Bergen Tech campus in Teterboro or Paramus. The district 
offers programs on a shared-time or full-time basis, with admission based 
on a selective application process and tuition covered by the student's 
home school district.[212][213] Teaneck is home to the Metropolitan Campus 
of Fairleigh Dickinson University, which straddles the Hackensack River 
in Teaneck and Hackensack. The campus served 4,114 undergraduates and 2,350 
graduate students.[214] Private Orthodox Jewish day schools include the 
Torah Academy of Bergen County (for boys in grades 9–12)[215] which completed 
an $8 million expansion project at the start of the 2013–14 school year 
that doubled the size of the school, adding new classrooms and an additional 
gym to accommodate the record enrollment of 293 students, with room for 
expansion for the several years ahead.[216][217] Ma'ayanot Yeshiva High 
School serves girls in grades 9–12.[218] Yeshivas Heichal HaTorah, another 
high school, opened in September 2013 at the Teaneck Jewish Center with 
an initial enrollment of 17 students.[219] The Community School is a private 
school, founded in 1968 to serve the bright child with learning and attentional 
disabilities. Both the lower school and high school are in Teaneck.[220] 
Teaneck was home to the Metropolitan Schechter High School, a co-ed Conservative 
Jewish high school, which closed its doors in August 2007 due to fundraising 
problems.[221] Al-Ghazaly High School, a co-ed religious day school for 
seventh through twelfth grades founded in 1984, was located on 441 North 
Street, serving the Muslim community from the greater Teaneck area. The 
school relocated to a larger facility in Wayne and opened its doors to 
students in September 2013, with the Teaneck facility repurposed to serve 
students in pre-Kindergarten through third grade.[222][223] Although licensed 
to Oakland, a community in Western Bergen County, radio station WVNJ operating 
at 1160 kHz on the AM dial maintains its studios at 1086 Teaneck Road.[224] 
WFDU FM-89.1 operates from studios at Fairleigh Dickinson University, and 
there was a defunct AM Carrier Current version of WFDU on 640 through some 
time in the 1980s.[225] The Teaneck Police Department had 96 sworn officers 
in 2012, in addition to 13 civilian employees, three parking enforcement 
officers and 25 school crossing guards[226] out of a total of 106 authorized 
uniformed positions. Robert Wilson was named Chief as of July 2008, filling 
the acting chief role previously held by Deputy Chief Fred Ahearn, who 
had been serving in that position after the departure of Paul Tiernan in 
2007.[227] The department hired its first two officers in 1914; Freddie 
Greene, its first African-American officer, joined the department on September 
15, 1962, and its first female officer began serving on January 4, 1981.[228][229] 
In 2012, the Teaneck Police Department received accreditation from the 
Commission on Accreditation for Law Enforcement Agencies (CALEA), following 
a two-year-long process that documented the department's compliance with 
112 standards established by the organization as best practices. The department 
became the ninth in the state to receive CALEA accreditation.[230] The 
Teaneck Fire Department is a career fire department that has 91 uniformed 
members, out of a total of 99 authorized uniformed positions, including 
31 officers and 60 firefighters.[231] Teaneck's four fire stations are 
staffed around the clock by paid full-time fire fighters. Teaneck is one 
of four municipalities in Bergen County with a paid fire department, joining 
Englewood, Hackensack and Ridgewood.[232] Robert J. Montgomery was named 
Chief of Department as of June 1, 2006, and retired in March 2010, when 
he was succeeded by Anthony Verley.[233] The department operates four Engine 
Companies out of four strategically placed firehouses. Additionally, a 
Tower Ladder, Rescue Truck and Command vehicle responds out of the main 
Fire Headquarters on Teaneck Road. Reserve apparatus include two Engines, 
a Rescue and a Ladder Truck that can be manned as required during high 
service demands. The department responds to approximately 4,000 calls per 
year involving structure fires, vehicle fires, electrical emergencies, 
natural gas releases, carbon monoxide incidents, explosions, rescues, outside 
fires, vehicle extrications and first responder medical calls.[231] The 
department celebrated its 100th anniversary in October 2015.[234] The Box 
54 Canteen Unit provides canteen and other support services at fire scenes, 
offering water, coffee and other snacks where firefighters have an extended 
presence. The unit was created in 1952.[235] The Teaneck Volunteer Ambulance 
Corps (TVAC) was created in 1939 to serve the residents of Teaneck.[236] 
TVAC has always been Teaneck's only emergency ambulance service and includes 
over 100 volunteers and four ambulances, serving Teaneck and its residents 
around the clock, without pay. In 2011, TVAC responded to over 4,300 emergency 
calls, routinely saving lives and reducing suffering with their rapid response 
and application of Basic Life Support skills. Throughout the last 70 years, 
TVAC has never charged a patient nor the patient's family for service. 
The services of the Corps are entirely free of charge, whether the patients 
are residents of Teaneck, visitors, or individuals who need medical service 
while passing through the town. The Corps also renders service in nearby 
towns as part of a mutual aid system, again without charge.[237] The Richard 
Rodda Community Center, located near Route 4 at the south end of Votee 
Park, is a 50,900-square-foot (4,730 m2) community and recreation center 
completed in 1998. The facility includes two full sized gyms, a dance studio, 
a kitchen and several multipurpose rooms of different sizes.[238] The Teaneck 
Recreation Department offers educational, sports and arts programs throughout 
the year.[96] The Rodda Center is home to the Senior Citizens Service Center, 
which offers educational and fitness activities for adults ages 55 and 
up, and serves hot lunch daily, provided by the Bergen County Division 
of Senior Services.[239] The Community Center also provides a WiFi access 
point, which resulted in a police investigation in January 2012 after its 
identifying name was changed to a racist slur.[240] Holy Name Medical Center 
is a fully accredited, not-for-profit community hospital. Founded and sponsored 
by the Sisters of St. Joseph of Peace in 1925, the hospital has grown to 
become a comprehensive 361-bed medical center. Affiliation with NewYork-Presbyterian 
Healthcare System further brings the advantages of large urban hospitals 
to the community, with access to clinical trials and expanded education 
for its physicians. Holy Name Medical Center has undertaken an ambitious 
effort to provide comprehensive health care services to underinsured and 
uninsured Korean patients from a wide area with its growing "Korean Medical 
Program", including attracting 1,500 people to its annual seventh annual 
Korean health fair in 2014.[241][242] To accommodate the township's Orthodox 
Jewish community, the hospital offers a Shabbat elevator, a room prepared 
for families of patients staying at the hospital during Shabbat and Jewish 
holidays, as well as a lounge offering kosher food.[243] Teaneck is situated 
along a number of major transportation routes, including the New Jersey 
Turnpike (a portion of Interstate 95) and Interstate 80. As of May 2010[update], 
the township had a total of 119.41 miles (192.17 km) of roadways, of which 
103.95 miles (167.29 km) were maintained by the municipality, 10.70 miles 
(17.22 km) by Bergen County, 3.47 miles (5.58 km) by the New Jersey Department 
of Transportation, and 1.29 miles (2.08 km) by the New Jersey Turnpike 
Authority.[244] Teaneck is the eastern terminus of Interstate 80, which 
stretches west to San Francisco since the dedication of a segment in Salt 
Lake City on August 22, 1986, marking the completion of the first transcontinental 
portion of the Interstate Highway System.[245] As the second-longest Interstate 
route, the highway stretches nearly coast-to-coast for 2,899.5 miles (4,666.3 km), 
shorter than only Interstate 90.[246] The easternmost 0.9 miles (1.4 km) 
of Interstate 80 runs from Bogota to the junction with Interstate 95.[247] 
NJ Route 4 traverses east-west through Teaneck, running 2.5 miles (4.0 km) 
from Hackensack to Englewood.[248] Unlike all other municipalities situated 
along the highway, there is no commercial development or billboards, with 
the open space along the highway maintained by the Township Council's Preserve 
the Greenbelt Committee.[249] Route 4 narrows from three lanes in each 
direction on a section between Belle Avenue and Englewood, causing rush-hour 
traffic backups that may extend for miles. The New Jersey Department of 
Transportation (NJDOT) has discussed a series of proposed replacement projects 
for bridges over the highway, pending completion of feasibility studies 
and design work. While the township has indicated its willingness to cede 
space along the Greenbelt for a third lane, the lack of space for a shoulder 
may preclude the creation of a full three-lane route through Teaneck.[250] 
In November 2013, NJDOT informed Teaneck officials that it had no plans 
to widen the highway, as the need to focus the limited funds available 
on replacing and repairing deteriorating bridges and infrastructure precluded 
the implementation of a widening project.[251] Interstate 95 heads north 
for 1.3 miles (2.1 km) through Teaneck from Ridgefield Park to Leonia.[252] 
New Jersey's other main trunk route, the Garden State Parkway, can be reached 
just a few miles west of Teaneck. Access to New York City is available 
for motorists by way of the George Washington Bridge in Fort Lee (via Route 
4 or Interstate 95), or through the Lincoln Tunnel in Hudson County (via 
the NJ Turnpike) into Midtown Manhattan. County roads in Teaneck include 
Teaneck Road, Queen Anne Road, River Road and Fort Lee Road. Cedar Lane, 
another county road, crosses the Hackensack River and connects to Hackensack 
over the Anderson Street Bridge. New Jersey Transit bus service is available 
in Teaneck, with frequent service on Teaneck Road, Route 4 and Cedar Lane, 
and less-frequent service on other main streets. NJTransit bus service 
is offered to the Port Authority Bus Terminal in Midtown Manhattan on the 
155, 157, 165R, 167 and 168 routes; to the George Washington Bridge Bus 
Station in Upper Manhattan on the 171, 175, 178, 182 and 186 routes; and 
to other New Jersey communities served on the 83, 751, 753, 755, 756, 772 
and 780 routes.[253] Scheduled bus service is also available from Rockland 
Coaches to the Port Authority Bus Terminal, on the 21T from New Milford 
and on the 11T/11AT from Stony Point, New York.[254][255] Saddle River 
Tours / Ameribus provides service to the George Washington Bridge Bus Station 
on route 11C.[256] Spanish Transportation and several other operators provide 
frequent jitney service along Route 4 between Paterson, New Jersey and 
the George Washington Bridge Bus Station[257] While there is currently 
no passenger train operation in Teaneck, train service is available across 
the Hackensack River at the New Bridge Landing station in River Edge[258] 
and at the Anderson Street station in Hackensack.[259] NJTransit's Pascack 
Valley Line runs north-south to Hoboken Terminal, with connections to the 
PATH train from the Hoboken PATH station, and with NJT connecting service 
to Penn Station in Midtown Manhattan via the Secaucus Junction transfer 
station. At Hoboken Terminal, connections are also available to NY Waterway 
ferry service (to the World Financial Center and other destinations) and 
to the Hudson-Bergen Light Rail system (serving locations along the Hudson 
River in Hudson County).[260] Teaneck is split east and west by railroad 
tracks, which currently provide freight service by CSX Transportation. 
Until 1959, passenger train service was provided on these same tracks by 
the West Shore Railroad, with Teaneck stations at Cedar Lane and West Englewood 
Avenue. Commuter service was available from these stations, with 44 passenger 
trains operating daily to and from Weehawken, where Hudson River ferry 
service was available to New York City at 42nd Street and at the Financial 
District in Lower Manhattan.[261] Train service from Teaneck was also available 
north to Albany, along the west shore of the river. Efforts are ongoing 
to restore some passenger train service on this line for commuters heading 
toward New York City, including extension of the Hudson-Bergen Light Rail 
service via the Northern Branch to Englewood or Tenafly.[262] Teaneck's 
closest airport in New Jersey with scheduled passenger service is Newark 
Liberty International Airport, 20 miles (32 km) away (about 27 minutes) 
in Newark / Elizabeth.[263] New York City's LaGuardia Airport is 15 miles 
(24 km) away in Flushing, Queens via the George Washington Bridge, an estimated 
22 minutes in ideal conditions.[264] John F. Kennedy International Airport 
in Queens is 26 miles (42 km) and 34 minutes from Teaneck.[265] Teterboro 
Airport offers general aviation service, and is a 9-mile (14 km) drive
