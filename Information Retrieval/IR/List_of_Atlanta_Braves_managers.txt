The Atlanta Braves are a professional baseball team based in Atlanta, Georgia. 
The Braves are members of the National League (NL) East division in Major 
League Baseball (MLB). Since the franchise started as the Boston Red Stockings 
(no relationship to the current Boston Red Sox team) in 1871, the team 
has changed its name several times and relocated twice. The Braves were 
a charter member of the NL in 1876 as the Boston Red Caps, and are one 
of the NL's two remaining charter franchises (the other being the Chicago 
Cubs).[1] In baseball, the head coach of a team is called the manager, 
or more formally, the field manager. The duties of the team manager include 
team strategy and leadership on and off the field.[2][3] The Braves franchise 
has employed 45 different managers.[4] The franchise's first manager was 
Hall of Famer Harry Wright, who managed the team for eleven seasons.[5] 
Frank Selee was the next manager to have managed the team for eleven seasons, 
with a total of twelve with the formerly named Boston Beaneaters.[6] The 
formerly named Boston Braves made their first postseason appearance under 
George Stallings in 1914, winning the World Series that year.[7] Several 
other managers spent long tenures with the Braves. Bill McKechnie managed 
the Braves from 1930 to 1937, while Casey Stengel managed the team from 
1938 to 1942.[8][9] The franchise was known as the Boston Bees from 1936 
to 1940, and was again named the Boston Braves until 1952. Stengel also 
managed the Braves in 1943.[9] From 1943 to 1989, no managerial term lasted 
as long as five complete seasons. The Braves were managed by Billy Southworth 
from 1946 to 1949, and again from 1950 to 1951. Southworth led the team 
into the 1948 World Series, which ended the Braves' 34-year postseason 
drought; the World Series ended in a losing result for the Braves. In 1953, 
the team moved from Boston to Milwaukee, where it was known as the Milwaukee 
Braves. Its first manager in Milwaukee was Charlie Grimm, who managed the 
team from mid-season of 1952 to mid-season of 1956. Fred Haney took over 
the managerial position after Grimm, and led the team to the World Series 
in 1957, defeating the New York Yankees in a game seven to win the series.[10] 
In 1966, the team moved from Milwaukee to its current location, Atlanta. 
Its first manager in Atlanta was Bobby Bragan, who managed the team for 
three seasons earlier in Milwaukee. Lum Harris was the first manager to 
have managed the team in Atlanta for more than four seasons. Harris led 
the team into the NL Championship Series (NLCS) in 1969, but failed to 
advance into the World Series. Joe Torre was the next manager to manage 
the Braves into the postseason, but like Harris, led the team into the 
NLCS with a losing result.[10] Bobby Cox was the manager of the Braves 
from 1990 till 2010. Under his leadership the Braves made the postseason 
15 times, winning five National League championships and one World Series 
title in 1995.[11] Cox has the most regular season wins, regular season 
losses, postseason appearances, postseason wins and postseason losses of 
any Braves manager.[4] He was named NL Manager of the Year three times, 
in 1991, 2004 and 2005.[12] After Cox retired upon the conclusion of the 
2010 season, Fredi Gonz√°lez was hired to take over as manager. Several 
managers have had multiple tenures with the Braves. John Morrill served 
three terms in the 1880s as the Braves manager, while Fred Tenney, Stengel, 
Bob Coleman, Southworth, Dave Bristol and Cox each served two terms. Ted 
Turner and Vern Benson's term each lasted only a single game, as they were
