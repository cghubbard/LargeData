Jeremiah Dennis Denny (Jeremiah Dennis Eldridge; March 16, 1859 in New 
York City – August 16, 1927 in Houston, Texas) was a third baseman in Major 
League Baseball. Denny holds the distinction of being the last Major League 
position player (non-pitcher) to play his entire career on the diamond 
without wearing a fielding glove. Over 13 professional seasons he played 
for the Providence Grays (1881–1885), St. Louis Maroons (1886), Indianapolis 
Hoosiers (1888–1889), New York Giants (1890–1891), Cleveland Spiders (1891), 
Philadelphia Phillies (1891), and Louisville Colonels (1893–1894). After 
leaving the Major Leagues, Denny continued playing Minor League baseball 
until 1902. At the time Denny began his professional career, fielding gloves 
had not yet become standard equipment, other than padded mitts for catchers 
and first basemen. Fielding gloves gradually gained acceptance between 
1885 and the mid-1890s, but Denny refused to adapt. He was one of the few 
ambidextrous major league players; although he threw primarily with his 
right arm, he could also toss with his left. This gave him a defensive 
advantage at his customary field position—in ranging to his left on a ground 
ball, if he saw a play at second base, instead of having to transfer the 
ball to his right hand while pivoting and repositioning his body (as third 
basemen would customarily do), Denny could dispatch the ball to second 
with his left hand. This skill contributed to his refusal to wear a glove 
in the field, long after most players considered gloves essential. In 1884, 
Denny helped the National League champion Grays defeat the New York Metropolitans 
of the American Association in the major leagues' first post-season championship 
match-up. That season, he was the Grays' leader in home runs (six, and 
one in the championship series) and runs batted in (59), and second in 
extra base hits (37). His career totals are 1,237 Games and 4,946 At Bats, 
714 Runs, 1,286 Hits, 238 Doubles, 76 Triples, 74 Home runs, 667 RBI, 130 
Stolen bases, 173 Walks, a Batting average of.260, an On-base percentage 
of.287, a Slugging percentage of.384, and 1,898 Total bases. Denny holds 
the Major League record for most chances by a third baseman in a single 
game, handling 16 chances during an 18-inning match on August 17, 1882.[1] 
He led the National League in Games (85) in 1881 and Strikeouts (79) in 
1888. Eldridge attended St Mary's College, Phoenix in the late 1870s, and 
wanted to play semi-professional baseball during the summer months, when 
he wasn't playing for the college as an amateur.[2] He used the pseudonym
