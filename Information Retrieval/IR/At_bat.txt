In baseball, an at bat (AB) or time at bat is a batter's turn batting against 
a pitcher. An at bat is different from a plate appearance. A batter is 
credited with a plate appearance regardless of what happens during his 
turn at bat. A batter is credited with an at bat only if that plate appearance 
does not have one of the results enumerated below. While at bats are used 
to calculate certain statistics, including batting average and slugging

categories only if he accumulates 502 plate appearances during the season.

the count will be reset to no balls and no strikes. Section 10.02.a.1 of

(1) hits a sacrifice bunt or sacrifice fly; (2) is awarded first base on 
four called balls; (3) is hit by a pitched ball; or (4) is awarded first

a batter who is facing the pitcher. Note that just because a player is 
described as being "at bat" in this sense, he will not necessarily be given 
an at bat in his statistics; the phrase actually signifies a plate appearance 
(assuming it is eventually completed). This ambiguous terminology is usually 
clarified by context. To refer explicitly to the technical meaning of "at
