CTV Sports was the division of the CTV Television Network responsible for 
sports broadcasting. The division existed in its own right from 1961 to 
2001; between 1998 and 2001, CTV Sports also operated a cable sports network, 
CTV Sportsnet, now owned by Rogers Media and known simply as Sportsnet. 
Since CTV's purchase of the more established sports network TSN in 2001 
(which in turn caused the sale of Sportsnet to Rogers), the network has 
assumed responsibility for CTV's remaining sports output. At the same time, 
the amount of in-house sports programming aired by CTV has been reduced 
to only encompass occasional, TSN-produced telecasts, such as Skate Canada 
events, and simulcasts of events from U.S. networks. As of 2014, the only 
sports broadcasts regularly aired by CTV and CTV Two are National Football 
League games. CTV has been incorporated into coverage of major international 
sporting eventsâ€”such as FIFA World Cup tournaments, and the Olympic Games, 
which were most recently aired from 2010 to 2012 as part of a joint venture 
between Bell Media and Rogers Media. The following events are currently 
specifically designated to air on CTV: Figure Skating Football Golf Soccer 
In addition, other coverage of events with rights held by TSN have occasionally 
aired on CTV or CTV Two, or local stations thereof, if necessary due to 
scheduling conflicts on the TSN channels, such as Vancouver Whitecaps FC 
games.[4][5][6] Auto Racing Baseball Basketball Curling Football Hockey
