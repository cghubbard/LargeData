Earvin "Magic" Johnson Jr. (born August 14, 1959) is an American retired 
professional basketball player who played point guard for the Los Angeles 
Lakers of the National Basketball Association (NBA) for 13 seasons. After 
winning championships in high school and college, Johnson was selected 
first overall in the 1979 NBA draft by the Lakers. He won a championship 
and an NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award in his rookie season, and 
won four more championships with the Lakers during the 1980s. Johnson retired 
abruptly in 1991 after announcing that he had contracted HIV, but returned 
to play in the 1992 All-Star Game, winning the All-Star MVP Award. After 
protests from his fellow players, he retired again for four years, but 
returned in 1996, at age 36, to play 32 games for the Lakers before retiring 
for the third and final time. Johnson's career achievements include three 
NBA MVP Awards, nine NBA Finals appearances, twelve All-Star games, and 
ten All-NBA First and Second Team nominations. He led the league in regular-season 
assists four times, and is the NBA's all-time leader in average assists 
per game, at 11.2.[2] Johnson was a member of the 1992 United States men's 
Olympic basketball team ("The Dream Team"), which won the Olympic gold 
medal in 1992. After leaving the NBA in 1992, Johnson formed the Magic 
Johnson All-Stars, a barnstorming team that travelled around the world 
playing exhibition games.[3] Johnson was honored as one of the 50 Greatest 
Players in NBA History in 1996. Johnson became a two-time inductee into 
the Basketball Hall of Fame—being enshrined in 2002 for his individual 
career, and again in 2010 as a member of the "Dream Team".[4] He was rated 
the greatest NBA point guard of all time by ESPN in 2007.[5] His friendship 
and rivalry with Boston Celtics star Larry Bird, whom he faced in the 1979 
NCAA finals and three NBA championship series, are well documented. Since 
his retirement, Johnson has been an advocate for HIV/AIDS prevention and 
safe sex,[4] as well as an entrepreneur,[6] philanthropist,[7] broadcaster 
and motivational speaker.[8] His public announcement of his HIV-positive 
status in 1991 helped dispel the stereotype, still widely held at the time, 
that HIV was a "gay disease" that heterosexuals need not worry about; his 
bravery in making this announcement was widely commended.[9] Named by Ebony 
magazine as one of America's most influential black businessmen in 2009,[10] 
Johnson has numerous business interests, and was a part-owner of the Lakers 
for several years. Johnson also is part of a group of investors that purchased 
the Los Angeles Dodgers in 2012 and the Los Angeles Sparks in 2014. Earvin 
Johnson Jr. was born in Lansing, Michigan to Earvin Sr., a General Motors 
assembly worker, and Christine, a school custodian.[11] Johnson, who had 
six siblings,[12][13][14] was influenced by his parents' strong work ethic. 
Johnson's mother spent many hours after work each night cleaning their 
home and preparing the next day's meals, while his father did janitorial 
work at a used car lot and collected garbage, all while never missing a 
day at General Motors. Earvin Jr. would often help his father on the garbage 
route, and he was teased by neighborhood children who called him "Garbage 
Man."[15] Johnson grew up in Lansing, and came to love basketball as a 
youngster. His favorite basketball player was Bill Russell, whom he admired 
more for his many championships than his athletic ability.[16] He also 
idolized players such as Earl Monroe and Marques Haynes,[17] and practiced 
"all day."[4] Magic Johnson came from an athletic family. His father played 
high school basketball in his home state of Mississippi,[18] and Johnson 
learned the finer points about the game from him. Johnson's mother, originally 
from North Carolina,[18] had also played basketball as a child, and she 
grew up watching her brothers play the game.[16] By the time he had reached 
the eighth grade, Johnson had begun to think about a future in basketball. 
He had become a dominant junior high player, once scoring 48 points in 
a game.[13] Johnson looked forward to playing at Sexton High School, a 
school with a very successful basketball team and a great tradition that 
also happened to be only five blocks from his home. His plans underwent 
a dramatic change when he learned that he would be bused to predominately 
white Everett High School[16][19] instead of going to Sexton, which was 
predominately black.[13][20] Johnson's sister Pearl and his brother Larry 
had bused to Everett the previous year and did not have a pleasant experience. 
There were incidents of racism, with rocks being thrown at buses carrying 
black students, and white parents refusing to send their children to school. 
Larry was kicked off the basketball team after a confrontation during practice, 
prompting him to beg Earvin not to play. Johnson did join the basketball 
team but became angry after several days when his new teammates ignored 
him during practice, not even passing the ball. He nearly got into a fight 
with another player before head coach George Fox intervened. Eventually 
Johnson accepted his situation, and the small group of black students looked 
to him as their leader.[13] When recalling the events in his autobiography, 
My Life, he talked about how his time at Everett had changed him: As I 
look back on it today, I see the whole picture very differently. It's true 
that I hated missing out on Sexton. And the first few months, I was miserable 
at Everett. But being bused to Everett turned out to be one of the best 
things that ever happened to me. It got me out of my own little world and 
taught me how to understand white people, how to communicate and deal with 
them.[13] Johnson was first dubbed "Magic" as a 15-year-old sophomore playing 
for Everett High School, when he recorded a triple-double of 36 points, 
18 rebounds and 16 assists.[4] After the game, Fred Stabley Jr., a sports 
writer for the Lansing State Journal, gave him the moniker[21] despite 
the belief of Johnson's mother, a Christian, that the name was sacrilegious.[4] 
In his final high school season, Johnson led Lansing Everett to a 27–1 
win–loss record while averaging 28.8 points and 16.8 rebounds per game,[4] 
and took his team to an overtime victory in the state championship game.[22] 
Johnson dedicated the championship victory to his best friend Reggie Chastine, 
who was killed in a car accident the previous summer.[23] He gave Chastine 
much of the credit for his development as a basketball player and as a 
person,[24] saying years later, "I doubted myself back then."[25] Johnson 
and Chastine were almost always together, playing basketball or riding 
around in Chastine's car.[15] Upon learning of Chastine's death, Magic 
ran from his home, crying uncontrollably.[25] Johnson, who finished his 
high school career with two All-State selections, was considered at the 
time to be the best high school player ever to come out of Michigan[23] 
and was also named to the 1977 McDonald's All-American team.[26] Although 
Johnson was recruited by several top-ranked colleges such as Indiana and 
UCLA, he decided to play close to home.[27] His college decision came down 
to Michigan and Michigan State in East Lansing. He ultimately decided to 
attend Michigan State when coach Jud Heathcote told him he could play the 
point guard position. The talent already on Michigan State's roster also 
drew him to the program.[28] Johnson did not initially aspire to play professionally, 
focusing instead on his communication studies major and on his desire to 
become a television commentator.[29] Playing with future NBA draftees Greg 
Kelser, Jay Vincent and Mike Brkovich, Johnson averaged 17.0 points, 7.9 rebounds, 
and 7.4 assists per game as a freshman, and led the Spartans to a 25–5 record, 
the Big Ten Conference title, and a berth in the 1978 NCAA Tournament.[4] 
The Spartans reached the Elite Eight, but lost narrowly to eventual national 
champion Kentucky.[30] During the 1978–79 season, Michigan State again 
qualified for the NCAA Tournament, where they advanced to the championship 
game and faced Indiana State, which was led by senior Larry Bird. In what 
was the most-watched college basketball game ever,[31] Michigan State defeated 
Indiana State 75–64, and Johnson was voted Most Outstanding Player of the 
Final Four.[22] After two years in college, during which he averaged 17.1 points, 
7.6 rebounds, and 7.9 assists per game, Johnson entered the 1979 NBA draft.[32] 
Jud Heathcote stepped down as coach of the Spartans after the 1994–95 season, 
and on June 8, 1995, Johnson returned to the Breslin Center to play in 
the Jud Heathcote All-Star Tribute Game. He led all scorers with 39 points.[33] 
Johnson was drafted first overall in 1979 by the Los Angeles Lakers. Johnson 
said that what was "most amazing" about joining the Lakers was the chance 
to play alongside Kareem Abdul-Jabbar,[34] the team's 7 ft 2 in (2.18 m) 
center who became the leading scorer in NBA history.[35] Despite Abdul-Jabbar's 
dominance, he had failed to win a championship with the Lakers, and Johnson 
was expected to help them achieve that goal.[36] Johnson averaged 18.0 points, 
7.7 rebounds, and 7.3 assists per game for the season, was selected to 
the NBA All-Rookie Team, and was named an NBA All-Star Game starter.[37] 
The Lakers compiled a 60–22 record in the regular season and reached the 
1980 NBA Finals,[38] in which they faced the Philadelphia 76ers, who were 
led by forward Julius Erving. The Lakers took a 3–2 lead in the series, 
but Abdul-Jabbar, who averaged 33 points a game in the series,[39] sprained 
his ankle in Game 5 and could not play in Game 6.[36] Paul Westhead decided 
to start Johnson at center in Game 6; Johnson recorded 42 points, 15 rebounds, 
7 assists, and 3 steals in a 123–107 win, while playing guard, forward, 
and center at different times during the game.[36] Johnson became the only 
rookie to win the NBA Finals MVP award,[36] and his clutch performance 
is still regarded as one of the finest in NBA history.[5][40][41] He also 
became one of four players to win NCAA and NBA championships in consecutive 
years.[42] Early in the 1980–81 season, Johnson was sidelined after he 
suffered torn cartilage in his left knee. He missed 45 games,[32] and said 
that his rehabilitation was the "most down" he had ever felt.[43] Johnson 
returned before the start of the 1981 playoffs, but the Lakers' then-assistant 
and future head coach Pat Riley later said Johnson's much-anticipated return 
made the Lakers a "divided team".[44] The 54-win Lakers faced the 40–42 
Houston Rockets in the first round of playoffs,[45][46] where Houston upset 
the Lakers 2–1 after Johnson airballed a last-second shot in Game 3.[47] 
In 1981, after the 1980–81 season, Johnson signed a 25-year, $25-million 
contract with the Lakers, which was the highest-paying contract in sports 
history up to that point.[48] Early in the 1981–82 season, Johnson had 
a heated dispute with Westhead, who Johnson said made the Lakers "slow" 
and "predictable".[49] After Johnson demanded to be traded, Lakers owner 
Jerry Buss fired Westhead and replaced him with Riley. Although Johnson 
denied responsibility for Westhead's firing,[50] he was booed across the 
league, even by Laker fans.[4] However, Buss was also unhappy with the 
Lakers offense and had intended on firing Westhead days before the Westhead–Johnson 
altercation, but assistant GM Jerry West and GM Bill Sharman had convinced 
Buss to delay his decision.[51] Despite his off-court troubles, Johnson 
averaged 18.6 points, 9.6 rebounds, 9.5 assists, and a league-high 2.7 steals 
per game, and was voted a member of the All-NBA Second Team.[32] He also 
joined Wilt Chamberlain and Oscar Robertson as the only NBA players to 
tally at least 700 points, 700 rebounds, and 700 assists in the same season.[22] 
The Lakers advanced through the 1982 playoffs and faced Philadelphia for 
the second time in three years in the 1982 NBA Finals. After a triple-double 
from Johnson in Game 6, the Lakers defeated the Sixers 4–2, as Johnson 
won his second NBA Finals MVP award.[52] During the championship series 
against the Sixers, Johnson averaged 16.2 points on .533 shooting, 10.8 rebounds, 
8.0 assists, and 2.5 steals per game.[53] Johnson later said that his third 
season was when the Lakers first became a great team,[54] and he credited 
their success to Riley.[55] During the 1982–83 NBA season, Johnson averaged 
16.8 points, 10.5 assists, and 8.6 rebounds per game and earned his first 
All-NBA First Team nomination.[32] The Lakers again reached the Finals, 
and for a third time faced the Sixers, who featured center Moses Malone 
as well as Erving.[56] With Johnson's teammates Norm Nixon, James Worthy 
and Bob McAdoo all hobbled by injuries, the Lakers were swept by the Sixers, 
and Malone was crowned the Finals MVP.[56] In a losing effort against Philadelphia, 
Johnson averaged 19.0 points on .403 shooting, 12.5 assists, and 7.8 rebounds 
per game.[57] Prior to Johnson's fifth season, West—who had become the 
Lakers general manager—traded Nixon to free Johnson from sharing the ball-handling 
responsibilities.[58] Johnson that season averaged a double-double of 17.6 points 
and 13.1 assists, as well as 7.3 rebounds per game.[32] The Lakers reached 
the Finals for the third year in a row, where Johnson's Lakers and Bird's 
Celtics met for the first time in the post-season.[59] The Lakers won the 
first game, and led by two points in Game 2 with 18 seconds to go, but 
after a layup by Gerald Henderson, Johnson failed to get a shot off before 
the final buzzer sounded, and the Lakers lost 124–121 in overtime.[59] 
In Game 3, Johnson responded with 21 assists in a 137–104 win, but in Game 
4, he again made several crucial errors late in the contest. In the final 
minute of the game, Johnson had the ball stolen by Celtics center Robert 
Parish, and then missed two free throws that could have won the game. The 
Celtics won Game 4 in overtime, and the teams split the next two games. 
In the decisive Game 7 in Boston, as the Lakers trailed by three points 
in the final minute, opposing point guard Dennis Johnson stole the ball 
from Johnson, a play that effectively ended the series.[59] Friends Isiah 
Thomas and Mark Aguirre consoled him that night, talking until the morning 
in his Boston hotel room amidst fan celebrations on the street.[60][61] 
During the Finals, Johnson averaged 18.0 points on .560 shooting, 13.6 assists, 
and 7.7 rebounds per game.[62] Johnson later described the series as "the 
one championship we should have had but didn't get".[63] In the 1984–85 
regular season, Johnson averaged 18.3 points, 12.6 assists, and 6.2 rebounds 
per game and led the Lakers into the 1985 NBA Finals, where they faced 
the Celtics again. The series started poorly for the Lakers when they allowed 
an NBA Finals record 148 points to the Celtics in a 34-point loss in Game 
1.[64] However, Abdul-Jabbar, who was now 38 years old, scored 30 points 
and grabbed 17 rebounds in Game 2, and his 36 points in a Game 5 win were 
instrumental in establishing a 3–2 lead for Los Angeles.[64] After the 
Lakers defeated the Celtics in six games, Abdul-Jabbar and Johnson, who 
averaged 18.3 points on .494 shooting, 14.0 assists, and 6.8 rebounds per 
game in the championship series,[65][66] said the Finals win was the highlight 
of their careers.[67] Johnson again averaged a double-double in the 1985–86 
NBA season, with 18.8 points, 12.6 assists, and 5.9 rebounds per game.[32] 
The Lakers advanced to the Western Conference Finals, but were unable to 
defeat the Houston Rockets, who advanced to the Finals in five games.[68] 
In the next season, Johnson averaged a career-high of 23.9 points, as well 
as 12.2 assists and 6.3 rebounds per game,[32] and earned his first regular 
season MVP award.[4][69] The Lakers met the Celtics for the third time 
in the NBA Finals, and in Game 4 Johnson hit a last-second hook shot over 
Celtics big men Parish and Kevin McHale to win the game 107–106.[70] The 
game-winning shot, which Johnson dubbed his "junior, junior, junior sky-hook",[70] 
helped Los Angeles defeat Boston in six games. Johnson was awarded his 
third Finals MVP title after averaging 26.2 points on .541 shooting, 13.0 assists, 
8.0 rebounds, and 2.33 steals per game.[70][71] Before the 1987–88 NBA 
season, Lakers coach Pat Riley publicly promised that they would defend 
the NBA title, even though no team had won consecutive titles since the 
Celtics did so in the 1969 NBA Finals.[72] Johnson had another productive 
season with averages of 19.6 points, 11.9 assists, and 6.2 rebounds per 
game.[32] In the 1988 playoffs, the Lakers survived two 4–3 series against 
the Utah Jazz and the Dallas Mavericks to reach the Finals and face Thomas 
and the Detroit Pistons,[73] known as the "Bad Boys" for their physical 
style of play.[74] Johnson and Thomas greeted each other with a kiss on 
the cheek before the opening tip of Game 1, which they called a display 
of brotherly love.[61][75][76] After the teams split the first six games, 
Lakers forward and Finals MVP James Worthy had his first career triple-double 
of 36 points, 16 rebounds, and 10 assists, and led his team to a 108–105 win.[77] 
Despite not being named MVP, Johnson had a strong championship series, 
averaging 21.1 points on .550 shooting, 13.0 assists, and 5.7 rebounds 
per game.[78] It was the fifth and final NBA championship of his career. 
In the 1988–89 NBA season, Johnson's 22.5 points, 12.8 assists, and 7.9 rebounds 
per game[32] earned him his second MVP award,[79] and the Lakers reached 
the 1989 NBA Finals, in which they again faced the Pistons. However, after 
Johnson went down with a hamstring injury in Game 2, the Lakers were no 
match for the Pistons, who swept them 4–0.[80] Playing without Abdul-Jabbar 
for the first time, Johnson won his third MVP award[81] after a strong 
1989–90 NBA season in which he averaged 22.3 points, 11.5 assists, and 
6.6 rebounds per game.[32] However, the Lakers bowed out to the Phoenix 
Suns in the Western Conference semifinals, which was the Lakers' earliest 
playoffs elimination in nine years.[82] Mike Dunleavy became the Lakers' 
head coach in 1990–91, when Johnson had grown to be the league's third-oldest 
point guard. He had become more powerful and stronger than in his earlier 
years, but was also slower and less nimble.[83] Under Dunleavy, the offense 
used more half-court sets, and the team had a renewed emphasis on defense.[84] 
Johnson performed well during the season, with averages of 19.4 points, 
12.5 assists, and 7.0 rebounds per game, and the Lakers reached the 1991 
NBA Finals. There they faced the Chicago Bulls, led by shooting guard Michael 
Jordan, a five-time scoring champion regarded as the finest player of his 
era.[85][86] Although the series was portrayed as a matchup between Johnson 
and Jordan,[87] Bulls forward Scottie Pippen defended effectively against 
Johnson. Despite two triple-doubles from Johnson during the series, finals 
MVP Jordan led his team to a 4–1 win.[4] In the last championship series 
of his career, Johnson averaged 18.6 points on .431 shooting, 12.4 assists, 
and 8.0 rebounds per game.[88] After a physical before the 1991–92 NBA 
season, Johnson discovered that he had tested positive for HIV. In a press 
conference held on November 7, 1991, Johnson made a public announcement 
that he would retire immediately.[89] He stated that his wife Cookie and 
their unborn child did not have HIV, and that he would dedicate his life 
to "battle this deadly disease".[89] Johnson initially said that he did 
not know how he contracted the disease,[89] but later acknowledged that 
it was through having multiple sexual partners during his playing career.[90] 
At the time, only a small percentage of HIV-positive American men had contracted 
it from heterosexual sex,[76][91] and it was initially rumored that Johnson 
was gay or bisexual, although he denied both.[76] Johnson later accused 
Isiah Thomas of spreading the rumors, a claim Thomas denied.[61][92] Johnson's 
HIV announcement became a major news story in the United States,[91] and 
in 2004 was named as ESPN's seventh-most memorable moment of the past 25 
years.[9] Many articles praised Johnson as a hero, and former U.S. President 
George H. W. Bush said, "For me, Magic is a hero, a hero for anyone who 
loves sports."[91] Despite his retirement, Johnson was voted by fans as 
a starter for the 1992 NBA All-Star Game at Orlando Arena, although his 
former teammates Byron Scott and A. C. Green said that Johnson should not 
play,[93] and several NBA players, including Utah Jazz forward Karl Malone, 
argued that they would be at risk of contamination if Johnson suffered 
an open wound while on court.[94] Johnson led the West to a 153–113 win 
and was crowned All-Star MVP after recording 25 points, 9 assists, and 
5 rebounds.[95] The game ended after he made a last-minute three-pointer, 
and players from both teams ran onto the court to congratulate Johnson.[96] 
Johnson was chosen to compete in the 1992 Summer Olympics for the US basketball 
team, dubbed the "Dream Team" because of the NBA stars on the roster.[97] 
The Dream Team, which along with Johnson included fellow Hall of Famers 
such as Michael Jordan, Charles Barkley, and Larry Bird, was considered 
unbeatable.[98] The Dream Team dominated the competition, winning the gold 
medal with an 8–0 record, beating their opponents by an average of 43.8 
points per game. Johnson averaged 8.0 points per game during the Olympics, 
and his 5.5 assists per game was second on the team.[98][99] Johnson played 
infrequently because of knee problems,[100] but he received standing ovations 
from the crowd, and used the opportunity to inspire HIV-positive people.[29] 
Before the 1992–93 NBA season, Johnson announced his intention to stage 
an NBA comeback. After practicing and playing in several pre-season games, 
he returned to retirement before the start of the regular season, citing 
controversy over his return sparked by opposition from several active players.[22] 
In an August, 2011 interview Johnson said that in retrospect, he wished 
that he had never retired after being diagnosed with HIV, saying, "If I 
knew what I know now, I wouldn't have retired."[101] Johnson said that 
despite the physical, highly competitive practices and scrimmages leading 
up to the 1992 Olympics, some of those same teammates still expressed concerns 
about his return to the NBA. He said that he retired because he "didn't 
want to hurt the game."[101] During his retirement, Johnson has written 
a book on safe sex, run several businesses, worked for NBC as a commentator, 
and toured Asia, Australia and New Zealand with a basketball team of former 
college and NBA players.[4] In 1985, Johnson created "A Midsummer Night's 
Magic", a yearly charity event which included a celebrity basketball game 
and a black tie dinner. The proceeds went to the United Negro College Fund, 
and Johnson held this event for twenty years, ending in 2005. "A Midsummer 
Night's Magic" eventually came under the umbrella of the Magic Johnson 
Foundation, which he founded in 1991.[102] The 1992 event, which was the 
first one held after Johnson's appearance in the 1992 Olympics, raised 
over $1.3 million for UNCF. Magic Johnson joined Shaquille O'Neal and celebrity 
coach Spike Lee to lead the blue team to a 147–132 victory over the white 
team, which was coached by Arsenio Hall.[103][104] Johnson returned to 
the NBA as coach of the Lakers near the end of the 1993–94 NBA season, 
replacing Randy Pfund, and Bill Bertka, who served as an interim coach 
for two games.[105][106] Johnson, who took the job at the urging of owner 
Jerry Buss, admitted "I've always had the desire (to coach) in the back 
of my mind." He insisted that his health was not an issue, while downplaying 
questions about returning as a player, saying, "I'm retired. Let's leave 
it at that."[107] Amid speculation from general manager Jerry West that 
he may only coach until the end of the season,[107] Johnson took over a 
team that had a 28–38 record, and won his first game as head coach, a 110–101 
victory over the Milwaukee Bucks.[108] He was coaching a team that had 
five of his former teammates on the roster: Vlade Divac, Elden Campbell, 
Tony Smith, Kurt Rambis, James Worthy, who would retire after the season, 
and Michael Cooper, who was brought in as an assistant.[107][109] Johnson, 
who still had a guaranteed player contract that would pay him $14.6 million 
during the 1994–95 NBA season, signed a separate contract to coach the 
team that had no compensation.[107] The Lakers played well initially, winning 
five of their first six games under Johnson, but after losing the next 
five games, Johnson announced that he was resigning as coach after the 
season. The Lakers finished the season on a ten-game losing streak, and 
Johnson's final record as a head coach was 5–11.[106] Stating that it was 
never his dream to coach, he chose instead to purchase a 5% share of the 
team in June 1994.[4] At the age of 36, Johnson attempted another comeback 
as a player when he re-joined the Lakers during the 1995–96 NBA season. 
During his retirement, Johnson began intense workouts to help his fight 
against HIV, raising his bench press from 135 to 300 pounds, and increasing 
his weight to 255 pounds.[25] He officially returned to the team on January 
29, 1996,[110] and played his first game the following day against the 
Golden State Warriors. Coming off the bench, Johnson had 19 points, 8 rebounds, 
and 10 assists to help the Lakers to a 128–118 victory.[111] On February 
14, Johnson recorded the final triple-double of his career, when he scored 
15 points, along with 10 rebounds and 13 assists in a victory against the 
Atlanta Hawks.[111] Playing power forward, he averaged 14.6 points, 6.9 assists, 
and 5.7 rebounds per game in 32 games, and finished tied for 12th place 
with Charles Barkley in voting for the MVP Award.[32][112] The Lakers had 
a record of 22–10 in the games Johnson played, and he considered his final 
comeback "a success."[110] While Johnson played well in 1996, there were 
struggles both on and off the court. Cedric Ceballos, upset over a reduction 
in his playing time after Johnson's arrival, left the team for several 
days.[113][114] He missed two games and was stripped of his title as team 
captain.[115] Nick Van Exel received a seven-game suspension for bumping 
referee Ron Garretson during a game on April 9. Johnson was publicly critical 
of Van Exel, saying his actions were "inexcusable."[116] Ironically Johnson 
was himself suspended five days later, when he bumped referee Scott Foster, 
missing three games. He also missed several games due to a calf injury.[110] 
Despite these difficulties, the Lakers finished with a record of 53–29 
and fourth seed in the NBA Playoffs. Although they were facing the defending 
NBA champion Houston Rockets, the Lakers had home court advantage in the 
five-game series. The Lakers played poorly in a Game 1 loss, prompting 
Johnson to express frustration with his role in coach Del Harris' offense.[117] 
Johnson led the way to a Game 2 victory with 26 points, but averaged only 
7.5 points per game for the remainder of the series, which the Rockets 
won three games to one.[118] After the Lakers lost to the Houston Rockets 
in the first round of the playoffs,[119] Johnson initially expressed a 
desire to return to the team for the 1996–97 NBA season, but he also talked 
about joining another team as a free agent, hoping to see more playing 
time at point guard instead of power forward.[110] A few days later Johnson 
changed his mind and retired permanently, saying, "I am going out on my 
terms, something I couldn't say when I aborted a comeback in 1992."[22][110] 
Determined to play competitive basketball despite being out of the NBA, 
Johnson formed the Magic Johnson All-Stars, a barnstorming team composed 
of former NBA and college players. In 1994 Johnson joined with former pros 
Reggie Theus, John Long, Earl Cureton, and Lester Conner, as his team played 
games in Australia, Israel, South America, Europe, New Zealand, and Japan. 
They also toured the United States, playing five games against teams from 
the CBA. In the final game of the CBA series, Magic Johnson had 30 points, 
17 rebounds, and 13 assists, leading the All-Stars to a 126–121 victory 
over the Oklahoma City Cavalry.[120] By the time he returned to the Lakers 
in 1996, the Magic Johnson All-Stars had amassed a record of 55–0, and 
Johnson was earning as much as $365,000 per game.[25] Johnson played with 
the team frequently over the next several years, with possibly the most 
memorable game occurring in November, 2001. Magic, at the age of 42, played 
with the All-Stars against his alma mater, Michigan State. Although he 
played in a celebrity game to honor coach Jud Heathcoate in 1995,[33] this 
was Johnson's first meaningful game played in his hometown of Lansing in 
22 years. Playing in front of a sold out arena, Johnson had a triple-double 
and played the entire game, but his all-star team lost to the Spartans 
by two points. Johnson's half court shot at the buzzer would have won the 
game, but it fell short.[121][122] On November 1, 2002 Johnson returned 
to play a second exhibition game against Michigan State. Playing with the 
Canberra Cannons of Australia's National Basketball League instead of his 
usual group of players, Johnson's team defeated the Spartans 104–85, as 
he scored 12 points, with 10 assists and 10 rebounds.[123] In 1999, Johnson 
joined the Swedish squad M7 Borås (now known as 'Borås Basket'), and was 
undefeated in five games with the team.[124][125] Johnson also became a 
co-owner of the club;[126] however, the project failed after one season 
and the club was forced into reconstruction.[126] He later joined the Danish 
team The Great Danes.[126] Johnson first fathered a son in 1981, when Andre 
Johnson was born to Melissa Mitchell. Although Andre was raised by his 
mother, he visited Johnson each summer, and as of October 2005[update] 
was working for Magic Johnson Enterprises as a marketing director.[6] In 
1991, Johnson married Earlitha "Cookie" Kelly in a small wedding in Lansing 
which included guests Thomas, Aguirre, and Herb Williams.[127] Johnson 
and Cookie have one son, Earvin III (EJ), who is openly gay and a star 
on the reality show Rich Kids of Beverly Hills.[6][128] The couple adopted 
a daughter, Elisa, in 1995.[129] Johnson resides in Dana Point, California.[130] 
Johnson is a Christian[131] and has said his faith is "the most important 
thing" in his life.[132] In 2010, Magic Johnson and current and former 
NBA players such as LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, and Bill Russell, as well 
as Maya Moore from the WNBA, played a basketball game with President Barack 
Obama as an exhibition for a group of military troops who had been injured 
in action. The game was played at a gym inside Fort McNair, and reporters 
covering the President were not allowed to enter. The basketball game was 
part of festivities organized to celebrate Obama's 49th birthday.[133] 
In 1998, Johnson hosted a late night talk show on the Fox network called 
The Magic Hour, but the show was canceled after two months because of low 
ratings.[134] Shortly after the cancellation of his talk show, Magic Johnson 
started a record label. The label, initially called Magic 32 Records, was 
renamed Magic Johnson Music when Johnson signed a joint venture with MCA 
in 2000. Magic Johnson Music signed R&B artist Avant as its first act.[135][136] 
Johnson also co-promoted Janet Jackson's Velvet Rope Tour through his company 
Magicworks.[137] He has also worked as a motivational speaker,[8] and was 
an NBA commentator for Turner Network Television for seven years,[138] 
before becoming a studio analyst for ESPN's NBA Countdown in 2008.[139] 
Johnson runs Magic Johnson Enterprises, a conglomerate company that has 
a net worth of $700 million;[6] its subsidiaries include Magic Johnson 
Productions, a promotional company; Magic Johnson Theaters, a nationwide 
chain of movie theaters; and Magic Johnson Entertainment, a film studio.[140] 
In addition to these business ventures, Johnson has also created the Magic 
Card, a pre-paid MasterCard aimed at helping low-income people save money 
and participate in electronic commerce.[141] In 2006, Johnson created a 
contract food service with Sodexo USA called Sodexo-Magic.[142][143] In 
2004, Johnson and his partner Ken Lombard, sold Magic Johnson Theaters 
to Loews Cineples Entertainment in 2004. The first Magic Johnson Theater 
located in the Baldwin Hills Crenshaw Plaza, closed in 2010 and re-opened 
in 2011 as Rave Cinema 15.[144] Johnson began thinking of life after basketball 
while still playing with the Lakers. He wondered why so many athletes had 
failed at business, and sought advice. During his seventh season in the 
NBA, he had a meeting with Michael Ovitz, CEO of Creative Artists Agency. 
Ovitz encouraged him to start reading business magazines and to use every 
connection available to him. Johnson learned everything he could about 
business, often meeting with corporate executives during road trips.[10] 
Johnson's first foray into business, a high-end sporting goods store named 
Magic 32,[10] failed after only one year, costing him $200,000.[145] The 
experience taught him to listen to his customers and find out what products 
they wanted. Johnson has become a leading voice on how to invest in urban 
communities, creating redevelopment opportunities in underserved areas, 
most notably through his movie theaters and his partnership with Starbucks. 
He went to Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz with the idea that he could successfully 
open the coffee shops in urban areas. After showing Schultz the tremendous 
buying power of minorities, Johnson was able to purchase 125 Starbucks 
stores, which reported higher than average per capita sales.[145] The partnership, 
called Urban Coffee Opportunities, placed Starbucks in locations such as 
Detroit, Washington, D.C., Harlem, and the Crenshaw District of Los Angeles. 
Johnson sold his remaining interest in the stores back to the company in 
2010, ending a successful twelve-year partnership.[146][147] Johnson has 
also invested in urban California real estate and financial service companies 
catering to America's underserved markets via his Canyon-Johnson and Yucaipa-Johnson 
funds.[148][149][150][151] Another major project is with Chicago-based 
Aon Corp., an insurance services company is designed to promote minority 
businesses.[152] In 1994, Johnson became a minority owner of the Lakers, 
having reportedly paid more than $10 million for part ownership. He also 
held the title of team vice president.[153] Johnson sold his ownership 
stake in the Lakers in October 2010 to Patrick Soon-Shiong, a Los Angeles 
surgeon and professor at UCLA,[154] but continued as an unpaid vice president 
for the team.[155] In the wake of the Donald Sterling controversy, limited 
media reports indicated that Johnson had expressed an interest in purchasing 
the Los Angeles Clippers franchise.[156] In 2015, Johnson completed its 
planned acquisition for a "majority, controlling interest" in EquiTrust 
Life Insurance Company, which manages $14.5 billion in annuities, life 
insurance and other financial products.[157] He is an investor for aXiomatic 
eSports, the ownership company of Team Liquid.[158] In January 2012, Johnson 
joined with Guggenheim Partners and Stan Kasten in a bid for ownership 
of the Los Angeles Dodgers baseball team.[159] In March 2012, Johnson's 
ownership group was announced as the winner of the proceedings to buy the 
Dodgers.[160] The Johnson-led group, which also includes movie executive 
Peter Guber, paid $2 billion for the Dodgers, the largest amount paid for 
a professional sports team. While Magic Johnson is considered the leader 
of the ownership group, the controlling owner is Mark Walter, chief executive 
officer for Guggenheim Partners. Peter Guber, who is co-owner of the Golden 
State Warriors, owns a small stake in the Dodgers along with Johnson. Johnson 
and Guber are also partners in the Dayton Dragons, a minor league baseball 
team that has sold out 844 consecutive games, a record for professional 
sports.[161][162] Together with Guggenheim, Johnson was also involved in 
the February 2014 purchase of the Los Angeles Sparks team in the WNBA.[163] 
As such, in 2014 Johnson was named one of ESPNW's Impact 25.[164] He won 
the WNBA championship as the owner in 2016.[165] Johnson announced his 
co-ownership of a future Major League Soccer expansion franchise based 
in Los Angeles on October 30, 2014.[166] The temporary name is Los Angeles 
Football Club while the ownership group explores a permanent name.[167] 
Johnson is a supporter of the Democratic Party. In 2006, he publicly endorsed 
Phil Angelides for governor of California,[168] in 2007 he supported Hillary 
Clinton in her presidential campaign,[169] and in 2010 he endorsed Barbara 
Boxer in her race for re-election to the US Senate.[170] In 2012, he endorsed 
Barack Obama for President.[171] He endorsed and appeared in campaign ads 
for unsuccessful Los Angeles mayoral candidate Wendy Greuel in 2013.[172] 
In 2015, he once again endorsed Hillary Clinton in her second presidential 
campaign.[173] He is hosting a fundraiser for Hillary Clinton's presidential 
campaign on August 22, 2016.[174] After announcing his infection in November 
1991, Johnson created the Magic Johnson Foundation to help combat HIV,[175] 
although he later diversified the foundation to include other charitable 
goals.[176] In 1992, he joined the National Commission on AIDS, a committee 
appointed by members of Congress and the Bush Administration. Johnson left 
after eight months, saying that the White House had "utterly ignored" the 
work of the panel, and had opposed the commission's recommendations, which 
included universal healthcare and the expansion of Medicaid to cover all 
low-income people with AIDS.[175][177] He was also the main speaker for 
the United Nations (UN) World AIDS Day Conference in 1999,[176] and has 
served as a United Nations Messenger of Peace.[178] HIV had been associated 
with drug addicts and homosexuals,[175] but Johnson's campaigns sought 
to show that the risk of infection was not limited to those groups. Johnson 
stated that his aim was to "help educate all people about what [HIV] is 
about" and teach others not to "discriminate against people who have HIV 
and AIDS".[176] Johnson was later criticized by the AIDS community for 
his decreased involvement in publicizing the spread of the disease.[175][176] 
To prevent his HIV infection from progressing to AIDS, Johnson takes a 
daily combination of drugs.[179] He has advertised GlaxoSmithKline's drugs,[180] 
and partnered with Abbott Laboratories to publicize the fight against AIDS 
in African American communities.[179] In 905 NBA games, Johnson tallied 
17,707 points, 6,559 rebounds, and 10,141 assists, translating to career 
averages of 19.5 points, 7.2 rebounds, and 11.2 assists per game, the highest 
assists per game average in NBA history.[32] Johnson shares the single-game 
playoff record for assists (24),[181] holds the Finals record for assists 
in a game (21),[181] and has the most playoff assists (2,346).[182] He 
is the only player to average 12 assists in an NBA Finals series, achieving 
it six times.[183] He holds the All-Star Game single-game record for assists 
(22), and the All-Star Game record for career assists (127).[181] Johnson 
introduced a fast-paced style of basketball called "Showtime", described 
as a mix of "no-look passes off the fastbreak, pin-point alley-oops from 
halfcourt, spinning feeds and overhand bullets under the basket through 
triple teams."[4] Fellow Lakers guard Michael Cooper said, "There have 
been times when [Johnson] has thrown passes and I wasn't sure where he 
was going. Then one of our guys catches the ball and scores, and I run 
back up the floor convinced that he must've thrown it through somebody."[4][22] 
Johnson could dominate a game without scoring, running the offense and 
distributing the ball with flair.[183] In the 1982 NBA Finals, he was named 
the Finals MVP averaging just 16.2 points, the lowest average of any Finals 
MVP award recipient in the three-point shot era.[183] Johnson was exceptional 
because he played point guard despite being 6 ft 9 in (2.06 m), a size 
reserved normally for frontcourt players.[4] He combined the size of a 
power forward, the one-on-one skills of a swingman, and the ball handling 
talent of a guard, making him one of the most dangerous triple-double threats 
of all time; his 138 triple-double games are second only to Oscar Robertson's 
181.[184] Johnson is the only player in NBA Finals history to have triple-doubles 
in multiple series-clinching games.[183] For his feats, Johnson was voted 
as one of the 50 Greatest Players of All Time by the NBA in 1996,[185] 
and was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 
2002.[186] ESPN's SportsCentury ranked Johnson #17 in their "50 Greatest 
Athletes of the 20th Century"[187] In 2006, ESPN.com rated Johnson the 
greatest point guard of all time, stating, "It could be argued that he's 
the one player in NBA history who was better than Michael Jordan."[5] Several 
of his achievements in individual games have also been named among the 
top moments in the NBA.[41][188][189] Johnson and Larry Bird were first 
linked as rivals after Johnson's Michigan State squad defeated Bird's Indiana 
State team in the 1979 NCAA finals. The rivalry continued in the NBA, and 
reached its climax when Boston and Los Angeles met in three out of four 
NBA Finals from 1984 to 1987. Johnson asserted that for him, the 82-game 
regular season was composed of 80 normal games, and two Lakers–Celtics 
games. Similarly, Bird admitted that Johnson's daily box score was the 
first thing he checked in the morning.[96] Several journalists hypothesized 
that the Johnson–Bird rivalry was so appealing because it represented many 
other contrasts, such as the clash between the Lakers and Celtics, between 
Hollywood flashiness ("Showtime") and Boston/Indiana blue collar grit ("Celtic 
Pride"), and between blacks and whites.[190][191] The rivalry was also 
significant because it drew national attention to the faltering NBA. Prior 
to Johnson and Bird's arrival, the NBA had gone through a decade of declining 
interest and low TV ratings.[192] With the two future Hall of Famers, the 
league won a whole generation of new fans,[193] drawing both traditionalist 
adherents of Bird's dirt court Indiana game and those appreciative of Johnson's 
public park flair. According to sports journalist Larry Schwartz of ESPN, 
Johnson and Bird saved the NBA from bankruptcy.[22] Despite their on-court 
rivalry, Johnson and Bird became close friends during the filming of a 
1984 Converse shoe advertisement that depicted them as enemies.[194][195] 
Johnson appeared at Bird's retirement ceremony in 1992, and described Bird 
as a "friend forever";[96] during Johnson's Hall of Fame ceremony, Bird 
formally inducted his old rival.[193] In 2009, Johnson and Bird collaborated 
with journalist Jackie MacMullan on a non-fiction book titled When the 
Game Was Ours. The book detailed their on-court rivalry and friendship 
with one another.[196] Magic Johnson had an extremely close relationship 
with Lakers owner Jerry Buss, whom he saw as a mentor and a father figure.[197] 
Calling Buss his "second father" and "one of [his] best friends", Johnson 
spent five hours visiting Buss at the hospital just a few months before 
his death from cancer. Speaking to media just hours after Buss had died, 
Johnson was emotional, saying, "Without Dr. Jerry Buss, there is no Magic."[198] 
Buss acquired the team from Jack Kent Cooke in 1979, shortly before he 
drafted Johnson with the #1 pick in the 1979 NBA draft. In addition to 
playing 13 seasons for the Lakers and coaching the team briefly in 1994, 
Johnson also had an ownership stake in the team for nearly twenty years. 
Buss took a special interest in Johnson, introducing him to important Los 
Angeles business contacts and showing him how the Lakers organization was 
run, before eventually selling Johnson a stake in the team in 1994.[198] 
Johnson credits Buss with giving him the business knowledge that enabled 
him to become part owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers.[198][199] Buss supported 
Johnson as he revealed his diagnosis of HIV in 1991, and he never hesitated 
to keep Johnson close to the organization, bringing him in as part-owner, 
and even as a coach. Johnson had never seriously considered coaching, but 
he agreed take the head coaching position with the Lakers in 1994 at Buss' 
request. In 1992, Buss had given Johnson a contract that paid him $14 million 
a year, as payback for all the years he was not the league's highest paid 
player. Although Johnson's retirement prior to the 1992–93 NBA season voided 
this contract, Buss insisted that he still be paid.[198] It was this arrangement 
that allowed Johnson to coach the team without receiving any additional 
salary.[107][197] After Johnson ended his coaching stint, Buss sold him 
a 4% stake in the Lakers for $10 million, and Johnson served as a team 
executive.[198] Johnson's autobiography is Johnson, Earvin (1992). Magic
