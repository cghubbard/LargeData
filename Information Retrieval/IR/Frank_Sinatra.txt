Official website Francis Albert Sinatra (/sᵻˈnɑːtrə/; Italian: [siˈnaːtra]; 
December 12, 1915 – May 14, 1998) was an American singer, actor, and producer 
who was one of the most popular and influential musical artists of the 
20th century. Sinatra's music has been considered timeless by many.[2] 
He is one of the best-selling music artists of all time, having sold more 
than 150 million records worldwide.[3] Born in Hoboken, New Jersey, to 
Italian immigrants, he began his musical career in the swing era with Harry 
James and Tommy Dorsey. He found success as a solo artist after being signed 
by Columbia Records in 1943, becoming the idol of the "bobby soxers". He 
released his first album, The Voice of Frank Sinatra, in 1946. Sinatra's 
professional career had stalled by the early 1950s, and he turned to Las 
Vegas, where he became one of its best known performers as part of the 
Rat Pack. His career was reborn in 1953 with the success of From Here to 
Eternity and his subsequent Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. He 
signed with Capitol Records and released several critically lauded albums, 
including In the Wee Small Hours (1955), Songs for Swingin' Lovers! (1956), 
Come Fly with Me (1958), Only the Lonely (1958) and Nice 'n' Easy (1960). 
Sinatra left Capitol in 1960 to start his own record label, Reprise Records, 
and released a string of successful albums. In 1965 he recorded the retrospective 
September of My Years, starred in the Emmy-winning television special Frank 
Sinatra: A Man and His Music, and scored hits with "Strangers in the Night" 
and "My Way". After releasing Sinatra at the Sands, recorded at the Sands 
Hotel and Casino in Vegas with frequent collaborator Count Basie in early 
1966, the following year he recorded one of his most famous collaborations 
with Tom Jobim, the album Francis Albert Sinatra & Antonio Carlos Jobim. 
It was followed by 1968's collaboration with Duke Ellington. Sinatra retired 
for the first time in 1971, but came out of retirement two years later 
and recorded several albums and resumed performing at Caesars Palace. In 
1980 he scored a Top 40 hit with "New York, New York". Using his Las Vegas 
shows as a home base, he toured both within the United States and internationally 
until a short time before his death in 1998. Sinatra forged a highly successful 
career as a film actor. After winning an Academy Award for From Here to 
Eternity, he starred in The Man with the Golden Arm (1955), and received 
critical acclaim for his performance in The Manchurian Candidate (1962). 
He appeared in various musicals such as On the Town (1949), Guys and Dolls 
(1955), High Society (1956), and Pal Joey (1957), and toward the end of 
his career he became associated with playing detectives, including the 
title character in Tony Rome (1967). On television, The Frank Sinatra Show 
began on ABC in 1950, and he continued to make appearances on television 
throughout the 1950s and 1960s. Sinatra was also heavily involved with 
politics from the mid-1940s, and actively campaigned for presidents such 
as Harry S. Truman, John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan, though before Kennedy's 
death Sinatra's alleged Mafia connections led to his being snubbed.[4] 
While Sinatra never formally learned how to read music, he had a fine, 
natural understanding of it, and he worked very hard from a young age to 
improve his abilities in all aspects of music. A perfectionist, renowned 
for his impeccable dress sense and cleanliness, he always insisted on recording 
live with his band. His bright blue eyes earned him the popular nickname 
"Ol' Blue Eyes". Sinatra led a colorful personal life, and was often involved 
in turbulent affairs with women, such as with his second wife Ava Gardner. 
He went on to marry Mia Farrow in 1966 and Barbara Marx in 1976. Sinatra 
had several violent confrontations, usually with journalists he felt had 
crossed him, or work bosses with whom he had disagreements. He was honored 
at the Kennedy Center Honors in 1983, was awarded the Presidential Medal 
of Freedom by Ronald Reagan in 1985, and the Congressional Gold Medal in 
1997. Sinatra was also the recipient of eleven Grammy Awards, including 
the Grammy Trustees Award, Grammy Legend Award and the Grammy Lifetime 
Achievement Award. After his death, American music critic Robert Christgau 
called him "the greatest singer of the 20th century",[5] and he continues 
to be seen as an iconic figure.[6] Francis Albert Sinatra[a] was born on 
December 12, 1915, in an upstairs tenement at 415 Monroe Street in Hoboken, 
New Jersey.[8][b] He was the only child of Italian immigrants Antonino 
Martino "Marty" Sinatra (May 4, 1892 – January 24, 1969), the son of grape 
growers from Lercara Friddi,[11] and Natalina "Dolly" Garaventa (December 
26, 1896 – January 6, 1977), daughter of a lithographer from Genoa.[12][13][c] 
The couple had eloped on Valentine's Day 1913, and married in a civil ceremony 
in Jersey City, New Jersey.[15] Sinatra weighed 13.5 pounds (6.1 kg) at 
birth and had to be delivered with the aid of forceps, which caused severe 
scarring to his left cheek, neck, and ear, and perforated his ear drum, 
damage that remained for life.[16] Due to his injuries at birth, his baptism 
at St. Francis Church in Hoboken was delayed until April 2, 1916.[17] A 
childhood operation on his mastoid bone left major scarring on his neck, 
and during adolescence he suffered from cystic acne that scarred his face 
and neck.[18] Sinatra was raised Roman Catholic.[19] When Sinatra's mother 
was a child, her pretty face earned her the nickname "Dolly". Energetic 
and driven,[20] biographers believe that she was the dominant factor in 
the development of her son's personality traits and extraordinary self-confidence.[21] 
Barbara Sinatra claims that Dolly was abusive to him as a child, and "knocked 
him around a lot".[22] Dolly became influential in Hoboken and in local 
Democratic Party circles.[23] She worked as a midwife, earning $50 for 
each delivery,[24] and according to Sinatra biographer Kitty Kelley, also 
ran an illegal abortion service that catered to Italian Catholic girls 
for which she was nicknamed "Hatpin Dolly".[25][d] She also had a gift 
for languages and served as a local interpreter.[28] Sinatra's illiterate 
father was a bantamweight boxer who fought under the name Marty O'Brien.[29] 
He later worked for 24 years at the Hoboken Fire Department, working his 
way up to captain.[30] Sinatra spent much time at his parents' tavern in 
Hoboken,[e] working on his homework and occasionally singing a song on 
top of the player piano for spare change.[32] During the Great Depression, 
Dolly provided money to her son for outings with friends and to buy expensive 
clothes, resulting in neighbors describing him as the "best-dressed kid 
in the neighborhood".[33] Excessively thin and small as a child and young 
man, Sinatra's skinny frame later became a staple of jokes during stage 
shows.[34][35] "They'd fought through his childhood and continued to do 
so until her dying day. But I believe that to counter her steel will he'd 
developed his own. To prove her wrong when she belittled his choice of 
career ... Their friction first had shaped him; that, I think, had remained 
to the end and a litmus test of the grit in his bones. It helped keep him 
at the top of his game." Sinatra developed an interest in music, particularly 
big band jazz, at a young age.[37] He listened to Gene Austin, Rudy Vallée, 
Russ Colombo, and Bob Eberly, and "idolized" Bing Crosby.[38] Sinatra's 
maternal uncle, Domenico, gave him a ukulele for his 15th birthday, and 
he began performing at family gatherings.[39] Sinatra attended David E. 
Rue Jr. High School from 1928,[40] and A. J. Demarest High School in 1931, 
where he arranged bands for school dances.[39] He left without graduating, 
having attended only 47 days before being expelled for "general rowdiness".[41] 
To please his mother, he enrolled at Drake Business School, but departed 
after 11 months.[39] Dolly found Sinatra work as a delivery boy at the 
Jersey Observer newspaper, where his godfather Frank Garrick worked,[f] 
and after that, Sinatra was a riveter at the Tietjen and Lang shipyard.[43] 
He performed in local Hoboken social clubs such as The Cat's Meow and The 
Comedy Club, and sang for free on radio stations such as WAAT in Jersey 
City.[44] In New York, Sinatra found jobs singing for his supper or for 
cigarettes.[39] To improve his speech, he began taking elocution lessons 
for a dollar each from vocal coach John Quinlan, who was one of the first 
people to notice his impressive vocal range.[45] Sinatra began singing 
professionally as a teenager, but he learned music by ear and never learned 
to read music.[46][47] He got his first break in 1935 when his mother persuaded 
a local singing group, the 3 Flashes, to let him join. Fred Tamburro, the 
group's baritone, stated that "Frank hung around us like we were gods or 
something", admitting that they only took him on board because he owned 
a car[g] and could chauffeur the group around. Sinatra soon learned they 
were auditioning for the Major Bowes Amateur Hour show, and "begged" the 
group to let him in on the act.[49] With Sinatra, the group became known 
as the Hoboken Four, and passed an audition from Edward Bowes to appear 
on the Major Bowes Amateur Hour show. They each earned $12.50 for the appearance,[50] 
and ended up attracting 40,000 votes and won first prize—a six-month contract 
to perform on stage and radio across the United States.[51] Sinatra quickly 
became the group's lead singer, and, much to the jealousy of his fellow 
group members, garnered most of the attention from girls.[52][h] Due to 
the success of the group, Bowes kept asking for them to return, disguised 
under different names, varying from "The Seacaucus Cockamamies" to "The 
Bayonne Bacalas".[34] In 1938, Sinatra found employment as a singing waiter 
at a roadhouse called "The Rustic Cabin" in Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey, 
for which he was paid $15 a week.[54] The roadhouse was connected to the 
WNEW radio station in New York City, and he began performing with a group 
live during the Dance Parade show.[55] Despite the low salary, Sinatra 
felt that this was the break he was looking for, and boasted to friends 
that he was going to "become so big that no one could ever touch him".[56] 
In March 1939, saxophone player Frank Mane, who knew Sinatra from Jersey 
City radio station WAAT where both performed on live broadcasts, arranged 
for him to audition and record "Our Love", his first solo studio recording.[57][i] 
In June, bandleader Harry James, who had heard Sinatra sing on "Dance Parade", 
signed a two-year contract of $75 a week one evening after a show at the 
Paramount Theatre in New York.[58][j] It was with the James band that Sinatra 
released his first commercial record "From the Bottom of My Heart" in July. 
No more than 8,000 copies of the record were sold, [62] and further records 
released with James through 1939, such as "All or Nothing At All", also 
had weak sales on their initial release.[63] Thanks to his vocal training, 
Sinatra could now sing two tones higher, and developed a repertoire which 
included songs such as "My Buddy", "Willow Weep for Me", "It's Funny to 
Everyone But Me", "Here Comes the Night", "On a Little Street in Singapore", 
"Ciribiribin" and "Every Day of My Life".[64] Sinatra became increasingly 
frustrated with the status of the Harry James band, feeling that he was 
not achieving the major success and acclaim he was looking for. His pianist 
and close friend Hank Sanicola persuaded him to stay with the group,[65] 
but in November 1939 he left James to replace Jack Leonard[k] as the lead 
singer of the Tommy Dorsey band. Sinatra signed a contract with Dorsey 
for $125 a week at Palmer House in Chicago,[66] and James agreed amicably 
to release Sinatra from his contract.[67][l] On January 26, 1940, he made 
his first public appearance with the band at the Coronado Theatre in Rockford, 
Illinois,[69] opening the show with "Stardust".[70] Dorsey recalled: "You 
could almost feel the excitement coming up out of the crowds when the kid 
stood up to sing. Remember, he was no matinée idol. He was just a skinny 
kid with big ears. I used to stand there so amazed I'd almost forget to 
take my own solos".[71] Dorsey was a major influence on Sinatra and became 
a father figure. Sinatra copied Dorsey's mannerisms and traits, becoming 
a demanding perfectionist like him, even adopting his hobby of toy trains. 
He asked Dorsey to be godfather to his daughter Nancy in June 1940.[72] 
Sinatra later said that "The only two people I've ever been afraid of are 
my mother and Tommy Dorsey".[73] Though Kelley claims that Sinatra and 
drummer Buddy Rich were bitter rivals,[m] other authors state that they 
were friends and even roommates when the band was on the road, but professional 
jealousy surfaced as both men wanted to be considered the star of Dorsey's 
band. Later, Sinatra helped Rich form his own band with a $25,000 loan 
and provided financial help to Rich during times of the drummer's serious 
illness.[75] In his first year with Dorsey, Sinatra recorded over forty 
songs. Sinatra's first vocal hit was the song "Polka Dots and Moonbeams" 
in late April 1940.[76] Two more chart appearances followed with "Say It" 
and "Imagination", which was Sinatra's first top-10 hit.[76] His fourth 
chart appearance was "I'll Never Smile Again", topping the charts for twelve 
weeks beginning in mid-July.[77] Other records with Tommy Dorsey issued 
by RCA Victor include "Our Love Affair" and "Stardust" in 1940; "Oh! Look 
at Me Now", "Dolores", "Everything Happens to Me" and "This Love of Mine" 
in 1941; "Just as Though You Were There", "Take Me" and "There Are Such 
Things" in 1942; and "It Started All Over Again", "In the Blue of Evening" 
and "It's Always You" in 1943.[78] As his success and popularity grew, 
Sinatra pushed Dorsey to allow him to record some solo songs. Dorsey eventually 
relented, and on January 19, 1942, Sinatra recorded "Night and Day, "The 
Night We Called It a Day", "The Song is You" and "Lamplighter's Serenade" 
at a Bluebird recording session, with Axel Stordahl as arranger and conductor.[79] 
Sinatra first heard the recordings at the Hollywood Palladium and Hollywood 
Plaza and was astounded at how good he sounded. Stordahl recalled: "He 
just couldn't believe his ears. He was so excited, you almost believed 
he had never recorded before. I think this was a turning point in his career. 
I think he began to see what he might do on his own".[80] After the 1942 
recordings, Sinatra believed he needed to go solo,[81] with an insatiable 
desire to compete with Bing Crosby,[n] but he was hampered by his contract 
which gave Dorsey 43% of Sinatra's lifetime earnings in the entertainment 
industry.[82] A legal battle ensued, eventually settled in August 1943.[83][o] 
On September 3, 1942, Dorsey bid farewell to Sinatra, reportedly saying 
as Sinatra left, "I hope you fall on your ass".[82] He replaced Sinatra 
with singer Dick Haymes.[67] Rumors began spreading in newspapers that 
Sinatra's mobster godfather, Willie Moretti, coerced Dorsey to let Sinatra 
out of his contract for a few thousand dollars, holding a gun to his head.[85][p] 
Sinatra persuaded Stordahl to leave Dorsey with him and become his personal 
arranger, offering him $650 a month, five times the salary of Dorsey.[87] 
Dorsey and Sinatra, who had been very close, never patched up their differences 
before Dorsey's death in 1956, worsened by the fact that Dorsey occasionally 
made biting comments to the press such as "he's the most fascinating man 
in the world, but don't put your hand in the cage".[88] By May 1941, Sinatra 
topped the male singer polls in Billboard and Down Beat magazines.[89] 
His appeal to bobby soxers, as teenage girls of that time were called, 
revealed a whole new audience for popular music, which had been recorded 
mainly for adults up to that time.[90] The phenomenon became officially 
known as "Sinatramania" after his "legendary opening" at the Paramount 
Theatre in New York on December 30, 1942.[82] According to Nancy Sinatra, 
Jack Benny later said, "I thought the goddamned building was going to cave 
in. I never heard such a commotion ... All this for a fellow I never heard 
of."[91] Sinatra performed for four weeks at the theatre, his act following 
the Benny Goodman orchestra, after which his contract was renewed for another 
four weeks by Bob Weitman due to his popularity. He became known as "Swoonatra" 
or "The Voice", and his fans "Sinatratics". They organized meetings and 
sent masses of letters of adoration, and within a few weeks of the show, 
some 1000 Sinatra fan clubs had been reported across the US.[92] Sinatra's 
publicist, George Evans, encouraged interviews and photographs with fans, 
and was the man responsible for depicting Sinatra as a vulnerable, shy, 
Italian–American with a rough childhood who made good.[93] When Sinatra 
returned to the Paramount in October 1944 only 250 persons left the first 
show, and 35,000 fans left outside caused a near riot, known as the Columbus 
Day Riot, outside the venue because they were not allowed in.[94][95][96] 
Such was the bobby-soxer devotion to Sinatra that they were known to write 
Sinatra's song titles on their clothing, bribe hotel maids for an opportunity 
to touch his bed, and accost his person in the form of stealing clothing 
he was wearing, most commonly his bow-tie.[97] Sinatra signed with Columbia 
Records as a solo artist on June 1, 1943 during the 1942–44 musicians' 
strike.[98] Columbia Records re-released Harry James and Sinatra's August 
1939 version of "All or Nothing at All",[68] which reached number 2 on 
June 2, and was on the best–selling list for 18 weeks.[99] He initially 
had great success, [100] and performed on the radio on Your Hit Parade 
from February 1943 until December 1944,[101] and on stage. Columbia wanted 
new recordings of their growing star as quickly as possible, so Alec Wilder 
was hired as an arranger and conductor for several sessions with a vocal 
group called the Bobby Tucker Singers.[102] These first sessions were on 
June 7, June 22, August 5, and November 10, 1943. Of the nine songs recorded 
during these sessions, seven charted on the best–selling list.[103] That 
year he also made his first solo nightclub appearance at New York's Riobamba,[104] 
and a successful concert in the Wedgewood Room of the prestigious Waldorf-Astoria 
New York that year secured his popularity in New York high society.[105] 
Sinatra released "You'll Never Know", "Close to You", "Sunday, Monday, 
or Always" and "People Will Say We're in Love" as singles. By the end of 
1943 he was more popular in a Down Beat poll than Bing Crosby, Perry Como, 
Bob Eberly and Dick Haymes.[106] Sinatra did not serve in the military 
during World War II. On December 11, 1943, he was officially classified 
4-F ("Registrant not acceptable for military service") by his draft board 
because of a perforated eardrum. However, army files reported that Sinatra 
was "not acceptable material from a psychiatric viewpoint", but his emotional 
instability was hidden to avoid "undue unpleasantness for both the selectee 
and the induction service".[107] Briefly, there were rumors reported by 
columnist Walter Winchell that Sinatra paid $40,000 to avoid the service, 
but the FBI found this to be without merit.[108][109][110] Toward the end 
of the war, Sinatra entertained the troops during several successful overseas 
USO tours with comedian Phil Silvers.[111] During one trip to Rome he met 
the Pope, who asked him if he was an operatic tenor.[112] Sinatra worked 
frequently with the popular Andrews Sisters in radio the 1940s,[113] and 
many USO shows were broadcast to troops via the Armed Forces Radio Service 
(AFRS).[114] In 1944 Sinatra released "I Couldn't Sleep a Wink Last Night" 
as a single and recorded his own version of Crosby's "White Christmas", 
and the following year he released "I Dream of You (More Than You Dream 
I Do)", "Saturday Night (Is the Loneliest Night of the Week)", "Dream" 
and "Nancy (with the Laughing Face)" as singles.[115] Despite being heavily 
involved in political activity in 1945 and 1946, in those two years Sinatra 
sang on 160 radio shows, recorded 36 times, and shot four films. By 1946 
he was performing on stage up to 45 times a week, singing up to 100 songs 
daily, and earning up to $93,000 a week.[116] In 1946 Sinatra released 
"Oh! What it Seemed to Be", "Day by Day", "They Say It's Wonderful", "Five 
Minutes More" and "The Coffee Song" as singles,[117] and launched his first 
album, The Voice of Frank Sinatra,[118] which reached No. 1 on the Billboard 
chart. William Ruhlmann of AllMusic noted that Sinatra "took the material 
very seriously, singing the love lyrics with utter seriousness", and that 
his "singing and the classically influenced settings gave the songs unusual 
depth of meaning".[119] He was soon selling ten million records a year.[120] 
Such was Sinatra's command at Columbia that his love of conducting was 
indulged with the release of the set Frank Sinatra Conducts the Music of 
Alec Wilder, an offering unlikely to appeal to Sinatra's core fanbase at 
the time, which consisted of teenage girls.[121] The following year he 
released his second album, Songs by Sinatra, featuring songs of a similar 
mood and tempo such as Irving Berlin's "How Deep is the Ocean?" and Harold 
Arlen's and Jerome Kern's "All The Things You Are".[122] "Mam'selle", composed 
by Edmund Goulding with lyrics by Mack Gordon for the film The Razor's 
Edge (1946),[123] was released a single.[117] Sinatra had competition; 
versions by Art Lund, Dick Haymes, Dennis Day, and The Pied Pipers also 
reached the top ten of the Billboard charts.[124] In December he recorded 
"Sweet Lorraine" with the Metronome All-Stars, featuring talented jazz 
musicians such as Coleman Hawkins, Harry Carney and Charlie Shavers, with 
Nat King Cole on piano, in what Charles L. Granata describes as "one of 
the highlights of Sinatra's Columbia epoch".[125] Sinatra's third album, 
Christmas Songs by Sinatra, was originally released in 1948 as a 78 rpm 
album set,[126] and a 10" LP record was released two years later.[127] 
When Sinatra was featured as a priest in The Miracle of the Bells, due 
to press negativity surrounding his alleged Mafia connections at the time,[q] 
it was announced to the public that Sinatra would donate his $100,000 in 
wages from the film to the church.[128] By the end of 1948, Sinatra had 
slipped to fourth on Down Beat's annual poll of most popular singers (behind 
Billy Eckstine, Frankie Laine, and Bing Crosby).[130] and in the following 
year he was pushed out of the top spots in polls for the first time since 
1943.[131] Frankly Sentimental (1949) was panned by Down Beat, who commented 
that "for all his talent, it seldom comes to life".[132] Though "The Hucklebuck" 
reached the top ten,[133] it was his last single release under the Columbia 
label.[117] Sinatra's last two albums with Columbia, Dedicated to You and 
Sing and Dance with Frank Sinatra, were released in 1950.[134] Sinatra 
would later feature a number of the Sing and Dance with Frank Sinatra album's 
songs, including "Lover", "It's Only a Paper Moon", "It All Depends on 
You", on his 1961 Capitol release, Sinatra's Swingin' Session!!!.[135] 
Cementing the low of his career was the death of publicist George Evans 
from a heart attack in January 1950 at 48. According to Jimmy Van Heusen, 
Sinatra's close friend and songwriter, Evans's death to him was "an enormous 
shock which defies words", as he had been crucial to his career and popularity 
with the bobbysoxers.[136] Sinatra's reputation continued to decline as 
reports broke out in February of his affair with Ava Gardner and the destruction 
of his marriage to Nancy,[137] though he insisted that his marriage had 
long been over even before he had met Gardner.[138] In April, Sinatra was 
engaged to perform at the Copa club in New York, but had to cancel five 
days of the booking due to suffering a submucosal hemorrhage of the throat.[139] 
Evans once noted that whenever Sinatra suffered from a bad throat and loss 
of voice it was always due to emotional tension which "absolutely destroyed 
him".[140] In financial difficulty following his divorce and career decline, 
Sinatra was forced to borrow $200,000 from Columbia to pay his back taxes 
after MCA refused to front the money.[141] Rejected by Hollywood, he turned 
to Las Vegas and made his debut at the Desert Inn in September 1951,[142] 
and also began singing at the Riverside Hotel in Reno, Nevada. Sinatra 
became one of Las Vegas's pioneer entertainers,[143] and a prominent figure 
on the Vegas scene throughout the 1950s and 1960s onwards, a period described 
by Rojek as the "high-water mark" of Sinatra's "hedonism and self absorption". 
Rojek notes that the Rat Pack "provided an outlet for gregarious banter 
and wisecracks", but argues that it was Sinatra's vehicle, possessing an 
"unassailable command over the other performers". [144] Sinatra would fly 
to Las Vegas from Los Angeles in Van Heusen's single-engine plane.[145] 
On October 4, 1953, Sinatra made his first performance at the Sands Hotel 
and Casino, after an invitation by the manager Jack Entratter,[146] who 
had previously worked at the Copa in New York.[147] Sinatra typically performed 
there three times a year, and later acquired a share in the hotel.[148][r] 
Sinatra's decline in popularity was evident at his concert appearances. 
At a brief run at the Paramount in New York he drew small audiences.[152] 
At the Desert Inn in Las Vegas he performed to half-filled houses of wildcatters 
and ranchers.[153] At a concert at Chez Paree in Chicago, only 150 people 
in a 1,200-seat capacity venue turned up to see him.[154] By April 1952 
he was performing at the Kauai County Fair in Hawaii.[155] Sinatra's relationship 
with Columbia Records was also disintegrating, with A&R executive Mitch 
Miller claiming he "couldn't give away" the singer's records.[152][s] Though 
several notable recordings were made during this time period, such as "If 
I Could Write a Book" in January 1952, which Granata sees as a "turning 
point", forecasting his later work with its sensitivity,[158] Columbia 
and MCA dropped him later that year.[160] His last studio recording for 
Columbia, "Why Try To Change Me Now", was recorded in New York on September 
17, 1952, with orchestra arranged and conducted by Percy Faith.[161] Journalist 
Burt Boyar observed, "Sinatra had had it. It was sad. From the top to the 
bottom in one horrible lesson."[152] The release of the film From Here 
to Eternity in August 1953 marked the beginning of a remarkable career 
revival.[162] Santopietro notes that Sinatra began to bury himself in his 
work, with an "unparalleled frenetic schedule of recordings, movies and 
concerts",[163] in what authors Anthony Summers and Robbyn Swan describe 
as "a new and brilliant phase".[164] On March 13, 1953, Sinatra met with 
Capitol Records vice president Alan Livingston and signed a seven-year 
recording contract.[165] His first session for Capitol took place at KHJ 
studios at Studio C, 5515 Melrose Avenue in Los Angeles, with Axel Stordahl 
conducting.[166] The session produced four recordings, including "I'm Walking 
Behind You",[167] Sinatra's first Capitol single.[168] After spending two 
weeks on location in Hawaii filming From Here to Eternity, Sinatra returned 
to KHJ on April 30 for his first recording session with Nelson Riddle, 
an established arranger and conductor at Capitol who was Nat King Cole's 
musical director.[169] After recording the first song, "I've Got the World 
on a String", Sinatra offered Riddle a rare expression of praise, "Beautiful!",[170] 
and after listening to the playbacks, he could not hide his enthusiasm, 
exclaiming, "I'm back, baby, I'm back!"[171] In subsequent sessions in 
May and November 1953,[172] Sinatra and Riddle developed and refined their 
musical collaboration, with Sinatra providing specific guidance on the 
arrangements.[171] Sinatra's first album for Capitol, Songs for Young Lovers, 
was released on January 4, 1954, and included "A Foggy Day", "I Get a Kick 
Out of You", "My Funny Valentine", "Violets for Your Furs" and "They Can't 
Take That Away from Me",[173] songs which became staples of his later concerts.[34][174] 
That same month, Sinatra and Doris Day released the single "Young at Heart", 
which reached #2 and was awarded Song of the Year.[175][176][177][t] In 
March, he recorded and released the single "Three Coins in the Fountain", 
a "powerful ballad"[180] that reached #4.[181] Sinatra's second album with 
Riddle, Swing Easy!, which reflected his "love for the jazz idiom" according 
to Granata,[182] was released on August 2 of that year and included "Just 
One of Those Things", "Taking a Chance on Love", "Get Happy", and "All 
of Me".[181][183] Swing Easy! was named Album of the Year by Billboard, 
and he was also named "Favorite Male Vocalist" by Billboard, Down Beat, 
and Metronome that year.[184][185] Sinatra came to consider Riddle "the 
greatest arranger in the world",[186] and Riddle, who considered Sinatra 
"a perfectionist",[171] offered equal praise of the singer, observing, 
"It's not only that his intuitions as to tempi, phrasing, and even configuration 
are amazingly right, but his taste is so impeccable ... there is still 
no one who can approach him."[186] In 1955 Sinatra released In the Wee 
Small Hours, his first 12" LP,[187] featuring songs such as "In the Wee 
Small Hours of the Morning", "Mood Indigo", "Glad to Be Unhappy" and "When 
Your Lover Has Gone".[188] According to Granata it was the first concept 
album of his to make a "single persuasive statement", with an extended 
program and "melancholy mood".[182] Sinatra embarked on his first tour 
of Australia the same year.[189] Another collaboration with Riddle resulted 
in the development of Songs for Swingin' Lovers!, sometimes seen as one 
of his best albums, which was released in March 1956.[190] It features 
a recording of "I've Got You Under My Skin" by Cole Porter,[191] something 
which Sinatra paid meticulous care to, taking a reported 22 takes to perfect.[192] 
His February 1956 recording sessions inaugurated the studios at the Capitol 
Records Building,[193] complete with a 56-piece symphonic orchestra.[194] 
According to Granata his recordings of "Night and Day", "Oh! Look At Me 
Now" and "From This Moment On" revealed "powerful sexual overtones, stunningly 
achieved through the mounting tension and release of Sinatra's best-teasing 
vocal lines", while his recording of "River, Stay 'Way from My Door" in 
April demonstrated his "brilliance as a syncopational improviser".[195] 
Riddle noted that Sinatra took "particular delight" in singing "The Lady 
is a Tramp", commenting that he "always sang that song with a certain amount 
of salaciousness", making "cue tricks" with the lyrics.[196] His penchant 
for conducting was displayed again in 1956's Frank Sinatra Conducts Tone 
Poems of Color, an instrumental album that has been interpreted to be a 
catharsis to his failed relationship with Gardner.[197] Also that year, 
Sinatra sang at the Democratic National Convention, and performed with 
The Dorsey Brothers for a week soon afterwards at the Paramount Theatre.[198] 
In 1957, Sinatra released Close to You, A Swingin' Affair! and Where Are 
You?  – his first album in stereo, with Gordon Jenkins.[199] Granata considers 
"Close to You" to have been thematically his closest concept album to perfection 
during the "golden" era, and Nelson Riddle's finest work, which was "extremely 
progressive" by the stands of the day. It is structured like a three-act 
play, each commencing with the songs "With Every Breath I Take", "Blame 
It On My Youth" and "It Could Happen to You".[200] For Granata, Sinatra's 
A Swingin' Affair! and swing music predecessor Songs for Swingin' Lovers! 
solidified "Sinatra's image as a 'swinger', from both a musical and visual 
standpoint". Buddy Collette considered the swing albums to have been heavily 
influenced by Sammy Davis, Jr., and noted that when he worked with Sinatra 
in the mid-1960s he approached a song much differently than he had done 
in the early 1950s.[192] On June 9, 1957, he performed in a 62-minute concert 
conducted by Riddle at the Seattle Civic Auditorium,[201] his first appearance 
in Seattle since 1945.[174] The recording was first released as a bootleg, 
but in 1999 Artanis Entertainment Group officially released it as the Sinatra 
'57 in Concert live album, after Sinatra's death.[202] In 1958 Sinatra 
released the album Come Fly with Me with Billy May.[203] It reached the 
top spot on the Billboard album chart in its second week, remaining at 
the top for five weeks,[204] and was nominated for the Grammy Award for 
Album of the Year at the inaugural Grammy Awards.[205] The title song, 
"Come Fly With Me", written especially for him, would become one of his 
best known standards.[206] On May 29 he recorded seven songs in a single 
session, more than double the usual yield of a recording session, and an 
eighth was planned, "Lush Life", but Sinatra found it too technically demanding.[207] 
In September, Sinatra released Frank Sinatra Sings for Only the Lonely, 
a stark collection of introspective[u] saloon songs and blues-tinged ballads 
which proved a huge commercial success, spending 120 weeks on Billboards 
album chart and peaking at No. 1.[209] Cuts from this LP, such as "Angel 
Eyes" and "One for My Baby (and One More for the Road)", would remain staples 
of the "saloon song" segments of Sinatra's concerts.[210] In 1959, Sinatra 
released Come Dance with Me!, a highly successful, critically acclaimed 
album which stayed on Billboard's Pop album chart for 140 weeks, peaking 
at #2. It won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year, as well as Best Vocal 
Performance, Male and Best Arrangement for Billy May.[211] He also released 
No One Cares in the same year, a collection of "brooding, lonely" torch 
songs, which critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine thought was "nearly as good 
as its predecessor Where Are You?, but lacked the "lush" arrangements of 
it and the "grandiose melancholy" of Only the Lonely.[212] In the words 
of Kelley, by 1959, Sinatra was "not simply the leader of the Rat Pack" 
but had "assumed the position of il padrone in Hollywood". He was asked 
by 20th Century Fox to be the master of ceremonies at a luncheon attended 
by President Nikita Khrushchev on September 19, 1959.[213] Nice 'n' Easy, 
a collection of ballads, topped the Billboard chart in October 1960 and 
remained in the charts for 86 weeks, [214] winning critical plaudits.[215][216] 
Granata noted the "lifelike ambient sound" quality of Nice and Easy, the 
perfection in the stereo balance, and the "bold, bright and snappy" sound 
of the band. He highlighted the "close, warm and sharp" feel of Sinatra's 
voice, particularly on the songs "September in the Rain", "I Concentrate 
on You", and "My Blue Heaven".[217] Sinatra grew discontented at Capitol, 
and fell into a feud with Alan Livingston, which lasted over six months.[217] 
He decided to form his own label, Reprise Records.[218] and, in an effort 
to assert his new direction, temporarily parted with Riddle, May and Jenkins, 
working with other arrangers such as Neil Hefti, Don Costa, and Quincy 
Jones.[219] Under Sinatra the company developed into a music industry "powerhouse", 
and he later sold it for an estimated $80 million.[220] His first album 
on the label, Ring-a-Ding-Ding! (1961), was a major success, peaking at 
No.4 on Billboard.[221] The album was released in February 1961, the same 
month that Reprise Records released Ben Webster's The Warm Moods, Sammy 
Davis, Jr.'s The Wham of Sam, Mavis River's Mavis and Joe E. Lewis's It 
is Now Post Time.[222] On September 11 and 12, 1961, Sinatra recorded his 
final songs for Capitol.[223] In an effort to maintain his commercial viability 
in the 1960s, Sinatra recorded Elvis Presley's hit "Love Me Tender", and 
later recorded works by Paul Simon such as "Mrs. Robinson", the Beatles 
("Something", "Yesterday"), and Joni Mitchell ("Both Sides, Now").[224] 
In 1962, Sinatra released Sinatra and Strings, a set of standard ballads 
arranged by Don Costa, which became one of the most critically acclaimed 
works of Sinatra's entire Reprise period. Frank Sinatra, Jr., who was present 
during the recording, noted the "huge orchestra", which Nancy Sinatra stated 
"opened a whole new era" in pop music, with orchestras getting bigger, 
embracing a "lush string sound".[225] Sinatra and Count Basie collaborated 
for the album Sinatra-Basie the same year,[226] a popular and successful 
release which prompted them to rejoin two years later for the follow-up 
It Might as Well Be Swing, arranged by Quincy Jones.[227] The two became 
frequent performers together,[228] and appeared at the Newport Jazz Festival 
in 1965.[189] Also in 1962, as the owner of his own record label, Sinatra 
was able to step on the podium as conductor again, releasing his third 
instrumental album Frank Sinatra Conducts Music from Pictures and Plays.[193] 
In 1963, Sinatra reunited with Nelson Riddle for The Concert Sinatra, an 
ambitious album featuring a 73-piece symphony orchestra arranged and conducted 
by Riddle. The concert was recorded on a motion picture scoring soundstage 
with the use of multiple synchronized recording machines that employed 
an optical signal onto 35 mm film designed for movie soundtracks. Granata 
considers the album to have been "impeachable" [sic], "one of the very 
best of the Sinatra-Riddle ballad albums", in which Sinatra displayed an 
impressive vocal range, particularly in "Ol' Man River", in which he darkened 
the hue.[229] In 1964 the song "My Kind of Town" was nominated for the 
Academy Award for Best Original Song.[230] Sinatra released Softly, as 
I Leave You,[231] and collaborated with Bing Crosby and Fred Waring on 
America, I Hear You Singing, a collection of patriotic songs recorded as 
a tribute to the assassinated President John F. Kennedy.[232][233] Sinatra 
increasingly became involved in charitable pursuits in this period. In 
1961 and 1962 he went to Mexico, with the sole purpose of putting on performances 
for Mexican charities,[v] and in July 1964 he was present for the dedication 
of the Frank Sinatra International Youth Center for Arab and Jewish children 
in Nazareth.[235] Sinatra's phenomenal success in 1965, coinciding with 
his 50th birthday, prompted Billboard to proclaim that he may have reached 
the "peak of his eminence".[236] In June 1965, Sinatra, Sammy Davis, Jr., 
and Dean Martin played live in St. Louis to benefit Dismas House, a prisoner 
rehabilitation and training center with nationwide programs that in particular 
helped serve African Americans. The Rat Pack concert was broadcast live 
via satellite to numerous movie theaters across America.[237] The album 
September of My Years was released September 1965, and went on to win the 
Grammy Award for best album of the year.[238] Granata considers the album 
to have been one of the finest of his Reprise years, "a reflective throwback 
to the concept records of the 1950s, and more than any of those collections, 
distills everything that Frank Sinatra had ever learned or experienced 
as a vocalist".[239] One of the album's singles, "It Was a Very Good Year", 
won the Grammy Award for Best Vocal Performance, Male.[240] A career anthology, 
A Man and His Music, followed in November, winning Album of the Year at 
the Grammys the following year.[241] In 1966 Sinatra released That's Life, 
with both the single of "That's Life" and album becoming Top Ten hits in 
the US on Billboard's pop charts.[242] Strangers in the Night went on to 
top the Billboard and UK pop singles charts,[243][244] winning the award 
for Record of the Year at the Grammys.[245] Sinatra's first live album, 
Sinatra at the Sands, was recorded during January and February 1966 at 
the Sands Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas. Sinatra was backed by the Count 
Basie Orchestra, with Quincy Jones conducting.[246] Sinatra pulled out 
from the Sands the following year, when he was driven out by its new owner 
Howard Hughes, after a fight.[247][w] Sinatra started 1967 with a series 
of recording sessions with Antônio Carlos Jobim. He recorded one of his 
most famous collaborations with Jobim, the Grammy-nominated album Francis 
Albert Sinatra & Antônio Carlos Jobim, which was one of the best-selling 
albums of the year, behind the Beatles's Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club 
Band.[252] According to Santopietro the album "consists of an extraordinarily 
effective blend of bossa nova and slightly swinging jazz vocals, and succeeds 
in creating an unbroken mood of romance and regret".[253] Writer Stan Cornyn 
noted that Sinatra sang so softly on the album that it was comparable to 
the time that he suffered from a vocal hemorrhage in 1950.[254] Sinatra 
also released the album The World We Knew, which features a chart-topping 
duet of "Somethin' Stupid" with daughter Nancy.[243][255] In December, 
Sinatra collaborated with Duke Ellington on the album Francis A. & Edward 
K..[256] According to Granata, the recording of "Indian Summer" on the 
album was a favorite of Riddle's, noting the "contemplative mood [which] 
is heightened by a Johnny Hodges alto sax solo that will bring a tear to 
your eye".[257] With Sinatra in mind, singer-songwriter Paul Anka wrote 
the song "My Way", using the melody of the French "Comme d'habitude" ("As 
Usual"), composed by Claude François and Jacques Revaux.[258] Sinatra recorded 
it just after Christmas 1968.[259] "My Way", Sinatra's best-known song 
on the Reprise label, was not an instant success, charting at #27 in the 
US and #5 in the UK,[260] but it remained in the UK charts for 122 weeks, 
including 75 non-consecutive weeks in the Top 40, between April 1969 and 
September 1971, which was still a record in 2015.[261][262] Sinatra told 
songwriter Ervin Drake in the 1970s that he "detested" singing the song, 
because he believed audiences would think it was a "self-aggrandizing tribute", 
professing that he "hated boastfulness in others".[263] In 1970, Sinatra 
released Watertown, one of his most acclaimed concept albums, with music 
by Bob Gaudio (of the Four Seasons) and lyrics by Jake Holmes.[264] However, 
it sold a mere 30,000 copies that year and reached a peak chart position 
of 101.[265] He left Caesars Palace in September that year after an incident 
where executive Sanford Waterman pulled a gun on him.[x] He performed several 
charity concerts with Count Basie at the Royal Festival Hall in London.[269] 
On November 2, 1970, Sinatra recorded the last songs for Reprise Records 
before his self-imposed retirement,[270] announced the following June at 
a concert in Hollywood to raise money for the Motion Picture and TV Relief 
Fund.[271] He finished the concert with a "rousing" performance of "That's 
Life", and stated "Excuse me while I disappear" as he left the stage.[272] 
He told LIFE journalist Thomas Thompson that "I've got things to do, like 
the first thing is not to do anything at all for eight months ... maybe 
a year",[273] while Barbara Sinatra later claimed that Sinatra had grown 
"tired of entertaining people, especially when all they really wanted were 
the same old tunes he had long ago become bored by".[274] While he was 
in retirement, President Richard Nixon asked him to perform at a Young 
Voters Rally in anticipation of the upcoming campaign. Sinatra obliged 
and chose to sing "My Kind of Town" for the rally held in Chicago on October 
20, 1972.[275] In 1973, Sinatra came out of his short-lived retirement 
with a television special and album. The album, entitled Ol' Blue Eyes 
Is Back,[265] arranged by Gordon Jenkins and Don Costa,[276] was a success, 
reaching number 13 on Billboard and number 12 in the UK.[277][278] The 
television special, Magnavox Presents Frank Sinatra, reunited Sinatra with 
Gene Kelly. He initially developed problems with his vocal cords during 
the comeback due to a prolonged period without singing.[279] That Christmas 
he performed at the Sahara Hotel in Las Vegas,[280] and returned to Caesars 
Palace the following month in January 1974, despite previously vowing to 
perform there again [sic].[281] He began what Barbara Sinatra describes 
as a "massive comeback tour of the United States, Europe, the Far East 
and Australia".[282] In July, while on a second tour of Australia,[283] 
he caused an uproar by describing journalists there – who were aggressively 
pursuing his every move and pushing for a press conference – as "bums, 
parasites, fags, and buck-and-a-half hookers".[284] After he was pressured 
to apologize, Sinatra instead insisted that the journalists apologize for 
"fifteen years of abuse I have taken from the world press".[285] In the 
end, Sinatra's lawyer, Mickey Rudin, arranged a final concert which was 
televised to the nation, and Sinatra was given the opportunity to say "I 
love your attitude, I love your booze" to the Australian people.[286] In 
October 1974 he appeared at New York City's Madison Square Garden in a 
televised concert that was later released as an album under the title The 
Main Event – Live. Backing him was bandleader Woody Herman and the Young 
Thundering Herd, who accompanied Sinatra on a European tour later that 
month.[287][288] In 1975, Sinatra performed in concerts in New York with 
Count Basie and Ella Fitzgerald, and at the London Palladium with Basie 
and Sarah Vaughan, and in Tehran at Aryamehr Stadium, giving 140 performances 
in 105 days.[289] In August he held several consecutive concerts at Lake 
Tahoe together with the newly-risen singer John Denver,[290][291] who became 
a frequent collaborator.[292] Sinatra had recorded Denver's "Leaving on 
a Jet Plane" and "My Sweet Lady" for Sinatra & Company (1971),[293][294] 
and according to Denver, his song "A Baby Just Like You" was written at 
Sinatra's request for his new grandchild, Angela.[295] During the Labor 
Day weekend held in 1976, Sinatra was responsible for reuniting old friends 
and comedy partners Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis for the first time in nearly 
twenty years, when they performed at the "Jerry Lewis MDA Telethon".[296][297] 
That year, the Friars Club selected him as the "Top Box Office Name of 
the Century", and he was given the Scopus Award by the American Friends 
of Hebrew University in Israel and an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters 
from the University of Nevada.[289] Sinatra continued to perform at Caesars 
Palace in the late 1970s, and was performing there in January 1977 when 
his mother Dolly died in a plane crash on the way to see him.[298][y] He 
cancelled two weeks of shows and spent time recovering from the shock in 
Barbados.[300] In March, he performed in front of Princess Margaret at 
the Royal Albert Hall in London, raising money for the NSPCC.[301] On March 
14 he recorded with Nelson Riddle for the last time, recording the songs 
"Linda", "Sweet Loraine" and "Barbara".[302] The two men had a major falling 
out, and later patched up their differences in January 1985 at a dinner 
organized for Ronald Reagan, when Sinatra asked Riddle to make another 
album with him. Riddle was ill at the time, and died that October, before 
they had a chance to record.[303] In 1978, Sinatra filed a $1 million lawsuit 
against a land developer for using his name in the "Frank Sinatra Drive 
Center" in West Los Angeles.[304] During a party at Caesars in 1979, he 
was awarded the Grammy Trustees Award, while celebrating 40 years in show 
business and his 64th birthday.[305][306] That year, former President Gerald 
Ford awarded Sinatra the International Man of the Year Award,[307] and 
he performed in front of the Egyptian pyramids for Anwar Sadat, which raised 
more than $500,000 for Sadat's wife's charities.[301] In 1980, Sinatra's 
first album in six years was released, Trilogy: Past Present Future, a 
highly ambitious triple album that features an array of songs from both 
the pre-rock era and rock era.[308] It was the first studio album of Sinatra's 
to feature his touring pianist at the time, Vinnie Falcone, and was based 
on an idea by Sonny Burke.[309] The album garnered six Grammy nominations – 
winning for best liner notes – and peaked at number 17 on Billboard's album 
chart,[308] and spawned yet another song that would become a signature 
tune, "Theme from New York, New York".[302] That year, as part of the Concert 
of the Americas, he performed in the Maracana Stadium in Rio de Janeiro, 
Brazil, which broke records for the "largest live paid audience ever recorded 
for a solo performer".[310] The following year, Sinatra built on the success 
of Trilogy with She Shot Me Down, an album that was praised for embodying 
the dark tone of his Capitol years.[311] Also in 1981, Sinatra was embroiled 
in controversy when he worked a ten-day engagement for $2 million in Sun 
City, in the internationally unrecognized Bophuthatswana, breaking a cultural 
boycott against apartheid-era South Africa. President Lucas Mangope awarded 
Sinatra with the highest honor, the Order of the Leopard, and made him 
an honorary tribal chief.[312] Santopietro stated that by the early 1980s, 
Sinatra's voice had "coarsened, losing much of its power and flexibility, 
but audiences didn't care".[313] In 1982, he signed a $16 million three-year 
deal with the Golden Nugget of Las Vegas. Kelley notes that by this period 
Sinatra's voice had grown "darker, tougher and loamier", but he "continued 
to captivate audiences with his immutable magic". She added that his baritone 
voice "sometimes cracked, but the gliding intonations still aroused the 
same raptures of delight as they had at the Paramount Theater".[314] That 
year he made a reported further $1.3 million from the Showtime television 
rights to his "Concert of the Americas" in the Dominican Republic, $1.6 
million for a concert series at Carnegie Hall, and $250,000 in just one 
evening at the Chicago Fest. He donated a lot of his earnings to charity.[315] 
He put on a performance at the White House for the Italian Prime Minister, 
and performed at the Radio City Music Hall with Luciano Pavarotti and George 
Shearing.[316] Sinatra was selected as one of the five recipients of the 
1983 Kennedy Center Honors, alongside Katherine Dunham, James Stewart, 
Elia Kazan, and Virgil Thomson. Quoting Henry James, President Reagan said 
in honoring his old friend that "art was the shadow of humanity" and that 
Sinatra had "spent his life casting a magnificent and powerful shadow".[317] 
On September 21, 1983, Sinatra filed a $2 million court case against Kitty 
Kelley, suing her in punitive damages, before her unofficial biography, 
His Way, was even published. The book became a best-seller for "all the 
wrong reasons" and "the most eye-opening celebrity biography of our time", 
according to William Safire of The New York Times.[318] Sinatra was always 
adamant that such a book would be written on his terms, and he himself 
would "set the record straight" in details of his life.[319] According 
to Kelley, the family detested her and the book, which took its toll on 
Sinatra's health. Kelley claims that Tina Sinatra blamed her for her father's 
colon surgery in 1986.[320] He was forced to drop the case on September 
19, 1984, with several leading newspapers expressing concerns about his 
views on censorship.[321] In 1984, Sinatra worked with Quincy Jones for 
the first time in nearly two decades on the album, L.A. Is My Lady, which 
was well received critically.[322] The album was a substitute for another 
Jones project, an album of duets with Lena Horne, which had to be abandoned.[z] 
In 1986, Sinatra collapsed on stage while performing in Atlantic City and 
was hospitalized for diverticulitis,[324] which left him looking frail.[325] 
Two years later, Sinatra reunited with Martin and Davis, Jr. and went on 
the Rat Pack Reunion Tour, during which they played a number of large arenas. 
When Martin dropped out of the tour early on, a rift developed between 
them and the two never spoke again.[326] In 1990, Sinatra was awarded the 
second "Ella Award" by the Los Angeles-based Society of Singers, and performed 
for a final time with Ella Fitzgerald at the award ceremony.[327] Sinatra 
maintained an active touring schedule in the early 1990s, performing 65 
concerts in 1990, 73 in 1991 and 84 in 1992 in seventeen different countries.[328] 
In 1993, Sinatra returned to Capitol Records and the recording studio for 
Duets, which became his best-selling album.[329] The album and its sequel, 
Duets II, released the following year,[330] would see Sinatra remake his 
classic recordings with popular contemporary performers, who added their 
vocals to a pre-recorded tape.[331] During his tours in the early 1990s, 
his memory failed him at times during concerts, and he happened to faint 
onstage in Richmond, Virginia, in March 1994.[332] His final public concerts 
were held in Fukuoka Dome in Japan on December 19–20, 1994.[333] The following 
year, Sinatra sang for the very last time on February 25, 1995, before 
a live audience of 1200 select guests at the Palm Desert Marriott Ballroom, 
on the closing night of the Frank Sinatra Desert Classic golf tournament.[334] 
Esquire reported of the show that Sinatra was "clear, tough, on the money" 
and "in absolute control".[335] Sinatra was awarded the Legend Award at 
the 1994 Grammy Awards, where he was introduced by Bono, who said of him, 
"Frank's the chairman of the bad attitude ... Rock 'n roll plays at being 
tough, but this guy is the boss – the chairman of boss ... I'm not going 
to mess with him, are you?"[336][337] In 1995, to mark Sinatra's 80th birthday, 
the Empire State Building glowed blue.[338] A star-studded birthday tribute, 
Sinatra: 80 Years My Way, was held at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles, 
featuring performers such as Ray Charles, Little Richard, Natalie Cole 
and Salt-N-Pepa singing his songs.[339] At the end of the program Sinatra 
graced the stage for the last time to sing the final notes of the "Theme 
from New York, New York" with an ensemble.[340] In recognition of his many 
years of association with Las Vegas, Frank Sinatra was elected to the Gaming 
Hall of Fame in 1997.[341] "He'd always been critical of his voice, and 
that only intensified as he got older. He never liked to discuss a performance 
afterward because he knew his voice wasn't as good as it used to be. If 
someone told him he'd been great, he'd reply, 'It was a nice crowd, but 
my reed was off' or 'I wasn't so good on the third number'. Strangely, 
in spite of his hearing problems, he had the most incredible ear, which 
often drove those he worked with nuts. There could be an orchestra of a 
hundred musicians, and if one played a bum note he'd know exactly who was 
responsible." While Sinatra never formally learned how to read music, he 
had a fine, natural understanding of it,[343] and he worked very hard from 
a young age to improve his abilities in all aspects of music.[344] He did, 
however, learn to follow a lead sheet during a performance by "carefully 
following the patterns and groupings of notes arranged on the page" and 
made his own notations to the music, using his ear to detect semi-tonal 
differences.[345] Granata states that some of the most accomplished classically 
trained musicians soon noticed his musical understanding, and remarked 
that Sinatra had a "sixth sense", which "demonstrated unusual proficiency 
when it came to detecting incorrect notes and sounds within the orchestra".[346] 
Sinatra was an aficionado of classical music,[347] and would often request 
classical strains in his music, inspired by composers such as Puccini and 
Impressionist masters. His personal favorite was Ralph Vaughan Williams.[348] 
He would insist on always recording live with the band because it gave 
him a "certain feeling" to perform live surrounded by musicians.[349] By 
the mid 1940s, such was his understanding of music that after hearing an 
air check of some compositions by Alec Wilder which were for strings and 
woodwinds, he became the conductor at Columbia Records for six of Wilder's 
compositions: "Air for Oboe", "Air for English Horn", "Air for Flute", 
"Air for Bassoon", "Slow Dance" and "Theme and Variations".[aa] The works, 
which combine elements of jazz and classical music were considered by Wilder 
to have been among the finest renditions and recordings of his compositions-past 
or present.[343] At one recording session with arranger Claus Ogerman and 
an orchestra, Sinatra heard "a couple of little strangers" in the string 
section, prompting Ogerman to make corrections to what were thought to 
be copyist's errors.[343] Critic Gene Lees, a lyricist and the author of 
the words to the Jobim melody "This Happy Madness", expressed amazement 
when he heard Sinatra's recording of it on Sinatra & Company (1971), considering 
him to have worded the lyrics in the way that he had intended when writing 
them to perfection.[350] Voice coach John Quinlan was impressed by Sinatra's 
vocal range, remarking, "He has far more voice that people think he has. 
He can vocalize to a B-flat on top in full voice, and he doesn't need a 
mic either".[45] As a singer, early on he was primarily influenced by Bing 
Crosby,[38] but later believed that Tony Bennett was "the best singer in 
the business". [351] Bennett also praised Sinatra himself, claiming that 
as a performer, he had "perfected the art of intimacy."[352] According 
to Nelson Riddle, Sinatra had a "fairly rangy voice",[ab] remarking that 
"His voice has a very strident, insistent sound in the top register, a 
smooth lyrical sound in the middle register, and a very tender sound in 
the low. His voice is built on infinite taste, with an overall inflection 
of sex. He points everything he does from a sexual standpoint".[353] Despite 
his heavy New Jersey accent, according to Richard Schuller, when Sinatra 
sang his accent was "virtually undetectable", with his diction becoming 
"precise" and articulation "meticulous".[353] His timing was impeccable, 
allowing him, according to Charles L. Granata, to "toy with the rhythm 
of a melody, bringing tremendous excitement to his reading of a lyric".[354] 
Tommy Dorsey observed that Sinatra would "take a musical phrase and play 
it all the way through seemingly without breathing for eight, ten, maybe 
sixteen bars." Dorsey was a considerable influence on Sinatra's techniques 
for his vocal phrasing with his own exceptional breath control on the trombone,[355] 
and Sinatra regularly swam and held his breath underwater, thinking of 
song lyrics to increase his breathing power.[71] Arranger Nelson Riddle 
found Sinatra to be a "perfectionist who drove himself and everybody around 
him relentlessly", and stated that his collaborators approached him with 
a sense of uneasiness because of his unpredictable and often volatile temperament.[356] 
Granata comments that Sinatra was almost fanatically obsessed with perfection 
to the point that people began wondering if he was genuinely concerned 
about the music or showing off his power over others.[125] On days when 
he felt that his voice was not right, he would know after only a few notes 
and would postpone the recording session until the following day, yet still 
pay his musicians.[357] After a period of performing, Sinatra tired of 
singing a certain set of songs and was always looking for talented new 
songwriters and composers to work with. Once he found ones that he liked, 
he actively sought to work with them as often as he could, and made friends 
with many of them. He once told Sammy Cahn, who wrote songs for Anchor's 
Away, "if you're not there Monday, I'm not there Monday". Over the years 
he recorded 87 of Cahn's songs, of which 24 were composed by Jule Styne, 
and 43 by Jimmy Van Heusen. The Cahn-Styne partnership lasted from 1942 
until 1954, when Van Heusen succeeded him as Sinatra's main composer.[358] 
Unlike many of his contemporaries, Sinatra insisted upon direct input regarding 
arrangements and tempos for his recordings. He would spend weeks thinking 
about the songs he wanted to record, and would keep an arranger in mind 
for each song. If it were a mellow love song, he would ask for Gordon Jenkins. 
If it were a "rhythm" number, he would think of Billy May, or perhaps Neil 
Hefti or some other favored arranger. Jenkins considered Sinatra's musical 
sense to be unerring. His changes to Riddle's charts would frustrate Riddle, 
yet he would usually concede that Sinatra's ideas were superior.[359] Barbara 
Sinatra notes that Sinatra would almost always credit the songwriter at 
the end of each number, and would often make comments to the audience, 
such as "Isn't that a pretty ballad" or "Don't you think that's the most 
marvelous love song", delivered with "childlike delight".[360] She states 
that after each show, Sinatra would be "in a buoyant, electrically charged 
mood, a post-show high that would take him hours to come down from as he 
quietly relived every note of the performance he'd just given".[361] "His 
voice is more interesting now: he has separated his voice into different 
colors, in different registers. Years ago, his voice was more even, and 
now it is divided into at least three interesting ranges: low, middle, 
and high. [He's] probing more deeply into his songs than he used to. That 
may be due to the ten years he's put on, and the things he's been through." 
Sinatra's split with Gardner in the fall of 1953 had a profound impact 
on the types of songs he sang and his voice. He began to console himself 
in songs with a "brooding melancholy", such as "I'm a Fool to Want You", 
"Don't Worry 'Bout Me", "My One and Only Love" and There Will Never Be 
Another You",[363] which Riddle believed was the direct influence of Ava 
Gardner. Lahr comments that the new Sinatra was "not the gentle boy balladeer 
of the forties. Fragility had gone from his voice, to be replaced by a 
virile adult's sense of happiness and hurt".[364] Author Granata considered 
Sinatra to have been a "master of the art of recording", noting that his 
work in the studio "set him apart from other gifted vocalists". During 
his career he made over 1000 recordings.[365] Recording sessions would 
typically last three hours, though Sinatra would always prepare for it 
by spending at least an hour by the piano beforehand to vocalize, followed 
by a short rehearsal with the orchestra to ensure the balance of sound.[366] 
During his Columbia years Sinatra would use a RCA 44 microphone, which 
Granata describes as "the 'old-fashioned' microphone which is closely associated 
with Sinatra's crooner image of the 1940s", though when performing on talk 
shows later he would use a bullet-shaped RCA 77.[367] At Capitol he used 
a Neumann U47, an "ultra-sensitive" microphone which better captured the 
timbre and tone of his voice.[368] In the 1950s, Sinatra's career was facilitated 
by developments in technology. As disc jockey Jonathan Schwartz said, "Never 
before had there been an opportunity for a popular singer to express emotions 
at an extended length". In the words of author John Lahr, "as many as sixteen 
songs could be held by the twelve-inch L.P., and this allowed Sinatra to 
use song in a novelistic way, turning each track in a kind of chapter, 
which built and counterpointed moods to illuminate a larger theme".[369] 
Santopietro writes that through the 1950s, well into the 1960s, "every 
Sinatra LP was a masterpiece of one sort of another, whether uptempo, torch 
song, or swingin' affairs. Track after track, the brilliant concept albums 
redefined the nature of pop vocal art".[370] Sinatra attempted to pursue 
an acting career in Hollywood in the early 1940s. While films appealed 
to him,[371] being exceptionally self-confident,[372] he was rarely enthusiastic 
towards his own acting, once remarking that "pictures stink".[373] Sinatra 
made his film debut in 1941, performing in an uncredited sequence in Las 
Vegas Nights, singing "I'll Never Smile Again" with Tommy Dorsey's The 
Pied Pipers.[374] In 1943 he had a cameo role along with Duke Ellington 
and Count Basie in Charles Barton's Reveille with Beverly, making a brief 
appearance singing "Night and Day".[375] The following year he was given 
his leading roles in Higher and Higher and Step Lively for RKO Pictures.[376][377] 
In 1945, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer cast Sinatra opposite Gene Kelly and Kathryn 
Grayson in the Technicolor musical Anchors Aweigh, in which he played a 
sailor on leave in Hollywood for four days.[378][379] A major success,[380] 
it garnered several Academy Award wins and nominations, and the song "I 
Fall in Love Too Easily", sung by Sinatra in the film, was nominated for 
the Academy Award for Best Original Song.[381] In 1946, Sinatra briefly 
appeared at the end of Richard Whorf's commercially successful Till the 
Clouds Roll By, a Technicolor musical biopic of Jerome Kern, in which he 
sang "Ol' Man River.[382] In 1949, Sinatra co-starred with Gene Kelly in 
the Technicolor musical Take Me Out to the Ball Game, a film set in 1908, 
in which Sinatra and Kelly play baseball players who are part-time vaudevillians.[383] 
He teamed up with Kelly for a third time in On the Town, playing a sailor 
on leave in New York City. Today the film is rated very highly by critics, 
and in 2006 it ranked No. 19 on the American Film Institute's list of best 
musicals.[384] Both Double Dynamite (1951), an RKO Irving Cummings comedy 
produced by Howard Hughes,[385] and Joseph Pevney's Meet Danny Wilson (1952) 
failed to make an impression.[386] The New York World Telegram and Sun 
ran the headline "Gone on Frankie in '42; Gone in '52".[387] Fred Zinnemann's 
From Here to Eternity deals with the tribulations of three soldiers, played 
by Burt Lancaster, Montgomery Clift, and Sinatra, stationed on Hawaii in 
the months leading up to the attack on Pearl Harbor.[388] Sinatra had long 
been desperate to find a film role which would bring him back into the 
spotlight, and Columbia Pictures boss Harry Cohn had been inundated by 
appeals from people across Hollywood to give Sinatra a chance to star as 
"Maggio" in the film.[389][ac] During production, Montgomery Clift became 
a close friend,[391] and Sinatra later professed that he "learned more 
about acting from him than anybody I ever knew before".[392] After several 
years of critical and commercial decline, his Academy Award for Best Supporting 
Actor win helped him regain his position as the top recording artist in 
the world.[393] The Los Angeles Examiner wrote that Sinatra is "simply 
superb, comical, pitiful, childishly brave, pathetically defiant", commenting 
that his death scene is "one of the best ever photographed".[394] In 1954 
Sinatra starred opposite Doris Day in the musical film Young at Heart,[395] 
and earned critical praise for his performance as a psychopathic killer 
posing as an FBI agent opposite Sterling Hayden in the film noir Suddenly.[396] 
Sinatra was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor and BAFTA Award 
for Best Actor in a Leading Role for his role as a heroin addict in The 
Man With The Golden Arm (1955).[397][ad] After roles in Guys and Dolls,[399] 
and The Tender Trap,[400] Sinatra was nominated for a BAFTA Award for Best 
Actor in a Leading Role for his role as hospital orderly in Stanley Kramer's 
début picture, Not as a Stranger.[401] During production, Sinatra got drunk 
with Robert Mitchum and Broderick Crawford and trashed Kramer's dressing 
room.[402] Kramer vowed to never hire Sinatra again at the time, and later 
regretted casting him as a Spanish guerrilla leader in The Pride and the 
Passion (1957).[403][404] In 1956 Sinatra featured alongside Bing Crosby 
and Grace Kelly in High Society for MGM, earning a reported $250,000 for 
the picture.[405] The public rushed to the cinemas to see Sinatra and Crosby 
together on-screen, and it ended up earning over $13 million at the box 
office, becoming one of the highest-grossing pictures of 1956.[406] In 
1957, Sinatra starred opposite Rita Hayworth and Kim Novak in George Sidney's 
Pal Joey, for which he won for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – 
Motion Picture Musical or Comedy.[407] Santopietro considers the scene 
in which Sinatra sings "The Lady Is a Tramp" to Hayworth to have been the 
finest moment of his film career.[408] He next portrayed comedian Joe E. 
Lewis in The Joker Is Wild;[409] the song "All the Way" won the Academy 
Award for Best Original Song.[410] By 1958 Sinatra was one of the ten biggest 
box office draws in the United States,[411] appearing with Dean Martin 
and Shirley MacLaine in Vincente Minnelli's Some Came Running and Kings 
Go Forth with Tony Curtis and Natalie Wood.[412] "High Hopes", sung by 
Sinatra in the Frank Capra comedy, A Hole in the Head (1959),[413][414] 
won the Academy Award for Best Original Song,[415] and became a chart hit, 
lasting on the Hot 100 for 17 weeks.[416] Due to an obligation he owed 
to 20th Century Fox for walking off the set of Henry King's Carousel (1956),[ae] 
in 1960 Sinatra starred opposite Shirley MacLaine, Maurice Chevalier and 
Louis Jourdan in Can-Can. He earned $200,000 and 25% of the profits for 
the performance.[417] Later that year he starred in the Las Vegas-set Ocean's 
11, the first film to feature the Rat Pack together and the start of a 
"new era of screen cool" for Santopietro.[418] Sinatra personally financed 
the film, and paid Martin and Davis Jr. fees of $150,000 and $125,000 respectively, 
sums considered exorbitant for the period.[419] In 1962, Sinatra had a 
leading role opposite Laurence Harvey in the The Manchurian Candidate, 
which he considered to be the role he was most excited about and the high 
point of his film career.[420] Vincent Canby, writing for the magazine 
Variety, found the portrayal of Sinatra's character to be "a wide-awake 
pro creating a straight, quietly humorous character of some sensitivity."[421] 
He appeared with the Rat Pack in the western Sergeants 3, following it 
with 4 for Texas in 1963.[419] For his performance in Come Blow Your Horn, 
he was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture 
Musical or Comedy.[422] Though 1965's Von Ryan's Express was a major success,[423][424] 
and he had directed None but the Brave that year,[425] in the mid 1960s, 
Brad Dexter wanted to "breathe new life" in Sinatra's film career by helping 
him display the same professional pride in his films as he did his recordings. 
On one occasion, he gave Sinatra Anthony Burgess's novel A Clockwork Orange 
(1962) to read, with the idea of making a film, but Sinatra thought it 
had no potential and did not understand a word.[426][af] In the late 1960s, 
Sinatra became known for playing detectives,[429] including Tony Rome in 
Tony Rome (1967) and its sequel Lady In Cement (1968).[430][431] He also 
played a similar role in 1968's The Detective.[432] In 1970, Sinatra starred 
opposite George Kennedy in the western Dirty Dingus Magee, an "abysmal" 
affair according to Santopietro,[433] which was panned by the critics.[434][435] 
Sinatra had intended to play Detective Harry Callahan in Dirty Harry (1971), 
but had to turn the role down due to developing Dupuytren's contracture 
in his hand.[436] Sinatra's last major film role was opposite Faye Dunaway 
in Brian G. Hutton's The First Deadly Sin (1980). Santopietro noted that 
as a troubled New York City homicide cop, Sinatra gave an "extraordinarily 
rich", heavily layered characterization, one which "made for one terrific 
farewell" to his film career.[437] After beginning on the Major Bowes Amateur 
Hour radio show with the Hoboken Four in 1935, and later WNEW and WAAT 
in Jersey City,[55] Sinatra became the star of various radio shows of his 
own on NBC and CBS from the early 1940s to the mid 1950s. In 1942 Sinatra 
hired arranger Axel Stordahl away from Tommy Dorsey before he began his 
first radio program that year, keeping Stordahl with him for all of his 
radio work.[438] By the end of 1942 he was named the "Most Popular Male 
Vocalist on Radio" in a Down Beat poll.[439] Early on he frequently worked 
with the popular Andrews Sisters on radio, and they would appear as guests 
on each other's shows,[113] as well as on many USO shows broadcast to troops 
via the Armed Forces Radio Service (AFRS).[114] He appeared as a special 
guest in the sisters' ABC Eight-to-the-Bar Ranch series,[440] while the 
trio in turn guested on his Songs by Sinatra series on CBS.[441] Sinatra 
had two stints as a regular member of cast of Your Hit Parade;[ag] his 
first was from 1943 to 1945,[443] and second was from 1946 to May 28, 1949,[444] 
during which he was paired with the then-new girl singer, Doris Day.[445] 
Starting in September 1949, the BBD&O advertising agency produced a radio 
series starring Sinatra for Lucky Strike called Light Up Time – some 176 
15-minute shows which featured Frank and Dorothy Kirsten singing – which 
lasted through to May 1950.[446] In October 1951, the second season of 
The Frank Sinatra Show began on CBS Television. Ultimately, Sinatra did 
not find the success on television for which he had hoped.[ah] Santopietro 
writes that Sinatra "simply never appeared fully at ease on his own television 
series, his edgy, impatient personality conveying a pent up energy on the 
verge of exploding".[448] In 1953 Sinatra starred in the NBC radio program 
Rocky Fortune, portraying Rocco Fortunato (a.k.a. Rocky Fortune), a "footloose 
and fancy free" temporary worker for the Gridley Employment Agency who 
stumbles into crime-solving. The series aired on NBC radio Tuesday nights 
from October 1953 to March 1954.[449] In 1957, Sinatra formed a three-year 
$3 million contract with ABC to launch The Frank Sinatra Show, featuring 
himself and guests in 36 half hour shows. ABC agreed to allow Sinatra's 
Hobart Productions to keep 60% of the residuals,and bought stock in Sinatra's 
film production unit, Kent Productions, guaranteeing him $7 million.[450] 
Though an initial critical success upon its debut on October 18, 1957, 
it soon attracted negative reviews from Variety and The New Republic, and 
The Chicago Sun-Times thought that Sinatra and frequent guest Dean Martin 
"performed like a pair of adult delinquents", "sharing the same cigarette 
and leering at girls".[451] In return, Sinatra later made numerous appearances 
on The Dean Martin Show and Martin's TV specials.[452] Sinatra's fourth 
and final Timex TV special, Welcome Home Elvis was broadcast in March 1960, 
which earned massive viewing figures. Sinatra had previously been highly 
critical of Elvis Presley and rock and roll in the 1950s, describing it 
as a "deplorable, a rancid smelling aphrodisiac" which "fosters almost 
totally negative and destructive reactions in young people."[453][ai] A 
CBS News special about the singer's 50th birthday, Frank Sinatra: A Man 
and His Music, was broadcast on November 16, 1965, and garnered both an 
Emmy award and a Peabody Award.[455] According his musical collaboration 
with Jobim and Ella Fitzgerald in 1967, Sinatra appeared in the TV special, 
A Man and His Music + Ella + Jobim, which was broadcast on CBS on November 
13.[456] When Sinatra came out of retirement in 1973, he released both 
an album and appeared in a TV special named "Ol' Blue Eyes Is Back". The 
TV special was highlighted by a dramatic reading of "Send in the Clowns" 
and a song-and-dance sequence with former co-star Gene Kelly.[457] In the 
late 1970s, John Denver appeared as a guest in the Sinatra and Friends 
ABC-TV Special, singing "September Song" as a duet.[458] In 1977, Sinatra 
starred as a detective in Contract on Cherry Street, cited as his "one 
starring role in a dramatic television film".[459] Ten years later, he 
made a guest appearance opposite Tom Selleck in Magnum, P.I., playing a 
retired policeman who teams up with Selleck to find his granddaughter's 
murderer. Shot in January 1987, the episode aired on CBS on February 25.[460] 
Sinatra had three children, Nancy (born 1940), Frank Jr. (1944–2016), and 
Tina (born 1948), all with his first wife, Nancy Sinatra (née Barbato; 
born September 11, 1917) (m. 1939–1951).[461] Sinatra had met Barbato in 
Long Branch, New Jersey in the late 1930s, where he spent most of the summer 
working as a lifeguard.[462] He agreed to marry her after an incident at 
"The Rustic Cabin" which led to his arrest.[aj] Sinatra had numerous extra-marital 
affairs,[466] and gossip magazines published details of affairs with women 
including Marilyn Maxwell, Lana Turner, and Joi Lansing.[467][ak] "Frank 
attracted women. He couldn't help it. Just to look at him—the way he moved, 
and how he behaved—was to know that he was a great lover and true gentleman. 
He adored the company of women and knew how to treat them. I had friends 
whose husbands were 'players', and every time the husbands had affairs 
my friends were showered with gifts. Well, I was constantly showered with 
gifts, but no matter what temptations Frank may have had while I wasn't 
around, he made me feel so safe and loved that I never became paranoid 
about losing him." Sinatra was married to Hollywood actress Ava Gardner 
from 1951 to 1957. It was a turbulent marriage, with many well-publicized 
fights and altercations,[470] and Gardner aborted a child in November 1952.[471] 
The couple formally announced their separation on October 29, 1953, through 
MGM.[472] Gardner filed for divorce in June 1954, at a time when she was 
dating matador Luis Miguel Dominguín,[473] but the divorce was not settled 
until 1957.[474] Sinatra continued to feel very strongly for her,[474] 
and they remained friends for life.[475] He was still dealing with her 
finances in 1976.[476] Sinatra reportedly broke off engagements to Lauren 
Bacall in 1958,[477] and Juliet Prowse in 1962.[478] He married Mia Farrow 
on July 19, 1966, a short marriage which ended with divorce in Mexico in 
August 1968.[479] They remained close friends for life,[480] and in a 2013 
interview Farrow admitted that Sinatra might be the father of her son, 
Ronan Farrow (born 1987).[481][482] Sinatra was lastly married to Barbara 
Marx from 1976 until his death.[483] The couple married at Sunnylands, 
in Rancho Mirage, California, the estate of media magnate Walter Annenberg, 
on July 11, 1976.[484] Sinatra was close friends with Jilly Rizzo,[485] 
songwriter Jimmy Van Heusen, golfer Ken Venturi, comedian Pat Henry and 
baseball manager Leo Durocher.[486] In his spare time, Sinatra enjoyed 
listening to classical music, and would attend concerts when he could.[347] 
He swam daily in the Pacific Ocean, finding it to be therapeutic and giving 
him much-needed solitude.[487] He would often play golf with Venturi at 
the course in Palm Springs, where he lived,[488] and liked painting, reading, 
and building model railways.[489] Though Sinatra was critical of the church 
on numerous occasions,[490] and had an Albert Einstein-like view of God 
in his earlier life,[491] he turned to the Roman Catholic Church for healing 
after his mother died in a plane crash in 1977. He died as a practicing 
Catholic and had a Catholic burial.[492] Sinatra was noted for his impeccable 
sense of style.[493] He always dressed immaculately, both in his professional 
and private life. He believed that as he was the best, he had to give his 
best to the audience, and would wear expensive custom-tailored tuxedos 
on stage as a sign of respect and to look important.[494] He spent lavishly 
on stylish pin-striped suits and other clothing, and later admitted that 
clothing made him feel wealthy and important, bolstering his ego.[495] 
He was also obsessed with cleanliness—while with the Tommy Dorsey band 
he developed the nickname "Lady Macbeth", because of frequent showering 
and switching his outfits.[496] His deep blue eyes earned him the popular 
nickname "Ol' Blue Eyes".[497] For Santopietro, Sinatra was the personification 
of America in the 1950s: "cocky, eye on the main chance, optimistic, and 
full of the sense of possibility".[498] Barbara Sinatra wrote that "A big 
part of Frank's thrill was the sense of danger that he exuded, an underlying, 
ever-present tension only those closest to him knew could be defused with 
humor".[486] Cary Grant, a good friend of Sinatra's, stated that Sinatra 
was the "most honest person he'd ever met", who spoke "a simple truth, 
without artifice which scared people", and was often moved to tears by 
his performances.[499] Jo-Caroll Dennison commented that he possessed "great 
inner strength", and that his energy and drive was "enormous".[140] A workaholic, 
he reportedly only slept for four hours a night on average.[500] Throughout 
his life, Sinatra had mood swings and bouts of mild to severe depression,[501] 
admitting to an interviewer in the 1950s that "I have an over-acute capacity 
for sadness as well as elation".[502] Barbara Sinatra stated that he would 
"snap at anyone for the slightest misdemeanor",[503] while Van Heusen said 
that when Sinatra got drunk it was "best to disappear".[504] Sinatra's 
mood swings often developed into violence, directed at people he felt had 
crossed him, particularly journalists who gave him scathing reviews, publicists 
and photographers,[505] According to Rojek he was "capable of deeply offensive 
behavior that smacked of a persecution complex".[506] He received negative 
press for fights with Lee Mortimer in 1947, photographer Eddie Schisser 
in Houston in 1950, Judy Garland's publicist Jim Byron on the Sunset Strip 
in 1954,[505][507] and for a confrontation with Washington Post journalist 
Maxine Cheshire in 1973, in which he implied that she was a cheap prostitute.[506][al] 
Yet Sinatra was known for his generosity,[508] particularly after his comeback. 
Kelley notes that when Lee J. Cobb nearly died from a heart attack in June 
1955, Sinatra flooded him with "books, flowers, delicacies", paid his hospital 
bills, and visited him daily, telling him that his finest acting was yet 
to come.[509] In another instance, after a heated argument with manager 
Bobby Burns, rather than apologize, Sinatra bought him a brand new Cadillac.[510] 
Sinatra became the stereotype of the "tough working-class Italian American", 
something which he embraced. Sinatra commented that if it had not been 
for his interest in music he would "probably have ended in a life of crime".[511] 
In his early days, Mafia boss Willie Moretti, Sinatra's godfather and notorious 
underboss of the Genovese crime family, helped him for kickbacks and was 
reported to have intervened in releasing him from his contract with Tommy 
Dorsey.[512] Sinatra was present at the Mafia Havana Conference in 1946,[513] 
and when the press learned of Sinatra being in Havana with Lucky Luciano, 
one newspaper published the headline, "Shame, Sinatra".[514] He was reported 
to be a good friend of Sam Giancana,[515] and the two were seen playing 
golf together.[516] Kelley quotes Jo-Carrol Silvers in saying that Sinatra 
"adored" Bugsy Siegel, and would boast about him to friends and how many 
people he had killed.[517] Kelley claims that Sinatra and mobster Joseph 
Fischetti had been good friends from 1938 onward, and acted like "Sicilian 
brothers".[518] She also states that Sinatra and Hank Sanicola were financial 
partners with Mickey Cohen in the gossip magazine Hollywood Night Life.[519] 
The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) kept records amounting to 2,403 
pages on Sinatra, becoming a natural target with his alleged Mafia ties, 
his ardent New Deal politics and his friendship with John F. Kennedy.[520] 
The FBI kept Sinatra under surveillance for almost five decades beginning 
in the 1940s. The documents include accounts of Sinatra as the target of 
death threats and extortion schemes.[521] The FBI documented that Sinatra 
was losing esteem with the Mafia as he grew closer to President Kennedy, 
whose brother Bobby was leading a crackdown on organized crime.[522] Sinatra 
denied Mafia involvement, declaring that "any report that I fraternized 
with goons or racketeers is a vicious lie".[523] In 1960, Sinatra bought 
a share in the Cal Neva Lodge & Casino, a casino hotel which straddles 
the border between Nevada and California on the north shores of Lake Tahoe. 
Though it only opened between June and September, Sinatra built the Celebrity 
Room theater, which attracted the other Rat Pack members, Red Skelton, 
Marilyn Monroe, Victor Borge, Joe E. Lewis, Lucille Ball, Lena Horne, Juliet 
Prowse, the McGuire Sisters and others. By 1962 he reportedly held a 50% 
share in the hotel.[524] Sinatra's gambling license was temporarily stripped 
by the Nevada Gaming Control Board in 1963 after Giancana was spotted on 
the premises.[525][am] Due to ongoing pressure from the FBI and Nevada 
Gaming Commission on mobster control of casinos, Sinatra agreed to give 
up his share in Cal Neva and the Sands.[527] That year, Sinatra's son, 
Frank Sinatra, Jr., was kidnapped, but was eventually released unharmed.[528] 
Sinatra restored his gaming license in February 1981, following support 
from Ronald Reagan.[529] Sinatra held differing political views throughout 
his life. His mother, Dolly Sinatra (1896–1977), was a Democratic Party 
ward leader.[530] Sinatra met President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1944, 
and subsequently heavily campaigned for the Democrats in the 1944 presidential 
election.[531] According to Jo Carroll Silvers, in his younger years Sinatra 
had "ardent liberal" sympathies, and was "so concerned about poor people 
that he was always quoting Henry Wallace".[532] He was outspoken about 
racism, particularly toward blacks and Italians, from early on. In November 
1945 Sinatra was invited by the mayor of Gary, Indiana, to try to settle 
a strike by white students of Froebel High School against the "Pro-Negro" 
policies of the new principal.[533] His comments, while praised by liberal 
publications, led to accusations by some that he was a Communist, which 
he strongly denied.[534] In the 1948 presidential election, Sinatra actively 
campaigned for President Harry S. Truman.[535] In 1952 and 1956, he also 
campaigned for Adlai Stevenson.[535] Of all the U.S. Presidents he associated 
with during his career, he was closest to John F. Kennedy.[535] Sinatra 
often invited Kennedy to Hollywood and Las Vegas, and the two would womanize 
and enjoy parties together.[536] In January 1961 Sinatra and Peter Lawford 
organized the Inaugural Gala in Washington, D.C., held on the evening before 
President Kennedy was sworn into office.[535] In 1962, Sinatra was snubbed 
by Kennedy during his visit to Palm Springs when he decided to stay with 
the Republican Bing Crosby, due to FBI concerns about Sinatra's alleged 
connections to organized crime.[an] Sinatra had invested a lot of his own 
money in upgrading the facilities at his home in anticipation of the President's 
visit, fitting it with a heliport, which he later reportedly smashed up 
with a sledgehammer upon being rejected.[538] Despite the snub, when he 
learned of Kennedy's assassination he reportedly sobbed in his bedroom 
for three days.[535][ao] Sinatra worked with Hubert H. Humphrey in 1968,[540] 
and remained a supporter of the Democratic Party until the early 1970s. 
Although still a registered Democrat, Sinatra endorsed Republican Ronald 
Reagan for a second term as Governor of California in 1970.[541][535] He 
officially changed allegiance in July 1972 when he supported Richard Nixon 
for re-election in the 1972 presidential election.[535] In the 1980 presidential 
election, Sinatra supported Ronald Reagan and donated $4 million to Reagan's 
campaign.[542] Sinatra arranged Reagan's Presidential gala, as he had done 
for Kennedy 20 years previously.[543][544] In 1985, Reagan presented Sinatra 
with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, remarking, "His love of country, 
his generosity for those less fortunate ... make him one of our most remarkable 
and distinguished Americans."[545] Santopietro notes that Sinatra was a 
"lifelong sympathizer with Jewish causes".[546] He was awarded the Hollzer 
Memorial Award by the Los Angeles Jewish Community in 1949.[133] He gave 
a series of concerts in Israel in 1962, and donated his entire $50,000 
fee for appearing in a cameo role in Cast a Giant Shadow (1966) to the 
Youth Center in Jerusalem.[546] On November 1, 1972, he raised $6.5 million 
in bond pledges for Israel,[275] and was given the Medallion of Valor for 
his efforts.[269] The Frank Sinatra Student Center at the Hebrew University 
of Jerusalem was dedicated in his name in 1978.[307] From his youth, Sinatra 
displayed sympathy for African Americans and worked both publicly and privately 
all his life to help them win equal rights. He blamed racial prejudice 
on the parents of children.[547] Sinatra played a major role in the desegregation 
of Nevada hotels and casinos in the 1950s and 1960s.[548] At the Sands 
in 1955, Sinatra went against policy by inviting Nat King Cole into the 
dining room,[549] and in 1961, after an incident where an African-American 
couple entered the lobby of the hotel and were blocked by the security 
guard, Sinatra and Sammy Davis, Jr. forced the hotel management to begin 
hiring black waiters and busboys.[550] On January 27, 1961, Sinatra played 
a benefit show at Carnegie Hall for Martin Luther King, Jr. and led his 
fellow Rat Pack members and Reprise label mates in boycotting hotels and 
casinos that refused entry to black patrons and performers. According to 
his son, Frank Sinatra, Jr., King sat weeping in the audience at one of 
his father's concerts in 1963 as Sinatra sang "Ol' Man River", a song from 
the musical Show Boat that is sung by an African-American stevedore.[551] 
When he changed his political affiliations in 1970, Sinatra became less 
outspoken on racial issues.[317] Though he did much towards racial causes, 
it did not stop the occasional racist jibe from him and the other Rat Pack 
members toward Davis at concerts.[202][552] Sinatra died with his wife 
at his side at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles on May 14, 1998, 
aged 82, after a heart attack.[553][554] Sinatra had ill health during 
the last few years of his life, and was frequently hospitalized for heart 
and breathing problems, high blood pressure, pneumonia and bladder cancer. 
He was further diagnosed as having dementia.[555] He had made no public 
appearances following a heart attack in February 1997.[553] Sinatra's wife 
encouraged him to "fight" while attempts were made to stabilize him, and 
his final words were, "I'm losing."[556] Sinatra's daughter, Tina, later 
wrote that she and her sister, Nancy, had not been notified of their father's 
final hospitalization, and it was her belief that "the omission was deliberate. 
Barbara would be the grieving widow alone at her husband's side."[557] 
The night after Sinatra's death, the lights on the Empire State Building 
in New York City were turned blue. Also right after Sinatra's death, the 
lights on the Las Vegas Strip were dimmed in his honor, and the casinos 
stopped spinning for a minute.[554][558] Sinatra's funeral was held at 
the Roman Catholic Church of the Good Shepherd in Beverly Hills, California, 
on May 20, 1998, with 400 mourners in attendance and thousands of fans 
outside.[559] Gregory Peck, Tony Bennett, and Sinatra's son, Frank Jr., 
addressed the mourners, who included many notable people from film and 
entertainment.[556][559] Sinatra was buried in a blue business suit with 
mementos from family members—cherry-flavored Life Savers, Tootsie Rolls, 
a bottle of Jack Daniel's, a pack of Camel cigarettes, a Zippo lighter, 
stuffed toys, a dog biscuit, and a roll of dimes that he always carried—next 
to his parents in section B-8 of Desert Memorial Park in Cathedral City, 
California.[560] His close friends Jilly Rizzo and Jimmy Van Heusen are 
buried nearby. The words "The Best Is Yet to Come", plus "Beloved Husband 
& Father" are imprinted on Sinatra's grave marker.[561] Significant increases 
in recording sales worldwide were reported by Billboard in the month of 
his death.[236] American music critic Robert Christgau referred to Sinatra 
as "the greatest singer of the 20th century".[5] His popularity was later 
matched only by Elvis Presley, The Beatles, and Michael Jackson.[562] For 
Santopietro, Sinatra was the "greatest male pop singer in the history of 
America",[563] who amassed "unprecedented power onscreen and off", and 
"seemed to exemplify the common man, an ethnic twentieth-century American 
male who reached the 'top of the heap', yet never forgot his roots". Santopietro 
argues that Sinatra created his own world, which he was able to dominate—his 
career was centred around power, perfecting the ability to capture an audience.[564] 
Composer Gus Levene commented that Sinatra's strength was that when it 
came to lyrics, telling a story musically, Sinatra displayed a "genius" 
ability and feeling, which with the "rare combination of voice and showmanship" 
made him the "original singer" which others who followed most tried to 
emulate.[565] George Roberts, a trombonist in Sinatra's band, remarked 
that Sinatra had a "charisma, or whatever it is about him, that no one 
else had".[566] Biographer Arnold Shaw considered that "If Las Vegas had 
not existed, Sinatra could have invented it". He quoted reporter James 
Bacon in saying that Sinatra was the "swinging image on which the town 
is built", adding that no other entertainer quite "embodied the glamour" 
associated with Las Vegas as him.[142] Sinatra continues to be seen as 
one of the icons of the 20th century,[6] and has three stars on the Hollywood 
Walk of Fame for his work in film and music. There are stars on east and 
west sides of the 1600 block of Vine Street respectively, and one on the 
south side of the 6500 block of Hollywood Boulevard for his work in television.[567] 
In Sinatra's native New Jersey, Hoboken's Frank Sinatra Park, the Hoboken 
Post Office,[568] and a residence hall at Montclair State University were 
named in his honor.[569] Other buildings named for Sinatra include the 
Frank Sinatra School of the Arts in Astoria, Queens, the Frank Sinatra 
International Student Center at Israel's Hebrew University in Jerusalem 
dedicated in 1978,[570] and the Frank Sinatra Hall at the USC School of 
Cinematic Arts in Los Angeles, California, dedicated in 2002.[571] Wynn 
Resorts' Encore Las Vegas resort features a restaurant dedicated to Sinatra 
which opened in 2008.[572] Items of memorabilia from Sinatra's life and 
career are displayed at USC's Frank Sinatra Hall and Wynn Resort's Sinatra 
restaurant.[571][572] Near the Las Vegas Strip is a road named Frank Sinatra 
Drive in his honor.[573] The United States Postal Service issued a 42-cent 
postage stamp in honor of Sinatra in May 2008, commemorating the tenth 
anniversary of his death.[568][574] The United States Congress passed a 
resolution introduced by Representative Mary Bono Mack on May 20, 2008, 
designating May 13 as Frank Sinatra Day to honor his contributions to American 
culture.[575] Sinatra received three honorary degrees during his lifetime. 
In May 1976, he was invited to speak at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas 
(UNLV) graduation commencement held at Sam Boyd Stadium. It was at this 
commencement that he was bestowed an Honorary Doctorate litterarum humanarum 
by the university.[576] During his speech, Sinatra noted that his education 
had come from "the school of hard knocks" and was suitably touched by the 
award. He went on to describe that "this is the first educational degree 
I have ever held in my hand. I will never forget what you have done for 
me today".[577] A few years later in 1984 and 1985, Sinatra also received 
an Honorary Doctorate of Fine Arts from Loyola Marymount University as 
well as an Honorary Doctorate of Engineering from the Stevens Institute 
of Technology.[578][579] Sinatra has been portrayed on numerous occasions 
in film and on television. A television miniseries based on Sinatra's life, 
titled Sinatra, was aired by CBS in 1992. Sinatra was directed by James 
Steven Sadwith, who won an Emmy Award for Outstanding Individual Achievement 
in Directing for a Miniseries or a Special, and starred Philip Casnoff 
as Sinatra. Sinatra was written by Abby Mann and Philip Mastrosimone, and 
produced by Sinatra's daughter, Tina.[580] Sinatra has subsequently been 
portrayed on screen by Ray Liotta (The Rat Pack, 1998),[581] James Russo 
(Stealing Sinatra, 2003),[582] Dennis Hopper (The Night We Called It a 
Day, 2003),[583] and Robert Knepper (My Way, 2012),[584] and spoofed by 
Joe Piscopo and Phil Hartman on Saturday Night Live.[585] A biographical 
film directed by Martin Scorsese has long been in production.[586] A 1998 
episode of the BBC documentary series Arena, The Voice of the Century, 
focused on Sinatra.[587] Alex Gibney directed a four-part biographical 
series on Sinatra, All or Nothing At All, for HBO in 2015.[588] A musical 
tribute was aired on CBS television in December 2015 to mark Sinatra's
