Warren Darst Gill (December 21, 1878 in Ladoga, Indiana â€“ November 26, 
1952 in Laguna Beach, California) nicknamed "Doc", was a professional baseball 
player who played first base for the Pittsburgh Pirates in the 1908 Major 
Leagues. Gill is best known for failing to touch second base in a game 
against the Chicago Cubs on September 4, 1908. With the game tied at 0 
in the bottom of the 10th, Chief Wilson stroked a two-out single that scored 
the winning run. However, Johnny Evers saw that Gill didn't touch second 
base. Umpire Hank O'Day, the only umpire working the game that day, said 
he didn't see it and called the game over with a Pirates victory. Three 
weeks later on September 23, 1908, New York Giants player Fred Merkle repeated 
Gill's error during a game against the Cubs. The Cubs' capitalization of 
this error was followed by a losing streak which became known as the Curse
