William C. Bartholomay (born August 11, 1928) is a Chicago executive who 
made his living in the insurance industry. In 1962 he was the leader of 
a consortioum who bought the Milwaukee Braves, a National League Baseball 
franchise, from the previous Braves owner Lou Perini. Despite the Braves 
success in Milwaukee, where the team had set league attendance records 
during the 1950s, Bartholomay was intent on moving the team to Atlanta, 
a growing regional center, where there was more television revenue, and 
where the new, 52,000 seat Fulton County Stadium had recently been built. 
Furthermore, Bill was an innovator and wanted to be the first man to bring 
a baseball team to the deep south. He worked with many social leaders to 
help attain his dream. After an extended legal battle with Milwaukee that 
kept the Braves in Milwaukee through the 1965 season, the National League 
agreed to the shift to Atlanta. The case ultimately led to baseball's guidelines 
on local ownership.[1] In 1976, he was approached by a friend, Ted Turner. 
Bill and Ted knew a baseball team and network deal would be a good way 
to market the Atlanta Braves on a national scale and provided programing 
for Ted Turner's developing network. Bartholomay agreed, and sold the controlling 
interest of the Braves to Turner of Turner Broadcasting System, Inc., and 
owner of CNN, while retaining his interest as Chairman.[2] Bartholomay
