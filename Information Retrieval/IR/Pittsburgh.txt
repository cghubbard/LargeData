Allegheny Pittsburgh (/ˈpɪtsbərɡ/ PITS-burg) is a city in the Commonwealth 
of Pennsylvania in the United States, and is the county seat of Allegheny 
County. The Combined Statistical Area (CSA) population of 2,659,937 is 
the largest in both the Ohio Valley and Appalachia, the second-largest 
in Pennsylvania after Philadelphia and the 20th-largest in the U.S. Located 
at the confluence of the Allegheny and Monongahela rivers, which form the 
Ohio River, Pittsburgh is known as both "the Steel City" for its more than 
300 steel-related businesses, and as the "City of Bridges" for its 446 
bridges.[3] The city features 30 skyscrapers, two inclines, a pre-revolutionary 
fortification and the Point State Park at the confluence of the rivers. 
The city developed as a vital link of the Atlantic coast and Midwest. The 
mineral-rich Allegheny Mountains made the area coveted by the French and 
British empires, Virginia, Whiskey Rebels, and Civil War raiders.[4] Aside 
from steel, Pittsburgh has led in manufacturing of aluminum, glass, shipbuilding, 
petroleum, foods, sports, transportation, computing, autos, and electronics.[5] 
For part of the 20th century, Pittsburgh was behind only New York and Chicago 
in corporate headquarters employment; it had the most U.S. stockholders 
per capita.[6] America's 1980s deindustrialization laid off area blue-collar 
workers and thousands of downtown white-collar workers when the longtime 
Pittsburgh-based world headquarters of Gulf Oil, Sunbeam, Rockwell and 
Westinghouse moved out.[7] This heritage left the area with renowned museums, 
medical centers,[8] parks, research centers, libraries, a diverse cultural 
district and the most bars per capita in the U.S.[9] In 2015, Pittsburgh 
was listed among the "eleven most livable cities in the world";[10] The 
Economist's Global Liveability Ranking placed Pittsburgh as the first- 
or second-most livable city in the United States in 2005, 2009, 2011, 2012 
and 2014.[11] Google, Apple, Bosch, Facebook, Uber, Nokia, Autodesk, and 
IBM are among 1,600 technology firms generating $20.7 billion in annual 
Pittsburgh payrolls. The area has served also as the long-time federal 
agency headquarters for cyber defense, software engineering, robotics, 
energy research and the nuclear navy.[12] The area is home to 68 colleges 
and universities, including research and development leaders Carnegie Mellon 
University and the University of Pittsburgh.[13] The nation's fifth-largest 
bank, eight Fortune 500 companies, and six of the top 300 US law firms 
make their global headquarters in the Pittsburgh area, while RAND, BNY 
Mellon, Nova, FedEx, Bayer and NIOSH have regional bases that helped Pittsburgh 
become the sixth-best area for U.S. job growth.[14] The region is a hub 
for Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design, sustainable energy, 
and energy extraction.[15] French Empire 1669–1758 British Empire 1681–1781 
United States 1776–present Pittsburgh was named in 1758 by General John 
Forbes, in honor of British statesman William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham. 
As Forbes was a Scotsman, historians speculate that the pronunciation of 
the name was originally intended to be /ˈpɪtsbᵊrə/ PITS-brə or PITS-bə-rə 
(similar to Edinburgh).[16] Pittsburgh was incorporated as a township in 
1771 and as a borough on April 22, 1794 with the following Act:[17] "Be 
it enacted by the Pennsylvania State Senate and Pennsylvania House of Representatives 
of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania...by the authority of the same, that 
the said town of Pittsburgh shall be...erected into a borough, which shall 
be called the borough of Pittsburgh for ever."[18] Pittsburgh is one of 
the few American cities to be spelled with an h at the end of a burg suffix.[19] 
From 1890 to 1911 the city's "h" was removed but, after a public campaign, 
it was officially restored by the United States Board on Geographic Names.[18] 
The area of the Ohio headwaters was long inhabited by the Shawnee and several 
other settled groups of Native Americans.[20] The first known European 
to enter the region was the French explorer/trader Robert de La Salle from 
Quebec during his 1669 expedition down the Ohio River.[21] European pioneers, 
primarily Dutch, followed in the early 18th century. Michael Bezallion 
was the first to describe the forks of the Ohio in a 1717 manuscript, and 
later that year European fur traders established area posts and settlements.[22] 
In 1749, French soldiers from Quebec launched an expedition to the forks 
to unite Canada with French Louisiana via the rivers.[22] During 1753–54, 
the British hastily built Fort Prince George before a larger French force 
drove them off. The French built Fort Duquesne based on LaSalle's 1669 
claims. The French and Indian War, the North American front of the Seven 
Years' War, began with the future Pittsburgh as its center. British General 
Edward Braddock was dispatched with Major George Washington as his aide 
to take Fort Duquesne.[23] The British and colonial force were defeated 
at Braddock's Field. General John Forbes finally took the forks in 1758. 
Forbes began construction on Fort Pitt, named after William Pitt the Elder 
while the settlement was named "Pittsborough".[24] During Pontiac's Rebellion, 
native tribes conducted a siege of Fort Pitt for two months until Colonel 
Henry Bouquet relieved it after the Battle of Bushy Run. Fort Pitt is notable 
as the site of an early use of smallpox for biological warfare. Lord Jeffrey 
Amherst ordered blankets contaminated from smallpox victims to be distributed 
in 1763 to the tribes surrounding the fort. The disease spread into other 
areas, infected other tribes, and killed hundreds of thousands.[25][26][not 
in citation given] During this period, the powerful nations of the Iroquois 
Confederacy, based in New York, had maintained control of much of the Ohio 
Valley as hunting grounds by right of conquest after defeating other tribes. 
By the terms of the 1768 Treaty of Fort Stanwix, the Penns were allowed 
to purchase the modern region from the Iroquois. A 1769 survey referenced 
the future city as the "Manor of Pittsburgh".[27] Both the Colony of Virginia 
and the Province of Pennsylvania claimed the region under their colonial 
charters until 1780, when they agreed under a federal initiative to extend 
the Mason–Dixon line westward, placing Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania. On March 
8, 1771 Bedford County, Pennsylvania was created to govern the frontier. 
On April 16, 1771, the city's first civilian local government was created 
as Pitt Township.[28][29] William Teagarden was the first constable, and 
William Troop was the first clerk.[30] Following the American Revolution, 
the village of Pittsburgh continued to grow. One of its earliest industries 
was boat building for settlers of the Ohio Country. In 1784, Thomas Viceroy 
completed a town plan which was approved by the Penn family attorney. Pittsburgh 
became a possession of Pennsylvania in 1785. The following year, the Pittsburgh 
Post-Gazette was started, and in 1787, the Pittsburgh Academy was chartered. 
Unrest during the Whiskey Rebellion of 1794 resulted in federal troops 
being sent to the area. By 1797, glass manufacture began, while the population 
grew to around 1,400. Settlers came via routes over the Appalachian Mountains 
or through the Great Lakes. Fort Pitt (now Pittsburgh) at the source of 
the Ohio River became the main base for settlers moving into the Northwest 
Territory. The War of 1812 cut off the supply of British goods, stimulating 
American industry. By 1815, Pittsburgh was producing significant quantities 
of iron, brass, tin, and glass. On March 18, 1816, the 46-year-old local 
government became a city. In the 1830s, many Welsh people from the Merthyr 
steelworks immigrated to the city following the aftermath of the Merthyr 
Rising. By the 1840s, Pittsburgh was one of the largest cities west of 
the Allegheny Mountains. The Great Fire of Pittsburgh destroyed over a 
thousand buildings in 1845. The city rebuilt with the aid of Irish immigrants 
and by 1857, Pittsburgh's 1,000 factories were consuming 22 million coal 
bushels yearly. Coal mining and iron manufacturing attracted waves of European 
immigrants to the area. The American Civil War boosted the city's economy 
with increased iron and armament demand. Andrew Carnegie began steel production 
in 1875 at the Edgar Thomson Steel Works in North Braddock, Pennsylvania, 
which evolved into the Carnegie Steel Company. He adopted the Bessemer 
process to increase production. In 1901, Carnegie merged several companies 
into U.S. Steel. By 1910, Pittsburgh was the nation's 8th-largest city, 
accounting for between a third and a half of national steel output. The 
city's population swelled to over a half million with European immigration 
via Ellis Island in New York harbor. By 1940, non-Hispanic whites were 
90.6% of the city's population.[31] Pittsburgh also became a main destination 
of the African-American Great Migration from the rural South during the 
first half of the 20th century.[32] Limited initially by discrimination, 
some 95% percent of the men became unskilled steel workers.[33] During 
World War II, demand increased and area mills operated 24 hours a day to 
produce 95 million tons of steel for the war effort.[24] This resulted 
in the highest levels of air pollution in the city's almost century of 
industry. The city's reputation as the "arsenal of democracy"[34][35] was 
being overshadowed by James Parton's 1868 observation of Pittsburgh being 
"hell with the lid off."[36] Following the war, the city launched a clean 
air and civic revitalization project known as the "Renaissance," cleaning 
up the air and the rivers. The "Renaissance II" project followed in 1977, 
focused on cultural and neighborhood development. The industrial base continued 
to expand through the 1970s, but beginning in the early 1980s both the 
area's steel and electronics industries imploded during national industrial 
restructuring. There were massive layoffs from mill and plant closures.[7] 
In the later 20th century, the area shifted its economic base to education, 
tourism, and services, largely based on healthcare/medicine, finance, and 
high technology such as robotics. Although Pittsburgh successfully shifted 
its economy and remained viable, the city's population has never rebounded 
to its industrial-era highs. While 680,000 people lived in the city proper 
in 1950, a combination of suburbanization and economic turbulence resulted 
in a decrease in city population, even as the metropolitan area population 
increased again. During the late 2000s recession, Pittsburgh was economically 
strong, adding jobs when most cities were losing them. It was one of the 
few cities in the United States to see housing property values rise. Between 
2006 and 2011, the Pittsburgh metropolitan statistical area (MSA) experienced 
over 10% appreciation in housing prices—the highest appreciation of the 
largest 25 MSAs in the United States, as 22 of the top 25 MSAs saw a depreciation 
of housing values.[37] Pittsburgh's story of economic regeneration was 
the inspiration for President Barack Obama to host the 2009 G-20 Pittsburgh 
summit.[38] Pittsburgh has a total area of 58.3 square miles (151 km2), 
of which 55.6 square miles (144 km2) is land and 2.8 square miles (7.3 km2) 
(or 4.75%) is water. The 80th meridian west passes directly through the 
city's downtown. The city is on the Allegheny Plateau, within the ecoregion 
of the Western Allegheny Plateau,[39] The Downtown area (also known as 
the Golden Triangle) sits where the Allegheny River flowing from the northeast 
and Monongahela River from the southeast form the Ohio River. The convergence 
is at Point State Park and is referred to as "the Point." The city extends 
east to include the Oakland and Shadyside sections, which are home to the 
University of Pittsburgh, Carnegie Mellon University, Chatham University, 
Carnegie Museum and Library, and many other educational, medical, and cultural 
institutions. The southern, western, and northern areas of the city are 
primarily residential. Many Pittsburgh neighborhoods are steeply sloped 
with two-lane roads. More than a quarter of neighborhood names make reference 
to "hills," "heights," or similar features.[a] The steps of Pittsburgh 
comprise some 712 sets of outdoor public stairways with 44,645 treads and 
24,090 vertical feet. They include hundreds of paper streets composed entirely 
of stairs, and many other steep streets with stairs for sidewalks.[40] 
Many provide vistas of the Pittsburgh area while attracting hikers and 
fitness walkers.[41] Bike and walking trails have been built to border 
many of the city's rivers and hollows, but steep hills and variable weather 
can make biking a challenge. The Great Allegheny Passage and Chesapeake 
and Ohio Canal Towpath connect the city directly to downtown Washington, 
D.C. (some 335 miles (539 km) away) with a continuous bike/running trail. 
The city consists of the Downtown area, called the Golden Triangle,[42] 
and four main areas surrounding it. These surrounding areas are subdivided 
into distinct neighborhoods (in total, Pittsburgh contains 90 neighborhoods).[43] 
Relative to downtown, these areas are known as the North Side, South Side/South 
Hills, East End, and West End. Downtown Pittsburgh has 30 skyscrapers, 
nine of which top 500 feet (150 m). U.S. Steel Tower is the tallest at 
841 ft (256 m).[44] The Cultural District comprises a 14-block area of 
downtown along the Allegheny River. It is packed with theaters and arts 
venues, and has a growing residential segment. Most significantly, the 
Pittsburgh Cultural Trust is embarking on RiverParc, a four-block mixed-use 
"green" community, featuring 700 residential units and multiple towers 
between 20 and 30 stories. The Firstside portion of downtown borders the 
Monongahela River, the historic Mon Wharf and is home to the distinctive 
PPG Place Gothic-style glass skyscraper complex. New condo towers have 
been constructed and historic office towers are converted to residential 
use, increasing 24-hour residents. Downtown is served by the Port Authority's 
subway and multiple bridges leading north and south.[45] It is also home 
to Point Park University, The Art Institute of Pittsburgh and Duquesne 
University which borders Uptown. The North Side is home to various neighborhoods 
in transition. What is known today as Pittsburgh's North Side was once 
known as Allegheny City, and operated as a city independently of Pittsburgh. 
Allegheny City merged with Pittsburgh under great protest from its citizens. 
The North Side is primarily composed of residential neighborhoods and is 
noteworthy for well-constructed and architecturally interesting homes. 
Many buildings date from the 19th century and are constructed of brick 
or stone and adorned with decorative woodwork, ceramic tile, slate roofs 
and stained glass. The North Side is also home to many popular attractions 
such as Heinz Field, PNC Park, Carnegie Science Center, National Aviary, 
Andy Warhol Museum, Mattress Factory installation art museum, Children's 
Museum of Pittsburgh, Randyland, Highmark SportsWorks, Penn Brewery, and 
Allegheny Observatory. The North Side is also home to Allegheny General 
Hospital, which is listed among the 1999 US News & World Report 2000 best 
hospitals nationwide. The South Side was once the site of the Pennsylvania 
Railroad railyards and associated dense, inexpensive housing for mill and 
railroad workers. Since the late 20th century, the city undertook a Main 
Street program in cooperation with the National Trust for Historic Preservation, 
encouraging design and landscape improvements on East Carson Street, and 
supporting new retail. The area has become a local Pittsburgher destination. 
The South Side is one of the most popular neighborhoods in the city in 
which to own a home. The value of homes in the South Side has increased 
in value by about 10% annually for the past 10 years.[46] East Carson Street 
has developed as one of the most vibrant areas of the city, packed with 
diverse shopping, ethnic eateries, vibrant nightlife, and live music venues. 
In 1993 the Urban Redevelopment Authority of Pittsburgh purchased the South 
Side Works steel mill property. It collaborated with the community and 
various developers to create a master plan for a mixed-use development, 
to include a riverfront park, office space, housing, health-care facilities, 
and indoor practice fields for the Pittsburgh Steelers and Pitt Panthers. 
Construction began in 1998. The SouthSide Works has been open since 2005, 
featuring many stores, restaurants, offices, and the world headquarters 
for American Eagle Outfitters.[47] The East End is home to the University 
of Pittsburgh, Carnegie Mellon University, Carlow University, Chatham University, 
The Carnegie Institute's Museums of Art and Natural History, Frick Art 
& Historical Center (Clayton and the Frick art museum), Phipps Conservatory, 
Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Hall, and the Pittsburgh Zoo and PPG Aquarium. 
The neighborhoods of Shadyside and Squirrel Hill are large, wealthy neighborhoods 
with some apartments and condos. They enjoy pedestrian-oriented shopping/business 
districts. Oakland, heavily populated by undergraduate and graduate students, 
is home to most of the universities, Schenley Park and the Petersen Events 
Center. Bloomfield is Pittsburgh's Little Italy and is known for its Italian 
restaurants and grocers. Lawrenceville is a revitalizing rowhouse neighborhood 
popular with artists and designers; it is expected to benefit from the 
recent new construction of a new Children's Hospital. The Strip District 
to the west along the Allegheny River is an open-air marketplace by day 
and a clubbing destination by night. The West End includes Mt. Washington, 
with its famous view of the Downtown skyline and numerous other residential 
neighborhoods such as Sheraden and Elliott. Pittsburgh's patchwork of neighborhoods 
still retain an ethnic character reflecting the city's immigrant history. 
These include: Several neighborhoods on the edges of the city are less 
urban, featuring tree-lined streets, yards and garages, with a more suburban 
character. Oakland, the South Side, the North Side, and the Golden Triangle 
are characterized by more density of housing, walking neighborhoods, and 
a more diverse, urban feel. Pittsburgh falls within the borders of the 
Northeastern United States as defined by multiple US Government agencies, 
but the Pittsburgh Combined Statistical Area extends into both the Southern 
United States (West Virginia) and the Midwestern United States (Ohio), 
with the borders of the three regions meeting 30 miles (48 km) from the 
city. Pittsburgh is also in the Great Lakes Megalopolis, a collection of 
primarily Midwestern cities, reflecting Pittsburgh's socio-economic connections 
to Ohio and points west.[48][49] Pittsburgh falls within the borders of 
Appalachia as defined by the Appalachian Regional Commission, and has long 
been characterized as the "northern urban industrial anchor of Appalachia."[50] 
In its post-industrial state, Pittsburgh has been characterized as the 
"Paris of Appalachia",[51][52][53][54] recognizing the city's cultural, 
educational, healthcare, and technological resources, as well as its status 
as Appalachia's largest city. Pittsburgh lies in the humid continental 
climate zone (Köppen Dfa).[55] The city and river valleys lie in the USDA 
plant hardiness zone 6b while higher elevated areas lie in zone 6a.[56] 
The area has four distinct seasons: winters are cold, cloudy, and moderately 
snowy, springs and falls generally mild with moderate levels of sunshine, 
and summers warm to hot and humid. As measured by percent possible sunshine, 
summer is by far the sunniest season.[57] The warmest month of the year 
in Pittsburgh is July, with a 24-hour average of 72.6 °F (22.6 °C). Conditions 
are often humid, and combined with highs reaching 90 °F (32 °C) on an average 
9.5 days a year,[58] a considerable heat index arises. The coldest month 
is January, when the 24-hour average is 28.4 °F (−2.0 °C), and lows of 
0 °F (−18 °C) or below can be expected on an average 2.6 nights per year.[58] 
Officially, record temperatures range from −22 °F (−30 °C), on January 
19, 1994 to 103 °F (39 °C), which occurred three times, most recently on 
July 16, 1988; the record cold daily maximum is −3 °F (−19 °C), which occurred 
three times, most recently the day of the all-time record low, while, conversely, 
the record warm daily minimum is 82 °F (28 °C) on July 1, 1901.[58][b] 
Due to elevation and location on the windward side of the Appalachian Mountains, 
100 °F (38 °C)+ readings are very rare, and were last seen on July 15, 
1995.[58] Average annual precipitation is 38.2 inches (970 mm) and total 
precipitation is greatest in May while least in October; annual precipitation 
has historically ranged from 22.65 in (575 mm) in 1930 to 57.41 in (1,458 mm) 
in 2004.[59] On average, December and January have the greatest number 
of precipitation days. Snowfall averages 41.4 inches (105 cm) per season, 
but has historically ranged from 8.8 in (22 cm) in 1918–19 to 82.0 in (208 cm) 
in 1950–51.[60] There is an average of 59 clear days and 103 partly cloudy 
days per year, while 203 days are cloudy.[61] In terms of annual percent-average 
possible sunshine received, Pittsburgh (45%) is similar to Seattle (43%).[62] 
"It's the best it's been in the lifetime for virtually every resident in 
this county...We've seen a steady decrease in pollution levels over the 
past decade and certainly over the past 20, 30, 40, 50 years or more." 
In a 2013 ranking of 277 metropolitan areas in the United States, the American 
Lung Association (ALA) ranked only six U.S. metro areas as having higher 
amounts of short-term particle pollution, and only seven U.S. metro areas 
having higher amounts of year-round particle pollution than Pittsburgh. 
For ozone (smog) pollution, Pittsburgh was ranked 24th among U.S. metro 
areas.[64][65] The area has improved its air quality with every annual 
survey. The ALA's rankings have been disputed by the Allegheny County Health 
Department (ACHD), since data from only the worst of the region's 20 air 
quality monitors is considered by the ALA, without any context or averaging. 
The lone monitor used is located immediately downwind and adjacent to U.S. 
Steel's Clairton Coke Works, the nation's largest coke mill, and several 
municipalities outside the city's jurisdiction of pollution controls, leading 
to possible confusion that Pittsburgh itself is the source or center of 
the emissions cited in the survey.[66] The region's readings also reflect 
pollution swept in from Ohio and West Virginia, though both are outside 
the jurisdictional powers of local leadership.[67] Although the county 
was still below the "pass" threshold, the report showed substantial improvement 
over previous decades on every air quality measure. Fewer than 15 high 
ozone days were reported between 2007 and 2009, and just 10 between 2008 
and 2010, compared to more than 40 between 1997 and 1999.[68] ACHD spokesman 
Guillermo Cole stated that "It's the best it's been in the lifetime for 
virtually every resident in this county...We've seen a steady decrease 
in pollution levels over the past decade and certainly over the past 20, 
30, 40, 50 years, or more."[69] The local rivers continue to have pollution 
levels exceeding EPA limits; however, fish catches in the city in 2007 
were found to be more than twice as free of pollutants than catches on 
the Canadian side of Lake Erie and six times as free of pollutants than 
Allegheny River catches of the New York border area.[70] There are other 
concerns about local storm sewers and waste treatment plants frequently 
overflowing untreated sewage into local waterways, due to flood conditions 
and antiquated infrastructure. The city contains 31,000 trees on 900 miles 
of streets, by the last count conducted in 2005. A 2011 analysis of Pittsburgh's 
total tree cover, which involved sampling more than 200 small plots throughout 
the city, showed a value of between $10 and $13 million in annual benefits 
based on the "urban forest" contributions to aesthetics, energy use and 
air quality. Energy savings from shade, impact on city air and water quality, 
and the boost in property values were taken into account in the analysis. 
The city spends $850,000/year on street tree planting and maintenance.[71] 
At the 2010 Census, there were 305,704 people residing in Pittsburgh, a 
decrease of 8.6% since 2000. 66.0% of the population was White, 25.8% Black 
or African American, 0.2% American Indian and Alaska Native, 4.4% Asian, 
0.3% Other, and 2.3% mixed. 2.3% of Pittsburgh's population was of Hispanic 
or Latino origin of any race. Non-Hispanic Whites were 64.8% of the population 
in 2010,[75] compared to 78.7% in 1970.[76] The five largest European ethnic 
groups in the city are German- (19.7%), Irish- (15.8%), Italian- (11.8%), 
Polish- (8.4%), and English- (4.6%), while the metropolitan area is approximately 
22% German-American, 15.4% Italian American and 11.6% Irish American. Pittsburgh 
has one of the largest Italian-American communities in the nation,[78] 
the fifth-largest Ukrainian community,[79] and the largest Croatian community 
in the USA. In the metro Pittsburgh area live more than 200,000 Croatian 
descendants.[citation needed] According to a 2010 ARDA study, residents 
include 773,341 "Catholics"; 326,125 "Mainline Protestants"; 174,119 "Evangelical 
Protestants;" 20,976 "Black Protestants;" and 16,405 "Orthodox Christians," 
with 996,826 listed as "unclaimed" and 16,405 as "other" in the metro area.[80] 
There were 143,739 households, out of which 21.9% had children under the 
age of 18 living with them, 31.2% were married couples living together, 
16.5% had a female householder with no husband present, and 48.4% were 
non-families. 39.4% of all households were made up of individuals and 13.7% 
had someone living alone who is 65 years of age or older. The average household 
size was 2.17 and the average family size was 2.95. In the city the population 
was spread out, with 19.9% under the age of 18, 14.8% from 18 to 24, 28.6% 
from 25 to 44, 20.3% from 45 to 64, and 16.4% who were 65 years of age 
or older. The median age was 36 years. For every 100 females there were 
90.7 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 87.8 males. 
The median income for a household in the city was $28,588, and the median 
income for a family was $38,795. Males had a median income of $32,128 versus 
$25,500 for females. The per capita income for the city was $18,816. About 
15.0% of families and 20.4% of the population were below the poverty line, 
including 27.5% of those under the age of 18 and 13.5% ages 65 or older. 
In a 2002 study, Pittsburgh ranked 22nd of 69 urban places in the U.S. 
in the number of residents 25 years or older who had completed a bachelor's 
degree, at 31%.[81] Pittsburgh ranked 15th of the 69 places in the number 
of residents 25 years or older who completed a high school degree, at 84.7%.[82] 
The metro area has shown greater residential racial integration during 
the last 30 years. The 2010 census ranked 18 other U.S. metros as having 
greater black-white segregation, while 32 other U.S. metros rank higher 
for black-white isolation.[83] Within city limits both Carlow University[84] 
and Chatham University[85] have residential gender segregation above 90%, 
as Duquesne University[86] and Point Park University[87] both have female 
populations at 60% or greater. Carnegie Mellon University has a 60% male 
population.[88] Pittsburgh has adapted since the collapse of its century-long 
steel and electronics industries. The region has shifted to high technology, 
robotics, health care, nuclear engineering, tourism, biomedical technology, 
finance, education, and services. Total annual payroll of the region's 
technology industries, when taken in aggregate, exceeded $10.8 billion 
in 2007,[89] and in 2010 there were 1,600 technology companies.[90] A National 
Bureau of Economic Research 2014 report named Pittsburgh the second-best 
U.S. city for intergenerational economic mobility[91] or the American Dream.[92] 
Reflecting the citywide shift from industry to technology, former factories 
have been renovated as modern office space. Google has research and technology 
offices in a refurbished 1918–1998 Nabisco factory, a complex known as 
Bakery Square.[93] Some of the factory's original equipment, such as a 
large dough mixer, were left standing in homage to the site's industrial 
roots.[94] Pittsburgh's transition from its industrial heritage has earned 
it praise as "the poster child for managing industrial transition".[95] 
Other major cities in the northeast and mid-west have increasingly borrowed 
from Pittsburgh's model in order to renew their industries and economic 
base.[96] Pittsburgh is the poster child for managing industrial transition. 
The largest employer in the city is the University of Pittsburgh Medical 
Center, with 48,000 employees. All hospitals, outpatient clinics, and doctor's 
office positions combine for 116,000 jobs, approximately 10% of the jobs 
in the region. An analyst recently observed of the city's medical sector: 
"That's both more jobs and a higher share of the region's total employment 
than the steel industry represented in the 1970s."[97] Area retail is anchored 
by over 35 shopping malls and a healthy downtown retail sector, as well 
as boutique shops along Walnut Street, in Squirrel Hill and Station Square. 
Education is another major industry in the region. The largest single employer 
in that industry is the University of Pittsburgh, with 10,700 employees.[99] 
Six Fortune 500 companies call the Pittsburgh area home. These include

Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra and Pittsburgh Opera, respectively as well 
as such groups as the River City Brass Band and the Pittsburgh Youth Symphony 
Orchestra. Pittsburgh has a long tradition of jazz, blues, and bluegrass 
music. The National Negro Opera Company was founded in the city as the 
first all African-American opera company in the United States. This led 
to the prominence of African-American singers like Leontyne Price in the 
world of opera. Pittsburgh has a number of small and mid-size arts organizations 
including the Pittsburgh Irish and Classical Theatre, Quantum Theatre, 
the Renaissance and Baroque Society of Pittsburgh, and the early music

blues guitarist George Benson has a Pittsburgh artist received such national 
acclaim. Perry Como and Christina Aguilera are from Pittsburgh suburbs. 
Hip hop artist Mac Miller's album Blue Slide Park debuted at the top of 
Billboard's album chart; its first #1 independent release since Dogg Food 
in 1995.[110] Many punk rock and Hardcore punk acts, such as Aus Rotten 
and Anti-Flag, originated in Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh is home to the world's 
largest furry convention known as Anthrocon, which has been held annually 
at the David L. Lawrence Convention Center since 2006. In 2013 Anthrocon

The city's first play was produced at the old courthouse in 1803[112] and 
the first theater built in 1812.[113] Collegiate companies include the 
University of Pittsburgh's Repertory Theatre and Kuntu Repertory Theatre,

needed] The city's longest-running theater show, Friday Nite Improvs, is 
an improv jam that has been performed in the Cathedral of Learning and 
other locations for 20 years. The Pittsburgh New Works Festival utilizes 
local theatre companies to stage productions of original one-act plays

Carnegie, Jennerstown, Trafford, and Greensburg, respectively, employ Pittsburgh 
actors and contribute to the culture of the region. Pittsburgh is the birthplace 
of Gertrude Stein and Rachel Carson, a Chatham University graduate from 
the suburb of Springdale, Pennsylvania.[114] Modern writers include Pulitzer 
Prize-winning playwright August Wilson and Michael Chabon with his Pittsburgh-focused 
commentary on student and college life. Two-time Pulitzer Prize winner 
and recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom, David McCullough was 
born and raised in Pittsburgh.[115] Annie Dillard, a Pulitzer Prize–winning 
writer, was born and raised in Pittsburgh. Much of her memoir An American 
Childhood takes place in post-World War II Pittsburgh. Poet Michael Simms, 
founder of Autumn House Press, currently resides in the Mount Washington 
neighborhood of Pittsburgh. Poet Samuel John Hazo, the first poet Laureate 
of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, also resides in the city. John Edgar 
Wideman grew up in Pittsburgh and based "Brothers and Keepers," a National 
Book Critics awarded novel in his hometown. New writers include Chris Kuzneski 
who attended the University of Pittsburgh and mentions Pittsburgh in his 
works and Pittsburgher Brian Celio, author of Catapult Soul who captured 
the Pittsburgh 'Yinzer' dialect in his writing. Pittsburgh's unique literary 
style extends to playwrights,[116] as well as local graffiti and hip hop 
artists. There are also specific Pittsburgh genres that have been adopted 
in globally, from children's television to sci-fi/fantasy to Yinzer Pittsburghese. 
Pittsburgh's position as the birthplace for community owned television 
and networked commercial television helped spawn the modern children's 
show genres exemplified by Mister Rogers' Neighborhood, Where in the World 
is Carmen Sandiego?, Happy's Party, Cappelli & Company, and The Children's 
Corner, all nationally broadcast. The Pittsburgh Dad series has showcased 
the Pittsburghese genre to a global YouTube audience since 2011. The modern 
fantasy, macabre and science fiction genre was popularized by director 
George A. Romero, television's Bill Cardille and his Chiller Theatre,[117] 
director and writer Rusty Cundieff[118] and makeup effects guru Tom Savini.[119] 
The genre continues today with the PARSEC writers organization,[120] The 
It's Alive Show, the annual "Zombie Fest",[121] and several writer's workshops 
including Write or Die,[122] Pittsburgh SouthWrites,[123] and Pittsburgh 
Worldwrights[124][125] with Barton Paul Levenson, Kenneth Chiacchia and 
Elizabeth Humphreys Penrose. The Pittsburgh English dialect, commonly called 
Pittsburghese, was influenced by Scots-Irish, Welsh, German, Central European, 
and Eastern European immigrants.[citation needed] Locals who speak the 
dialect are sometimes referred to as "Yinzers" (from the local word "yinz" 
[var. yunz], a blended form of "you ones," similar to "y'all" and "you 
all" in the South). Common Pittsburghese terms are: slippy (slippery), 
redd up (clean up), jagger bush (thorn bush), and gum bands (rubber bands). 
The dialect is also notable for dropping the verb "to be." In Pittsburghese 
one would say "the car needs washed" instead of "needs to be washed," "needs 
washing," or "needs a wash." The dialect has some tonal similarities to 
other nearby regional dialects of Erie and Baltimore, but is noted for 
its somewhat staccato rhythms. The staccato qualities of the dialect are 
thought to originate either from Welsh or other European languages. The 
many local peculiarities have prompted the New York Times to describe Pittsburgh 
as, "the Galapagos Islands of American dialect."[126] The lexicon itself 
contains notable loans from Polish and other European languages; examples 
include babushka, pierogi, and halušky.[127] Pittsburgh often places high 
in lists of the nation's most livable cities. After placing fourth and 
first in the first two editions of Places Rated Almanac, Pittsburgh finished 
third in 1989, fifth in 1993, 14th in 1997, and 12th in 2000, before reclaiming 
the number one spot in 2007.[128] The survey's primary author, David Savageau, 
has noted that Pittsburgh is the only city to finish in the top 20 of every 
edition. In 2005, 2009, and 2011, Pittsburgh was named the most livable 
city in the United States and in those years, between the 26th- and 29th-most 
livable cities worldwide by The Economist.[129][130] Pittsburgh ranked 
No. 28 in the book Cities Ranked and Rated (2004) by Bert Sperling and 
Peter Sander. In 2010, Forbes and Yahoo! listed Pittsburgh as the most 
livable city in the United States.[131][132] A month later, Forbes named 
Pittsburgh the 7th best place to raise a family.[133] Pittsburgh was ranked 
the 4th best city for working mothers by Forbes in 2010[134] and the city 
was ranked as one of the best for entrepreneurs by Entrepreneur.[135] Forbes 
named Pittsburgh, in an 8-way tie, the world's 10th cleanest city for 2007.[136] 
The Economist Intelligence Unit named Pittsburgh the top place to live 
in the United States in 2011,[137] and behind only Honolulu for 2012 and 
2014.[138][139] The city was listed among the 10 best U.S. places to retire 
in 2012 by CBS Money Watch and U.S. News.[140][141] In February 2013 Forbes 
again placed Pittsburgh among its 10 most unexpectedly romantic world locations.[142] 
In April 2014, Niche rated Pittsburgh the 15th best city for millennials.[143] 
Livability rankings typically consider factors such as cost of living, 
crime, and cultural opportunities. Pittsburgh has a low cost of living 
compared to other northeastern U.S. cities. According to the Federal Housing 
Board the average price for a 3- to 4-bedroom, 2-bath family home in Pittsburgh 
for 2004 is $162,000, well below the national average of $264,540. Average 
2010 rent for all bedrooms in Pittsburgh was $789. This compares to the 
nationwide average of $1,087.[144] Pittsburgh also has five city parks 
and several parks managed by the Nature Conservancy, the largest of which, 
Frick Park, provides a 664 acres (269 ha) of woodland park with extensive 
hiking and biking trails throughout steep valleys and wooded slopes. Birding 
enthusiasts love to visit Clayton Hill area of Frick Park, where well over 
100 species of birds have been recorded.[145] Enhancing Pittsburgh's livability 
is that the area faces little natural disaster risk such as an earthquake, 
hurricane, wildfire, or tornado. Forbes ranked Pittsburgh as having the 
2nd lowest natural disaster risk in the nation for 2009.[146] Greater Pittsburgh 
is not entirely free of natural disasters, however. Residents living in 
extremely low-lying areas near the rivers or one of the 1,400 creeks and 
streams experience occasional floods,[147] such as those caused when the 
remnants of Hurricane Ivan hit rainfall records in 2004.[148] River flooding 
is relatively rare due to federal flood control efforts extensively managing 
locks, dams, and reservoirs.[147][149][150] Residents living near smaller 
tributary streams are less protected from occasional flooding, and the 
cost of a comprehensive flood control program for the region has been estimated 
at a prohibitive $50 billion.[147] Pittsburgh has the most bars per capita 
in the nation.[9] Pittsburgh boasts several professional teams and in 2009 
the city has won the Sporting News title of "Best Sports City" in the United 
States.[151] and Sperling's Best Places "top 15 cities for baseball" in 
2013.[152] College sports also have large followings with the University 
of Pittsburgh in football and sharing Division I basketball fans with Robert 
Morris and Duquesne. Nearby Penn State and West Virginia University have 
sizable fanbases in the city. Pittsburgh's dedication to sports has a long 
history with its major professional sports teams—the Steelers of the National 
Football League, the Penguins of the National Hockey League, and the Pirates 
of Major League Baseball[153]—share the same team colors, the official 
city colors of black and gold. This tradition of solidarity is unique to 
Pittsburgh. The black-and-gold color scheme has since become widely associated 
with the city and personified in its famous Terrible Towel.[154] "Rails 
to Trails", has converted miles of former rail tracks to recreational trails, 
including a Pittsburgh-Washington D.C. bike/walking trail. Several mountain 
biking trails are located within the city and suburbs, Frick Park has biking 
trails and Hartwood Acres Park has many miles of single track trails.[citation

franchise are heirs to it only in location. [t]his is the perfect blend 
of location, history, design, comfort and baseball…The best stadium in 
baseball is in Pittsburgh. The Pittsburgh Pirates baseball team, often 
referred to as the Bucs or the Buccos (derived from buccaneer), is the 
city's oldest professional sports franchise having been founded in 1881, 
and plays in the Central Division of the National League. The Pirates are 
nine-time Pennant winners and five-time World Series Champions, were in 
the first World Series (1903) and claim two pre-World Series titles in 
1901 and 1902. The Pirates play in PNC Park, annually ranked as one of 
the sports best venues; ESPN.com stated: "[t]his is the perfect blend of 
location, history, design, comfort and baseball…The best stadium in baseball 
is in Pittsburgh."[155] PNC Park hosted the team's MLB record-tying fifth 
All-Star game in 2006. Pittsburgh also has a rich Negro League history, 
with the former Pittsburgh Crawfords and the Homestead Grays credited with 
as many as 14 league titles and 11 Hall of Famers between them in the 1930s 
and 1940s, while the Keystones fielded teams in the 1920s. In addition, 
in 1971 the Pirates were the first Major League team to field an all-minority 
lineup. One sportswriter claimed, "No city is more synonymous with black 
baseball than Pittsburgh."[156] Since the late 20th century, the Pirates 
had three consecutive National League Championship Series appearances (1990–92) 
(going 6, 7 and 7 games each), followed by setting the MLB record for most 
consecutive losing seasons, with 20 from 1993 until 2012. This era was 
followed by their 2013 National League Division Series and 2014 Wild Card 
appearances. Their September pennant race in 1997 featured the franchises' 
last no-hitter and last award for Sporting News' Executive of the Year.[157] 
Football is the most popular and tradition laden sport in the region with 
the nation's first professional game being played in the city on November 
12, 1892, between the Allegheny Athletic Association and the Pittsburgh 
Athletic Club, the first pro-team in nearby Latrobe and first organized 
league, the NFL and their inaugural champions: the Pittsburgh Stars. High 
school football routinely attract 10,000 fans per game and extensive press 
coverage. The Tom Cruise film All the Right Moves and ESPN's Bound for 
Glory with Dick Butkus both filmed in the area to capture the tradition 
and passion high school football enjoys in the region. College football 
in the city dates to 1889 with the Division I (FBS) Panthers of the University 
of Pittsburgh posting nine national championships and recently qualifying 
for seven straight bowl games for 31 total. Local universities Duquesne 
and Robert Morris have loyal fan bases that follow their lower (FCS) teams. 
Duquesne, Carnegie Mellon University, and Washington & Jefferson College 
all posted major bowl games and AP Poll rankings from the 1920s to the 
1940s as that era's equivalent of Top 25 FBS programs. The city's most 
popular team is the NFL's Pittsburgh Steelers, named after the distribution 
company the Pittsburgh Steeling company established in 1927. News of the 
team has preempted news of elections and other events and are more than 
a sports team to the region and its diaspora. The Steelers have been owned 
by the Rooney family since the team's founding in 1933, show consistency 
in coaching (only three coaches since the 1960s all with the same basic 
philosophy) and are noted as one of sports' most respectable franchises. 
The Steelers have a long waiting list for season tickets, and have sold 
out every home game since 1972.[158] The team won four Super Bowls in a 
six-year span in the 1970s, a fifth Super Bowl in 2006, and a league record 
sixth Super Bowl in 2009. Since the AFL-NFL merger in 1970 they have qualified 
for the most NFL playoff berths (28) and have played in (15) and hosted 
(11) the most NFL conference championship games. Heinz Field serves as 
home for the Steelers, Panthers, and both the suburban and city high school 
championships. Playoff franchises Pittsburgh Power and Pittsburgh Gladiators 
competed in the Arena Football League in the 1980s and 2010s respectively. 
The Gladiators hosted ArenaBowl I in the city, competing in two total, 
but losing both before moving to Tampa, Florida and becoming the Storm.[159] 
The Pittsburgh Passion has been the city's professional women's football 
team since 2002 and plays its home games at Highmark Stadium. The Ed Debartolo 
owned Pittsburgh Maulers featured a Heisman Trophy winner in the mid-1980s, 
former superstar University of Nebraska running back Mike Rozier. The NHL's 
Pittsburgh Penguins have played in Pittsburgh since the team's founding 
in 1967. The team has won 5 Eastern Conference titles (1991, 1992, 2008, 
2009, and 2016) and 4 Stanley Cup championships (1991, 1992, 2009, and 
2016) as of the 2015/2016 season. Since 1999, Hall of Famer and back-to-back 
playoff MVP Mario Lemieux has served as Penguins owner. Until moving into 
the PPG Paints Arena in 2010 (when it known as Consol Energy Center), the 
team played their home games at the world's first retractable domed stadium, 
the Civic Arena, or in local parlance "The Igloo".[160] Ice hockey has 
had a regional fan base since the 1890s semi-pro Keystones. The city's 
first ice rink dates back to 1889, when there was an ice rink at the Casino 
in Schenley Park. From 1896 to 1956, the Exposition Building on the Allegheny 
River near The Point and Duquesne Gardens in Oakland offered indoor skating.[161] 
The NHL awarded one of its first franchises to the city in 1924 on the 
strength of the back-to-back USAHA championship winning Pittsburgh Yellow 
Jackets featuring future Hall of Famers and a Stanley Cup winning coach. 
The NHL's Pittsburgh Pirates made several Stanley Cup playoff runs with 
a future Hall of Famer before folding from Great Depression financial pressures. 
Hockey survived with the Pittsburgh Hornets farm team (1936–1967) and their 
seven finals appearances and three championships in 18 playoff seasons; 
all in an "original six" NHL era with "farm team" talent (especially Calder 
Cup champions) exceeding the level on most modern day NHL playoff teams.[citation 
needed] Robert Morris University fields a Division I college hockey team 
at the Island Sports Center. Like 100 years ago, Pittsburgh is again a 
hotbed for semi-pro and amateur teams such as the top 50 ranked Junior 
Penguins, Predators and Viper Stars with the Hornets a top 20 team for 
the last 7 years. Pro-grade ice rinks such as the Rostraver Ice Garden 
and Iceoplex at Southpointe have trained several native Pittsburgh players 
for NHL play. RMU hosted the city's first Frozen Four college championship 
in 2013 with the four PPG Paints Arena games televised by ESPN. Professional 
basketball in Pittsburgh dates to the 1910s with teams "Monticello" and 
"Loendi" winning five national titles, the Pirates (1937–45 in the NBL), 
the Pittsburgh Ironmen (1947–48 NBA inaugural season), the Pittsburgh Rens 
(1961–63), the Pittsburgh Condors (first American Basketball Association 
championship in 1968 and playing until 1972), the Pittsburgh Piranhas (CBA 
Finals in 1995), the Pittsburgh Xplosion (2004–08) and Phantoms (2009–10) 
both of the ABA. The city has hosted dozens of pre-season and 15 regular 
season "neutral site" NBA games, including Wilt Chamberlain's record setting 
performance in both consecutive field goals and field goal percentage on 
February 24, 1967, NBA records that still stand.[162] The Duquesne University 
Dukes and the University of Pittsburgh Panthers have played college basketball 
in the city since 1914 and 1905 respectively. Pitt and Duquesne have played 
the annual City Game since 1932. Duquesne was the city's first team to 
appear in a Final Four (1940), obtain a number one AP Poll ranking (1954),[163] 
and to win a post-season national title, the 1955 National Invitation Tournament 
on its second straight trip to the NIT title game. Duquesne is the only 
college program to produce back-to-back NBA #1 overall draft picks with 
1955's Dick Ricketts and 1956's Sihugo Green.[citation needed] Duquesne's 
Chuck Cooper was the first African American drafted by an NBA team.[164] 
The Panthers won two pre-tournament era Helms Athletic Foundation National 
Championships in 1928 and 1930, competed in a "national title game" against 
LSU in 1935, and made a Final Four appearance in 1941. Pitt has won 13 
conference titles, qualified for the NCAA tournament 25 times including 
a post season tournament every season since 1999–2000 and regularly sells 
out the Petersen Events Center. The program has produced 27 NBA draft picks 
and 15 All Americans while ranking #1 in the nation as recently as 2009. 
The suburban Robert Morris University's Colonials have competed in NCAA 
Division I basketball since the 1970s, qualifying for the NCAA tournament 
in each of the last four decades (8 total). In the 2013 National Invitation 
Tournament the Colonials notched an upset win over the defending national 
champions Kentucky Wildcats. Pittsburgh Panthers women's basketball has 
qualified for 14 post season tournaments (including 4 NCAA tournaments) 
and boasts of 5 All-Americans selected 6 times with 3 WNBA players. Pitt 
women began play in 1914 before being reintroduced in 1970. Both Duquesne 
and Robert Morris also have competitive Division I women's basketball programs. 
Pittsburgh launched the nation's first high school all-star game in 1965.[citation 
needed] The Roundball Classic annually featured future NBA hall of famers 
at the Civic Arena with ESPN televising. The Civic Arena also hosted the 
Championship Tournament for the Eastern Eight Conference from 1978 until 
1982. Golf has deep roots in the area. The oldest U.S. course in continuous 
use, Foxburg Country Club dating from 1887 calls the region home. Suburban 
Oakmont Country Club holds the record for most times as host for the U.S. 
Open (8). U.S. Women's Open (2), PGA Championships (3), and U.S. Amateurs 
(8) have also called Oakmont home. Golf legends Arnold Palmer, Jim Furyk, 
and Rocco Mediate learned the game and began their careers on Pittsburgh 
area courses. Suburban courses such as Laurel Valley Golf Club and the 
Fox Chapel Golf Club have hosted PGA Championships (1937, 1965), the Ryder 
Cup (1975), LPGA Championships (1957–58), Senior Players Championships 
(2012–14), and the Senior PGA Championship (2005). Local courses have sponsored 
annual major tournaments for 40 years: Pittsburgh hosts several annual 
major sporting events initiated in the late 20th century, including the: 
The city's vibrant rivers have attracted annual world-title fishing competitions 
of the Forrest Wood Cup in 2009 and the Bassmaster Classic in 2005. Annual 
events continue during the winter months at area ski resorts such as Boyce 
Park, Seven Springs, Hidden Valley Resort, Laurel Mountain, and Wisp. Ice 
skating rinks are enjoyed at PPG Place and North Park. The Government of 
Pittsburgh is composed of the Mayor of Pittsburgh, the Pittsburgh City 
Council, and various boards and commissions. The mayor and the nine-member 
council serve a four-year term. Since the 1950s the Mayor's Chief of Staff 
has assumed a large role in advising, long term planning, and as a "gatekeeper" 
to the mayor. City council members are chosen by plurality elections in 
each of nine districts. The government's official offices are located in 
the Pittsburgh City-County Building. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court holds 
sessions in Pittsburgh, as well as Harrisburg and Philadelphia. Pittsburgh 
is represented in the Pennsylvania General Assembly by three Senate Districts 
and nine House Districts. Federally, Pittsburgh is part of Pennsylvania's 
14th congressional district. In 2006, Council President Luke Ravenstahl 
was sworn in as mayor at age 26, becoming the youngest mayor in the history 
of any major American city. His successor, Bill Peduto, was sworn in January 
6, 2014. Current Pittsburgh City Council members are: Darlene Harris, Theresa 
Kail-Smith, Natalia Rudiak, Cory O'Conner, R. Daniel Lavelle, Deborah Gross, 
Dan Gilman, and Rev. Ricky Burgess. They are elected from single-member 
districts.[165] The president of city council is Bruce Kraus. Prior to 
the American Civil War, Pittsburgh was strongly abolitionist. It is considered 
the birthplace of the national Republican Party, as the party held its 
first convention here in February 1856. From the Civil War to the 1930s, 
Pittsburgh was a Republican stronghold. The effects of the Great Depression, 
combined with entrenched local GOP scandals, resulted in a shift among 
voters to the Democratic Party. With the exceptions of the 1973 and 1977 
elections (where lifelong Democrats ran off the party ticket), Democrats

Bureau of Police, with close to 1,000 sworn officers. The city also has 
separate housing and school police departments. Other agencies also provide 
police protection within the city because of overlapping jurisdictional 
boundaries. The Allegheny County Sheriff focuses on jail and courthouse 
security. The Allegheny County Police primarily patrols county-owned parks 
and airports, while providing detective/investigatory functions for smaller 
suburbs and the Port Authority police patrols rapid transit. Pennsylvania 
State Police Troop B provides patrols for the city and immediate suburbs. 
The county's lead law enforcement officer is Allegheny County District 
Attorney Stephen Zappala while the Allegheny County Medical Examiner heads 
forensics. Crimes of a federal nature are covered by the U.S. Attorney 
for Western Pennsylvania. Pittsburgh annually ranks as one of America's 
safest big cities, recently being named the 3rd "most secure" big city 
by Farmers Insurance.[167] Among crime rates of the 60 largest U.S. cities, 
43 had more instances of property crime while 16 had less when compared 
to Pittsburgh. More instances of violent crime were reported in 21 of the 
largest cities while 37 had less. The FBI recommends against using data 
for ranking.[168][169] Per 100,000 persons stats (2012): Pittsburgh is

the 2006 passage of the Pennsylvania Film Production Tax Credit.[180] According 
to the Pittsburgh Film Office, over 124 major motion pictures have been 
filmed, in whole or in part, in Pittsburgh, including The Mothman Prophecies, 
Wonder Boys,[181] Dogma,[181] Hoffa, The Silence of the Lambs,[181] Flashdance,[181] 
Southpaw, Striking Distance, Mrs. Soffel, Jack Reacher, Inspector Gadget, 
The Next Three Days, The Perks of Being a Wallflower,[181] and Zack and 
Miri Make a Porno. Pittsburgh became "Gotham City" in 2011 during filming 
of The Dark Knight Rises.[104] George A. Romero has shot nearly all his 
films in the area, including his Living Dead series. The city is served 
by Duquesne Light, one of the original 1912 power companies founded by 
George Westinghouse. Water service is provided by the Pittsburgh Water 
and Sewer Authority[182] and Pennsylvania American Water. Natural gas is 
provided by Equitable Gas, Columbia Gas, Dominion Resources, Direct Energy, 
and Novec.[183] The two largest area health care providers are the world-renowned 
University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) (since 1893) and Allegheny 
Health Network (since 1882). Both flagship hospitals annually rank as among 
the best overall in the United States, with UPMC being among U.S. News 
and World Report's "Honor Roll" every year since 2000. The first military 
hospital in U.S. history as well as the first west of the Atlantic Plain—General 
Edward Hand Hospital—served the area from 1777 to 1845.[184] Since 1847, 
Pittsburgh has hosted the world's first "Mercy Hospital".[185] This was 
followed by West Penn hospital in 1848, Passavant Hospital in 1849,[186] 
the University of Pittsburgh Medical School in 1883, Children's Hospital 
in 1887, and Magee Womens Hospital in 1911. In 1954, Allegheny General 
(AGH) was among the first to administer Cobalt therapy.[187] In 1980, UPMC 
announced a $250 million ($816 million today) expansion and also hired 
transplant pioneer Dr. Thomas Starzl.[188] In 1984, Allegheny General surgeons 
pioneered modern brain surgery. Dr. Starzl arranged the 1985 liver transplant 
of 5 year old Amie Garrison as a UPMC surgery team flew to Baylor University, 
starting its transplant program.[189] Also in 1985, UPMC surgeons Drs. 
Griffith, Hardesty, and Trento revealed a new device after a heart-lung 
transplant. In 1986, UPMC announced a $230 million ($497 million today) 
modernization. In 1996, UPMC's planned Sicily ISMETT branch was approved 
by the Italian government as transplant surgeons to supervise and deliver 
the world's third (both earlier ones done at UPMC)--and first public—cross 
species marrow transplant at University of California, San Francisco.[190] 
UPMC's Thomas Detre founded the International Society for Bipolar Disorders 
at a world medical conference in Pittsburgh in 1999.[191] The $80 million 
($110 million today) UPMC Sports Performance Complex for the Pittsburgh 
Panthers & Pittsburgh Steelers opened in 2000. In 2002, AGH opened its 
$30 million ($40.2 million today), 5 floor, 100,000 sq. ft., cancer center. 
The $130 million ($171 million today) 350,000 sq. ft. Hillman Cancer Center 
opened in 2003 as UPMC entered into an 8-year, $420 million ($527 million 
today) agreement with IBM to upgrade medical technologies & health information 
systems. In 2009, the $600 million ($661 million today) Children's Hospital 
of Pittsburgh of UPMC opened. The campus was featured in world news in 
2012 for several unique approaches to patient care.[192] UPMC officially 
adopted in Erie, Pennsylvania's Hamot Medical Center in 2010. The Pittsburgh 
Penguins announced a state of the art training facility with UPMC in 2012.[193] 
UPMC announced in 2013 that it had partnered with Nazarbayev University 
to help found its medical school.[194] Many notable physicians have made 
major world discoveries and innovations at area hospitals including polio 
vaccine developer Jonas Salk, MRI inventor Paul Lauterbur, pediatric psychoanalyst 
Benjamin Spock, CPR and intensive care unit pioneer Peter Safar, surgeon 
Thomas Starzl who perfected organ transplantation, pathologist Maud Menten 
who made enzyme kinetics discoveries, orthopedic surgeon and sports medicine 
expert Freddie Fu, pioneering immunologist Niels Kaj Jerne, forensic pathologist 
Cyril Wecht, Vitamin C's discoverer Charles Glen King, pediatrician Jack 
Paradise, head and neck cancer surgeon/otolaryngologist Eugene Nicholas 
Myers, laparoscopic liver resection pioneer David Geller, virologists Patrick 
S. Moore and Yuan Chang, who co-discovered Kaposi's sarcoma-associated 
herpesvirus and breast cancer treatment pioneer Bernard Fisher. UPMC has 
pioneered several world firsts including the first known cystic fibrosis 
heart-lung transplant (1983), the world's first simultaneous liver and 
heart transplant operation on a child (6-year-old Stormie Jones in 1984), 
the youngest heart-lung transplant (9 years old in 1985), the world's first 
heart-liver-kidney transplant (1989),[195] the world's first heart-liver 
transplant on an infant (1997),[196] the first pediatric heart-double lung-liver 
transplant (1998), the nation's first double hand transplant (2009), and 
the first total forearm and hand transplant (2010), as well as the state's 
first heart transplant (1968).[197][198] The Lancet published a 2012 UPMC 
study of two 9 year quadriplegics being able to move a robotic arm by thought, 
to pick up objects, shake hands, and even eat. Wiring the brain around 
spine damage to restore arm and leg muscle function was successful using 
robotic arms controlled via an embedded computer to translate signals near 
a small group of neurons with 200 needles.[199] Several notable patients 
have chosen to be treated at the city's hospitals including Indonesian 
President Yudhoyono (2012), Steelers founder Art Rooney (1988),[200][201] 
MCI Communications founder William G. McGowan (who in 1990 gifted $1 million 
($1.91 million today) to UPMC),[202] a Saudi princess (1983),[203] Rob 
Buck (2000),[204] Bob Prince (1985),[205] William Block, publisher of the 
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette (2005),[206] PGA golfer David Toms (2005),[207] 
ESPN broadcaster Stuart Scott (2007),[208] 2 1/2 old Lauren Toohey for 
a liver transplant (1981),[209] Miami 7 year old Ronnie DeSillers for a 
liver transplant (1987),[210] 9 year old Tabatha Foster for an innovative 
transplant surgery that had President Ronald Reagan commending the city's 
hospitals and urging donations to Tabatha's recovery in 1988.[211] In 1997, 
a Tennessee judge denied James Earl Ray's request for a UPMC liver transplant.[212] 
Both Governors Tom Corbett (2011) and Robert P. Casey (1993), months before 
his presidential bid were treated at AGH and UPMC respectively. Pittsburgh 
is a city of bridges. With a total of 446,[213] it has three bridges more 
than Venice, Italy, which has historically held the title "City of Bridges."[214] 
Around 40 bridges cross the three rivers near the city. The Smithfield 
Street Bridge was the world's first lenticular truss bridge. The city's 
Three Sisters Bridges offer a picturesque view of the city from the North. 
The south-western "entrance" to Downtown for travelers coming in from Interstate 
79 and the Pittsburgh International Airport is through the Fort Pitt Tunnel 
and over the Fort Pitt Bridge. The Fort Duquesne Bridge carrying Interstate 
279 is the main gateway from Downtown to both PNC Park, Heinz Field and 
the Rivers Casino. The Panhandle Bridge carries the Port Authority's Blue/Red/Brown 
subway lines across the Monongahela River. The renovated J&L Steel Company 
bridge has been a key traffic/running-biking trail conduit connecting the 
Southside Works and Pittsburgh Technology Center. Over 2,000 bridges span 
the landscape of Allegheny County.[215] Pittsburgh's rail industry dates 
to 1851 when the Pennsylvania Railroad first opened service between the 
city and Philadelphia, the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad entered the city in 
1871. In 1865 Andrew Carnegie opened the Pittsburgh Locomotive and Car 
Works which manufactured for the industry until 1919. Carnegie also founded 
the Union Railroad in 1894 for heavy freight services and it still serves 
the area's steel industry, while George Westinghouse's Wabtec has been 
a leader in rail engines and switching since 1869. Pittsburgh is home to 
one of Norfolk Southern Railway's busiest freight corridors, the Pittsburgh 
Line, and operates up to 70 trains per day through the city. The suburban 
Conway Rail Yard—originally built in 1889—was the largest freight rail 
center in the world from 1956 until 1980 and is today the nation's second-largest. 
CSX, the other major freight railroad in the eastern U.S. also has major 
operations around Pittsburgh. Amtrak provides intercity rail service via 
the Capitol Limited and the Pennsylvanian which use Penn Station. The Port 
of Pittsburgh ranks as the 21st-largest port in the United States with 
almost 34 million short tons of river cargo for 2011, the port ranked 9th-largest 
in the U.S. when measured in domestic trade.[216] Locals refer to the interstates 
fanning out from downtown Pittsburgh as the "parkways." Interstate 376 
is both the "parkway east" connecting to Interstate 76 (Pennsylvania Turnpike) 
and the "parkway west" connecting to Interstate 79, the Pittsburgh International 
Airport, the Ohio end of the Turnpike and Interstate 80. The "parkway north" 
is Interstate 279 connecting to I-79. The "crosstown" is Interstate 579 
allowing access to the heart of downtown, the Liberty Tunnels and the PPG 
Paints Arena. The 45 mile long and 70 mile long expressway sections of 
Pennsylvania Route 28 and U.S. Route 22 also carry traffic from downtown 
to the northeast and western suburbs, respectively. Interstate 70, 79 and 
76 (the Turnpike) roughly form a triangular-shaped "beltway" with Interstate 
68 and 80 within the media market's northern and southern limits. Turnpike 
spurs such as the Mon–Fayette Expressway, Pennsylvania Route 576 and Route 
66 also help traffic flow. The non-expressway Pittsburgh/Allegheny County 
Belt System serves navigation in the region. Pittsburgh International Airport 
and Arnold Palmer Regional Airport provide commercial passenger service 
to the metropolitan area. Port Authority of Allegheny County, commonly 
known as the Port Authority, but sometimes referred to by its former nickname 
"PAT" or "PAT Transit", is the region's mass transit system. While serving 
only a portion of the Pittsburgh area (the nation's 20th largest metro 
area), it is the 11th largest transit agency in the nation and helped the 
region rank 8th on commuters that use non-car means to work, second to 
only Chicago in metros outside the Northeast corridor.[217] Port Authority 
runs a network of intracity and intercity bus routes, the Monongahela Incline 
funicular railway (more commonly known as an "incline") on Mount Washington, 
a light rail system that runs mostly above-ground in the suburbs and underground 
as a subway in the city, and one of the nation's largest busway systems.[218] 
The Duquesne Incline is operated by a non-profit preservation trust,[219] 
but accepts Port Authority passes and charges Port Authority fares. Since 
2007, the Port Authority cut annual expenses by $52 million and raised 
revenues by $14 million to help alleviate a $472 million gap in the state 
transportation budget.[220][221] Pittsburgh has 21 sister cities:[222]
