The 1966 St. Louis Cardinals season was the team's 85th season in St. Louis, 
Missouri and its 75th season in the National League. The Cardinals went 
83–79 during the season and finished sixth in the National League, 12 games 
behind the Los Angeles Dodgers. This season marked the final time the Cardinals 
played in Sportsman's Park/Busch Stadium I, as they played their final 
home game at that ballpark on May 8, losing to the San Francisco Giants, 
10–5. Busch sought to replace the increasingly inadequate Busch Stadium 
(formerly Sportsman's Park) with a modern facility in a better location. 
The result was a new multi-purpose, $25 million concrete stadium, also 
named for Busch's father – Busch Memorial Stadium, also known as Busch 
II. The Cardinals moved into Busch II four days later, and defeated the 
Atlanta Braves, 4–3 in 12 innings. On July 12, the Cardinals hosted the 
1966 Major League Baseball All-Star Game at their new stadium, in 105 degree 
heat and humidity, with the NL defeating the AL, 2–1 in ten innings. Busch 
Memorial Stadium was where the Cardinals would play baseball until the 
end of 2005. Later derided as a facsimile of the bland, cookie-cutter "multi-purpose 
stadia" built in multiple locations of the United States in the 1960s, 
Busch Memorial achieved a measure of popularity among St. Louis fans in 
a way that its cousins in Philadelphia, Atlanta, Pittsburgh, and Cincinnati 
did not, perhaps due in part to the success of the teams which played there, 
and perhaps also due to the distinctive roof arches added by architect 
Edward Durrell Stone — unique touches meant to echo the city's new iconic 
monument (completed at nearly the same time), the Gateway Arch. Pitcher 
Bob Gibson and outfielder Curt Flood won Gold Gloves this year. Infielders
