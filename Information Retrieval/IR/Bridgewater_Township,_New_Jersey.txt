Bridgewater Township is a township in Somerset County, New Jersey, United 
States. As of the 2010 United States Census, the township's population 
was 44,464,[9][10][11] reflecting an increase of 1,524 (+3.5%) from the 
42,940 counted in the 2000 Census, which had in turn increased by 10,431 
(+32.1%) from the 32,509 counted in the 1990 Census.[20] Bridgewater Township 
was originally created by Royal charter on April 4, 1749, from portions 
of the Northern precinct. It was incorporated as one of New Jersey's initial 
group of 104 townships by the New Jersey Legislature on February 21, 1798, 
under the Township Act of 1798. During the nineteenth century, portions 
of the township were taken to form Warren Township (March 5, 1806), Branchburg 
Township (April 5, 1845), Somerville (March 25, 1863), Raritan (April 3, 
1868) and Bound Brook (March 24, 1869).[21] Bridgewater is a relatively 
large, suburban township located in the center of Somerset County. The 
area of the present Township of Bridgewater was originally purchased from 
a local Lenape Native American tribe. Bridgewater was chartered by George 
II of Great Britain in 1749, and incorporated on February 21, 1798, as 
one of New Jersey's 104 original townships.[21] It is named after the town 
of Bridgwater in the English county of Somerset.[22] Tradition holds that 
it was at the Middlebrook encampment that the first official flag of the 
United States was unfurled, after a law to adopt a national flag had been 
passed by Congress on June 14, 1777. By special order of Congress, a Thirteen 
Star Flag is flown 24 hours a day at the Washington Camp Ground, part of 
the former Middlebrook encampment, in Bridgewater. Since 1889, the first 
hoisting of the flag is commemorated annually each July 4 with a changing 
of the flag, a reading of the Declaration of Independence, and the delivery 
of an historical address.[23] Until the 1960s, Bridgewater was largely 
known as a farming community. In the 1970s its population began to grow 
when residents of larger cities such as Plainfield and Newark started to 
migrate into Bridgewater as a result of the 1967 Plainfield Riots and 1967 
Newark riots. Subsequently, Bridgewater started to receive an influx of 
residents who worked in the strong pharmaceutical, telecommunications and 
financial industries in Bridgewater and the Raritan Valley. More recently, 
there has also been growth as Bridgewater has become more popular with 
New York City commuters who use Bridgewater Station on New Jersey Transit's 
Raritan Valley Line or Interstate 78 East to commute to New York City. 
Bridgewater is now a fairly developed suburban community, with only a few 
traces of its rural past still evident in the town (particularly in its 
northwestern section). Bridgewater is now Somerset County's second-most 
populous municipality, after Franklin Township. According to the United 
States Census Bureau, the township had a total area of 32.510 square miles 
(84.200 km2), including 32.037 square miles (82.974 km2) of land and 0.473 
square miles (1.226 km2) of water (1.46%).[1][2] While much of Bridgewater 
has relatively flat terrain, the northeastern portion of the township is 
very hilly, with the First Ridge of the Watchung Mountains (sometimes known 
as the First Watchung Mountain) passing through the township. Additionally 
the Second Ridge (Second Mountain) passes just north of the township border. 
The Raritan River and its branches and tributaries form much of Bridgewater's 
borders with other municipalities and a number of smaller rivers and streams 
run through Bridgewater. The Raritan itself runs along Bridgewater's southern 
border (except where Somerville and Raritan were carved out as separate 
boroughs) and the North Branch of the Raritan River forms the township's 
western border with Branchburg. The North Branch and South Branch of the 
Raritan River meet at the extreme southwestern corner of Bridgewater at 
the border with both Branchburg Township and Hillsborough Township, and 
this point known as the Raritan River Confluence was once intended to be 
a major reservoir. Bradley Gardens (with a 2010 Census population of 14,206[24]), 
Finderne (5,600[25]), Green Knoll (6,200[26]) and Martinsville (11,980[27]) 
are census-designated places and unincorporated communities located within 
Bridgewater Township.[28][29][30] Other unincorporated communities, localities 
and place names located partially or completely within the township include 
Chimney Rock, Middle Brook Heights, Milltown and Sunset Lake.[31] Bridgewater 
borders 13 other municipalities. Its longest borders are with Branchburg 
Township, Bedminster Township, Bernards Township, Warren Township, Bound 
Brook, Somerville and Raritan. It also borders Green Brook (though connected 
only by Route 22), Middlesex (though connected only by one local street), 
South Bound Brook (a very short border in the middle of the Raritan River), 
Franklin Township (the only street connection is Interstate 287), Manville 
(the only street connection is Finderne Avenue, a county highway), and 
Hillsborough Township (no direct street connection).[32] Bridgewater Township's 
ZIP Code is 08807, with 08836 used in the community of Martinsville, and 
08805 used in the Thomae Park section (mailing address of Bound Brook). 
Bridgewater's area codes are 908 and 732/848. Bridgewater is in Raritan 
Valley (a line of cities in Central New Jersey). Bridgewater lies in the 
western division of the Raritan Valley along with Branchburg and Raritan. 
Bridgewater contains a number of communities and sections, many of which 
do not have officially defined boundaries. They include: According to National 
Geographic magazine, Bridgewater has an unusually high number of twins 
and triplets.[45] At the 2010 United States Census, there were 44,464 people,

majority of students in the district are from Bridgewater, with approximately 
1,000 students from Raritan. All schools in the district are in Bridgewater 
except for Kennedy, which is in Raritan. Schools in the district (with

the highest award an American school can receive from the federal government.[110][111] 
Bridgewater is the home of the Somerset County Vocational and Technical 
High School, a four-year magnet school that provides occupational and academic 
training to students from Somerset County.[112] Little Friends of Jesus 
Nursery School (preschool, non-parochial) operates under the supervision 
of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Metuchen.[113][114] The headquarters of 
the Somerset County Library System is located in Bridgewater.[115] As of 
May 2010[update], the township had a total of 239.75 miles (385.84 km) 
of roadways, of which 189.03 miles (304.21 km) were maintained by the municipality, 
23.49 miles (37.80 km) by Somerset County and 27.23 miles (43.82 km) by 
the New Jersey Department of Transportation.[116] Bridgewater is crisscrossed 
by several major highways, including Interstate 287, Interstate 78, U.S. 
22, Route 202-206 and Route 28. The Raritan Valley Line of NJ Transit provides 
service at the Bridgewater station, located on the old American Cyanamid 
property.[117] NJ Transit ended service at the Finderne station, off Finderne 
Avenue, in October 2006.[118] NJ Transit bus service is provided on the 
114 route to the Port Authority Bus Terminal in Midtown Manhattan, to Newark 
on the 65 line (Limited) and local Wheels service on the 884 and 989 bus 
routes.[119] Bridgewater Township is serviced by three local airports, 
Solberg-Hunterdon Airport to the west in Readington, Somerset Airport to 
the north in Bedminster Township, and Central Jersey Regional Airport to 
the south in Manville. These airports are open to the public and offer 
charter flight services as well as flight training and other aviation related 
services. They operate in all weather conditions and have instrument approaches 
available for use by pilots in bad weather. Scheduled commercial passenger 
service is provided by Morristown Airport, located approximately 17 miles 
(27 km) away in Morristown. The township's Communications Center handles 
all emergency calls with 11 full-time dispatchers and five part-time dispatchers.[120] 
The Bridgewater emergency dispatch is being transitioned to Somerset County 
at an unknown time frame, joining nine other county municipalities that 
have emergency calls handled centrally and dispatched to each individual 
police department. The move is expected to save the township $4.5 million 
over 10 years, saving $4.50 on the average tax bill.[121] Bridgewater has 
75 officers who are a part of the Bridgewater Township Police Department, 
which includes a patrol division, a detective bureau, a traffic unit, a 
communications bureau, a youth services bureau and other divisions.[122] 
Bridgewater has six all-volunteer fire companies, which provide fire suppression 
and assist in vehicle extrication and rescue attempts:[123] Bridgewater 
is served by five volunteer BLS rescue squads, which provide EMS coverage 
as well as vehicle extrication, water rescue, and other rescue services. 
ALS (paramedics) are dispatched from Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital 
- Somerset. During daytime hours, RWJ - Somerset also provides Basic Life 
Support coverage for a portion of the township.[123] In August 2011, Hurricane 
Irene submerged the former American Cyanamid Superfund site, causing chemicals 
to leak into the nearby Raritan River. It could cost Pfizer up to $205 
million and take a decade to clean up nearly all of the contaminated American 
Cyanamid site in Bridgewater—of which 560 acres (230 ha) are in the township 
and 10 acres (4.0 ha) are in Bound Brook—according to a company study awaiting 
federal approval.[136][137] In early 2011, application was made to turn 
the former inn/reception center, the Redwood Inn, into a mosque, the town's 
first.[138] The township council passed an ordinance that required houses 
of worship, country clubs and other such businesses only be built on locations 
with access to major roads, which would directly impact the application 
by the mosque.[139] The planning board then immediately dismissed the application, 
averting state statute that would become effective on May 5 that would 
have made rejection much more difficult. The applicant, Al Falah Center, 
then filed a lawsuit against the township.[140] In December 2014, the case 
was settled out of court, with the township agreeing to purchase a 15-acre 
(6.1 ha) lot between Routes 202-206 and Route 287 for $2.75 million and 
give it to the organization to build a mosque, as well as provide $5 million 
paid by its insurer for reimbursement for legal fees and alleged damages. 
In return, the case was dropped and the township was given ownership of 
the original Mountaintop Road property, with the zoning ordinance law left 
intact.[141] People who were born in, residents of, or otherwise closely
