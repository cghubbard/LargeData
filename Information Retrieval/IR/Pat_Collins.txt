Tharon Leslie "Pat" Collins (September 13, 1896 – May 20, 1960) was an 
American baseball catcher who played ten seasons in Major League Baseball 
(MLB). He played for the St. Louis Browns, New York Yankees and Boston 
Braves from 1919 to 1929. He batted and threw right-handed and also played 
five games at first base. Collins played minor league baseball for the 
Joplin Miners until 1919, when he signed with the St. Louis Browns. After 
spending six seasons with the organization, Collins spent a one-year sojourn 
in the minor leagues before he was traded to the New York Yankees, where 
he spent the next three years and played in the famous 1927 Murderers' 
Row lineup. At the conclusion of the 1928 season, he was traded to the 
Boston Braves, with whom he played his last game on May 23, 1929. A two-time 
World Series champion, he is famous for being the only major league player 
to pinch hit and pinch run in the same game. Collins was born on September 
13, 1896 in Sweet Springs, Missouri.[1] His mother, Sarah, ran a boarding 
house, and he had three siblings: Ola, Mildred, and Rathal.[2] He attended 
school in Sweet Springs before moving to Kansas City, Kansas to play sandlot 
ball.[3] He was married to Daisy C. Collins.[4] During his time with the 
Yankees, his teammate Babe Ruth—who usually called everyone "Kid" due to 
his inability to remember people's names—mockingly gave Collins the nickname 
"Horse Nose".[5] After his major league career ended, he went on to run 
a restaurant in Kansas City,[6] then operate a tavern in Lawrence, Kansas 
until 1952.[7] In April 1952, the state of Kansas took Collins to court 
over alleged unpaid federal income tax from 1945 to 1950.[7] Although he 
was convicted in December of evading $4,037, a federal judge ordered a 
new trial after evidence emerged showing his friend had deposited $48,300 
in a safety deposit box for him.[8][9] After being treated for a heart 
condition,[4] Collins died in his sleep on May 20, 1960 in Kansas City 
at the age of 63 and was interred at the city's Memorial Park Cemetery.[1][3] 
Collins began his professional baseball career in 1917 with the Joplin 
Miners, a minor league baseball team that were members of the Class A Western 
League.[10] In 1919, his last season with the Miners, he had a breakthrough 
year, posting a batting average .316 and amassing 100 hits, 19 doubles 
and 10 home runs in 96 games played.[10] This caught the attention of the 
St. Louis Browns, who signed him near the end of the season.[1] Collins 
made his major league debut for the Browns on September 5, 1919, at the 
age of 22,[1] entering the game as a pinch-hitter for pitcher Bert Gallia 
and drawing a walk in a 12–3 loss against the Detroit Tigers.[11] Between 
1920 and 1922, he never played more than 31 games nor started more than 
20 games a season as catcher, and his role was limited to occasional pinch-hitting 
appearances.[1] During the 1923 season, Collins played 47 games (37 starts) 
and had the fifth highest caught stealing percentage in the American League 
(AL) at 44.4%.[1][12] During a June 8 road game at Shibe Park, he became 
the first and only major league player to pinch hit and pinch run in the 
same game. His teammate Homer Ezzell reached base in the third inning, 
but needed to use the restroom. Collins was inserted into the game as a 
pinch runner until Ezzell returned. In the ninth inning, Collins returned 
to pinch hit for pitcher Ray Kolp after the Philadelphia Athletics' manager 
Connie Mack agreed to drop the no free substitution rule and allowed Collins 
to pinch hit.[13][14] However, the official box score lists his pinch hit 
appearance only.[15] In 1924, there were two factors which limited Collins 
to just 20 games (11 starts) as catcher. Firstly, he dislocated the joint 
in his left thumb during spring training after splitting the finger.[16] 
Then on June 22, Collins—along with Browns manager George Sisler and coach 
Jimmy Austin—were suspended indefinitely after arguing balls and strikes 
with the umpire.[17] Sisler lodged a formal protest to AL president Ban 
Johnson,[18] and the suspensions were rescinded four days later.[19] After 
the season ended, Collins was not re-signed by the Browns, so he spent 
the 1925 season with the St. Paul Saints, a minor league baseball team 
that competed in the American Association (AA). There, he batted .316 and 
hit 19 home runs in 132 games.[10] The Saints traded Collins to the New 
York Yankees on August 30, 1925, in exchange for $25,000 and three players 
to be named later (the Yankees later sent Pee-Wee Wanninger to St. Paul 
on December 16).[1][20] During his years with the team, he developed a 
reputation of being slow-footed[21] and having a throwing arm that was 
described as "terrible"[22] and "weak".[23] However, his steadiness behind 
the plate[21] and his bat[23] kept him in lineup. He became the starting 
catcher "by default"[24] after Benny Bengough—who was Miller Huggins' first 
choice for the job—suffered from a sore arm before spring training commenced.[24] 
In his first season with the organization, Collins had the fourth highest 
on-base percentage (.433) and tenth best at bats per home run ratio (41.4) 
in the AL, though he also recorded the fifth highest number of strikeouts 
in the league with 57. Defensively, he played the fourth highest number 
of games at catcher (100), during which he finished second in errors committed 
by a catcher (14), fifth in passed balls (6) and fourth in stolen bases 
allowed in the AL. However, he compensated for this by turning the most 
double plays (14) and recording the second highest range factor (4.75) 
as catcher, while finishing fourth in putouts (401) and fifth in assists 
(74) at his position and catching the fifth highest number of baserunners 
stealing (34).[1] On July 20, in the final game of a series against the 
Browns (his former team), Collins injured a side ligament while attempting 
to run down catcher Wally Schang,[25][26] who was also facing his former 
team.[27] This, along with Bengough's recurring problems with his arm, 
prompted the Yankees to buy Hank Severeid from the Washington Senators.[25] 
In the postseason, the Yankees advanced to the 1926 World Series, where 
they lost to the St. Louis Cardinals in seven games.[28] Collins did not 
receive much playing time throughout the series, appearing in just three 
games and getting no hits and one strikeout in two plate appearances.[1] 
The 1927 season saw Collins split catching duties with Johnny Grabowski 
and Bengough. He appeared in the most games behind the plate out of the 
three players – 89 games caught by Collins versus 68 by Grabowski and Bengough's 
30.[29] He was usually placed near the bottom of the Yankees lineup, which 
was given the nickname "Murderers' Row".[30] Many sports analysts, baseball 
writers and fans consider the 1927 team the greatest baseball team of all 
time.[30][31][32] Although Collins was labelled an "offensive afterthought",[30] 
he still managed to bat a respectable .275 and drove in 36 runs in 311 
plate appearances. Defensively, he once again finished fourth in the AL 
in number of games (89) and putouts (267) at catcher, while also recording 
the fourth highest fielding percentage at the position (.976).[1] At the 
end of the year, the Yankees once again advanced to the World Series, where 
they swept the Pittsburgh Pirates in four games.[33] Collins played in 
Games 1 and 4; in the first game, he was hitless in two at bats but garnered 
two walks,[34] while in the latter game he went 3-for-3 with a double.[35] 
His series average of .600 was the highest among his teammates.[33] After 
the Yankees purchased Bill Dickey from the Jackson Senators before the 
start of the 1928 season,[36] the team now had four catchers on their roster.[37] 
The increase competition restricted Collins to 45 starts and 70 games in 
total.[1] In the 1928 World Series, the Yankees achieved a second consecutive 
Fall Classic sweep, this time against the Cardinals in a rematch of the 
series from two years before.[38] However, he played just one game in the 
series, entering the 7th inning of Game 4 as a defensive substitute and 
hitting a double two innings later.[39] The catching situation—along with 
his dismal .221 batting average that year[1]—made Collins redundant, and 
at the end of the season, he was sold to the Boston Braves.[3] Collins 
managed to play just seven games for the Braves during the 1929 season, 
making his final major league appearance on May 23. During his brief tenure 
with the team, he was hitless, but drove in 2 runs, drew 3 walks and had 
3 sacrifice bunts in 11 plate appearances.[1] After the Braves acquired 
several younger catchers, he was released and sent to the Buffalo Bisons 
of the Class AAA International League[3][40] There, he batted .122 and 
had 5 hits in 16 games played[10] before manager Bill Clymer cut him loose 
after the season ended.[40] He promptly signed a one-year contract with 
the Seattle Indians, a minor league team that played in the Class AAA Pacific 
Coast League.[41] He batted .244 during his stint with the team and was 
traded midway through the 1930 season to the Kansas City Blues, thus returning 
to the AA. His numbers improved tremendously—he recorded a .358 batting 
average, amassed 39 hits and slugged 7 doubles and 3 home runs in 109 at 
bats. The 1931 season saw Collins play just 27 games with the Blues and 
his average dipped to .182.[10] He was scheduled to be traded to the Omaha 
Packers in July,[42] but the deal fell through and he remained with the 
team through to the 1932 season. That year, he played 105 games and batted 
.268, collected 78 hits with 14 doubles, 3 triples and 4 home runs before 
retiring from professional baseball at the end of the season.[10] After 
playing his final major league season in 1929, Collins returned to minor 
league baseball and played for several teams until 1932.[10] In 1936, he 
teamed up with former minor league pitcher Van Hammer in attempting to 
establish a new Western League franchise in St. Joseph, Missouri, after 
the St. Joseph Saints moved to Waterloo, Iowa and became the Waterloo Hawks.[43] 
However, the plan fell through after a court injunction was issued barring 
him from using the stadium in St. Joseph for professional baseball.[44] 
Because of this, Collins forfeited the St. Joseph franchise[45] and subsequently
