Eloy "Buck" Canel (March 4, 1906 – April 7, 1980) was an American Spanish 
language sportscaster of Major League Baseball games. Canel was born in 
Argentina when his father was working for the Spanish consulate in that 
country. Canel achieved international renown and became a household name 
in Latino communities when he joined in the late 1940s the Gillette Cavalcade 
of Sports. By then, the Cavalcade was aired through NBC Red Network and 
extended their Spanish programming activities to Latin American countries, 
where it was known as La Cabalgata Deportiva Gillette. On there Canel shared 
duties with Spanish-language broadcasters such as Pancho Pepe Cróquer, 
Omar Lares, and Felo Ramírez. During the opening presentation, Canel habitually 
introduced Cróquer as La Voz Deportiva de América. Canel announced the 
New York Mets and New York Yankees games in Spanish during the 1970s over 
radio station WHOM, which was then a Spanish radio station in New York 
City. The feeds were occasionally broadcast to Latin American radio stations.[1] 
Canel was given the Ford C. Frick Award by the National Baseball Hall of 
Fame in 1985. He began his career in journalism. He died in 1980 in Croton-on-Hudson, 
New York. The call letters of WHOM are now used for an easy listening station
