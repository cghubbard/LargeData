Methuen /mɛˈθuːɛn/ is a city[3] in Essex County, Massachusetts, United 
States. The population was 47,255 at the 2010 census.[4] Methuen was first 
settled in 1642 and was officially incorporated in 1726. Methuen was originally 
part of Haverhill, Massachusetts. In 1724 Stephen Barker and others in 
the western part of that town petitioned the General Court to grant them 
permission to form a new town above Hawke's Meadow Brook. Although opposed 
by their fellow townsmen, the petition was approved the following year 
(December 8, 1725), and the General Court gave them an act of incorporation 
under the name of Methuen. The town was named for Sir Paul Methuen, a member 
of the King's Privy Council and friend of acting Provincial Governor William 
Dummer. The first town meeting was held March 9, 1726. Industrial growth 
in the 1800s influenced Methuen's development. Construction of the Methuen 
Cotton Mills at the Spicket River falls in the 1820s and the increased 
manufacture of hats and shoes in small factories along the Spicket spurred 
the centralization of Methuen's economic, residential and cultural activities 
within the area around Osgood, Broadway, Hampshire and Pleasant streets. 
Three wealthy and prominent families—the Nevins, the Tenneys and the Searles—played 
a significant role in Methuen's history and development. These families 
were instrumental in the founding of many of Methuen's landmarks, including 
the Nevins Memorial Library, the Searles building, Tenney Gatehouse, Nevins 
Home, Spicket Falls, and the Civil War monument between Pleasant and Charles 
streets.[5] Methuen is located at 42°43′48″N 71°10′46″W﻿ / ﻿42.73000°N 
71.17944°W﻿ / 42.73000; -71.17944 (42.730040, −71.179352).[6] According 
to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 23.1 square 
miles (59.7 km2), of which 22.2 square miles (57.6 km2) is land and 0.77 
square miles (2.0 km2), or 3.42%, is water.[7] The town lies along the 
north banks of the Merrimack River, and is also bisected by the Spicket 
(originally "Spigot") River,[8] as well as many brooks and streams. There 
are several ponds dotting the area as well, and the town is home to a town 
forest, a bird sanctuary, and a small state park (Tenney State Park). Pine 
Island, near the southern end of town in the Merrimack River, is also part 
of the town's land. Methuen lies along the northwestern edge of Essex County, 
just east of Middlesex County and just south of Rockingham County, New 
Hampshire. The irregularly-shaped town is bordered by Haverhill to the 
northeast, North Andover to the east, Lawrence and Andover to the south, 
Dracut (Middlesex County) to the west, Pelham, New Hampshire (Hillsborough 
County) to the northwest, and Salem, New Hampshire (Rockingham County) 
to the north. Methuen is located 30 miles (48 km) north-northwest of Boston 
and 25 miles (40 km) south-southeast of Manchester, New Hampshire. Methuen 
lies at the northern end of Interstate 93 in Massachusetts, with three 
exits providing access. A portion of Interstate 495 crosses through the 
eastern side of town from Lawrence to Haverhill. Massachusetts Route 213, 
the "Loop Connector", provides highway access between the two, lying entirely 
within town and having five exits of its own. The town is also crossed 
by Route 28, Route 110, and Route 113, the latter two meeting at a rotary 
at I-93 Exit 46, one of the more congested intersections along the I-93 
corridor. Construction to replace this interchange began in July 2014;[9] 
it is expected to be complete at some point in 2017 with a partial cloverleaf 
interchange.[10] I-93 provides the town's only bridge across the Merrimack; 
there are several crossings in Lawrence, and several in neighboring Haverhill, 
but none for 7 miles (11 km) upstream from I-93 all the way to the eastern 
end of Lowell. Methuen is served by the Merrimack Valley Regional Transit 
Authority's bus service; there is no other mass transportation source within 
town. The nearest rail station is in South Lawrence, which is part of the 
Haverhill/Reading Line of the MBTA Commuter Rail, providing service into 
Boston's North Station. Small plane service can be found at Lawrence Municipal 
Airport and the Merrimack Valley Seaplane Base, with the nearest national 
service being at Manchester-Boston Regional Airport, and the nearest international 
service being at Logan International Airport. As of the census[22] of 2000, 
there were 43,789 people, 16,532 households, and 11,539 families residing 
in the city. The population density was 1,954.7 persons per square mile

average household size was 2.62 and the average family size was 3.17. In 
the city the population was spread out with 24.7% under the age of 18, 
7.3% from 18 to 24, 31.0% from 25 to 44, 21.6% from 45 to 64, and 15.3% 
who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 38 years. For every 
100 females there were 91.9 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, 
there were 87.0 males. The median income for a household in the city was 
$49,627, and the median income for a family was $59,831. Males had a median 
income of $41,693 versus $31,864 for females. The per capita income for 
the city was $22,305. About 5.8% of families and 7.4% of the population 
were below the poverty line, including 9.7% of those under age 18 and 7.7% 
of those age 65 or over. Historically, Methuen had a town meeting-selectmen 
form of government and was known as the Town of Methuen until it adopted 
a charter replacing its traditional town meeting and selectmen with a council 
and manager. Even with a form of government that had historically and legally 
been exclusive to cities, the community, in a gesture of traditionalism, 
retained the name Town of Methuen in its charter.[3] However, because Massachusetts 
cities have self-governing powers not available to towns, it became known 
for legal purposes as "The City Known as the Town of Methuen". A subsequent 
charter, which adopted a strong mayor form of government, officially changed 
the community name to the "City of Methuen". Methuen's city government 
consists of a mayor, three Councilors-at-Large, two East District councilors, 
two Central District councilors, two West District councilors, and six 
School Committee members. Methuen High School's athletic teams play in 
the Merrimack Valley Conference. Their big rivals are the Andover Golden 
Warriors, the Central Catholic Raiders of Lawrence, and the Haverhill Hillies. 
On Thanksgiving Day, the football team plays fellow Merrimack Valley foe 
the Dracut Middies. The teams first met in a non-Thanksgiving Day game 
in 1935 and did not play again until the Thanksgiving series started in 
1963. The school colors are blue and white, and their mascot is the Ranger, 
named after Rogers' Rangers, the precursor of the U.S. Army Rangers, which 
was founded by town resident Robert Rogers. The Searles Tenney Nevins Historic 
District, established by the city in 1992 to preserve the "distinctive 
architecture and rich character of one of Massachusetts' most unique neighborhoods", 
is named after the three Methuen city fathers: David C. Nevins, Edward 
F. Searles and Charles H. Tenney. From the City of Methuen: Today, the 
trio's collective vision can be seen in mills, housing, schools, mansions, 
churches, monuments, playgrounds, the library, and the architectural fantasies 
that resulted from their artistic rivalry. The historic district boundaries 
were established to include properties and buildings constructed or used 
by the Searles, Tenney and Nevins families and the people who worked for 
them.[26] The historic district is administered by the Methuen Historic 
District Commission, which protects the district from alterations that 
might compromise its historic integrity. Bounded within the Searles Tenney 
Nevins Historic District are the Spicket Falls Historic District and the 
Pleasant-High Historic District. Both are registered with the National 
Register of Historic Places, as are many of the other buildings within
