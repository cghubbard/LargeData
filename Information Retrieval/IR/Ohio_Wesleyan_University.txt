Ohio Wesleyan University (also known as Wesleyan or OWU) is a private liberal 
arts college in Delaware, Ohio, United States. It was founded in 1842 by 
Methodist leaders and Central Ohio residents as a nonsectarian institution, 
and is a member of the Ohio Five — a consortium of Ohio liberal arts colleges.[8] 
Ohio Wesleyan has always admitted students irrespective of religion or 
race and maintained that the university "is forever to be conducted on 
the most liberal principles."[9][10] The 200-acre (81 ha) site is 27 miles 
(44 km) north of Columbus, Ohio. It includes the main academic and residential 
campus, the Perkins Observatory, and the Kraus Wilderness Preserve.[11] 
In 2010, Ohio Wesleyan had the eleventh highest percentage of international 
students among liberal arts colleges for the seventeenth straight year.[12] 
In its 2015 edition of U.S. college rankings, Niche (company) ranked Ohio 
Wesleyan the 56th (out of 880 colleges) most politically liberal college 
in the U.S.[13] U.S. News & World Report ranked Ohio Wesleyan 99th among 
U.S. liberal arts colleges in its 2015 edition.[14][15] In 1841, Ohio residents 
Adam Poe and Charles Elliott decided to establish a university "of the 
highest order" in central Ohio.[16] To that end, they purchased the Mansion 
House Hotel, a former health resort with its Sulfur Spring, using funds 
raised from local residents.[17][18] Poe and Elliott wrote a charter emphasizing 
"the democratic spirit of teaching", which was approved by the Ohio State 
Legislature. Early in the following year they opened the college preparatory 
Academy and formed a Board of Trustees.[19] Ohio Wesleyan University, named 
(like several other U.S. colleges and universities) after John Wesley, 
founder of Methodism, opened on November 13, 1844 as a Methodist-related 
but nonsectarian institution, with a College of Liberal Arts for male students.[20][21][22] 
Ohio Wesleyan's first president, Edward Thomson, stated in his inaugural 
address on August 5, 1846 that the school was "a product of the liberality 
of the local people."[23] This liberal philosophy contributed to Ohio Wesleyan's 
vocal opposition to slavery in the 1850s.[24][25][26] In the annual celebration 
for George Washington's birthday in 1862, second president Frederick Merrick 
endorsed Ohio Wesleyan's "ideals of democracy" during his oration.[27] 
During the mid-19th century, Ohio Wesleyan focused on attracting students, 
adding fields of study, and fundraising, by which it significantly increased 
its endowment.[29] Sturges Hall was constructed as the University's first 
library in 1855.[30] In 1873, the school added the Department of Natural 
History housed in Merrick Hall.[31] The Ohio Wesleyan Female College, established 
in 1853, merged with the university in 1877.[32][33] Between 1876 and 1888, 
enrollment tripled and music education greatly increased, yet no major 
buildings were built in this time.[34][35] By the end of the 19th century, 
Ohio Wesleyan had added a School of Music (1877), School of Fine Arts (1877), 
School of Oratory (1894), and Business School (1895) to the original College 
of Liberal Arts (founded in 1844).[36] To address the need for new departments 
and specialized instruction, the administration improved the facilities 
and courses to make them on par with OWU's new academic position. University 
Hall, Slocum Library, extensions to the Monnett campus, and athletic facilities 
were all constructed during that period.[37] Between 1891 and 1895, Ohio 
Wesleyan specialized the curriculum by establishing departments for physics, 
zoology, geology, speech, history, French, English, and economics.[38] 
This specialization encouraged undergraduates to continue studies at graduate 
level, allowed professional preparation for the Doctor of Philosophy degree, 
and promoted exchange study in Europe.[39] Two professional schools for 
law and medicine were formed in 1896. In 1905, the Board of Trustees decided 
to keep Ohio Wesleyan a college, despite the expansion of the curriculum 
and campus and the word "university" in the institution's name.[40] The 
Bachelor of Science degree was abolished, which left only the Bachelor 
of Arts. Two students were selected as Rhodes Scholars in 1905 and 1909.[41] 
Edwards Gymnasium was built in 1906.[42] In 1907, the United Societies 
of Phi Beta Kappa, the oldest undergraduate honor society in the United 
States, installed the "Eta of Ohio" ΦΒΚ chapter on campus.[43] In 1909, 
the school added Sanborn Hall, housing the Music Department.[44] In the 
1920s, academic requirements for the bachelor's degree were reduced, and 
Latin and mathematics were no longer emphasized.[45] During the presidency 
of John W. Hoffman (1916–1928), the Academy and School of Business were 
closed; the Academy had started in 1842 as a preparatory school, and throughout 
its seventy-five years frequently outnumbered the college in enrollment.[46] 
Also in the 1920s, the chapel service was dropped and sororities were formed. 
Ohio Wesleyan also increased the number of buildings on campus, including 
Selby Stadium, Austin Manor, and Perkins Observatory; another building, 
Stuyvesant Hall, was in planning; and Edgar Hall was opened.[47] During 
the Great Depression, both enrollment and alumni donations shrank.[48] 
While the faculty size remained stable, lack of tuition and alumni revenues 
precipitated financial problems which threatened the college's survival 
in the administrations of Edmund D. Soper (1928–1938), Acting President 
Edward Loranus Rice (1938–1939), and Herbert John Burgstahler (1939–1949).[49] 
The administration adjusted the curriculum during the early 1930s to address 
these problems.[50] Greek and Latin declined, while business administration 
and economics thrived and the highest enrollments were in the social sciences, 
English, pre-medicine, and history. The registrar reported that, in these 
years, the number of students from New England states, urban Ohio areas, 
and from international locations increased. By the 1930s, the Methodist 
students were a minority among the student body;[51] formal ties to the 
Methodist church were severed in the 1920s[52] and led to debate among 
Board members in the 1930s, eventually resulting in the university's current 
active but loose historical affiliation with the United Methodist Church.[53] 
In a study into the relationship between American educational institutions 
and the Christian denominations they were historically affiliated with, 
James Tunstead Burtuchell writes that it was during this period that "in 
its personnel, its resources, and its students", Ohio Wesleyan lost its 
"symbiotic intimacy with the United Methodist Church."[54] In 1946, Ohio 
Wesleyan introduced a new "Centennial Curriculum", which enacted seven 
distribution requirements across the sciences and humanities; the new requirement 
for a foreign language course was added to the existing humanities requirement.[55] 
Thomson and Bashford Halls, originally men's dorms, were built between 
1951 and 1954.[55] In the 1960s, faculty, staff and administrators fought 
over administrative structure and control.[56] They eventually settled 
on a new "statement of aims" that stressed values, rather than religious 
goal statements, and instituted a more internationalized curriculum, a 
new Women's Studies Program, and an International Business major; the faculty 
senate also introduced a new academic calendar with three 10.5-week terms.[57] 
Thomas Wenzlau's presidency (1968–1984) began with the challenge of campus 
unrest: Ohio Wesleyan students took over the ROTC building, demanded its 
shut-down, and eventually eliminated ROTC in 1970.[58][59] Students also 
demanded participation in departmental meetings and faculty committees, 
and the democratic process in the governance of Ohio Wesleyan grew in this 
period.[60] Wenzlau's presidency witnessed decline in students' test scores, 
an unusually high attrition rate, lack of adequate research to identify 
potential major donors and a growing "party school" image,[61] leading 
to a rocky relationship between him and the student body.[62] Between 1979 
and 1982, the campus newspaper The Transcript frequently criticized Wenzlau's 
presidency, blaming it for "severely affecting the reputation of the college".[63] 
This exchange resulted in a Washington Post report on the school that eventually 
precipitated the end of Wenzlau's presidency.[64] The president, David 
Warren, increased admission standards in 1985, engaged students in a "live-in" 
presidency, expanded media exposure and established a National Colloquium 
focused on the liberal arts. Warren engaged in forty-one interviews on 
the ABC and NBC networks.[65] The current president is Rock Jones.[66] 
More recently, Ohio Wesleyan has achieved several academic and athletic 
recognitions. A 1986 study, titled "Educating America's Scientists: The 
Role of the Research Colleges," identified Ohio Wesleyan as one of 48 highly 
selective "science-active" liberal arts institutions in the nation.[67] 
The Battling Bishops won NCAA Division III national championships in men's 
basketball (1988) and men's (1998, 2011) and women's (2001, 2002) soccer.[42] 
Ohio Wesleyan continues to undertake construction projects. The Hamilton 
Williams Campus Center opened in 1991. The Memorial Union Building was 
renovated in 2001 to accommodate the Economics Department, the Academic 
Resource Center, the Information Services portion of the combined Libraries 
and Information Services department, and the Woltemade Center for Economics, 
Business and Entrepreneurship. The Schimmel-Conrades Science Center opened 
in 2004 to provide 52,000 square feet (4,800 m2) of additional space for 
the science departments.[68] As of 2010, the university is engaged in a 
fundraising campaign to improve athletics facilities by adding a new turf 
facility, a new field house and a pool, and a gateway connecting all sports 
facilities on campus.[69] Ohio Wesleyan University is accredited by The 
Higher Learning Commission, and is a member of the Great Lakes Colleges 
Association,[73][74] the Oberlin Group,[75] and the Five Colleges of Ohio, 
a consortium of Ohio liberal arts colleges which also includes Kenyon College, 
Oberlin College, The College of Wooster, and Denison University.[8] For 
2011, Ohio Wesleyan accepted approximately 52% of its regular decision 
applicants, 33% of its transfer applicants, and had a yield rate of 26%.[76][77][78] 
In 2010, the college accepted 36% of its international applicants.[79] 
The middle 50% range of matriculating students for the class of 2010 was 
1125–1320 for the SAT (old scale) and 24–30 for the ACT.[80] Approximately 
35% of accepted applicants were granted internal scholarships.[81] Ohio 
Wesleyan follows a need-blind admission policy; financial circumstances 
are not considered when deciding whether to admit applicants.[82] As of 
2010, OWU's 1,950 students come from 43 states and 57 countries; 47% are 
from Ohio, 11% are international, and 54% are female.[83] The student body 
is about 10% Asian, 6% Hispanic, and 9% Black. Fifty-nine percent of Ohio 
Wesleyan students claim no religious affiliation.[84] The student-faculty 
ratio is 11:1 and faculty members teach all classes.[85] Excluding independent 
studies and senior theses, nearly 60% of Ohio Wesleyan's class sections 
have fewer than twenty students enrolled.[86] Ohio Wesleyan is generally 
known for a strong "left-leaning" student body and an administration with 
a "permissive" attitude. In 2007, 60% of OWU students favored the Democratic 
Party.[87] In its 2015 edition of U.S. college rankings, Niche (company) 
ranked Ohio Wesleyan 56th (out of 880 colleges) most politically liberal 
college in the U.S.[13] Ohio Wesleyan admits students of all cultures, 
lifestyles, and socio-economic backgrounds. An index examining gay-friendly 
policies places OWU among the nation's gay-friendly colleges,[88][89] and 
the university enacts policies to meet the six criteria developed by the 
Campus-Pride organization for recruiting and supporting students from a 
lesbian, gay, bi-sexual, and transgender population.[90][91] Nearly 18% 
of students at Ohio Wesleyan receive Federal Pell Grants, which mostly 
go to students whose family incomes are below $40,000.[92] This measure 
indicates the degree to which economically disadvantaged groups are represented 
at OWU.[93] The faculty consists of 142 tenured members. As of 2010, all 
the university's tenured or tenure-track faculty members hold a PhD or 
other terminal degree.[94] The faculty is 37% female and 63% male, with 
10% from underrepresented groups. Also as of 2010, women constitute 37% 
of the tenured professors and earn 93.8% of what male professors earn—numbers 
which suggest favorable gender circumstances.[95] Freshmen are paired early 
in their first year with academic advisors who oversee their students' 
academic progress.[96] Upon completing 34 units of coursework, students 
may earn diplomas in Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Fine Arts, or Bachelor 
of Music.[97] Ohio Wesleyan has research departments and teaching faculties 
in most academic disciplines; as of 2005, OWU offered 39 majors.[98] In 
its early days, OWU's curriculum began with classical studies, for the 
course catalogue maintained that "the classical course in Greek and Latin 
and pure mathematics bring correctness in mental processes that an applied 
art, or a living and slightly inflected language, do not permit."[99] Scientific 
courses were added to Ohio Wesleyan's curriculum in 1849, and since then, 
scientific subjects have become a foundation to the liberal arts curriculum.[100] 
OWU also has a highly respected music department.[101] Ohio Wesleyan has 
upheld academic internationalism since its early years; since the 19th 
century, the college has established links with several international schools. 
In 1879, OWU alumna Elizabeth Russell founded Kwassui Women's College in 
Nagasaki, Japan, when predominant Japanese culture considered women's education 
unimportant.[102] Today, Kwassui College is one of the top finishing schools 
for young women in Japan.[103] In 1899, William Ehnis (from the class of 
1898) traveled to Africa and opened a school in Mutare, Zimbabwe, that 
eventually became the Africa University.[104] In March 1988, Conrad Kent 
established the popular Salamanca Spanish Program for Ohio Wesleyan students. 
The school also manifests international interest in the percentage of international 
students it recruits and enrolls annually. Since 1983, Ohio Wesleyan has 
been listed in U.S. News & World Report among colleges that attract the 
highest percentage of international students.[105][106][107][108] The percentage 
of international students grew in the early and mid-1990s.[109][110] In 
a study adjusted for school size, Ohio Wesleyan came ninth among 118 American 
colleges and universities in total aid awards to international students 
and 69th in average award per international student among both large universities 
and small liberal arts colleges.[111] South East Asian students have significantly 
contributed to this growth.[112] The United Nations flag, along with the 
flags of more than sixty represented nations and the U.S. flag, flies in 
University Hall in honor of the ideal of peaceful international relations.[113] 
High participation in formal exchange programs constitutes a third target 
of the school's international focus.[114] Under a Great Lakes Colleges 
Association agreement, OWU established an exchange program with Waseda 
University in 1962 to provide approximately 30 American students with opportunities 
to study in Japan and 30 Japanese students to study at Ohio Wesleyan each 
year.[115] The Salamanca program, founded by Conrad Kent in 1988,[116] 
conducts the exchange of approximately one hundred students and faculty 
between OWU and the University of Salamanca in Spain. The academic collaboration 
frequently extends to joint participation in academic symposia: in 1993, 
members of the Salamanca faculty participated in a symposium on the Golden 
Age in Salamanca.[117] The Ohio Wesleyan campus is next to downtown Delaware, 
and is bisected by Sandusky Street, the main north/south street through 
the heart of the city. The street informally divides the campus into an 
eastern sector composed mainly of academic buildings and a western sector 
composed mainly of residential and administrative buildings. Many facilities 
have been constructed in the last two years, with substantial benefit to 
science, art, and athletic programs on campus. OWU operates several facilities 
outside campus: The Philadelphia Business Center, Wesleyan in Washington, 
The New York Arts Program for the performing, visual and media arts (a 
GLCA arts program), Perkins Observatory, The Strand Theatre, and the Kraus 
Wilderness Preserve. Perkins Observatory is situated in Delaware on land 
separate to the main campus.[118] The observatory is named after Hiram 
Perkins, a former professor of mathematics and astronomy at the college.[119] 
When the observatory was built in 1931, it housed the third-largest telescope 
in the world, which has since been moved to Arizona.[120] The Perkins dome 
now houses a 32-inch (810 mm) telescope, which is the second-largest in 
Ohio. The university also maintains offices for study abroad, US domestic 
study, and internship programs. Such programs include: Wesleyan in Washington, 
which allows students to study for a semester in Washington, D.C., in research 
and internship positions.[121] The Philadelphia Center offers students 
hundreds of internship and field placement opportunities off-campus and 
the chance to live independently.[122] and the New York Arts Program, which 
allows students of the arts to gain a semester of hands on experience in 
the arts in New York City.[123] OWU has strong community ties with the 
City of Delaware.[124] Students participate in Delaware's community through 
a variety of educational, social, and cultural programs. The student-led 
Columbus Initiative, founded in 1989, is an experiential learning partnership 
between OWU and Columbus public schools.[125] More than 150 Ohio Wesleyan 
students from this program tutor and mentor underprivileged pupils from 
Columbus.[126] The Ohio Wesleyan Ambassadors Program (ISAP) promotes cultural 
diversity and ethnic awareness within the local community,[127] and exposes 
international students to American culture through the community. The program's 
ambassadors visit local schools to give presentations and participate in 
events for local non-profit community organizations.[127] Campus organizations 
cooperate with local residents on issues of civic engagement and activism. 
Progress OWU allows students from Ohio Wesleyan and local schools to express 
their voices on politics, public policy, and corporate and social issues, 
both on campus and in the local community.[128] Cultural programs also 
take part in community relations. In the 1960s, Ohio Wesleyan donated the 
Arts Castle, then part of the Fine Arts department, to the City of Delaware. 
It is now home to the Delaware County Cultural Arts Center. The Arts Castle 
hosts a variety of community programs in art, and offers classes ranging 
from ballet to fine arts.[129] In 2004, the OWU received a donation to 
rehabilitate the historic Strand Theatre in downtown Delaware.[130] The 
university and the City of Delaware sponsor several events in town throughout 
the year: the Delaware Arts Festival, the Little Brown Jug, the Delaware 
County Fair, and the Castle Arts Affair.[131] The Delaware Arts Festival 
is an annual event held the weekend after Mother's Day on the streets of 
Historic Downtown Delaware.[132] The festival hosts over 170 booths featuring 
works of local, regional, and other artists. OWU professors chair the committees 
that select winners.[133] The Little Brown Jug, a harness race, is run 
during the Delaware County Fair in September.[134] The OWU president and 
the college mascot traditionally award the trophy for the first division 
of the first heat of the race.[135] Ohio Wesleyan University has 95 student 
clubs and organizations.[136] The university offers three chapels as well 
as several Christian and other religious groups for its students.[137][138] 
Its social organizations cover a wide range of interests, including chess, 
ultimate, finance, and medieval sword fighting.[139] There are two a cappella 
singing groups on campus, "The OWtsiders," a student-run group formed in 
1999, and the all-female "Pitch Black" established in 2005.[140] Another 
entertainment-related club is "The Babbling Bishops", an improvisational 
comedy troupe.[141] The "Babbling Bishops" started in the fall of 1990 
when a group of theatre concentration students formed a performance-oriented 
project for their theatre degrees. The project became an improv comedy 
troupe, rehearsing in Stuyvesant Hall and performing with other college 
improv troupes since 1996.[142] Socially conscious students can join organizations 
such as the activist group "ProgressOWU"[143] or participate in student 
government groups, such as the Campus Programming Board and the Wesleyan 
Council on Student Affairs.[17] The "PRIDE" organization offers support 
to OWU's LGBT students.[144] Fewer than a third of Ohio Wesleyan's students 
are involved in Greek life,[145] but that percentage has fluctuated significantly 
throughout the university's history.[146] All twelve fraternities and seven 
sororities on campus are currently involved in many philanthropic and community 
programs.[147] Ohio Wesleyan has four religious chaplains: A Protestant 
minister, a Roman Catholic priest, and a Jewish rabbi.[148] In addition 
to student groups and services associated with these three religions, there 
are groups associated with Islam, Buddhism and Unitarian Universalism, 
and even a group which holds services that are simply "spiritual" and separate 
from any organized religion.[149][150] Services are also available for 
Quakers, Christian Scientists, Hindus, and Baha'is, and there are many 
local religious groups in Delaware, Ohio. OWU's oldest student organizations 
are its literary clubs, including a number of student journals, magazines, 
and newspapers. The school's student-run weekly newspaper, The Transcript, 
is the oldest continuously published, independent, college newspaper in 
the United States.[151] The OWL, an annual literary publication, features 
students' work and is one of the nation's oldest college literary magazines.[152] 
Other student publications include The Civic Arts Review, the electronic 
Connect2OWU bulletin, and @Wesleyan, a quarterly online magazine.[153] 
Radio station WSLN broadcasts from Slocum Hall and is run by students supervised 
by the journalism department.[154] The university also has a student government, 
the Wesleyan Council on Student Affairs (WCSA). Activism as represented 
in OWU's founding vision has had a significant role in Ohio Wesleyan's 
history.[155][156] The first president, Edward Thomson, staunchly supported 
the abolition of slavery and liberalism.[157] Other individuals associated 
with the university have fought racism. Branch Rickey, an alumnus, broke 
the racial barrier in baseball.[158] Mary King, a civil rights activist,[159] 
worked alongside Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in the U.S. civil rights movement 
while she was a staff member of OWU's Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee 
(SNCC).[160][161] In the 1980s, Ohio Wesleyan's administration, moved by 
student activism, pledged and eventually fully divested holdings connected 
to South Africa.[162][163] As of September 2007, Ohio Wesleyan joined a 
small group of liberal colleges that actively opposed the methodology and 
usefulness of US News and World Report college rankings, despite the fact 
that the magazine ranked Ohio Wesleyan among the top national liberal arts 
colleges.[164] Ohio Wesleyan's concern intensified with disclosures about 
institutions flagrantly manipulating data in order to move up in the rankings 
in U.S. News and other popular college guides. OWU has partisan political 
groups ranging from liberal to conservative, such the College Republicans 
and the College Democrats, and several activism awareness groups such as 
ProgressOWU, Black Men of the Future, Student Union on Black Awareness, 
PRIDE, ECHO, Amnesty International, and Rafiki Wa Afrika. Due to the school's 
proximity to Columbus, the Ohio state capital, many politically inclined 
students serve internships for state representatives.[165][166] In the 
2000s, students have been active on the Iraq war, race, globalization, 
and women's reproductive rights.[167] Many Ohio Wesleyan traditions originate 
from its early years. Monnett Weekend, beginning in 1896, welcomes female 
alumni, parents, and friends of the university. Events include a "People's 
Parade" with clowns, banners and marching, faculty lectures, Maypole dancing, 
Choral Arts Society, and an all-campus carnival.[168][169] It started as 
a girls' athletic fête held at the Monnett Athletic Club for Mothers Day. 
All events were held at the Monnett Campus, where female students danced 
around the Maypole, while men were barred. The men, in turn, developed 
their own tradition: they arrived at Monnett Campus early in the morning, 
and concealed themselves in trees to watch the festivities, discreetly.[170] 
In 1884, Ohio Wesleyan held its first Mock Convention, which has recurred 
in every United States presidential election year since 1920.[171] Its 
purpose is to inform participants, students, faculty staff, and Ohio residents 
about the presidential nominating convention,[172] presidential candidate, 
and key issues in the upcoming election.[173] Beginning in the 1920s, all 
freshmen were required to wear "dinks", red caps with black brims and a 
black W on the front.[174] Disobedient students who refused to wear the 
"dink" were tossed into the Sulphur Spring (see later reference). This 
tradition ended in the 1960s. The freshman class of 1957 wore dinks for 
half the first semester.[175] Ohio Wesleyan's Homecoming takes place in 
early October,[176] while the Ohio Wesleyan football team plays one of 
its traditional rivals. New events, such as a bonfire and a five kilometer 
run, have been added from as recently as 2004.[177] The President's Ball, 
a recent gala organized by the college president, takes place on the first 
Saturday of December.[178] Other traditions include OWU vs. Denison, which 
stages a "fierce" athletic rivalry between Ohio Wesleyan and Denison University;[179] 
the Sagan Colloquium, spanning the fall semester, recently expanded to 
include the spring semester, which consists of speeches focusing on an 
issue of concern to the liberal arts;[180] and Orchesis, an annual celebration 
of modern dance and the arts, which occurs at the end of the academic year. 
"Fresh-X" is an optional program for newly admitted students that occurs 
just before orientation in which students may choose between hiking, backpacking 
and other outdoor activities to make friends with their new classmates.[181] 
There are two major musical events, Unity through Music and Springfest. 
Unity through Music occurs once a year in the fall semester, and covers 
various musical styles in a carnival atmosphere, during the day; while, 
during the evening, a huge dance is held in the Hamilton-Williams Campus 
Center.[182] Springfest, the second musical event, proceeds in mid-April 
and in recent years has featured well-known music groups such as Counting 
Crows, The Roots, Guster, Ben Folds, and most recently, Gym Class Heroes. 
It is organized by the Campus Programming Board.[183] A rock next to Hayes 
Hall has been part of the residential campus for the last 50 years, and 
students continually repaint it with graffiti and slogans.[184] The university 
can house up to 1,600 students on campus.[185] First-year students are 
required to live on campus during their first two semesters. A lottery 
system matches second to fourth-year students with dormitories and another 
lottery system determines how many students are allowed to live in off-campus 
housing. Housing options include dormitories, small living units, fraternities, 
and cooperative housing.[186] Thomson, Bashford, Stuyvesant, and Smith 
Halls are large mid-rise dormitories on campus. Welch Hall is designated 
as a "quiet" dorm for honors students.[187] Hayes Hall is an all-female 
dorm.[188] Approximately 200 non-freshmen students live in Small Living 
Units (SLUs), which are co-ops united voluntarily to meet shared economic, 
social, and cultural needs and aspirations in democratically controlled 
houses. The houses allow students to live cooperatively with one another 
by sharing regularly scheduled house chores, participating in the decision 
process, and, in some, sharing the cooking duties. Each unit houses a group 
of 10-17 students, and is organized to promote a common theme, usually 
indicated by the co-op's name. As of the 2013–2014 academic year, the SLUs 
consist of The Peace and Justice House, The Citizens of the World House, 
The House of Black Culture, The Sexuality and Gender Equality House, The 
Modern Foreign Language House, The House of Thought, The Tree House, and 
The Interfaith House. The University owns these houses; the co-ops, therefore, 
must follow the University's living policies. The co-ops do, however, elect 
their own members and do not have Resident Advisers or faculty in residence 
like other on-campus residence halls. They have a House Moderator who is 
selected by Residential Life and undergoes the same training as a Resident 
Advisor. At the end of each calendar year, every existing and potential 
co-op must submit a house proposal describing its plans for theme promotion 
for the next academic year. The University Housing office places co-ops 
in houses every year on a competitive basis.[189] Off-campus housing is 
available only to junior and senior students, and students residing in 
Delaware, OH while living with their spouse or direct family; 17% of students 
live off-campus.[185][190] Most students assert Ohio Wesleyan's policy 
of off-campus housing as one of the "worst things" about Ohio Wesleyan 
because of the resulting shortage of the number of lottery tickets allowing 
people to live off due to the off-campus lottery cap.[191] Ohio Wesleyan 
participates in the NCAA's Division III as a member of the North Coast 
Athletic Conference (NCAC). Known as the Battling Bishops, Ohio Wesleyan 
competes in 21 sports.[192] The official school colors are red and black.[193] 
Formal athletics at the college date to 1875, when the first football teams 
were organized to play against other institutions. In the late 1880s, Ohio 
Wesleyan had perhaps the strongest amateur baseball team in the state of 
Ohio behind the pitching of Phil "Lefty" Saylor. The school joined the 
Ohio Athletic Conference along with Oberlin College, Kenyon College, Ohio 
State, and Case Western in 1902. In 1983, Ohio Wesleyan joined with nine 
other colleges in Ohio, Indiana and Pennsylvania to create the North Coast 
Athletic Conference.[194] The NCAC seeks to bring together a group of liberal 
arts institutions that value the primacy of the academic mission over the 
athletic one.[195] The men's lacrosse, golf and soccer teams are the most 
historically successful of the varsity teams, and soccer is the university's 
most intently followed sport.[196][197] For seven of the last twelve years, 
Ohio Wesleyan has won the NCAC conference All-Sports Trophy for excellence 
in both women's and men's sports.[198] In the Sears Director's Cup standings, 
OWU is among the top 25 overall collegiate athletics programs in the country.[199] 
Because of the North Coast Athletic Association athletic agreement, the 
university is not permitted to offer academic scholarships for athletic 
recruiting.[200] Ohio Wesleyan has won five NCAA Division III Championships, 
including men's basketball (1988), men's soccer (1998 and 2011), and women's 
soccer (2001 and 2002). In addition, Ohio Wesleyan's varsity athletic teams 
have been NCAC champions over 100 times,[196] leading the teams of Denison 
University and Kenyon College.[201] The nickname The Battling Bishops dates 
to 1925. This is also the name of the university's mascot, The Battling 
Bishop. Due to its ironic name, the mascot has been listed as one of the 
weirdest college mascots.[202] Due to its red robe, The Battling Bishop 
looks actually like a Cardinal.[203] Before 1925, Ohio Wesleyan's teams 
were referred to as "The Red and Black" and "The Methodists". Many schools, 
including several other Methodist ones, also claimed crimson and black 
as their colors, so the university decided to change the name.[204] Ohio 
Wesleyan maintains athletic rivalries with other NCAC institutions. The 
men's lacrosse team has a historic rivalry with Denison University, the 
football team with Wittenberg University, the soccer team with Kenyon College, 
and the field hockey team with Oberlin College.[205] Both Denison and Ohio 
Wesleyan issued alerts to their fans specifically for the OWU-Denison lacrosse 
game about unsportsmanlike behavior and profanity.[206] In addition to 
the school's varsity athletics, club sports teams, including ultimate frisbee, 
chess, hockey, cricket, rugby, ski, and scuba, have been organized as student 
organizations under the auspices of the Office of Student Activities. Ohio 
Wesleyan's intramural program includes 16 sports. Sports such as skiing, 
squash and water polo have been offered, as well as a sports trivia competition.[207] 
"Oh we're from dear old Wesleyan" is Ohio Wesleyan University's primary 
fight song. The song's lyrics were written in 1914 by Chass Cupett '1916.[208] 
Under the charter granted by the State of Ohio, the Board of Trustees possesses 
the legal authority to operate the college. The charter and bylaws stipulate 
a board of 34 trustees, of whom one is the president. In general, it is 
the board that elects the president. Since Ohio Wesleyan's beginnings, 
sixteen people have held the title of president, and a few have served 
as interim president. Former presidents include lawyers, literary scholars, 
politicians, executives, and clergymen.[209] After several disagreements 
between Huddleston and the Ohio Wesleyan administration,[210] Huddleston 
accepted a position as president of the University of New Hampshire and 
left Ohio Wesleyan on June 30, 2007, giving him the second shortest presidency, 
behind David Lockmiller, 1959–1961. On May 29, 2007, the appointment of 
current university provost Dr. David O. Robbins as interim president was 
unanimously endorsed by OWU's Board of Trustees.[211] Dr. Robbins' term 
as Interim President began on July 1, 2007.[211] On December 17, 2007, 
Dr. Rockwell "Rock" Jones was elected to serve as the 16th president of 
Ohio Wesleyan University.[212] Dr. Jones' inauguration ceremony took place 
on October 10, 2008 in Ohio Wesleyan's Grey Chapel, in University Hall. 
Ohio Wesleyan alumni are active in several annual events, organizations, 
and initiatives. The events and associations with significant alumni involvement 
are Homecoming, 'W' Association, and A/PART (the alumni admission team). 
For the 2005–2006 fiscal year, Ohio Wesleyan's alumni giving rate was 35%.[213] 
A number of the school's alumni have made notable contributions in the 
fields of government, law, academia, business, arts, journalism, and athletics, 
among others. In academia, Frank Sherwood Rowland (class of 1948) won the 
1995 Nobel Prize for chemistry for his research on the depletion of the 
Earth's ozone layer. Ezra Vogel (1950) is a prominent author on China-Japan 
issues and was the director of Harvard's Fairbank Center for East Asian 
Research from 1995 to 1999.[214] William Hsiao (1963) is an economist in 
the field of international health at Harvard,[215] and the designer of 
a landmark study to examine the United States' system of reimbursing physicians 
for medical services. Dennis R. Appleyard (1961) is the author of an international 
economics textbook.[216] Norman Vincent Peale In politics, John Wesley 
Hoyt (1849) was the third Governor of the Wyoming Territory,[217] Charles 
Fairbanks (1872) was the 26th Vice-President of the United States.[218] 
Jo Ann Emerson (1972) serves as a U.S. Representative from Missouri.[219] 
Arthur Flemming (1927) was a Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, 
was known for his commitment to civil rights,[220] was the recipient of 
two Presidential Medals of Freedom, and served as president of University 
of Oregon, Ohio Wesleyan University, and Macalester College. Lucy Webb 
Hayes (1853), wife of U.S. President Rutherford B. Hayes, was the first 
woman to be called First Lady, and the first First Lady to hold a college 
degree.[221] Notable journalists and media personalities include Frank 
Stanton (1930), a president of CBS known for supporting broadcast journalism 
before Congress; Byron Pitts (1982), a national correspondent for CBS News;[222] 
Wendie Malick (1972), an Emmy-nominated actress known for her role on the 
NBC sitcom Just Shoot Me! and now as "Victoria Chase" on the TV Land sitcom 
"Hot in Cleveland";[223] Melvin Van Peebles (1953), an actor, director, 
screenwriter, playwright, and composer; Patricia Wettig (1974), the actress 
who plays vice president Caroline Richards on Prison Break; and Clark Gregg 
(1984), the actor playing Richard in The New Adventures of Old Christine 
with Julia Louis-Dreyfus.[224] Numerous Ohio Wesleyan alumni have been 
associated with social justice. Branch Rickey (1904) was a baseball manager 
and executive known for signing Jackie Robinson as the first African-American 
in Major League Baseball.[225] Another graduate, Mary King (1962), worked 
alongside the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in the U.S. civil rights 
movement when she was a young student, and was a member of the staff of 
the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC).[161] Rev. Norman 
Vincent Peale (1920) was the author of The Power of Positive Thinking and 
the winner of a Presidential Medal of Freedom for his theological contributions.[226] 
Others found fame in other forms: Mildred Elizabeth Sisk (aka Axis Sally) 
was the first American woman to be tried and sentenced for treason, convicted 
of broadcasting for Nazi Germany during World War II. In 1917, she majored 
in dramatic arts, but did not graduate due to her failure to meet all university 
requirements. After serving a 12-year sentence, Sisk returned to OWU, where 
she received a bachelor's degree in speech in 1973.[227] Coordinates: 40°17′48″N
