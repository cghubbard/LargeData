The Women's Softball World Championship[1] is a fastpitch softball tournament 
for women's national teams held historically every four years, now every 
two years, by the World Baseball Softball Confederation (WBSC). The tournament, 
originally known as the ISF Women's World Championship, was sanctioned 
by the International Softball Federation (ISF) until that body's 2013 merger 
with the International Baseball Federation to create the WBSC. The number 
of teams in the tournament began at five in its inaugural event in 1965, 
went to a high of 28 for the 1994 edition, and now the WBSC Code legislates 
that the maximum number of teams that may participate is 16. There are 
qualifying tournaments that determine which countries will play at the 
World Championship. A women's softball world championship predates the 
ISF's event. A championship was held in Canada between several American 
and Canadian teams in 1952 and 1953.[2] Australia had also hosted an international 
tournament that predated the first Women's World Championship.[3][4] In 
1965, the first ISF Women's World Championship was held in Melbourne, with 
games being played at Albert Park.[5][6][7] Five nations competed at the 
inaugural championships including the United States, Japan and Australia, 
which Australia won 1-0 in a final game against the United States.[6][7][8] 
In the game, Australia was held to only two hits while the United States 
had four.[7] Lorraine Woolley was named the player of the tournament.[7] 
The inaugural men's championship would occur one year later in Mexico.[5] 
In 1970, ten countries participated. The Japanese won competition after 
having twelve consecutive wins and beating the Americans 3-0 in a final 
game spectated by 30,000 people.[8] In 1974, the Americans knocked out 
the Australians during the semi-finals, when they beat them by a score 
of 6-0.[9] Chinese Taipei's leadership discussed inviting China to compete 
at the 1982 competition which was the country was hosting. Ching-khou and 
Wang Shen supported mainland China's participation in the event and an 
invitation was issued but the Chinese government elected to not send a 
team.[10] The 1990 edition was the seventh to be held, with six different 
countries having played hosts to the competition.[11] Teams that competed 
in 1990 included the USA, New Zealand, China, Australia, Chinese Taipei, 
Japan, Canada, Italy, Netherlands, Cuba, Puerto Rico, Philippines, Bahamas, 
Netherlands Antilles, Mexico, Aruba, Bermuda, Indonesia, Argentina, and 
Zimbabwe.[12] The United States took home gold, New Zealand silver and 
China bronze.[12] The Soviet Union had a representative attend the 1990 
competition and promise that a Soviet side would be competing at the next 
championships.[12] The 2006 edition was very important as the Championships 
were used for Olympic qualifying, with the top four finishers going to 
the Olympic Games. In 2006, the fourth-place finishers automatically qualified 
to the Games because China was the Olympic Games based on that. Thus, there 
was a battle for fifth place between Canada and Italy for Olympic qualifications. 
In the match for fifth, Canada won 3-0 and earned their fourth consecutive 
trip to the Olympics.[13] A world championships is just as tough as any 
Olympics you attend, the only thing different is at the Olympics you just 
don't have the same magnitude of hype around it. Teams that will be competing 
at the 2012 edition include Australia, Canada and Japan who will play in 
the same pool.[14][15] The competition was scheduled to act as a replacement 
for the Olympics.[14] Australia won the competition in 1965. The victory 
was considered very impressive as they beat the Americans, who invented 
the game in 1887, to win the championship.[16] The 1974 and 1978 editions 
were won by the United States, the American side also won seven championships 
in a row from 1988 to 2010,[17][18][19][20] with the USA's most recent 
victory being a 7â€“0 win over Japan in the finals.[19] Other countries that 
have won it include Japan in 1970, 2012 and 2014, and New Zealand in 1982.[21] 
Teams that have finished second include the USA in 1965, 1970, 2012 and 
2014, Japan in 1974, 2002, 2006 and 2010, Canada in 1978, Taiwan in 1982, 
China in 1986 and 1994, New Zealand in 1990, and Australia in 1998.[19][21] 
Countries that have finished third include the Philippines in 1970. The 
1970 edition was hosted by Japan in Osaka.[21] The 1974 edition was played 
in Stratford, United States.[21] The 1978 games were played in San Salvador, 
El Salvador.[21] The 1982 competition was hosted by in Chinese Taipei in 
Taipei.[10][21] The 1986 edition was hosted by New Zealand and held in 
Auckland.[20][21][23] In 1990, the competition was played in Normal, Illinois.[20][21] 
The 1994 edition was played in St. John's, Newfoundland.[20][21][24] Japan 
hosted the 1998 competition in Fujinomiya.[20][21] The 2002 Championships 
were held in Saskatoon, Canada.[21] China hosted the 2006 Championships 
in Beijing.[21] The 2010 edition was hosted by Venezuela. The 2012 championship

in Haarlem, Netherlands. The 2016 Tournament will be held in Surrey, British
