Coach James Christopher "Chris" Maloney (born September 6, 1961) is the 
third-base coach for the St. Louis Cardinals of Major League Baseball. 
A former minor league first baseman and outfielder, he spent the 2011 season 
as the skipper of the Memphis Redbirds of the Pacific Coast League, his 
fifth consecutive season as manager of the Cardinals' Triple-A farm club 
before his hiring, on November 16, 2011, to serve on the 2012 staff of 
Cardinals' manager Mike Matheny.[1] Maloney was born on September 6, 1961, 
in Jackson, Mississippi. He graduated from St. Joseph High School in Jackson 
and from Mississippi State University.[2] He was nicknamed "The Hammer" 
and "Wally Pipp" during his MSU playing days for his smooth stroke and 
for being the starting first baseman on State's 1983 squad before contracting 
a stomach virus early in that campaign. College Baseball Hall of Fame member 
and MLB All-Star Will Clark took over for the ailing Maloney at first and 
started every game from mid-1983 through the semifinals of the 1985 NCAA 
World Series for the Bulldogs. His father, J. Con Maloney, was the longtime 
owner of the Jackson Mets and Jackson Generals of the Texas League, and 
a co-owner (with Nolan Ryan and family) of Round Rock Baseball, owners 
of the Round Rock Express. Chris has a brother, Mark, who is a partner 
with the law firm King & Spalding. Maloney signed with the New York Mets 
in 1983 and played four seasons of minor league baseball in the Mets and 
Cardinals organizations, never rising above the Class A level. In his finest 
season, 1984 with the Columbia Mets of the South Atlantic League, he batted 
.324 in 173 at bats with three home runs and 24 runs batted in. A switch-hitter 
who threw right-handed, Maloney stood 5'11" (1.8 m) and weighed 180 pounds 
(82 kg) during his playing career. Maloney became a minor league manager 
in the Cardinals' system in 1991 with the Rookie-level Johnson City Cardinals 
of the Appalachian League. In 18 seasons (1991–96; 1998–2009) as a manager, 
his teams have won 1,191 games and lost 1,121 (.515) with two league championships 
— including the 2009 PCL playoff title. With the exception of three seasons 
(2002–04) as manager of the New Orleans Zephyrs, top farm club of the Houston 
Astros at the time, all of those years have been spent with the Cardinals' 
organization. He was announced as taking the job as first-base coach for 
the St. Louis Cardinals on Nov. 16, 2011.[1] He was named 3B coach after 
Jose Oquendo was placed on medical leave of absence on March 27, 2016.[3]
