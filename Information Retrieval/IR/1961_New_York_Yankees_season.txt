The 1961 New York Yankees season was the 59th season for the team in New 
York, and its 61st season overall. The team finished with a record of 109â€“53, 
eight games ahead of the Detroit Tigers, and won their 26th American League 
pennant. New York was managed by Ralph Houk. The Yankees played their home 
games at Yankee Stadium. In the World Series, they defeated the Cincinnati 
Reds in 5 games. The 1961 Yankees are often mentioned as a candidate for 
the unofficial title of greatest baseball team in history. The 1961 season 
was notable for the race between center fielder Mickey Mantle and right 
fielder Roger Maris to break Babe Ruth's record of 60 home runs in a season 
(set in 1927). Maris eventually broke the record, hitting his 61st home 
run on October 1, the season's final day. During the season, Maris had 
seven multi-home run games; in a doubleheader against the Chicago White 
Sox, he hit four home runs. Nineteen sixty-one was an expansion year, with 
the American League increasing from eight to ten teams, the first expansion 
in the 61-year history of the league. The old schedule of 154 games (seven 
opponents multiplied by 22 games apiece) was replaced by 162 games (nine 
opponents multiplied by 18 games apiece) which led to some controversy 
due to the eight extra games that Maris had to try to hit 61. Maris' major 
league record stood for 37 years, three years longer than Ruth's, before 
it was broken by Mark McGwire of the St. Louis Cardinals in 1998. However, 
Maris' 61 home runs remains the American League single season record. In 
addition to the individual exploits of Maris and Mantle, the '61 Yankees 
hit a major league record 240 home runs. The record stood until 1996 when 
the Baltimore Orioles, with the added benefit of the designated hitter, 
hit 257 home runs as a team. In 1961, the American League expanded from 
eight to ten teams, generally watering down the pitching, but leaving the 
Yankees pretty much intact.[citation needed] Yankee home runs began to 
come at a record pace. One famous photograph lined up six 1961 Yankee players, 
including Mantle, Maris, Yogi Berra, Elston Howard, Johnny Blanchard, and 
Bill Skowron, under the nickname "Murderers Row", because they hit a combined 
207 home runs that year. The title "Murderers Row", originally coined in 
1918, had most famously been used to refer to the Yankees side of the late 
1920s. As mid-season approached, it seemed quite possible that either Maris 
or Mantle, or perhaps both, would break Babe Ruth's 34-year-old home run 
record. Unlike the home run race of 1998, in which the competition between 
Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa was given extensive positive media coverage, 
sportswriters in 1961 began to play the "M&M Boys" against each other, 
inventing a rivalry where none existed, as Yogi Berra has testified in 
recent interviews. The 1961 home run race between Maris and Mantle was 
dramatized in the 2001 film 61*, filmed under the direction of Billy Crystal.
