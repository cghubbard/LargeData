As player As manager Alexander Peter Grammas (born April 3, 1926) is a 
former Major League infielder and manager. A native of Birmingham, Alabama, 
Grammas played in the National League for the St. Louis Cardinals, Cincinnati 
Redlegs and the Chicago Cubs. He finished his career with a .969 overall 
fielding percentage. He was not usually an everyday player, playing as 
a reserve with the Reds and Cubs. Grammas served as the third base coach 
for the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1965–69. He began his big-league managerial 
career when he was brought in to finish out the Pirates' 1969 season after 
Larry Shepard was fired as the team's manager. Although Grammas guided 
the Bucs to a 4-1 finish, Danny Murtaugh took over as the team's manager 
in 1970. Grammas then returned to the Cincinnati Reds as third base coach 
under Sparky Anderson, spending six seasons in that post during the "Big 
Red Machine" era, including service on Cincinnati's 1972 National League 
champions and the 1975 world champions. After the Milwaukee Brewers fired 
Del Crandall as manager near the end of the 1975 season, his place was 
taken on an interim basis by Harvey Kuenn. But following the 1975 World 
Series, the Brewers set their sights on Grammas as their next skipper, 
and signed him to a three-year contract in November 1975. Milwaukee Brewers 
President Bud Selig said that Grammas was the only manager they wanted. 
He added, "There is no question in our mind, we got the best man available. 
In the years I've been in baseball, never has anybody been recommended 
by as broad a spectrum of people as Alex Grammas." [1] Grammas was, however, 
unable to bring the success he had seen with the Reds to Milwaukee. In 
1976 and 1977, Grammas led the Brewers to consecutive sixth-place finishes 
in the American League Eastern Division, in which the Brewers finished 
32 and 33 games, respectively, out of first place. Only the expansion 1977 
Toronto Blue Jays, who lost 107 games in their inaugural season, kept the 
Brewers from consecutive last-place finishes under Grammas.[2] A 10-5 start 
in 1976 led Sports Illustrated to publish a story praising Grammas'positive 
attitude and mental approach to the game.[3] But the Brewers faded soon 
thereafter, losing 22 of their last 26 games.[4] Internal signs of trouble 
were evident by mid-season in 1977. With the Brewers at 39-45, Brewers 
reserve first baseman Mike Hegan, who was dissatisfied with his playing 
time under Grammas, made national news by saying "Grammas is a nice guy, 
but as a manager, he makes a good third base coach". Hegan added, "I think 
that we all expected that, when he came over here, he was going to provide 
motivation and leadership...but that hasn't happened".[5] Grammas, for 
his part said some players were not putting out as much effort as they 
had earlier in the season, that every team has players who "cop out", including 
the Brewers, that the team had not played up to its potential, and that 
"I would say there have been times that we could have put out a lot harder".[6] 
After this point, the Brewers went 27-50. On November 21, 1977, Brewers 
President Bud Selig fired both Grammas and General Manager Jim Baumer.[7] 
Grammas ended his managerial career with a record of 137-191. Grammas then 
returned to the coaching ranks and the Reds in 1978 as a member of Anderson's 
staff; then, after Anderson's controversial firing, coached under Bobby 
Cox with the 1979 Atlanta Braves. In mid-June of 1979, Anderson was hired 
as skipper of the Detroit Tigers, and during Anderson's first off-season 
as Detroit's manager, he added Grammas to his staff as third base coach, 
where Grammas served for 12 consecutive years (1980–91), including the 
Tigers' 1984 world championship season. Grammas's family origins are from
