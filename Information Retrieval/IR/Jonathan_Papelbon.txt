Jonathan Robert Papelbon (/ˈpæpəlbɒn/; born November 23, 1980) is an American 
professional baseball relief pitcher who is currently a free agent. He 
has played for the Boston Red Sox, with whom he reached four consecutive 
Major League Baseball All-Star Games from 2006 to 2009, won the 2007 Major 
League Baseball Delivery Man Award, and was a 2007 World Series champion, 
as well as the Philadelphia Phillies from 2012 to 2015, and the Washington 
Nationals from 2015 to 2016. He has worn uniform number 58 throughout his 
career. After moving from Baton Rouge, Louisiana, Papelbon attended high 
school in Jacksonville, Florida, where he played at Bishop Kenny High School 
and earned All-City accolades prior to attending Mississippi State to play 
college baseball. Subsequently, in 2003, the Boston Red Sox drafted him 
in the 4th round of the 2003 Major League Baseball Draft, and he played 
three seasons of minor league baseball before breaking into the major leagues. 
His effectiveness as a pitcher used to center on above-average velocity 
and deceptive breaking balls that fooled hitters. Papelbon was born in 
Baton Rouge, Louisiana. His mother, Sheila, played volleyball and softball 
at Louisiana State University.[1][2] His father, John, spent time as the 
Deputy Director of the Ted Williams Museum and Hitters Hall of Fame in 
St. Petersburg, Florida.[3] Jonathan is the older brother of twins Josh 
Papelbon, former pitcher for the Brockton Rox, and Jeremy Papelbon, former 
pitcher for the Tennessee Smokies, the double-A affiliate of the Chicago 
Cubs. Papelbon was a three-time All-City honoree while playing in high 
school for Bishop Kenny High School in Jacksonville, Florida.[4] He was 
primarily a first baseman in high school, but he also pitched when needed, 
throwing two no-hitters as a senior.[5] Early in his senior year, he committed 
to play college baseball for Mississippi State University.[6] Papelbon 
was a closer for the Mississippi State Bulldogs. He had a 9–6 record, 13 
saves, and 2.90 ERA in his three years on the team in relief. During his 
time at MSU, the Bulldogs appeared in the 2001 and 2003 NCAA Tournaments 
and won the 2001 SEC Tournament. In the summer after his freshman year, 
Papelbon played with the Silver Spring-Takoma Park Thunderbolts in suburban 
D.C. The team is a part of a wooden bat league for college players. During 
the subsequent summers of his college career Papelbon played for the Danville 
Dans, a summer baseball team located in Danville, Illinois. Soon after 
arriving in Danville he easily became a crowd favorite and led the team 
to a CICL championship. In the 2002 MLB draft, the Oakland Athletics selected 
Papelbon with a 40th-round draft pick.[7] Oakland's 2002 draft became known 
as the "Moneyball draft" after the team's scouting strategies were featured 
in a book and movie with that name. The team was taking a chance with the 
pick in the hopes that Papelbon would agree to leave Mississippi State 
after his junior year, but Athletics scouting director Eric Kubota said 
that Papelbon was firm in his decision to return to school. Papelbon graduated 
from Mississippi State in 2003.[8] Papelbon was drafted by the Boston Red 
Sox in the fourth round of the 2003 Major League Baseball draft.[9] Papelbon 
began his minor league career as a starting pitcher for the Lowell Spinners 
of the New York–Penn League. In 13 games (6 started), he had a 1–2 record, 
a 6.34 ERA, 36 strikeouts, and 9 walks in 32 2⁄3 innings pitched.[10] After 
a 13–10 record for Class-A Lowell Spinners and Sarasota Red Sox from 2003–04, 
Papelbon was 5–2 in 14 starts for Double-A Portland in 2005. Promoted to 
Triple-A Pawtucket, he went 1–2 with a 3.57 ERA in four starts, walking 
two and striking out 21 in 22 1⁄3 innings.[11] Papelbon made his major 
league debut with the Red Sox on July 31, 2005 against the Minnesota Twins, 
in which he went 5 1⁄3 innings, struck out seven batters, and issued five 
walks in Boston's 4–3 victory.[12] He did not receive a decision.[13] He 
earned his first major league win on September 12, 2005, pitching three 
scoreless innings in an extra-inning game against the Toronto Blue Jays.[13] 
In two postseason appearances in 2005, he pitched four scoreless innings 
against the eventual World Series Champion Chicago White Sox. The Red Sox 
had plans of slotting Papelbon into their starting rotation prior to the 
regular season in 2006.[14] However, the incumbent closer, Keith Foulke, 
proved to be ineffective trying to come back from an injury-plagued 2005.[15] 
In April 2006, he changed his hair to a Mohawk style, after Charlie Sheen's 
character Ricky Vaughn from the film Major League due to a wager with teammate 
Kevin Youkilis in which they bet whether he could start the season with 
10 scoreless innings.[16] On April 5, the second game of the 2006 season, 
Papelbon recorded his first career save in Texas.[10] On April 29, 2006, 
he set a major league record with his 10th save, against the Tampa Bay 
Devil Rays. No rookie in major league baseball history had recorded that 
many saves in the month of April.[17] In early September, Papelbon injured 
his shoulder. When the Red Sox were eliminated from playoff contention, 
he was shut down for the remainder of the season to rest. The team considered 
using Papelbon as a starter due to his shoulder problems, but he was moved 
back to the bullpen before the start of the 2007 season and remained the 
team's closer.[18] The 25-year-old closer finished 2006 with one of the 
most dominant seasons ever for a rookie reliever. Papelbon saved 35 games, 
struck out 75 batters in 68 innings, and held opposing batters to a .167 
batting average.[10] On October 11, 2007, Papelbon was named the 2007 winner 
of the "DHL Presents the Major League Baseball Delivery Man of the Year 
Award."[10] Papelbon garnered 39,043 votes out of almost 125,000 votes 
cast.[19] In Game 2 of the World Series, Papelbon was brought in with the 
bases empty and two outs in the eighth with the Red Sox leading 2–1 to 
face Rockies hitter Matt Holliday. Papelbon gave up a single to Holliday 
before picking him off to end the inning. Papelbon pitched a one-two-three 
ninth for the save. In Game 4, he entered in the eighth inning to shut 
down the Rockies' comeback, and pitched until the ninth inning where he 
threw the game-winning strikeout for the Red Sox as they clinched the 2007 
championship.[20] He and catcher Jason Varitek then collided in a victory 
jump.[20] On March 6, 2008, Papelbon agreed to terms with the Red Sox for 
$775,000. Papelbon's deal set the record for the largest contract for a 
closer not eligible for salary arbitration, topping Mariano Rivera's previous 
record by $25,000. Boston was under no obligation to pay Papelbon more 
than the league minimum of $390,000.[21] On January 20, 2009, Papelbon 
agreed to a one-year $6.25 million contract with the Red Sox, avoiding 
arbitration. This is the largest contract for a closer in his first year 
of arbitration eligibility.[22] Papelbon recorded his 100th career save 
on July 13, 2008.[23] Among pitchers who have thrown at least 200 innings, 
Jonathan Papelbon's 0.930 WHIP through 2008 is the lowest in major league 
history.[24] Papelbon criticized former teammate Manny Ramirez in the April 
2009 issue of Esquire magazine, citing his selfishness and incapability 
of working with his teammates.[25][26] On June 29, 2009, Papelbon gained 
his 132nd save, in a 4–0 shut out against the Baltimore Orioles, tying 
Bob Stanley's record for most saves by a Red Sox pitcher. On July 1, Papelbon 
recorded his 133rd save with the Red Sox, setting a new franchise record. 
On July 5, 2009, Jonathan was selected to represent Boston at the 2009 
All-Star Game. Papelbon has been cited repeatedly for his slow play; on 
September 4, 2009 it was reported that he had been fined $5,000 for failing 
to deliver his first pitch within the required time in a September 1 appearance. 
Papelbon told the Boston Herald that he had been cited on at least five 
occasions and fined more than $10,000 for these violations. Papelbon jokingly 
added, "I think they're going to call my parole officer and put me away."[27] 
In Game 3 of the 2009 ALDS, with Boston down two games to none, Papelbon 
blew the save and Boston was swept. He allowed four hits and three runs; 
all of the runs scored with two outs.[28] His difficulties continued into 
the next season. In 2010, he blew eight saves (including one against the 
Yankees on May 17, 2010, where he allowed four earned runs and a walk-off 
home run for the first time in his career), leaving open the possibility 
that he might be traded. The Red Sox ended up keeping Papelbon as their 
closer, and his productivity improved over the 2011 season. On June 7, 
2011, Papelbon recorded his 200th career save against the New York Yankees, 
and achieved the mark in the fewest number of appearances (359), beating 
Mariano Rivera's mark in 382 appearances.[29] For the 2011 season, Papelbon 
recorded 31 saves in 34 opportunities. He blew just 3 saves all season 
long, but 2 occurred during the final month of the season, including the 
final game of the 2011 regular season; the Red Sox and Rays tied in the 
standings for the AL Wild Card, and Papelbon blew a 3–2 lead against the 
Baltimore Orioles and allowed them a walk-off 4–3 win. Just moments later, 
the Rays won their game against the Yankees with a walk-off home run by 
Evan Longoria to clinch the Wild Card, capping off a nine-game comeback 
in the standings against Boston and officially eliminating them from the 
playoffs. Following the 2011 World Series, Papelbon became a free agent. 
On November 11, 2011, Papelbon reportedly reached an agreement with the 
Philadelphia Phillies on a four-year, $50 million contract with a vesting 
option for a fifth year, bringing the total contract value to $60 million. 
He was signed to fill the role of former closer Ryan Madson who left to 
join the Reds.[30][31] The deal became official on November 14.[32] In 
Papelbon's first game for the Phillies, he had a perfect 9th inning to 
earn the save as the Phillies defeated the Pirates by a score of 1-0 on 
April 5, 2012.[33] Papelbon finished the month of April with a perfect 
8 saves on 8 opportunities. During April, Papelbon started using Metallica's 
song "For Whom The Bell Tolls" as his entrance music.[34] On May 7, Papelbon 
gave up a 3 run homer to Jordany Valdespin in the top of the 9th, giving 
the rival New York Mets a 5-2 lead. The home run was Valdespin's first 
major league hit.[35] Papelbon finished the season with a career high 64 
games finished, 38 saves, 92 strikeouts, and a 2.44 ERA over 70 innings 
pitched.[10] Papelbon finished the 2013 season with 29 saves in 61 games. 
His save total was the lowest of any of his complete MLB seasons to that 
point, and the Phillies finished with a 73-89 win-loss record. Papelbon 
said that he could not remember playing for another losing team.[36] He 
lost more than two miles per hour off of his average fastball velocity, 
and after the season he told a Philadelphia radio show that he had been 
playing with an injured hip.[37] On June 10, Papelbon earned his 300th 
career save in a win against the San Diego Padres, becoming the 26th member 
of the 300 save club. On August 26, Papelbon recorded his 100th save with 
the Philadelphia Phillies becoming tied for 4th on the all-time franchise 
saves list. On September 1, Papelbon was one of four pitchers who combined 
for a no-hitter in the Phillies' 7-0 win over the Atlanta Braves in Turner 
Field. On September 14, 2014, Papelbon blew a save against the Miami Marlins, 
and was booed off the mound by the fans. He subsequently made an obscene 
gesture towards the fans and then got into a confrontation with umpire 
Joe West. He was punished by MLB and suspended for 7 games.[38] On May 
13, Papelbon became the Phillies all-time saves leader with 113 saves.[39] 
Papelbon began to express his discontent with being on the Phillies as 
the trade deadline inched closer.[40] On July 28, 2015, the Phillies traded 
Papelbon to the Washington Nationals for Nick Pivetta.[41] Papelbon assumed 
the role of Nationals' closer from Drew Storen.[42] On September 23, Papelbon 
intentionally threw a pitch at Manny Machado's head. MLB suspended him 
for three games on September 25, but he appealed it.[43] Papelbon and teammate 
Bryce Harper got into an argument during their September 27 game as Harper 
was returning to the dugout following his at bat. The exchange escalated 
and Papelbon grabbed Harper by the throat and then shoved him toward the 
bench with both hands, before the two were separated by teammates.[44] 
The Nationals suspended Papelbon for four games for his role in the altercation 
with Harper, and Papelbon dropped his appeal of the suspension for hitting 
Machado. With seven games remaining for the Nationals, the pair of suspensions 
ended his season.[45] Papelbon finished the season with 7 saves with the 
Nationals, and 24 in total on the season. On December 6, 2015, Papelbon 
filed a grievance complaint against the Nationals organization. During 
the offseason, Storen was traded to the Toronto Blue Jays, cementing Papelbon 
as the team's closer with new manager Dusty Baker coming in. On June 14, 
2016, Papelbon was placed on the 15-day disabled list due to an intercostal 
strain, the first stint on the disabled list in his career.[46] Papelbon 
logged 19 saves with the Nationals in 2016 before the team acquired Mark 
Melancon to supplant him as closer in late July.[47][48] On August 13, 
Papelbon requested and was granted his release from the Nationals.[49] 
Papelbon's velocity has fueled much discussion about his overall value 
as a pitcher. Around 2011, his four-seam fastball reached 95 miles per 
hour (153 km/h),[50] but by 2013, one column on FanGraphs asserted that 
his velocity is "on the down side of that mountain", and that, for a reliever, 
he does not strike out enough hitters. Peter Gammons tweeted that some 
teams were not interested in acquiring Papelbon because of his velocity 
decline as well as poor performance in clutch situations – in 2013, he 
converted only five of nine one-run save opportunities.[51] Papelbon throws 
three pitches.[50] His predominant pitch is the fastball, which he cuts 
with "hard sweeping movement", particularly effectively against left-handed 
hitters.[52] He also throws an occasional two-seam fastball, which averages 
92 miles per hour (148 km/h). Secondarily, he throws a splitter, which 
he utilizes as a strikeout pitch and particularly "works well with the 
fastball".[50] His tertiary pitch is a sweeping slider, the velocity of 
which is around 76 miles per hour (122 km/h).[52] Papelbon and his wife, 
Ashley Jefferies, live in Hattiesburg, Mississippi. Ashley gave birth to 
their first child, a daughter named Parker Alice, on December 27, 2008.[53] 
Ashley gave birth to their son, Gunner Robert, on April 17, 2010.[54] He 
appeared on the Late Show with David Letterman on October 31, 2007, after 
the Red Sox won the 2007 World Series. On December 20, 2007, Papelbon claimed 
that his dog "Boss," chewed up the ball that recorded the final out of 
the 2007 World Series.[55] Papelbon is an avid fan of the Jacksonville 
Jaguars and attends games at EverBank Field after the completion of the
