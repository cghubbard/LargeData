The Shriners Hospitals for Children College Classic is an annual six-team 
college baseball tournament held in Houston and hosted by the Astros Foundation. 
The 15th annual tournament was held at Minute Maid Park in March 2015.[1][2] 
It was initially called Astros College Classic from 2001 through 2002, 
the Minute Maid Park College Classic from 2003 through 2007,[3] and the 
Houston College Classic from 2008 through 2015. In December 2015, the Astros 
Foundation and Shriners Hospitals for Children announced a multi-year naming 
rights agreement for the tournament,[4] rebranding the event the Shriners 
Hospitals for Children College Classic. As part of the agreement with Shriners 
Hospitals for Children, the Astros Foundation announced that the 2016 Shriners 
Hospitals for Children College Classic would be nationally televised for 
the first time in history on MLB Network. The College Classic is seen as 
the start of the college baseball season in Texas.[5] At the end of the 
tournament, a Most Outstanding Player and an All-Tournament Team are announced.[6][7] 
The Houston Cougars of the American Athletic Conference and Rice Owls of 
Conference USA who hold a rivalry, compete in the tournament annually.[8] 
The other four teams invited to the tournament alternate by year. "The 
intensity level is higher in practice because you know you're going to 
play quality people. I don't have to do much motivation to get the guys 
up to play three teams like this and in Minute Maid Park -- it's a major 
league park and guys are excited." Often, teams competing in the Classic 
are highly ranked. In 2002, the Classic involved three teams that ended 
the preceding season ranked in the top 25 of the Baseball Weekly/ESPN, 
Baseball America, and Collegiate Baseball year-end polls: the Rice Owls, 
Texas Tech Red Raiders, and Baylor Bears.[9] The 2005 Classic included 
four top ranked teams: the #11 Baylor Bears, #13 Texas A&M Aggies, #19 
Rice Owls, and #23 Oklahoma State Cowboys.[5] Collegiate Baseball ranked 
all six teams competing in the 2007 Classic: they ranked the Rice Owls 
the top team in college baseball, and also ranked the #8 Vanderbilt Commodores, 
#14 Arizona State Sun Devils, #21 Baylor Bears, and #33 Houston Cougars.[10][11] 
The Texas Longhorns and Rice Owls participated in the Classic when they 
won the College World Series championship in 2002 and 2003, respectively.[5]
