The Commerce Clause describes an enumerated power listed in the United 
States Constitution (Article I, Section 8, Clause 3). The clause states 
that the United States Congress shall have power "To regulate Commerce 
with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian 
Tribes." Courts and commentators have tended to discuss each of these three 
areas of commerce as a separate power granted to Congress.[1] It is common 
to see the individual components of the Commerce Clause referred to under 
specific terms: The Foreign Commerce Clause, the Interstate Commerce Clause,[2] 
and the Indian Commerce Clause. Dispute exists within the courts as to 
the range of powers granted to Congress by the Commerce Clause. As noted 
below, the clause is often paired with the Necessary and Proper Clause, 
the combination used to take a broad, expansive perspective of these powers. 
However, the effect of the Commerce Clause has varied significantly depending 
on the Supreme Court's interpretation. During the Marshall Court era, Commerce 
Clause interpretation empowered Congress to gain jurisdiction over numerous 
aspects of intrastate and interstate commerce as well as non-commerce. 
During the post-1937 era, the use of the Commerce Clause by Congress to 
authorize federal control of economic matters became effectively unlimited. 
Since the latter half of the Rehnquist Court era, Congressional use of 
the Commerce Clause has become slightly restricted again, being limited 
only to matters of trade or any other form of restricted area (whether 
interstate or not) and production (whether commercial or not). The Commerce 
Clause is the source of federal drug prohibition laws under the Controlled 
Substances Act. In the recent medical marijuana case, Gonzales v. Raich, 
the Supreme Court rejected the argument that the ban on growing medical 
marijuana for personal use exceeded Congress' powers under the Commerce 
Clause. Even if no goods were sold or transported across state lines, the 
Court found that there could be an "indirect" effect on interstate commerce. 
In reaching this conclusion, the Court relied heavily on the New Deal era 
case, Wickard v. Filburn, which held that the government may regulate personal 
cultivation and consumption of crops because the aggregate effect of individual 
consumption could have an "indirect" effect on interstate commerce. Article 
I, Section 8, Clause 3:[3] [The Congress shall have Power] To regulate 
Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the 
Indian Tribes; The significance of the Commerce Clause is described in 
the Supreme Court's opinion in Gonzales v. Raich, 545 U.S. 1 (2005):[4][5] 
The Commerce Clause emerged as the Framers' response to the central problem 
giving rise to the Constitution itself: the absence of any federal commerce 
power under the Articles of Confederation. For the first century of our 
history, the primary use of the Clause was to preclude the kind of discriminatory 
state legislation that had once been permissible. Then, in response to 
rapid industrial development and an increasingly interdependent national 
economy, Congress “ushered in a new era of federal regulation under the 
commerce power,” beginning with the enactment of the Interstate Commerce 
Act in 1887 and the Sherman Antitrust Act in 1890. The Commerce Clause 
represents one of the most fundamental powers delegated to the Congress 
by the founders. The outer limits of the Interstate Commerce Clause power 
have been the subject of long, intense political controversy. Interpretation 
of the sixteen words of the Commerce Clause has helped define the balance 
of power between the federal government and the states and the balance 
of power between the two elected branches of the federal government and 
the Judiciary. As such, it directly affects the lives of American citizens. 
The commerce clause provides comprehensive powers to the United States 
over navigable waters. These powers are critical to understanding the rights 
of landowners adjoining or exercising what would otherwise be riparian 
rights under the common law. The Commerce Clause confers a unique position 
upon the Government in connection with navigable waters. "The power to 
regulate commerce comprehends the control for that purpose, and to the 
extent necessary, of all the navigable waters of the United States.... 
For this purpose they are the public property of the nation, and subject 
to all the requisite legislation by Congress." United States v. Rands, 
389 U.S. 121 (1967). The Rands decision continues: This power to regulate 
navigation confers upon the United States a dominant servitude, FPC v. 
Niagara Mohawk Power Corp., 347 U.S. 239, 249 (1954), which extends to 
the entire stream and the stream bed below ordinary high-water mark. The 
proper exercise of this power is not an invasion of any private property 
rights in the stream or the lands underlying it, for the damage sustained 
does not result from taking property from riparian owners within the meaning 
of the Fifth Amendment but from the lawful exercise of a power to which 
the interests of riparian owners have always been subject. United States 
v. Chicago, M., St. P. & P. R. Co., 312 U.S. 592, 596–597 (1941); Gibson 
v. United States, 166 U.S. 269, 275–276 (1897). Thus, without being constitutionally 
obligated to pay compensation, the United States may change the course 
of a navigable stream, South Carolina v. Georgia, 93 U.S. 4 (1876), or 
otherwise impair or destroy a riparian owner's access to navigable waters, 
Gibson v. United States, 166 U.S. 269 (1897); Scranton v. Wheeler, 179 
U.S. 141 (1900); United States v. Commodore Park, Inc., 324 U.S. 386 (1945), 
even though the market value of the riparian owner's land is substantially 
diminished. Other scholars, such as Robert H. Bork and Daniel E. Troy, 
argue that prior to 1887, the Commerce Clause was rarely invoked by Congress, 
and thus a broad interpretation of the word "commerce" was clearly never 
intended by the Founders. In support of this claim, they argue that the 
word "commerce", as used in the Constitutional Convention and the Federalist 
Papers, can be substituted with either "trade" or "exchange" interchangeably 
while preserving the meaning of the statements. They also point to Madison's 
statement in an 1828 letter that the "Constitution vests in Congress expressly...'the 
power to regulate trade'."[6][7] Examining contemporaneous dictionaries 
does not neatly resolve the matter. For instance, the 1792 edition of Samuel 
Johnson's A Dictionary of the English Language defines the noun "commerce" 
narrowly as "[e]xchange of one thing for another; interchange of any thing; 
trade; traffick", but it defines the corresponding verb "to commerce" more 
broadly as "[t]o hold intercourse."[8] The word "intercourse" also had 
a different and wider meaning back in 1792 than it does now. Chief Justice 
John Marshall ruled in Gibbons v. Ogden that the power to regulate interstate 
commerce also included the power to regulate interstate navigation: "Commerce, 
undoubtedly is traffic, but it is something more—it is intercourse ... 
[A] power to regulate navigation is as expressly granted, as if that term 
had been added to the word 'commerce' ... [T]he power of Congress does 
not stop at the jurisdictional lines of the several states. It would be 
a very useless power if it could not pass those lines." The Court's decision 
contains language supporting one important line of Commerce Clause jurisprudence, 
the idea that the electoral process of representative government represents 
the primary limitation on the exercise of the Commerce Clause powers: The 
wisdom and the discretion of Congress, their identity with the people, 
and the influence which their constituents possess at elections, are, in 
this, as in many other instances, as that, for example, of declaring war, 
the sole restraints on which they have relied, to secure them from its 
abuse. They are the restraints on which the people must often rely solely, 
in all representative governments.... In Gibbons, the Court struck down 
New York's attempt to grant a steamboat monopoly to Robert Fulton, which 
he had then ultimately franchised to Ogden. Ogden claimed river traffic 
was not "commerce" under the Commerce Clause and further that Congress 
could not interfere with New York State's grant of an exclusive monopoly 
within its own borders. Ogden's assertion was untenable: he contended New 
York could control river traffic within New York all the way to the border 
with New Jersey, that New Jersey could control river traffic within New 
Jersey all the way to the border with New York, leaving Congress with the 
power to control the traffic as it crossed the state line. Thus, Ogden 
contended, Congress could not invalidate his monopoly as long as he only 
transported passengers within New York. The Supreme Court, however, found 
that Congress could invalidate his monopoly since it was operational on 
an interstate channel of navigation. In its decision, the Court assumed 
interstate commerce required movement of the subject of regulation across 
state borders. The decision contains the following principles, some of 
which have since been altered by subsequent decisions: Additionally, the 
Marshall Court limited the extent of federal maritime and admiralty jurisdiction 
to tidewaters in The Steamboat Thomas Jefferson.[9] In Cherokee Nation 
v. Georgia, 30 U.S. 1 (1831), the Supreme Court addressed whether the Cherokee 
nation is a foreign state in the sense in which that term is used in the 
constitution. The Court provided a definition of Indian tribe that clearly 
made the rights of tribes far inferior to those of foreign states. In part 
the court said: "Though the Indians are acknowledged to have an unquestionable, 
and, heretofore, unquestioned right to the lands they occupy, until that 
right shall be extinguished by a voluntary cession to our government; yet 
it may well be doubted whether those tribes which reside within the acknowledged 
boundaries of the United States can, with strict accuracy, be denominated 
foreign nations. They may, more correctly be denominated domestic dependent 
nations. They occupy a territory to which we assert a title independent 
of their will, which must take effect in point of possession when their 
right of possession ceases. Meanwhile, they are in a state of pupilage. 
Their relation to the United States resembles that of a ward to his guardian." 
As explained in United States v. Lopez, 514 U.S. 549 (1995), "For nearly 
a century thereafter (that is, after Gibbons), the Court's Commerce Clause 
decisions dealt but rarely with the extent of Congress' power, and almost 
entirely with the Commerce Clause as a limit on state legislation that 
discriminated against interstate commerce.[10] Under this line of precedent, 
the Court held that certain categories of activity such as "exhibitions", 
"production", "manufacturing", and "mining" were within the province of 
state governments, and thus were beyond the power of Congress under the 
Commerce Clause. When Congress began to engage in economic regulation on 
a national scale, the Court's dormant Commerce Clause decisions influenced 
its approach to Congressional regulation. In this context, the Court took 
a formalistic approach, which distinguished between services and commerce, 
manufacturing and commerce, direct and indirect effects on commerce, and 
local and national activities. See concurring opinion of Justice Kennedy 
in United States v. Lopez. ("One approach the Court used to inquire into 
the lawfulness of state authority was to draw content-based or subject-matter 
distinctions, thus defining by semantic or formalistic categories those 
activities that were commerce and those that were not.") The Dormant Commerce 
Clause formalisms spilled over into its Article I jurisprudence. While 
Congress had the power to regulate commerce, it could not regulate manufacturing, 
which was seen as being entirely local. In Kidd v. Pearson, 128 U.S. 1 
(1888), the Court struck a federal law which prohibited the manufacture 
of liquor for shipment across state lines. Similar decisions were issued 
with regard to agriculture, mining, oil production, and generation of electricity. 
In Swift v. United States, 196 U.S. 375 (1905), the Court ruled that the 
clause covered meatpackers; although their activity was geographically 
"local", they had an important effect on the "current of commerce", and 
thus could be regulated under the Commerce Clause. The Court's decision 
halted price fixing. Stafford v. Wallace (1922) upheld a federal law (the 
Packers and Stockyards Act) regulating the Chicago meatpacking industry, 
because the industry was part of the interstate commerce of beef from ranchers 
to dinner tables. The stockyards "are but a throat through which the current 
[of commerce] flows," Chief Justice Taft wrote, referring to the stockyards 
as "great national public utilities." As Justice Kennedy wrote: (in a concurring 
opinion to United States v. Lopez), "Though that [formalistic] approach 
likely would not have survived even if confined to the question of a State's 
authority to enact legislation, it was not at all propitious when applied 
to the quite different question of what subjects were within the reach 
of the national power when Congress chose to exercise it." Similarly, the 
court excluded most services by distinguishing them from commerce. In Federal 
Baseball Club v. National League, 259 U.S. 200 (1922), which was later 
upheld in Toolson v. New York Yankees (1953) and Flood v. Kuhn (1973), 
the court excluded nonproduction-related services, such as live entertainment, 
from the definition of commerce: In 1935 the Supreme Court of the United 
States, in Schecter Poultry Corporation v. United States, invalidated regulations 
of the poultry industry according to the nondelegation doctrine and as 
an invalid use of Congress's power under the commerce clause. This was 
a unanimous decision that rendered the National Industrial Recovery Act, 
a main component of President Roosevelt's New Deal, unconstitutional. Again 
in 1936, in Carter v. Carter Coal Company,[11] the Supreme Court struck 
down a key element of the New Deal's regulation of the mining industry, 
on the grounds that mining was not "commerce." In the preceding decades, 
the Court had struck down a laundry list of Progressive legislation – minimum-wage 
laws, child labor laws, agricultural relief laws, and virtually every element 
of the New Deal legislation that had come before it. After winning re-election 
in 1936, Roosevelt proposed the Judicial Procedures Reform Bill, wherein 
the President could appoint an additional Justice for each sitting Justice 
over age 70. Given the age of the current Justices, this allowed a Supreme 
Court size of up to 15 Justices. Roosevelt claimed that this was intended 
to lessen the load on the older Justices, rather than being an attempt 
to achieve a majority that would cease to strike his New Deal acts. Ultimately, 
there was widespread opposition to this "court packing" plan and in the 
end Roosevelt abandoned it. However, in what became known as "the switch 
in time that saved nine", shortly after the "court packing" plan was proposed, 
Justice Owen Roberts joined the 5-4 majority opinion in West Coast Hotel 
Co. v. Parrish (1937). The majority narrowly upheld a Washington state 
minimum wage law, abandoning prior jurisprudence, ending the Lochner era. 
This essentially marked the beginning of the end of Supreme Court opposition 
to the New Deal, obviating the political need for the "court packing" scheme 
as well. In United States v. Darby Lumber Co. (1941), the Court upheld 
the Fair Labor Standards Act which regulated the production of goods shipped 
across state lines. The Court stated that the Tenth Amendment "is but a 
truism" and was not considered to be an independent limitation on Congressional 
power.[12] In United States v. Wrightwood Dairy Co. (1942) the Court upheld 
federal price regulation of intrastate milk commerce, stating: The commerce 
power is not confined in its exercise to the regulation of commerce among 
the states. It extends to those activities intrastate which so affect interstate 
commerce, or the exertion of the power of Congress over it, as to make 
regulation of them appropriate means to the attainment of a legitimate 
end, the effective execution of the granted power to regulate interstate 
commerce. [ ...] The power of Congress over interstate commerce is plenary 
and complete in itself, may be exercised to its utmost extent, and acknowledges 
no limitations other than are prescribed in the Constitution. [ ... ] It 
follows that no form of state activity can constitutionally thwart the 
regulatory power granted by the commerce clause to Congress. Hence, the 
reach of that power extends to those intrastate activities which in a substantial 
way interfere with or obstruct the exercise of the granted power.[13] In 
Wickard v. Filburn (1942) the Court upheld the Agricultural Adjustment 
Act of 1938, which sought to stabilize wide fluctuations in the market 
price for wheat. The Court found that Congress could apply national quotas 
to wheat grown on one's own land, for one's own consumption, because the 
total of such local production and consumption could potentially be sufficiently 
large as to affect the overall national goal of stabilizing prices. The 
Court cited its recent Wrightwood decision and decided that "[w]hether 
the subject of the regulation in question was "production," "consumption," 
or "marketing" is, therefore, not material for purposes of deciding the 
question of federal power before us." The Court re-iterated Marshall's 
decision in Gibbons: "He made emphatic the embracing and penetrating nature 
of this power by warning that effective restraints on its exercise must 
proceed from political, rather than from judicial, processes." The Court 
also stated that "[t]he conflicts of economic interest between the regulated 
and those who advantage by it are wisely left under our system to resolution 
by the Congress under its more flexible and responsible legislative process. 
Such conflicts rarely lend themselves to judicial determination. And with 
the wisdom, workability, or fairness, of the plan of regulation, we have 
nothing to do."[14] Thereafter, the Court began to defer to the Congress 
on the theory that determining whether legislation affected commerce appropriately 
was a political and legislative, not a judicial, decision. This overall 
change in the Court's jurisprudence, beginning with Parrish, is often referred 
to as the Constitutional Revolution of 1937,[15] in which the Court shifted 
from exercising judicial review of legislative acts to protect economic 
rights, to a paradigm which focused most strongly on protecting civil liberties.[16] 
It was not until United States v. Lopez (1995) decision, after nearly 60 
years of leaving any restraint on the use of the Commerce Clause to political 
means only, that the Court again ruled that a regulation enacted under 
the Clause was unconstitutional. The wide interpretation of the scope of 
the Commerce Clause continued following the passing of the Civil Rights 
Act of 1964, which aimed to prevent business from discriminating against 
black customers. The United States Supreme Court issued several opinions 
which supported this use of the Commerce Clause. Heart of Atlanta Motel 
v. United States, 379 U.S. 241 (1964), ruled that Congress could regulate 
a business that served mostly interstate travelers. Daniel v. Paul, 395 
U.S. 298 (1969), ruled that the federal government could regulate a recreational 
facility because three out of the four items sold at its snack bar were 
purchased from outside the state. The Rehnquist Court's Commerce Clause 
jurisprudence restored limits to the Interstate Commerce Clause that were 
removed in post-New Deal decisions, based primarily on concerns of federalism 
and encroachment by Congress on the several States' police powers. It upheld 
Congress's plenary authority to legislate in Indian affairs that was derived 
from the Worcester decision's interpretation of the Indian Commerce Clause, 
but modified Worcester by giving the several states some jurisdiction over 
Indian affairs beyond what had been granted to them by Congress. Another 
view is that the Court was compelled to define limits to address Congressional 
legislation which sought to use the Interstate Commerce Clause power in 
new and unprecedented ways. In United States v. Lopez, the Court confronted 
conviction of a 12th Grade student for carrying a concealed handgun into 
school in violation of the Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990, 18 U.S.C. 
§ 922(q)(1)(A). The Gun-Free School Zones Act made it a federal offense 
for any individual knowingly to possess a firearm at a place that individual 
knows or has reasonable cause to believe is a school zone. The legislation 
posed several challenging problems for Commerce Clause jurisprudence. Education 
is a traditionally local government activity, and while education undoubtedly 
has an economic aspect, the nexus between regulating gun violence and the 
Commerce Clause power to regulate interstate commerce seems particularly 
strained. In Wickard v. Filburn, the Court ruled Congress was exercising 
its Commerce Clause power to regulate local economic activity in ways that 
the States were powerless to regulate, because only the federal government 
could effectively control the national wheat supply. The Court reasoned 
that if Wickard could be applied to acts of gun violence, simply because 
crime impaired education, Congress might conclude that crime in schools 
substantially affects commerce, and may be regulated. Under this logic, 
all police power could be nationalized and local police and criminal courts 
eliminated on the theory that all crime affects commerce. As the majority 
explained: Section 922(q) is a criminal statute that by its terms has nothing 
to do with “commerce” or any sort of economic enterprise, however broadly 
one might define those terms. Section 922(q) is not an essential part of 
a larger regulation of economic activity, in which the regulatory scheme 
could be undercut unless the intrastate activity were regulated. It cannot, 
therefore, be sustained under our cases upholding regulations of activities 
that arise out of or are connected with a commercial transaction, which 
viewed in the aggregate, substantially affects interstate commerce. The 
opinion pointed out that prior decisions had identified three broad categories 
of activity that Congress may regulate under its commerce power. Thus the 
federal government did not have the power to regulate relatively unrelated 
things such as the possession of firearms near schools, as in Lopez. This 
was the first time in sixty years, since the conflict with President Roosevelt 
in 1936–37, that the Court had overturned a putative regulation on interstate 
commerce because it exceeded Congress's commerce power. Justice Clarence 
Thomas, in a separate concurring opinion, argued that allowing Congress 
to regulate intrastate, noncommercial activity under the Commerce Clause 
would confer on Congress a general “police power” over the entire nation. 
The Lopez decision was clarified in United States v. Morrison, 529 U.S. 
598 (2000), in which the Supreme Court invalidated § 40302 of the Violence 
Against Women Act ("VAWA"). The VAWA created civil liability for the commission 
of a gender-based violent crime, but without any jurisdictional requirement 
of a connection to Interstate Commerce or commercial activity. 42 U.S.C. 
§ 13981(c). Once again, the Court was presented with a Congressional attempt 
to criminalize traditional local criminal conduct. As in Lopez, it could 
not be argued that State regulation alone would be ineffective to protect 
the aggregate effects of local violence. The Court explained that in both 
Lopez and Morrison "the noneconomic, criminal nature of the conduct at 
issue was central to our decision." Furthermore, the Court pointed out 
that in neither case was there an " 'express jurisdictional element which 
might limit its reach (to those instances that) have an explicit connection 
with or effect on interstate commerce.' " Id. at 1751. In both cases, Congress 
criminalized activity that was not commercial in nature without including 
a jurisdictional element establishing the necessary connection between 
the criminalized activity and Interstate Commerce. The Court found in Seminole 
Tribe v. Florida, 517 U.S. 44 (1996) that, unlike the Fourteenth Amendment, 
the Commerce Clause does not give the federal government the power to abrogate 
the sovereign immunity of the states. Many described the Rehnquist Court's 
Commerce Clause cases as a doctrine of "New Federalism". The outer limits 
of that doctrine were delineated by Gonzales v. Raich, in which Justices 
Antonin Scalia and Anthony Kennedy departed from their previous positions 
as parts of the Lopez and Morrison majorities to uphold a federal law regarding 
marijuana. The Court found the federal law valid, although the marijuana 
in question had been grown and consumed within a single state, and had 
never entered Interstate Commerce. The court held Congress may regulate 
an intrastate economic good if it does so as part of a complete scheme 
of legislation designed to regulate Interstate Commerce. During the Rehnquist 
court and to present, the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution has played 
an integral part in the Court's view of the Commerce Clause. The Tenth 
Amendment states that the federal government has only the powers specifically 
delegated to it by the Constitution while other powers are reserved to 
the states, or to the people. The Commerce Clause is an important source 
of those powers delegated to Congress, and therefore its interpretation 
is very important in determining the scope of federal power in controlling 
innumerable aspects of American life. The Commerce Clause has been the 
most broadly interpreted clause in the Constitution, making way for many 
laws which, some argue, contradict the original intended meaning of the 
Constitution. Justice Clarence Thomas has gone so far as to state in his 
dissent to Gonzales, Respondents Diane Monson and Angel Raich use marijuana 
that has never been bought or sold, that has never crossed state lines, 
and that has had no demonstrable effect on the national market for marijuana. 
If Congress can regulate this under the Commerce Clause, then it can regulate 
virtually anything – and the federal Government is no longer one of limited 
and enumerated powers.[20] The evolving level of scrutiny applied by Federal 
courts to Commerce Clause cases should be considered in the context of 
rational basis review. The idea behind rational basis review is that the 
judiciary must show deference to the elected representatives of the people. 
A respect for the democratic process requires that the Courts uphold legislation 
if there are rational facts and reasons that could support Congressional 
judgment, even if the Justices would come to different conclusions. Throughout 
the 20th century, in a variety of contexts, courts sought to avoid second 
guessing the legislative branch, and Commerce Clause jurisprudence can 
be seen as a part of this trend. Lawrence Tribe states: Since 1937, in 
applying the factual test in Jones & Laughlin to hold a broad range of 
activities sufficiently related to interstate commerce, the Supreme Court 
has exercised little independent judgment, choosing instead to defer to 
the expressed or implied findings of Congress to the effect that regulated 
activities have the requisite "economic effect". Such findings have been 
upheld whenever they could be said to rest upon some rational basis.[21] 
(Citing Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc. v United States (1964).) Justice Rehnquist 
echoed this point in his opinion in United States v. Lopez, stating: "Since 
[Wickard], the Court has ... undertaken to decide whether a rational basis 
existed for concluding that a regulated activity sufficiently affected 
interstate commerce. See, e.g., Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining & Reclamation 
Association, 452 U.S. 264, 276–280 (1981);[22] Perez v. United States, 
402 U.S. 146, 155–156 (1971);[23] Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc. v. United 
States, 379 U.S. 241, 252–253 (1964)."[24] Rational basis review begins 
with establishing the factual predicate upon which the exercise of Congressional 
power is based. This factual basis might come from a variety of sources. 
It might come from factual determinations made by Congress, passed in the 
legislation itself, or found in the Congressional Reports issued to accompany 
the legislation. It might come from the record of testimony compiled in 
Committee Hearings. It might come from facts posited by proponents in their 
briefs in support of the legislation. For example, the Court referenced 
extensive testimony presented in hearings in support of the conclusion 
that discrimination in public accommodations reduces interstate commerce. 
The Court wrote: Of course, the mere fact that Congress has said when particular 
activity shall be deemed to affect commerce does not preclude further examination 
by this Court. But where we find that the legislators, in light of the 
facts and testimony before them, have a rational basis for finding a chosen 
regulatory scheme necessary to the protection of commerce, our investigation 
is at an end. Similarly, in Gonzales v. Raich the Court upheld a ban on 
growing marijuana intended for medical use on the grounds that Congress 
could rationally conclude that such cultivation might make enforcement 
of drug laws more difficult by creating an otherwise lawful source of marijuana 
that could be diverted into the illicit market: In assessing the scope 
of Congress' authority under the Commerce Clause, we stress that the task 
before us is a modest one. We need not determine whether respondents' activities, 
taken in the aggregate, substantially affect interstate commerce in fact, 
but only whether a “rational basis” exists for so concluding. Given the 
enforcement difficulties that attend distinguishing between marijuana cultivated 
locally and marijuana grown elsewhere, 21 U.S.C. § 801(5), and concerns 
about diversion into illicit channels, we have no difficulty concluding 
that Congress had a rational basis for believing that failure to regulate 
the intrastate manufacture and possession of marijuana would leave a gaping 
hole in the CSA. Since its decision in Gibbons, the Supreme Court has held 
that Congress may regulate only those activities within a state that arise 
out of or are connected with a commercial transaction and that, viewed 
in the aggregate, substantially affect interstate commerce. Since judicial 
interpretations of constitutional limitations on Congressional exercise 
of its Commerce Clause powers represent an invasion of the democratic process 
which may not be overturned through ordinary democratic means, the Court 
has continued to assert that the primary limitation on the unwise exercise 
of Congressional Commerce Clause power by Congress must be found at the 
ballot box. Thus in Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority, 
469 U.S. 528 (1985), the Court stated: Of course, we continue to recognize 
that the States occupy a special and specific position in our constitutional 
system and that the scope of Congress' authority under the Commerce Clause 
must reflect that position. But the principal and basic limit on the federal 
commerce power is that inherent in all congressional action—the built-in 
restraints that our system provides through state participation in federal 
governmental action. The political process ensures that laws that unduly 
burden the States will not be promulgated. Questions over the range and 
applicability of the Commerce Clause have arisen in debate over the constitutionality 
of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ("PPACA"). The debate 
centers around whether Congress is authorized to require citizens to purchase 
health insurance from the private market, known as the individual mandate. 
Congress claims authority from the Commerce Clause. However, many opponents 
of the PPACA have claimed that the individual mandate exceeds Congress's 
authority thereunder, primarily on the position that the law attempts to 
define the non-purchase of insurance as "commerce". Twenty-six state attorneys 
general filed a lawsuit against the federal government claiming the insurance 
mandate is unconstitutional. On June 8, 2011, a panel of three judges from 
the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta held hearings on the issue.[25] 
On August 12, 2011. The 11th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled the Individual 
Mandate portion unconstitutional, stating that Congress had exceeded its 
authority by requiring Americans to buy coverage.[26] Differing court opinions 
have clashed over the question of whether failure to purchase insurance 
can be considered an economic activity that affects interstate commerce. 
In Virginia v. Sebelius, Judge Henry Hudson overturned the law, claiming 
that failure to purchase health insurance coverage could not be considered 
economic activity, being rather economic "inactivity." In Liberty University 
v. Geithner, Judge Norman Moon upheld the law, countering: Similarly, in 
Thomas More Law Center v. Obama, judge George Steeh ruled that such decisions 
have "a documented impact on interstate commerce."[27] In response to the 
Virginia decision, Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli petitioned 
the Supreme Court to hear the appeal immediately, rather than going through 
the Fourth Circuit. On November 14, 2011, the Supreme Court announced it 
would hear the case in the spring of 2012.[28] The Supreme Court heard 
arguments on March 26–28, 2012. Its majority opinion agreed that upholding 
the PPACA under the commerce clause "would open a new and potentially vast 
domain to congressional authority" and that "the power to regulate commerce
