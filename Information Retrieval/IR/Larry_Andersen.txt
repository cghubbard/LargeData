Larry Eugene Andersen (born May 6, 1953) is a former relief pitcher in 
Major League Baseball and current radio color commentator for the Philadelphia 
Phillies. From 1975 through 1994, Andersen played for the Cleveland Indians 
(1975, 1977–1979), Seattle Mariners (1981–1982), Philadelphia Phillies 
(1983–1986, 1993–1994), Houston Astros (1986–1990), Boston Red Sox (1990) 
and San Diego Padres (1991–1992). Andersen possessed an average fastball 
and outstanding slider. Andersen has said that he had better command of 
his slider than his fastball. He gained notoriety for his 1990 trade to 
the Red Sox straight up for a minor league prospect named Jeff Bagwell. 
Andersen played a month in Boston, appearing in 15 games, recording a 1.35 
ERA, and helping the Red Sox to a division title. In a 15-year career spent 
entirely with Houston, Bagwell hit 449 home runs with over 1500 RBI and 
a .297 average. Bagwell won the 1991 NL Rookie of the Year award, and the 
NL MVP in 1994. In a 17-season career, Andersen posted a 40-39 record with 
49 saves and a 3.15 ERA in 699 games pitched. His best season was 1987 
when he recorded nine wins, 94 strikeouts, and 101 2⁄3 innings pitched 
in 67 games, all career highs. He is the only member of the Phillies to 
play in both the 1983 World Series and the 1993 World Series (Darren Daulton 
had been called up, but did not make a game appearance in 1983). In 1995, 
Andersen was a player/coach for the Reading Phillies after failing to make 
the Major League club out of Spring Training. He spent the following two 
seasons as the pitching coach for the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Red Barons 
before joining Philadelphia's broadcast team as a color commentator prior 
to the 1998 season, filling the position left vacant by the death of Richie 
Ashburn late in the 1997 campaign. Andersen worked on both television and 
radio from 1998 to 2006 before moving exclusively to radio in 2007. Early 
in his broadcasting tenure, Andersen occasionally provided television color 
commentary when the Phillies were featured regionally on Fox Saturday afternoon 
telecasts. During the 2007 season, he began doing play-by-play work on 
Phillies radio broadcasts during the fifth and sixth innings, but returned 
to full-time color commentary in 2008. In 2012, Andersen was ranked #12 
on the MLB Network Countdown of the Top 25 personalities in Major League
