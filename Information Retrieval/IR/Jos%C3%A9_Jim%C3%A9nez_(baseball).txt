José Jiménez (born July 7, 1973) is a former Major League Baseball pitcher 
for the Cleveland Indians, Colorado Rockies and St. Louis Cardinals. As 
a Cardinal, Jiménez threw a no-hitter against Randy Johnson and the Arizona 
Diamondbacks on June 25, 1999, beating them by a score of 1–0. He is one 
of the 20 rookie pitchers who have pitched a no-hitter in Major League 
history.[1] In his second start after the no-hitter, he again opposed Johnson 
and the Diamondbacks, and he again triumphed, 1–0, while pitching a complete 
game. This time, he allowed two hits to the D-Backs. He would finish the 
1999 season with a 5-14 record, a 5.85 ERA in 29 games (28 starts). Jiménez 
was acquired by the 2000 season and became a staple in the Rockies bullpen, 
transitioning from starter to closer. From 2000-2003 he collected 102 saves 
for the Rockies, becoming the all-time saves leader in the Rockies franchise. 
He set a franchise record 41 saves in 2002, while having an ERA of 3.56 
despite having a record of 2-10. The following season he swung back into 
a starter, making 7 starts and 20 saves for the Rockies, but ballooned 
his ERA to 5.22 and again having a record of 2-10. At 30 years old, he 
pitched in 2004 for the Indians; he would wind up released after going 
1-7 with an 8.42 ERA. At the 2007 Pan-American Games, Jiménez tested positive 
for a banned substance and was subsequently removed from the competition.[1]
