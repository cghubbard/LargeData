Stephen Oris Drew (born March 16, 1983) is an American professional baseball 
infielder who is a free agent. He has played in Major League Baseball (MLB) 
for the Arizona Diamondbacks, Oakland Athletics, Boston Red Sox, New York 
Yankees and Washington Nationals. His two brothers, outfielder J.D. and 
pitcher Tim, also played in MLB. Drew went to Lowndes High School in Valdosta, 
Georgia. Following in the footsteps of his brother, J. D., he enrolled 
at Florida State University and played college baseball for the Florida 
State Seminoles baseball team. The Arizona Diamondbacks selected Drew in 
the first round, with the 15th overall selection, of the 2004 Major League 
Baseball Draft. He began the 2006 season with the Lancaster JetHawks of 
the Class A-Advanced California League, where he batted .389 and hit 10 
home runs. He was later promoted to the Tennessee Smokies of the Class 
AA Southern League, with whom he hit .218 and hit 4 home runs. He was then 
promoted to the Tucson Sidewinders of the Class AAA Pacific Coast League. 
He was selected to the 2006 All-Star Futures Game. On July 13, 2006, during 
a game against the Milwaukee Brewers, Craig Counsell injured his ribs, 
prompting the call-up of Drew from the Diamondbacks' Triple-A affiliate, 
the Tucson Sidewinders. He made his major league debut on July 15 against 
the Milwaukee Brewers. Also making his major league debut that day (with 
the Brewers) was Tony Gwynn, Jr., son of former major leaguer Tony Gwynn. 
He recorded his first major league hit against the Dodgers and his brother 
J. D. Drew. He finished the season batting .316, with 5 HR and 23 RBI. 
In 2007, although the Diamondbacks were division champions, Drew had a 
disappointing season, hitting only .238 with 12 home runs but a career-high 
9 stolen bases. On September 1, 2008, he hit for the cycle against the 
St. Louis Cardinals, becoming the first player to do so at Chase Field.[1] 
Batting leadoff, Drew singled in the first inning, tripled in the third 
and homered in the fifth against Cardinal starter Joel Piñeiro. He added 
a ground-rule double in the seventh against reliever Kyle McClellan. He 
was the fourth to hit for the cycle in 2008, and on the same day Adrián 
Beltré of the Seattle Mariners became the fifth. This was the first time 
that two players had hit for the cycle on the same day since 1920.[2] He 
finished the season batting .291, with a career-high 21 home runs. In 2009, 
he hit .261 with 12 home runs and a career-high 12 triples, tied with Michael 
Bourn for the second most in the National League that year. On Opening 
Day, April 5, 2010, he hit an inside-the-park home run against starter 
Jon Garland, the sixth Diamondback to do so. He finished that year batting 
.278, with 15 home runs and 61 RBI. In 2011, Drew missed the first four 
games of the season due to abdominal pain. On July 20, 2011, he slid into 
home plate, fractured his right ankle and missed the rest of the season, 
batting .252 for the year with 5 home runs and 45 RBI. He played in only 
86 games that season, fewer than in any season after the 59 games of his 
rookie year. He spent early 2012 on the disabled list for the broken ankle 
until June 27, when he played for the first time in over 11 months, going 
one for four. He was linked to various teams at the 2012 trade deadline, 
including the Detroit Tigers and Oakland Athletics.[3] On July 30, manager 
Kirk Gibson called Drew into his office for a closed-door meeting; speculation 
that Drew had been traded ensued.[4] In the 40 games he played with the 
Diamondbacks that season, Drew batted with just a .193 batting average, 
2 home runs, and 12 RBI. Over the course of nearly 7 seasons with the Diamondbacks, 
Drew would compile a team record 52 triples. On August 20, 2012, Drew was 
traded to the Oakland Athletics for minor league shortstop Sean Jamieson.[5] 
Drew finished 2012 hitting .223 in 79 games with 7 HR and 28 RBI. The A's 
declined their $10 million option on Drew on October 29, making him a free 
agent. Drew obtained a $1.35 million buyout. On December 17, 2012, Drew 
signed a one-year, $9.5 million contract with the Boston Red Sox, which 
also included $500,000 in performance bonuses.[6] Drew had a .253 batting 
average, 13 home runs, and 67 RBI in the 2013 regular season. After struggling 
at the plate for most of the 2013 postseason, Drew homered in the decisive 
Game 6 of the World Series, helping the Red Sox clinch their third championship 
in nine years and earning his first career World Series ring. Drew opted 
to become a free agent after the 2013 season, and turned down Boston's 
qualifying offer of $14.1 million for the 2014 season. Under the terms 
of the CBA, teams signing free agents who had declined a qualifying offer 
would forfeit their top unprotected pick in the following draft.[7] One 
effect of this was to reduce the market value of free agents who had received 
a qualifying offer.[8] By the start of the 2014 season Drew remained unsigned, 
and baseball analysts attributed it partly to few teams needing a veteran 
starting shortstop and partly to teams not being willing to give up a top 
draft pick. After having missed spring training and the start of the regular 
season, on May 20, 2014, Drew signed a one-year, $10 million contract with 
Boston, a prorated amount of the $14.1 million qualifying offer he previously 
rejected.[9] In 39 games he played in for the Red Sox that year, Drew hit 
4 home runs, 11 RBI, and had a low batting average of just .176. On July 
31, 2014, Drew was traded to the New York Yankees by the Boston Red Sox 
for Kelly Johnson.[10] It was the first trade between the teams since 1997.[11] 
Drew batted .150 with 3 home runs and 15 RBI in 46 games for the Yankees. 
At the end of the 2014 season, Drew's batting average was just .162 with 
7 home runs and 26 RBI in a total of 85 games. Drew became a free agent 
after the 2014 season, and re-signed with the Yankees on January 6, 2015, 
agreeing to a one-year, $5 million contract. The deal became official on 
January 16.[12] On April 17, 2015, Drew hit his 100th career home run in 
a game against the Tampa Bay Rays. On June 9, 2015, Drew recorded his 1,000th 
career hit, a home run, against the Washington Nationals. Drew had a .201 
batting average, 17 home runs (4 shy of his career high), and 44 RBIs.[citation

the Washington Nationals.[13] Drew is a Christian.[14] Drew's father found 
his first baseball glove in a dumpster.[15] The Drew brothers are the only 
trio of siblings all selected in the first round of the Major League Baseball
