Dontrelle Wayne Willis (born January 12, 1982), nicknamed "The D-Train",[1] 
is an American former professional baseball pitcher. He played in Major 
League Baseball (MLB) for the Florida Marlins, Detroit Tigers, Arizona 
Diamondbacks and Cincinnati Reds. Willis was notable for his success during 
his first few years in the MLB and for his unconventional pitching style, 
which included a high leg kick and exaggerated twisting away from the batter.[2] 
He was named the 2003 National League Rookie of the Year. Growing up in 
Alameda, California, Willis rooted for the Oakland Athletics as a child. 
His mother, Joyce, played softball as a catcher for her high school team. 
Willis' favorite player was former Oakland Athletics' pitcher Dave Stewart. 
Willis attended Encinal High School in Alameda, where he played baseball 
for four years. He is the son of Clinton Ostah, a former minor league player 
in the 1970s. In Willis' senior year, he had a 12–1 win–loss record and 
a 0.83 earned run average (ERA) in 70 innings pitched. Scouts never doubted 
his talents, but rather his unusual pitching mechanics. One scout even 
called him a "Poor man's CC Sabathia." He was drafted by the Chicago Cubs 
in the 8th round of the 2000 Major League Baseball draft.[citation needed] 
In 2001, Willis was bumped up to the Boise Hawks of the Northwest League. 
He finished with 8 wins and a 2.98 ERA. Opposing hitters only batted .217 
against Willis. In a Baseball America poll, several NWL managers called 
Willis Boise's best player.[2] On March 27, 2002, the Cubs traded Willis 
(then a minor leaguer), fellow pitchers Julián Tavárez and José Cueto, 
and catcher Ryan Jorgensen to the Florida Marlins, in exchange for pitchers 
Matt Clement and Antonio Alfonseca.[3] After being traded, Willis struggled 
early on. However, Willis started to get better as he got to low Class 
A ball. By the end of the season, he went 10-2 and finished the season 
with the Class-A Jupiter Hammerheads. In five starts, he went 2-0 with 
a 1.83 ERA, leading the Midwest League in ERA. For his performance, he 
was named the Marlins' Minor League Pitcher of the Year.[2] In the 2003 
Spring training, Willis reported to Jupiter. The plan was to start him 
with the Class-AA Carolina Mudcats. The hope was that he would make the 
leap to AAA, and potentially be available for a spot start in Florida or 
a back-of-the-bullpen job late in the season. The Marlins then sent Willis 
down to Carolina to work on consistency and control. Willis would dominate 
at Carolina; he went 4–0 with a 1.49 ERA. On May 9, 2003, Willis made his 
Major League debut for the Florida Marlins. Against the Rockies, he pitched 
six innings, allowed seven hits and three earned runs, and got a no decision.[4] 
On May 14, in a start against the Padres, Willis went five innings, allowed 
five hits, three earned runs, and four walks, and received his first Major 
League win. On June 16, Willis pitched nine innings and allowed no runs 
in a 1-0 victory over the Mets in his first career shutout. Willis' opponent 
in that game was Tom Glavine, one of his childhood heroes.[5] Willis was 
named Rookie of the Month for the month of June and became the first Marlins 
pitcher to be named Pitcher of the Month. He became the first rookie pitcher 
to win Pitcher of the Month since Hideo Nomo did it in 1995 for the Los 
Angeles Dodgers and he became the first rookie pitcher to win seven straight 
starts since Jason Isringhausen, also in 1995.[6] In 5 starts, Willis went 
5–0 with a 1.04 ERA.[7] Heading into the All-Star Break in mid-July, Willis 
was 9–1 with a 2.08 ERA in 13 starts.[8] He made the National League All-Star 
team as injury replacement for Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Kevin Brown. 
He became the second Marlins rookie player to make the All-Star team; Alex 
González did it in 1999.[9] On July 30, Willis faced another one of his 
childhood heroes, Randy Johnson of the Diamondbacks, in a head-to-head 
pitching duel. Willis went seven innings and allowed only one earned run.[10] 
After coming out of the bullpen in game 1 of the 2003 National League Division 
Series against the Giants, Willis started game 4 of the series. In 5.1 
innings pitched, Willis allowed 5 hits, 2 base on balls, struck out 3 batters 
but allowed 5 earned runs.[11] Despite struggling with his pitching, Willis 
showcased his remarkable (for a pitcher) hitting ability by going 3-for-3 
with a triple and scoring a run during that game, which the Marlins won 
7–6 to advance to the NL Championship Series against the Cubs, the team 
that drafted Willis. In game 4, Willis again struggled with his command. 
In just 2.1 innings pitched, he allowed 3 hits and allowed 5 base on balls 
and took the loss.[12] His only other appearance in the series was in game 
6, when he allowed a run in one inning of relief. Despite his limited contributions, 
the Marlins went on to defeat the Cubs in 7 games. The Marlins then defeated 
the New York Yankees in the 2003 World Series. After the 2003 season, Willis 
was named the National League Rookie of the Year.[13] He went 14–6 with 
a 3.30 earned run average in 27 starts for the year. In 2004, Willis started 
the year 3-0, and did not allow an earned run in his first three starts. 
He also showed great hitting skills for a pitcher. In his first two starts, 
Willis went 6-for-6 with a home run. His seven consecutive hits in the 
regular season was 1 short of the club record held by Gary Sheffield and 
Preston Wilson.[14] In his next start against the Phillies, Willis struck 
out in his first at bat, snapping his streak of 10 consecutive hits dating 
back to previous year's postseason.[15] He finished the 2004 season with 
a record of 10–11 and an earned run average of 4.02.[16] In 2005, Willis 
became one of the best pitchers in baseball. He started the 2005 season 
by pitching two shutouts against the Washington Nationals and the Philadelphia 
Phillies. During the month of April, Willis went 5–0 in 5 starts and allowed 
five earned runs in 35 innings pitched for a 1.29 ERA.[17] He was named 
NL Pitcher of the Month. On May 6, Willis became the league's first six-game 
winner when he went seven innings and allowed no runs against the Rockies. 
"I felt strong," Willis said. "I was able to stay down in the zone. That's 
my key, because I don't throw 100 mph. I can't live up in the zone. In 
all my starts I've been trying to stay down, and hopefully they swing at 
it."[18] On June 8, Willis became the major league's first 10-game winner 
when he pitched the Marlins to a 5-4 victory over the Seattle Mariners, 
allowing 4 runs. Willis became only the third pitcher in Marlins history 
to record 10 wins before the All-Star break.[19] On June 23, Willis became 
the NL's first 12-game winner when he pitched a shutout against the Braves. 
"He's tough," Braves manager Bobby Cox said. "He deserves to start the 
All-Star game, to be honest with you. He's the dominant pitcher in the 
National League right now."[20] Going into the All-Star break, Willis was 
13-4 with a 2.39 earned run average and a 1.14 WHIP.[21] Willis was named 
to the All-Star team but did not pitch in the game. Willis kept pace with 
his great first half after the All-Star break. He went 9–6 and posted a 
2.91 earned run average and a 1.13 WHIP the rest of the season.[21] During 
his last start before the All-Star break, Willis struggled against the 
Cubs. In 4.1 innings, he allowed 8 runs, all earned.[22] He struggled in 
each of his first two starts after the break, failing to make it past the 
sixth inning in games against the Philadelphia Phillies and San Francisco 
Giants.[23] However, he would get back on track. Willis matched his highest 
win total on July 28 against the Pirates when he went 7 innings, allowed 
3 hits, no earned runs, and picked up his 14th victory of the season, which 
tied his career high for most wins in a season.[24] Willis won his career-high 
15th victory on August 7 against the Reds. He went 8 innings, allowed 4 
hits, and no earned runs. On August 17, Willis held the Padres scoreless 
by shutting the Padres out in 9 innings, earning him his 16th win of the 
season, second most in baseball. "He's as good as anybody," San Diego manager 
Bruce Bochy said. "We aren't the first team he has shut out this year."[25] 
The win put Florida one-and-a-half games behind Houston and Philadelphia 
in the wild card standings. Willis won his 19th game of the season against 
the Mets on September 2, breaking Carl Pavano's franchise record for most 
wins in a season. Pavano held the Marlins' mark for most victories in a 
season by a Marlins' pitcher for a year.[26] On September 7 against the 
Washington Nationals, Willis pitched 6 innings and allowed 1 earned run, 
which gave him his 20th win of the season. He became the first African-American 
pitcher to win 20 games in a season since Dave Stewart did it in 1990, 
and in the process, he became the first pitcher to win 20 games and have 
20 hits as a batter since Mike Hampton did it in 1999 for the Astros.[27] 
On September 22, Willis became the first pitcher to bat seventh or higher 
since Montreal's Steve Renko batted seventh on August 26, 1973.[28] Willis 
went 1-for-4 against the New York Mets. He would go on to post a 22-10 
record with a 2.63 earned run average and 1.13 WHIP. His 22 wins was the 
most in baseball. He also pitched 7 complete games and 5 shutouts, also 
the most in baseball.[29] Willis is still the only pitcher in Marlins history 
to win 20 games in a season. Willis would go on to finish 2nd in the N.L. 
Cy Young Award voting behind Chris Carpenter of the St. Louis Cardinals. 
He did, however, win the Warren Spahn Award, given to the best left-handed 
pitcher in each league. In the 2006 season, Willis' numbers were down from 
his great 2005 season. Willis started the season by going 1–6 with a 4.93 
ERA and didn't get his second victory of the season until June 2. He still 
posted decent numbers for the year and went 12–12 with a 3.87 ERA. His 
12 wins were tied for the most on the Marlins. Willis also led the Marlins 
in complete games, innings pitched, base on balls, and hit by pitch. On 
June 20, Willis earned his 50th career win in a start against the Baltimore 
Orioles. At age 24, 159 days old, Willis became the fourth youngest pitcher 
to achieve this milestone. Only C.C Sabathia, Greg Maddux, and Mark Buehrle 
accomplished this at a younger age.[30] On July 7, Willis hit a grand slam 
off of Mets pitcher José Lima. Willis became the first pitcher to hit a 
grand slam since Robert Person did it in 2002. It was his fourth career 
home run.[31] On September 20, 2006 he hit 2 home runs, off of Óliver Pérez 
and Roberto Hernández.[32] He became the first pitcher since Randy Wolf 
to hit 2 home runs in a game.[33] On January 15, 2007, Willis signed a 
one-year contract with the Marlins for $6.45 million, avoiding salary arbitration. 
In the 2007 season, Willis went 10–15 with a 5.17 ERA and a 1.60 WHIP.[29] 
Up to that point, it was his worst season of his career. Willis led the 
National League in earned runs allowed with 118.[34] During his career 
with the Marlins, Willis went 68-54 with a 3.78 earned run average. He 
won at least 10 games each season during all five of his years with the 
Marlins from 2003–2007.[35] On December 5, 2007, the Marlins traded Willis 
along with fellow All-Star Miguel Cabrera to the Detroit Tigers for Andrew 
Miller, Cameron Maybin, Mike Rabelo, Eulogio de la Cruz, Dallas Trahern 
and Burke Badenhop. Tigers General Manager Dave Dombrowski then signed 
Willis to a 3-year, $29 million contract extension two weeks later. In 
his debut with the Tigers, Willis went 5 innings, gave up 1 hit, and 3 
earned runs against the Chicago White Sox.[36] In his next start, also 
against the White Sox, Willis injured his left knee and departed the game 
before even recording an out.[37] Placed on the disabled list the next 
day, Willis had walked nine batters while striking out none in his first 
two outings. Command of his pitches became a trouble spot, and later in 
the season, Tiger manager Jim Leyland pitched him in relief for the first 
time, with little success. He was placed back into the rotation on June 
3, 2008 to start in a loss against the Oakland Athletics.[38] On June 10, 
2008, Willis was sent down to Single-A Lakeland, a day after a start in 
which he gave up eight earned runs and five base on balls in 1⅓ innings 
pitched against the Cleveland Indians. Though Willis had enough service 
time in the Major Leagues to require his consent prior to the send-down, 
he agreed, saying he needed to work on his control. Willis was called back 
to the Tigers in time for the roster expansion on September 1, 2008. He 
made three starts, recording a loss and two no-decisions. Willis finished 
with a 0–2 record and a 9.17 ERA. In 24 innings pitched, Willis struggled 
with his control and walked 35 batters. Willis was placed on the 15-day 
disabled list in March 2009 for an anxiety disorder after a blood test 
showed something of concern; he began a treatment regimen aimed at addressing 
the condition.[39] Willis was taken off the disabled list and placed on 
the active roster May 13, 2009, when he made his first start of the 2009 
season.[40] Willis made seven starts after returning, with poor results,[41] 
before being returned to the disabled list on June 19 with the same anxiety 
issue.[42] In Willis' last start of the season, he was tagged with 6 earned 
runs allowed and 8 bases on balls. Willis finished the season with a 1–4 
record and a 7.49 ERA. In Spring training 2010, Willis made the Tigers 
starting rotation. On April 8, 2010, Willis started against the Kansas 
City Royals, giving the Tigers six innings and recording a no-decision. 
He gave up two earned runs, walking two and striking out four.[43] On May 
30, 2010, Willis was designated for assignment by the Tigers. In his career 
with the Tigers, Willis played in 24 games (22 starts). His record was 
2–8 and had an earned run average of 6.86 in 101 innings pitched.[16] On 
June 1, 2010, Willis was traded to the Arizona Diamondbacks for starting 
pitcher Billy Buckner.[44] He changed back to his former uniform number 
35, which he wore for the Marlins. In his Diamondback debut, he pitched 
six scoreless innings with four walks and three strikeouts. He got his 
first win as a member of the Diamondbacks. Willis pitched four innings, 
giving up two runs and three hits, walking six batters on June 10. During 
the second inning, he cracked a finger nail and after the fourth inning, 
he was removed from the game due to the pain on the fingernail. On July 
4, 2010 Willis was designated for assignment and subsequently released.[45] 
In 6 games (5 starts) with the Diamondbacks, Willis went 1–1 with a 6.85 
ERA in 24⅓ innings pitched.[16] On July 15, 2010, Willis was signed to 
a minor league contract by San Francisco and began pitching for the Fresno 
Grizzlies of the Pacific Coast League.[46] On November 6, 2010, Willis 
was granted free agency.[47] Willis signed a minor league contract with 
the Cincinnati Reds for the 2011 season. He was invited to spring training, 
for a chance at starter or bullpen.[48] Willis was reassigned to the Louisville 
Bats as of March 27, 2011.[49] Willis was called up on July 10 and made 
his Reds debut against Milwaukee at Miller Park. Willis pitched six innings, 
giving up two runs while striking out four and walking four. He also contributed 
on offense, going 1-for-2 with a double. Willis made his second start for 
Cincinnati on July 18, 2011, at PNC Park against the Pittsburgh Pirates.[50] 
On August 3, Willis started, going six innings and hitting a solo home 
run but was charged with a no-decision. On August 9, Willis went 8 innings, 
struck out 10 batters, and allowed 3 earned runs against the Rockies but 
was charged with the loss. His 10 strikeouts was the most he had got in 
a start since he struck out 11 against the Diamondbacks on August 14, 2007. 
His 8 innings pitched was the most innings he pitched since his last start 
with the Florida Marlins, where he pitched 8 innings against the Cubs on 
September 25, 2007. On August 14, Willis went 2.2 innings and allowed 4 
earned runs against the San Diego Padres. Prior to the start, Willis said 
that his forearm was still a little tight after he had warmed up in the 
bullpen earlier. On December 13, 2011, Willis agreed to a 1-year deal worth 
$1 million with the Philadelphia Phillies. He was expected to pitch out 
of the bullpen.[51] He was released on March 16, 2012, after just three 
Grapefruit League appearances.[52] Willis signed a minor league contract 
with the Baltimore Orioles five days later on March 21.[53] A left forearm 
strain suffered on April 12 led to a dispute with the organization which 
wanted him to be a relief pitcher.[54] Desiring to be a starter again, 
he placed the blame for the injury on working out of the bullpen. In his 
only start after the problem was resolved, he surrendered four runs and 
six hits in 2⅔ innings pitched. He made four appearances with the Norfolk 
Tides, going 0–3 with an 8.53 ERA while allowing eight runs and ten hits 
in 6⅓ innings. He announced his retirement as an active player on July 
2, 2012.[55] On January 4, 2013, Willis signed a minor league contract 
with the Chicago Cubs.[56] He left his first game in spring training after 
7 pitches, and came out of the game with a shoulder injury.[57] The Cubs 
released Willis in March 2013.[58] On April 5, 2013, Willis signed a contract 
with the Long Island Ducks of the Atlantic League.[59] He compiled the 
best earned run average in the Atlantic League, posting a 2.56 ERA through 
14 starts. Willis pitched to a 5-4 record and struck out 52 batters in 
87 and two-thirds innings. By August 3, he was tied for second in the league 
in complete games with three. His efforts earned him an Atlantic League 
All-Star selection, and he was chosen as the starting pitcher for the Liberty 
Division, tossing a perfect inning.[60] On August 4, 2013, the Angels signed 
Willis to a minor-league contract and assigned him to their AAA affiliate, 
the Salt Lake Bees.[61] Willis signed a minor league deal with the San 
Francisco Giants in January 2014 and was later released in April 2014.[62][63] 
On July 5, 2014, the Bridgeport Bluefish of the Atlantic League, reported 
they had agreed to verbal contract terms with Willis.[64] He made his first 
start with the Bluefish on July 18, 2014.[65][66] On January 21, 2015, 
Willis signed a minor league contract with the Milwaukee Brewers.[67][68] 
However, on March 13, 2015, he announced his retirement.[69] Willis married 
Natalee Vitagliano on December 6, 2006.[73] The couple has two daughters, 
Adrianna Rose (born 2007) and Bianca (born 2008).[74] In the early hours 
of December 2006, Willis was arrested and charged with driving under the 
influence after he double parked his Bentley in Miami Beach in order to 
urinate in the street.[73] In April 2008, Willis pleaded guilty to the 
lesser charge of reckless driving and was ordered to pay $761 in fines 
and fees, perform 50 hours of community service and serve six months of
