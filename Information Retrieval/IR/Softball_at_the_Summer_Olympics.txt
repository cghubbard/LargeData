Softball at the Summer Olympics was on the Olympic programme from 1996 
to 2008. Softball was removed from the programme for 2012 and 2016, but 
was added, along with baseball, for the 2020 Summer Olympics. During the 
1940s, Americans and Japanese were making the first overtures to get softball 
included on the Olympic programme. This effort was led by the American 
softball association and Jiro Iwano, Vice President of the Japanese Olympic 
Committee and President of the Japanese Softball Association.[1] There 
were efforts to get softball on the Olympic program during the 1950s.[1][2] 
In 1950, the Amateur Softball Association of America sent letters to national 
organisations asking for assistance in getting the newly created International 
Olympic Federation to include softball on the Olympic program. Australia 
received such a letter and responded by asking for additional information. 
Irene Burrows, the Australian association secretary, was extremely keen 
to support this and took active steps to try to work on this goal.[1] The 
Australian Softball Council made an effort in 1952 to get the sport included 
on the programme and thought they had a decent opportunity at doing just 
that because the sport had a great deal of popularity, being played in 
over 15 countries.[2] This effort was mirrored by the Americans with the 
support of other countries such as New Zealand. Efforts to improve the 
chances of getting softball on the 1956 programme included having New Zealand's 
national softball body affiliating with the American one.[3] These efforts 
continued into the 1960s, with the International Softball Federation working 
consistently towards inclusion. They were told in 1965 a requirement of 
playing the sport at the Olympics as the sport must be played in at least 
eleven countries who can field teams to compete at the Games and the international 
governing body for the sport must have at least twenty-nine national federations 
affiliated with it. At the time, softball only had fifteen national bodies 
affiliated with it.[1] Despite being eligible for inclusion on the programme 
by 1969, it was not because Olympic organisers determined the sport, alongside 
roller skating and water skiing was "too big and too expensive."[1] Efforts 
continued to get softball on the Olympic programme during the 1970s, with 
the hope of the 1984 Summer Olympics being held in the United States meaning 
softball could at least be a demonstration sport. This did not materialise.[1] 
The Barcelona Olympic Organising Committee decided to make softball and 
golf demonstration sports at the 1992 Summer Olympics but the IOC stepped 
in in 1990 because they felt its inclusion would be an "undue burden" on 
the organisers.[1] The 1992 Summer Olympics frustrated softball organisers 
because baseball was to be a medal sport at the Games as a men's only event.[1] 
At the highest level they are moving away from the ideals of Olympicism. 
We've been a casualty of that. I'm not against golf or any other sport 
being at the Olympics. I think there should be a place for everyone. I 
just thought we'd been loyal to the Olympic movement and they should have 
been loyal to us. Softball was introduced as an Olympic sport for women 
only in the 1996 Summer Olympics.[5][6][7][8][9] The decision to add the 
sport to the 1996 Olympic programme was made in 1995.[10] The IOC had a 
committee called the International Olympic Committee on Women and Sports. 
Anita DeFranz became the committee's chair in 1992 and would be instrumental 
in helping get softball on the Olympic programme.[11] It is a little bit 
funny seeing London splashed across the TV at the moment for us and I think 
a lot of the girls are only now just starting to realise that we aren't 
in the Olympics. It will be really different [to be away from the hype 
of an Olympics] but it is probably a good thing that we are focused on 
our world championships and not having to watch the opening ceremony and 
all those fun things. On 11 July 2005, the IOC voted to drop baseball and 
softball from the Olympic program for 2012,[13] a decision that was reaffirmed 
on 9 February 2006.[14] The vote to keep softball on the programme required 
a simple majority of the 105 eligible voters, but the vote ended up as 
52-52 with one abstention.[15] It was officially decided in August 2009 
at IOC Board meeting in Berlin that it will not be included in the 2016 
Summer Olympics.[16] This was the first time in 69 years that sports had 
been removed from the Olympic programme, with polo the sport removed in 
1936.[17] The selection of which sports to include on the London Programme 
was done via secret ballot.[17] The decision to remove softball from the 
Olympics in advance of the Beijing Games created a sense of urgency for 
some development players to make their senior national teams by 2008 as 
they would not otherwise have a chance to compete at the Olympics.[17] 
The removal of softball from the Olympics has had an adverse impact on 
the game: Australia's government gave less funding to the sport as a result 
of the decision. This means players are able to do less international travel 
and compete at the highest levels.[18] The IOC decision to include two 
other sports, golf and rugby sevens, on the Olympic programme was perceived 
by the softball community as a likely end of their ability to get back 
onto the Olympic programme.[4] On 1 April 2011, the International Softball 
Federation and International Baseball Federation announced they were preparing 
a joint proposal to revive play of both sports at the 2020 Summer Olympics.[19] 
On August 3, 2016, the IOC voted to include baseball and softball in the 
2020 Summer Olympics, along with karate, sport climbing, surfing and skateboarding.[20] 
Women's softball was the female version of baseball played at the Games 
since women's baseball was not included on the programme. Rule differences 
between Olympic softball and baseball included: 1) ball is pitched underhand. 
The ball must weigh between 6.25 ounces (177 g) and 7 ounces (200 g). The 
pitcher's mound is the same height as the rest of the playing surface, 
with the infield being covered in dirt instead of grass. The distance of 
the outfield fence is measured from home plate at 200 feet (61 m) and the 
distance between bases is 60 feet (18 m) instead of the 90 feet (27 m) 
of Olympic baseball. Games at the Olympics have seven innings compared 
to baseball's nine innings. .[21] At the Olympics, eight teams competed 
being chosen to compete at the Olympics based on the following criteria: 
One team was the host nation. Four teams were chosen because they were 
the semifinalists at the most recent ISF Women's World Championship. The 
three remaining nations were chosen based on regional qualification tournaments.[21] 
The preliminary round of competition was formatted as a round robin competition, 
with the top four point earning teams advancing to the semifinals.[21] 
During this stage, the semifinal team with the best record automatically 
advanced to the finals.[21] "[T]he other semifinal winner plays the team 
that lost to the superior seminal winner. The winner of this game goes 
to the final."[21] The softball games were held in Columbus, Georgia (approximately 
100 miles from the main Olympic Games site of Atlanta, Georgia). Countries 
competing at the 1996Summer Olympics included the United States, China, 
Australia, Japan, Canada, Taiwan, the Netherlands and Puerto Rico.[21][22] 
This was the first time softball was on the Olympic programme.[22] The 
United States finished first, China second and Australia third.[23][24] 
The Games were held in Sydney, Australia. Countries competing at the 2000 
Summer Olympics included the United States, Japan, Australia, China, Italy, 
New Zealand, Cuba and Canada. The United States won the gold medal for 
the second time.[21] The Games were held in Athens, Greece. Countries competing 
at the 2004 Summer Olympics included the United States, Australia, Japan, 
China, Canada, Taiwan, Greece and Italy.[21] Only one hitter at the 2004 
game was able to score a run off the American team's pitchers. That hitter 
was Stacey Porter of Australia.[25] Australia won a silver medal at the 
Games.[26] The 2006 edition of the ISF Women's World Championship was very 
important as the Championships were used for Olympic qualifying, with the 
top four finishers going to the Olympic Games. In 2006, the fourth-place 
finishers automatically qualified to the Games because China was the Olympic 
Games based on that. Thus, there was a battle for fifth place between Canada 
and Italy for Olympic qualifications. In the match for fifth, Canada won 
3-0 and earned their fourth consecutive trip to the Olympics.[27] Japan 
won the 2008 Summer Olympics softball gold medal, with the United States 
taking home silver.[28] The first solo no-hitter to be pitched at the Olympics 
was done by the American pitcher Lori Harrigan in a game against Canada 
at the 2000 Summer Olympics.[29] The first side to beat the host country 
in softball was Australia at the 1996 Summer Olympics.[4] Interestingly, 
the USA team lost this game primarily because of a base running error in 
which a home run was hit but the runner failed to touch home plate during 
the celebration at the plate, resulting in the run not scoring and an out 
being called. Australia won this game by one run. However, the USA team 
rebounded to win the overall tournament and the gold. The United States 
had a 22-game winning streak at the Olympics between 2000 and 2008, only 
ending their winning steak in the gold medal match against Japan.[30] At 
the inaugural appearance of the event on the Olympic programme, the United 
States took gold and losing one game on the way there.[10] They beat other 
medal favourites Australia and China.[31] The United States repeated their 
victory at the 2000 Games when they beat Japan 3-1 in the gold medal game[10]
