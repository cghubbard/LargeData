James B. Donnelly (July 19, 1865 – March 5, 1915) was an American professional 
baseball player whose career spanned from 1884 to 1900. He played all or 
part of 11 seasons in Major League Baseball, principally as a third baseman, 
for nine different major league clubs. In his 11 major league seasons, 
Donnelly compiled a .230 career batting average and led the National League's 
third basemen with 73 errors in 1886 and 275 assists in 1887. Donnelly's 
longest stints were with the Washington Nationals (243 games from 1887 
to 1889), the Kansas City Cowboys (113 games in 1886), and the Baltimore 
Orioles (106 games in 1896). In 1896, he raised his batting average to 
.328 and was the starting third baseman for the 1896 Baltimore Orioles 
team than won the National League pennant with a 90–39 record. Donnelly 
was born in 1865 in New Haven, Connecticut.[1] His parents, Michael and 
Sarah Donnelly, were immigrants from Ireland. His father worked in a lock 
shop.[2][3] Donnelly began his professional baseball career in 1884 with 
the Terre Haute, Indiana baseball club in the Northwestern League.[4] In 
August of that same year, he made his major league debut with the Indianapolis 
Hoosiers of the National League. In 40 games with the Hoosiers, Donnelly 
compiled a .254 batting average In 1885, the Hoosiers left the National 
League, lost their major league status, and joined the newly formed Western 
League in 1885. Donnelly remained with the Hoosiers at the start of the 
1885 season and compiled a .211 batting average in 32 games.[4] The Hoosiers 
were the dominant team in the Western League, compiling an .880 winning 
percentage. In mid June 1885, the Western League disbanded, and a mad rush 
developed to sign the players on the Indianapolis roster, a line-up that 
included Sam Thompson, Deacon McGuire, Sam Crane, Chub Collins, Mox McQuery, 
Gene Moriarty, and Dan Casey.[5] Donnelly was sold in a deal that sent 
most of the Hoosiers' roster to the Detroit Wolverines. Donnelly appeared 
in 56 games, all at third base, for the Wolverines during the 1885 season. 
He compiled a .232 batting average with four doubles, three triples, one 
home run and 22 RBIs.[1] Prior to the 1886 season, Donnelly was purchased 
by the Kansas City Cowboys from the Wolverines. He appeared in 113 games, 
all at third base, for the Cowboys in 1886 and compiled a .201 batting 
average. He ranked among the leading National League third basemen that 
year with 73 errors (1st), 153 putouts (2nd), 13 double plays turned (3rd), 
and a 3.52 range factor (3rd).[1] In March 1887, the Washington Nationals 
purchased rights to Donnelly for $2,500. He played three seasons with the 
Nationals from 1887 to 1889. He was the team's starting third baseman during 
the 1887 and 1888 seasons, appearing in 239 games during those two seasons. 
During the 1887 season, he ranked among the leading National League third 
basemen with 63 errors (2nd), 21 double plays turned (2nd), a 3.57 range 
factor (4th), and 136 putouts (5th). He also ranked second in the league 
with 51 errors at third base in 1888.[1] In 1889, Donnelly appeared in 
only four games for the Nationals and spent most of the season with the 
newly formed Detroit Wolverines of the International League. He compiled 
a .285 batting average in 89 games for Detroit in 1889 and played another 
16 games for Detroit in 1890.[4] On July 19, 1890, Donnelly was dealt by 
Detroit to the St. Louis Browns of the American Association. In his return 
to the major leagues, he compiled a career high .333 batting average in 
11 games with the Browns.[1] Donnelly began the 1891 season with Omaha 
in the Western Association. He compiled a .268 batting average in 58 games 
with Omaha.[4] In July 1891, Donnelly jumped from Omaha to the Columbus 
Solons of the American Association. He appeared in only 17 games for the 
Solons and was released on August 25, 1891.[1] After his brief stint with 
the Solons, Donnelly again returned to the minor leagues, playing in the 
Eastern League for four years from 1892 to 1895, including stints with 
the Buffalo Bisons, New Haven Nutmegs, Troy Trojans, and Springfield Ponies. 
He compiled a .334 batting average in 101 games with Troy in 1893 and hit 
.305 in 93 games for Springfield in 1895.[4] Donnelly returned to the major 
leagues in 1896 with the Baltimore Orioles. Donnelly appeared in 106 games 
as the team's third baseman, replacing John McGraw at the position. He 
joined an Orioles team that was managed by Ned Hanlon, featured Hughie 
Jennings and Willie Keeler, and won the National League pennant with a 
90–39 record.[6] In May 1896, The Sporting Life wrote that "[a] prettier 
or a headier fielder than Jim Donnelly it would be difficult to find", 
but found it to be a pity that he was not more capable with the bat.[7] 
In the end, Donnelly's bat perked up considerably in his only season with 
the Orioles, as he compiled a .328 batting average with 14 doubles, 10 
triples, 71 RBIs, and 38 stolen bases.[1] In November 1896, the Orioles 
traded Donnelly with Steve Brodie to the Pittsburgh Pirates for Elmer Horton, 
Tom O'Brien, Jake Stenzel and Harry Truby. Donnelly appeared in 44 games 
for the Pirates and finished the 1887 season appearing in 23 games for 
the New York Giants. His batting average in 1897 dropped to .191 – a decline 
of .137 points from the previous year.[1] In November 1897, the Giants 
traded Donnelly and Ducky Holmes with $3,500 to the St. Louis Browns for 
Mike Grady and Fred Hartman.[1] In early April 1898, The Sporting News 
questioned Donnelly's readiness for major league play: "Jim Donnelly has 
not shown up well so far. He has dicky legs, his fielding has not been 
particularly brilliant, and his batting has been lamentably weak."[8] On 
May 12, 1898, Donnelly appeared in his first and only game for the Browns 
– Donnelly's last in the major leagues. He had a double in his only at 
bat in the game.[1] Although his major league career ended in May 1898, 
Donnelly continued to play in the minor leagues through the 1900 season, 
including stints with the Syracuse Stars, New Haven Blues, and Springfield 
Ponies.[4] At the time of the 1900 United States Census, Donnelly was living 
with his mother, Sarah, and sister, Minnie, in New Haven, Connecticut. 
His occupation was listed as a ball player.[9] Donnelly was married in 
1909 to Elizabeth Kissan. By 1910, Donnelly and his wife were living in 
Stamford, Connecticut, and he was employed as a railroad brakeman.[10] 
Donnelly died in 1915 at age 49 in Meriden, Connecticut.[1] Donnelly played 
during the same time period as James Henry Donnelly, who played third base 
for the Kansas City Cowboys in 1884.[11] Their statistics are often conflated
