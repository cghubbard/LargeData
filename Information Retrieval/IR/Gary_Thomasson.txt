Gary Leah Thomasson (born July 29, 1951) is a retired Major League Baseball 
player. An outfielder and first baseman, Thomasson played with the San 
Francisco Giants, Oakland Athletics, New York Yankees, and Los Angeles 
Dodgers from 1972 to 1980. He was part of the Yankees' 1978 World Series 
winning team over the Dodgers. Thomasson attended Oceanside High School 
in Oceanside, California and was drafted by the San Francisco Giants in 
the 7th round of the 1969 Major League Baseball Draft.[1] He made his Major 
League debut on September 5, 1972, pinch hitting for pitcher Frank Reberger 
in a 4 - 3 Giants' win over the San Diego Padres.[2] In 1973, his first 
full Major League season, Thomasson hit .285 in 112 games. A significant 
trade on March 15, 1978, sent Thomasson to the Oakland A's along with Gary 
Alexander, Dave Heaverlo, Phil Huffman, John Henry Johnson, Alan Wirth, 
a player to be named later (Mario Guerrero), and $300,000, in exchange 
for All-Star pitcher Vida Blue. Thomasson spent only a few months and 47 
games with Oakland before being traded to the New York Yankees for Dell 
Alston, Mickey Klutts, and $50,000, on June 15, 1978. Eight months later 
he was on the move again, dealt to the Los Angeles Dodgers for catcher 
Brad Gulden on February 15, 1979. Purchased from the Dodgers by the Yomiuri 
Giants of Japanese Nippon Pro Baseball on December 22, 1980, Thomasson 
spent his final two professional seasons (1981â€“82) in Japan. Signed with 
great fanfare to the biggest contract ever given to a player in the Nippon 
league, Thomasson was a disappointment in his two years in Japan, coming 
close to setting the league strikeout record before a knee injury ended 
his career.[3] Tokyo writer and conceptual artist Genpei Akasegawa published 
a book containing photographs of found objects which he termed "Hyperart 
Thomasson".[4] The book enjoyed a cult following among late-1980s Japanese
