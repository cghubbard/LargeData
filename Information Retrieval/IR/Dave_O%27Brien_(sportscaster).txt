Dave O'Brien (born August 3, 1963) is an American sportscaster who currently 
works for ESPN, Westwood One, and New England Sports Network. Born in Quincy, 
Massachusetts, O'Brien grew up in New Hampshire before studying broadcasting 
at Syracuse University. From 1987 to 1992 he worked as a sportscaster in 
Atlanta, Georgia, calling play-by-play for Major League Baseball's Atlanta 
Braves in 1990-91 as well as college football and basketball games for 
Georgia and Miami, garnering the Georgia Associated Press' "Best Sports 
Play-by-Play" accolade in 1988 and 1991. O'Brien then broadcast for the 
Florida Marlins from the team's inaugural year in 1993 through 2001, including 
their first World Series win in 1997. He has also occasionally called Atlanta 
Falcons games. O'Brien recorded play-by-play "commentary" for the High 
Heat Major League Baseball video game series for its 2002, 2003, and 2004 
installments, along with color commentator Chuck Valenches.[1] O'Brien 
provided commentary for MLB's international coverage of the World Series 
from 2004 until 2009. O'Brien was television voice of the New York Mets 
on WPIX-TV from 2003 through 2005. He won the Achievements in Radio (A.I.R.) 
award for Best Play-by-Play for his call of Mark McGwire's 59th home run 
in 1998.[2] Prior to the 2005 season, O'Brien was denied permission by 
ESPN to join the Chicago Cubs' broadcast team.[3] In 2007, O'Brien joined 
the Boston Red Sox Radio Network, calling games alongside primary play-by-play 
announcer Joe Castiglione. In 2011, O'Brien became the primary play-by-play 
announcer with Castiglione becoming the secondary announcer. On August 
25, 2015, it was announced that O'Brien would be the primary play-by-play 
announcer for Red Sox telecasts on NESN beginning in 2016, replacing Don 
Orsillo.[4][5] O'Brien has called play-by-play for ESPN since 2002, handling 
MLB, the NBA, college basketball, and soccer (including Major League Soccer's 
MLS Primetime Thursday and United States men's national soccer team telecasts). 
O'Brien joined Marcelo Balboa on the primary broadcast team for the 2006 
FIFA World Cup coverage on ESPN and ABC Sports, despite having no experience 
calling soccer matches prior to that year. Because The Walt Disney Company, 
owner of both television outlets, retained control over on-air talent, 
the appointment of O'Brien as the main play-by-play voice was made over 
the objections of Soccer United Marketing, who wanted JP Dellacamera to 
continue in that role. Disney stated that their broadcast strategy was 
intended, in voice and style, to target the vast majority of Americans 
who do not follow the sport on a regular basis. Mispronunciation and incorrect 
addressing of names, misuse of soccer terminology, and lack of insight 
into tactics and history plagued the telecasts, resulting in heavy criticism 
from English-speaking soccer fans, many of whom ended up watching the games 
on Univision instead.[6][7] In 2007, O'Brien called play-by-play for an 
ESPN broadcast of a game between the San Francisco Giants and the San Diego 
Padres, in which Barry Bonds tied the major league all-time home run record 
with his 755th home run. He also called the August 7, 2007, game between 
the Giants and the Washington Nationals in which Bonds hit his 756th home 
run, breaking the record that was held by Hank Aaron for more than 33 years. 
O'Brien called a triple-overtime college basketball game between Oklahoma 
State and Texas on January 16, 2007. He called the game on ESPN2 alongside 
Rick Majerus. Oklahoma State won 105-103. O'Brien also called David Ortiz's 
grand slam off Joaquin Benoit in Game 2 of the 2013 American League Championship 
Series between the Boston Red Sox and the Detroit Tigers. Dave O'Brien 
has been married to his high school sweetheart, Debbie Nason O'Brien, for 
over 25 years. The couple has a son, Michael, and two daughters, Samantha 
and Katie. They live in Rye, New Hampshire. Michael serves with the 101st
