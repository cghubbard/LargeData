Albert James Whaling (June 22, 1888 in Los Angeles â€“ January 7, 1965 in 
Sawtelle, California) was an American professional baseball player.[1] 
He played as a catcher in Major League Baseball for the Boston Braves from 
1913 to 1915.[1] Whaling batted and threw right-handed.[1] Whaling began 
his professional baseball career at the age of 20 with the Portland Beavers 
in 1908.[2] He then played for the Seattle Giants from 1909 to 1911.[2] 
In August 1911, he was signed by the Cleveland Naps of the American League 
but, didn't play at the major league level.[3] In April 1912, Whaling was 
released by the Naps and returned to play for the Seattle Giants where, 
he posted a .264 batting average and hit 10 home runs.[2][4] Whaling's 
defensive skills were made evident as he threw out 188 baserunners attempting 
to steal a base during the 1912 season.[5] During the Deadball Era, catchers 
played a huge defensive role, given the large number of bunts and stolen 
base attempts, as well as the difficulty of handling the spitball pitchers 
who dominated pitching staffs.[6] A newspaper report in 1912 called Whaling 
the best catcher to have ever played in the Northwestern League.[7] Whaling 
signed a contract to play for the Boston Braves in October 1912, and made 
his major league debut with the team on April 22, 1913 at the age of 25.[1][5] 
He posted a .242 batting average in 79 games while sharing starting catching 
duties with Bill Rariden.[1] Whaling had a .990 fielding percentage that 
year, becoming the first rookie catcher in major league baseball history 
to win a fielding title.[8][9] Only four other rookie catchers in Major 
League Baseball history have accomplished the feat.[9] Before the 1914 
season began, Rariden left the Braves to join the Federal League leaving 
Whaling as their main catcher with Hank Gowdy as his back up.[10] When 
Whaling failed to provide much offense, Braves manager, George Stallings 
gave Gowdy the starting catcher's job.[10] The Braves had been in last 
place in the National League on July 4 before going on an extended winning 
streak.[11] The team went from last place to first place within a two-month 
period, becoming the first team to win a pennant after being in last place 
on the Fourth of July.[11] Whaling hit .206 in 60 games as Gowdy's back 
up and led National League catchers in baserunners caught stealing percentage 
with 54.5%.[1][12] The Braves went on to sweep Connie Mack's heavily favored 
Philadelphia Athletics in four games in the 1914 World Series, although 
Whaling never got a chance to play in the series.[13] The team became known 
as the "Miracle" Braves and remain one of the most storied comeback teams 
in baseball history.[14] While he was a weak hitter and a slow runner, 
Whaling developed a reputation as a fine defensive catcher.[15] In his 
final major league season, 1915, Whaling hit .221 in 72 games (42 at-bats), 
once again as the back up to Gowdy.[1] He appeared in his final major league 
game on October 7, 1915.[1] It was reported that there was friction between 
Whaling and the Braves management and, on October 13, he was traded with 
Herbie Moran to the Pacific Coast League's Vernon Tigers for Joe Wilhoit.[1][16] 
After threatening to join the outlaw Federal League, Whaling signed with 
the Tigers in December 1915.[16][17] Whaling played with the Vernon Tigers 
for two seasons before joining the United States Navy during World War 
I.[18][19] After his discharge from military service, Whaling then became 
a journeyman baseball player. In 1917, he signed to play for the Great 
Falls Electrics however, two months later he was reported to be playing 
in Arizona for the Copper Queen Mine baseball team.[20][21] In 1918, he 
played in Medicine Hat, Alberta before applying for the job of manager 
of the Regina Senators in 1919.[22] In May 1920, he was signed as a player 
for the Regina club.[18] Whaling continued to play in minor league baseball, 
never staying with a team for more than one season with the exception of 
two seasons spent with the Denver Bears in 1924 and 1925.[2] He played 
his final season as a player-manager for the Salt Lake City Bees in 1926 
before ending his playing career at the age of 38.[2] In a three-year major 
league career, Whaling played in 211 games, accumulating 129 hits in 573 
at bats for a .225 career batting average along with 0 home runs, 50 runs 
batted in and an on-base percentage of .283.[1] He scored 50 runs while 
walking 39 times and had 98 strikeouts.[1] His .986 career fielding average 
was 15 points higher than the league average over the span of his playing 
career.[1] Whaling also spent twelve seasons in the minor leagues, hitting 
.245 in 793 games.[2] After serving as a player-manager for the Salt Lake 
City Bees in 1926, Whaling was named the manager of the Phoenix Senators, 
and led them to the Arizona State League championship in 1928.[19][23] 
Whaling died in Los Angeles, California on January 21, 1965 and was interred
