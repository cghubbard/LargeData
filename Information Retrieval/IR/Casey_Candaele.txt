As coach Casey Todd Candaele (born January 12, 1961) is a former Major 
League Baseball (MLB) player from 1986 to 1997 for the Montreal Expos, 
Houston Astros, and Cleveland Indians. He currently serves as first base 
coach of the Seattle Mariners. His mother, Helen Callaghan St. Aubin, played 
for the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League, which was depicted 
in the movie A League of Their Own. Casey and his mother represent the 
only mother/son combination to have both played professional baseball.[1] 
The 5' 9", 165 pounds (75 kg) switch hitter was born in Lompoc, California, 
on January 12, 1961. Candaele attended the University of Arizona, where 
he played collegiate baseball for the Wildcats and was a part of the 1980 
College World Series champion team. He was signed by the Montreal Expos 
on August 15, 1982 as an amateur free agent.[2] Candaele split the 1983 
season between Class A and Class AA baseball. With the West Palm Beach 
Expos of the Class A Florida State League, he batted .305 in 127 games; 
he played 5 games for the Memphis Chicks of the Class AA Southern League. 
He played the 1984 season with the Jacksonville Suns, batting .273 in 132 
games with the team. He played the next two seasons with the Class AAA 
Indianapolis Indians of the American Association, batting .259 in 302 games 
in 1985 and finishing the 1986 season with a .302 average in 119 games.[3] 
Candaele made his major league debut for the Expos on June 5, 1986, pinch 
hitting for pitcher Dan Schatzeder and striking out against Charles Hudson 
in a 7–3 loss to the Philadelphia Phillies at Olympic Stadium.[4] He finished 
the 1986 season with 24 hits in 104 at-bats for a batting average of .231. 
In 1987, his first full year in the major leagues, Candaele batted .272 
with one home run and 23 RBI in 138 games.[2] He struck out just 28 times 
in 495 plate appearances. He played second base, shortstop, all three outfield 
positions, and first base. He came in fourth in balloting for the 1987 
Major League Baseball Rookie of the Year Award in the National League, 
an award that went to catcher Benito Santiago of the San Diego Padres.[5] 
Candaele played the first half of the 1988 season with the Expos, batting 
.172 in 38 games, with 20 hits in 116 at bats.[2] He played in 60 games 
for the Indianapolis Indians in 1988, batting .264 in 60 games.[3] The 
Expos traded Candaele on July 23, 1988, to the Houston Astros in exchange 
for catcher Mark Bailey. With the Astros that season, he played in 21 games, 
with his 5 hits in 31 at bats yielding a .161 batting average.[2] He played 
in 17 games with the Tucson Toros of the Class AAA Pacific Coast League 
in the Astros organization, hitting for a .258 average.[3] He played in 
130 games for the Astros in 1990, hitting for a .286 average with 3 home 
runs.[2] That season he also played in 7 games for the Toros, hitting for 
a .214 average.[3] He played the entire 1991 season with the Astros, finishing 
the season with an average of .262, and having career highs with 151 games 
played and 4 home runs to go along with 7 triples, which placed him ninth 
in the National league in that category.[2] His average dropped to .213 
for the 1992 season, with Candaele playing in 135 games.[2] Candaele split 
the 1993 season, playing 75 games with the Astros and hitting .240, with 
another 6 games played in Tucson, where he batted .296.[2][3] On October 
4, 1993, he was granted free agency by the Astros, and he was signed on 
November 24 by the Cincinnati Reds.[2] He played the entire 1994 season 
with the Indianapolis Indians, by then the Reds' AAA affiliate, and hit 
for a .282 average in 131 games with the team.[3] He was released by the 
Reds on October 15, 1994 and signed with the Los Angeles Dodgers on February 
1, 1995.[2] He played for the Albuquerque Dukes of the Pacific Coast League 
in the Dodgers organization, hitting .259 in 12 games.[3] The Dodgers released 
Candaele on April 26, 1995, and he was picked up as a free agent by the 
Cleveland Indians on May 5.[2] He played most of the 1995 season with the 
Buffalo Bisons of the American Association, hitting for a .247 average 
in 97 games with the team.[3] In 24 games for the Indians in 1996, he hit 
for a .250 average.[2] His last major league season was in 1997, which 
he finished with a .308 average in 14 games.[2] His final game was on July 
13, 1997, against the Minnesota Twins, in which Candaele came in the game 
in the seventh inning to replace Julio Franco at second base, with his 
final at bat resulting in a fly out to left field in the ninth inning of 
a 12–5 win.[6] He also played 79 games for the Bisons in the 1997 season, 
finishing with a .228 batting average. He played another three seasons 
shuffling around the minors, retiring after the 2000 season.[2] The Seattle 
Mariners hired Candaele as their first base coach during the 2015-16 offseason.[7] 
Houston Astros Hall of Fame announcer Milo Hamilton called Candaele the 
"Mighty Mite" for his aggressive play despite his diminutive size.[1] Casey's 
brother is filmmaker Kelly Candaele, whose PBS documentary about the AAGPBL 
led to the creation of the 1992 film A League of Their Own directed by 
Penny Marshall.[8] His mother Helen Callaghan, one of the best players 
in the league's history, won a batting title while collecting a .257 batting 
average and 354 stolen bases in her 388-game career over five seasons.[9]
