As Player As Coach Russell Jay Kuntz (/ˈkuːnts/; born February 4, 1955) 
is an American retired Major League Baseball (MLB) outfielder. He played 
for the Chicago White Sox, Minnesota Twins and Detroit Tigers between 1979 
and 1985. He never appeared in more than 84 games in any season during 
his playing career. In the final game of the 1984 World Series, Kuntz hit 
a pop fly to the second baseman that became the deciding run batted in 
(RBI). Kuntz grew up in Kansas and California, playing three sports in 
high school and community college. He went to the Division III World Series 
twice with California State University, Stanislaus before being selected 
by the White Sox in the 11th round of the 1977 Major League Baseball draft. 
After the 1984 season, Kuntz was unable to return to form the next year. 
He was demoted to the minor leagues early in the 1985 season and was out 
of professional baseball as a player shortly thereafter. Since his playing 
career ended, Kuntz has worked with several MLB organizations, including 
the Houston Astros, Seattle Mariners, Florida Marlins, Kansas City Royals, 
Atlanta Braves and Pittsburgh Pirates. He has worked as an assistant to 
the general manager, minor league coach, roving instructor and major league 
base coach. Since 2012, he has served as the first base coach for the Kansas 
City Royals, and has received substantial praise for his contributions 
to the team's success during that period. "Rusty Kuntz", Royals manager 
Ned Yost has said, "is the best first base coach in baseball."[1] Kuntz 
was born on February 4, 1955 in Orange, California.[2] He was born to Chet 
and Willie Kuntz. His father was a bricklayer who later became an auto 
mechanic. The family moved from Orange to Wichita, Kansas when Rusty was 
young, then moved to Paso Robles, California a few years later. He attended 
Paso Robles High School in California, where he played baseball, basketball, 
and football. He said that baseball was his least favorite of the three 
sports at the time and that he was drawn to basketball because of the game's 
pace.[3] Continuing his education, Kuntz attended Cuesta College and California 
State University, Stanislaus. At Cuesta College, Kuntz played center field 
on the baseball team, quarterbacked the football team and was the center 
on the basketball team. After hitting for .402 and .442 batting averages 
in two seasons at Cuesta, Kuntz's father encouraged him to focus on baseball.[3] 
At CSU Stanislaus, Kuntz played on two teams that went to the Division 
III World Series.[4] He was later inducted into the university's Warrior 
Athletics Hall of Fame.[5] Kuntz was drafted by the Chicago White Sox as 
the first pick in the 11th round of the 1977 Major League Baseball draft.[6] 
Kuntz played 51 games for the rookie-level Gulf Coast League White Sox 
in the 1977 season. He hit for .287 as the team finished first in the Gulf 
Coast League standings.[7][8] The next season, Kuntz was promoted to the 
Class AA team, the Knoxville Sox. He bypassed the Class A affiliate because 
the Knoxville center fielder was suffering from migraine headaches, and 
he won the starting center field position.[3] He hit .263 for Knoxville 
with 10 home runs in 113 games; the team was managed by Tony La Russa for 
part of the season and won first place in the Southern League. Starting 
the 1979 season with Chicago's Class AAA affiliate, the Iowa Oaks, Kuntz 
played 122 games, batted .294 and hit 15 home runs in 394 at bats.[7][9] 
Kuntz stood 6 feet 3 inches (1.91 m) and weighed 190 pounds (86 kg) during 
his playing career. He batted and threw right-handed. Kuntz made his MLB 
debut with the White Sox on September 1, 1979. He spent all of the 1980 
and 1981 seasons with the White Sox, but he was used sparingly, registering 
less than 120 plate appearances in the two seasons combined.[2] He started 
1982 in the minor leagues with the Edmonton Trappers of the Pacific Coast 
League, hitting .269 with 7 home runs and 34 RBI in 193 at bats. He walked 
50 times in 249 plate appearances for Edmonton. He was called back up to 
the major league team near the end of that season.[3] He was traded to 
the Minnesota Twins in June 1983, with the White Sox receiving minor leaguer 
Mike Sodders in exchange. He was traded to the Detroit Tigers for pitcher 
Larry Pashnick after the 1983 season.[10] The Pashnick-Kuntz trade was 
prompted because future Baseball Hall of Fame outfielder Kirby Puckett 
was playing in the minor leagues for Minnesota's Class AA affiliate and 
was expected to quickly join the Twins as an impact player.[3] In 1984 
with Detroit, Kuntz had the best numbers of his career: a .286 average 
and a .393 on-base percentage. He appeared in a career-high 84 major league 
games that season, mostly as a pinch-hitter and outfielder.[2] In the fifth 
and deciding game of the 1984 World Series against the San Diego Padres, 
Kuntz pinch-hit for designated hitter Johnny Grubb with the bases loaded 
and the score tied at three. Kuntz hit a pop-up to short right field that 
Tony Gwynn was unable to see. Second baseman Alan Wiggins made the catch, 
but was unable to prevent Kirk Gibson from racing home from third with 
the go-ahead run. The Tigers maintained their lead after that, giving Kuntz 
an unlikely game-winning RBI.[3] The 1984 American League Championship 
Series and the ensuing World Series represented Kuntz's only career postseason 
appearances.[2] In a 2010 Baseball Prospectus article, Steven Goldman wrote 
that the 1984 Tigers were "a great team that relied on a lot of fluke elements... 
The club had no regular first baseman, no regular third baseman, and the 
primary left fielder hit .239/.302/.342 against right-handers. The club 
made up for this in part by getting terrific production out of role players 
like Ruppert Jones, Johnny Grubb, and Rusty Kuntz, players who wouldn't 
synch up again..."[11] Kuntz returned to the Tigers in 1985 but appeared 
in just five games (last on April 24, 1985) before being sent back to the 
minor leagues. After batting .222 for Detroit's AAA affiliate, the Nashville 
Sounds, he was released by the Detroit organization. He signed with the 
Oakland Athletics a couple of months later, but he did not play any games 
with them.[3] Kuntz retired as a player with 277 games played, a .236 career 
batting average, 5 home runs and 38 RBI.[2] Kuntz was out of baseball in 
1986, working for the United Parcel Service.[3] He worked as a coach in 
the Houston Astros organization during the 1987 and 1988 seasons, then 
moved to the Seattle Mariners. With Seattle, he served as a first-base 
coach between 1989 and 1992.[4] Kuntz joined the Florida Marlins organization 
in 1993 as a minor league baserunning and outfield coach.[4] He became 
the team's first-base coach after the 1994 season.[12] In 1997, Kuntz moved 
into a role as roving instructor with the Marlins organization. In August 
of that year he worked on defensive skills with Gary Sheffield when the 
major league slugger was struggling with injuries.[13] In late 2000, Kuntz 
decided not to return to his role as first-base coach and outfield instructor. 
Instead, he went back to his position as a roving instructor with the team, 
which allowed for more time to be spent with his family. At that time, 
Marlins players including Cliff Floyd and Mark Kotsay praised Kuntz for 
the amount of preparation that he put into his coaching. Kotsay gave Kuntz 
credit for the stolen bases he had accrued. Floyd said, ""I don't know 
what I'm going to do. I'm telling you, he's meant everything. He tells 
me about every pitcher we're facing. He keeps me going when I'm down. You 
don't get that too often in this game. You're expected just to be strong, 
handle everything. But it ain't that easy sometimes. He's a players' man. 
He loves us."[14] Kuntz was dismissed from his position with the Marlins 
before spring training in 2002. The move was part of a mass firing of Marlins 
personnel in player development and scouting after the team's change in 
ownership. Kuntz, who was paid for the 2002 season in any case due to the 
terms of his contract, kept a job working on the grounds crew at the team's 
spring training site. He had performed ground crew duties at the site for 
several years in the offseasons.[15] Late in the 2002 season, the Atlanta 
Braves hired Kuntz as a roving instructor. After the season, he was hired 
by the Pittsburgh Pirates as a first-base coach.[16] In October 2005, the 
Pirates offered minor league positions to Kuntz and fellow coaches Gerald 
Perry and Alvaro Espinoza.[17] He spent the next two seasons coaching between 
the Class AAA Indianapolis Indians and the major league club.[4] After 
the 2007 season, the Kansas City Royals named him their first-base coach.[18] 
In October 2009, the team reassigned him, designating him field instructor 
and special assistant to the team's general manager, Dayton Moore.[19][20] 
In August 2012, he was named the Royals' first base coach after the dismissal 
of Doug Sisson. Sisson had replaced Kuntz as the Royals' first base coach 
after the 2010 season.[21] At the conclusion of the 2012 season, the Royals 
announced that they would retain Kuntz for the 2013 season.[22] In a January 
2014 article, the Boston Globe listed Kuntz as one of the baserunning/outfield 
coaches who had the most respect among his peers in the major leagues. 
"Kuntz's outfielders are fundamentally sound and get great jumps on balls. 
Kuntz has been able to improve arm accuracy".[23] Kuntz's son Kevin was 
drafted by the Royals in the 2009 MLB draft but he chose to play baseball 
at the University of Kansas. He was selected again by the Royals in the 
28th round of the 2013 MLB draft.[24] Kevin spent the 2013 season in the 
minor leagues at the team's rookie-level affiliate, the Burlington Royals.[25] 
The coach's name has been the subject of some media coverage. A 2010 Bleacher 
Report article said that his name was "hands down the best name ever. So 
many jokes, so little time."[26] In April 2013, The Big Lead wrote about 
the name after a photo depicted Kuntz standing to the right of White Sox 
first baseman Paul Konerko and Royals baserunner Chris Getz. The resulting 
image seemed to display the phrase "Konerko Getz Kuntz" on the backs of
