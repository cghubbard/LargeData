A World Series ring is an award given to Major League Baseball players 
who win the World Series. Since only one Commissioner's Trophy is awarded 
to the team, a World Series ring is an individual award that players and 
staff of each World Series champion team get to keep for themselves to 
symbolize the victory. World Series rings are uniquely commissioned by 
the winning team each year and presented to deserving players and staff 
early in the next season.[1] The rings have been made by companies that 
include Jostens, Tiffany & Co., Dieges & Clust, and the L.G. Balfour Company. 
The first World Series ring was given to members of the New York Giants 
after winning the 1922 World Series.[2] By the 1930s, each winning team 
gave their players a ring. Though the ring started off simple, usually 
containing only one diamond, rings over time have become more elaborate 
and ornate, with the 2003 World Series ring containing over 200 diamonds. 
In addition to their inherent value, World Series rings also carry additional 
value as sports memorabilia. A World Series ring belonging to Casey Stengel 
sold for $180,000. Lenny Dykstra's 1986 World Series ring sold for over 
$56,000 during his bankruptcy proceedings. Other rings sold in auctions 
have sold for over $10,000 apiece. Replica rings given to fans have sold 
for as much as $300. Prior to the 1922 World Series, players on the World 
Series-winning team were given keepsakes, such as a pin or pocketwatch 
fob.[3] The first World Series ring was given to the members of the New 
York Giants following their victory in the 1922 World Series over the New 
York Yankees.[2] When the Yankees won the 1923 World Series, players were 
given a commemorative pocketwatch. The Yankees first gave rings to their 
players following the 1927 World Series.[4] Rings became an annual tradition 
in the 1930s,[5] as every World Series-winning team has given rings to 
its players since 1932.[6] In past years, players often requested other 
items in place of rings, including cufflinks and tie clips. Frankie Crosetti 
and Tommy Henrich requested shotguns from the Yankees following World Series 
championships.[7] Grover Cleveland Alexander reportedly pawned his 1926 
World Series ring.[6] Members of the 1973 World Series champion Oakland 
Athletics were upset when team owner Charlie O. Finley, following salary 
disputes with his players, presented his team with rings that were identical 
to the ones received after winning the 1972 World Series, except without 
the one-carat diamond. Reggie Jackson referred to them as "trash rings".[7][8][9] 
The first ring to contain more than one diamond was the 1977 World Series 
ring commissioned by the Yankees, which had over a dozen diamonds.[8] Over 
time, ring designs have become larger and more elaborate, with Yogi Berra 
saying in 2009, "They're so much bigger now, they're like weapons. You 
can't even wear them."[7] Whereas older rings were 10 carat and between 
20 and 25 pennyweight, modern rings are typically 14 carat and 50 pennyweight.[7][disputed 
– discuss] The rings commissioned by the Florida Marlins after the 2003 
World Series are believed to be the most expensive World Series rings ever 
made; made of 14-carat white gold, the 3.5-ounce (99 g) ring featured 229 
diamonds, including one teal diamond, and 13 rubies. The rings cost $20,000 
apiece due to the quantity of the purchase, though they retailed at $40,000 
each.[8][10][11] Teams have also increasingly added distinctive touches 
to make their rings unique from previous versions. For their 2007 World 
Series rings, the Boston Red Sox commissioned a special version for players 
who were on both the 2004 and 2007 championship teams, and for 2013, they 
included the Boston Strong logo on the side.[12][13] The St. Louis Cardinals 
had the Rally Squirrel engraved into their 2011 World Series championship 
rings.[14] For their 2014 World Series rings, the San Francisco Giants 
included three diamonds on the top bezel and five on the bottom, representing 
their three titles in five years, and eight championships overall.[15] 
Companies that have been commissioned to create World Series rings include 
Jostens, Tiffany & Co., Dieges & Clust, and the L.G. Balfour Company.[16][17][18] 
In modern years, the importance of World Series rings to players has increased.[19] 
Players typically receive their rings in pregame ceremonies early in the 
next season.[14][16][20] Alex Rodriguez said his 2009 World Series ring 
"means the world" to him, and that he would wear it daily.[21] Sergio Romo 
of the 2010 World Series champion San Francisco Giants said of his ring: 
"In all reality, this is why we play right here."[3] Former player and 
current Giants broadcaster Duane Kuiper said, "It's not a hug. It's not 
a handshake. It's not a pat on the back. It's a ring. It's the one thing 
every professional athlete wants: something they can hold onto, something 
they can show off."[22] Players' names and uniform numbers are often inscribed 
in their ring.[7] Many players prefer to display their rings as trophies 
as opposed to wearing them.[7] I've seen it called "tacky" and it is, but 
here's the thing about these rings: They're not supposed to be understated. 
They're always over the top. When they're worn, they're done so obnoxiously. 
There's nothing humble or particularly beautiful about them. In fact, they're 
always kind of ugly, no matter the team. They're full of jewels and they're 
shiny, but it's always too much. Since the rings are commissioned by the 
team, many non-players affiliated with the team, including front office 
executives, coaches, broadcasters,[23] and locker room staff, also receive 
rings at the team's discretion.[3][7] After the 2004 World Series, the 
Red Sox ordered over 500 rings,[24] and the 2006 Cardinals commissioned 
400 rings.[1] Players who were only briefly on the team's roster during 
a championship season and those no longer affiliated with the winning team 
also often receive rings.[25][26] Arthur Rhodes, Bengie Molina, and Lonnie 
Smith played in the World Series against a team they played for earlier 
in the season, guaranteeing them World Series rings regardless of the series 
outcome.[27] As both the physical size and number of rings given out has 
increased, teams have started producing both "A" and "B" versions, and 
sometimes "C" versions, that are similar in appearance but smaller in size 
and use cheaper materials.[28][29] World Series rings are considered valuable 
sports memorabilia. In 2007, Casey Stengel's 1951 World Series ring sold 
for $180,000.[30] When Lenny Dykstra went through bankruptcy in 2009, his 
1986 World Series ring sold for $56,762.50 through Heritage Auctions, three 
times as much as was expected.[31] Others have sold their rings on eBay. 
Doug Baker of the 1984 World Series champion Detroit Tigers had a new ring 
made after his original was stolen, and when he recovered the original 
ring, he sold it for $12,322.[32] Cucho Rodriguez, a scout for the Red 
Sox, sold his 2004 World Series ring for over $19,000[33][34] and in 2011, 
Scott Williamson auctioned off his 2004 ring for $89,000.[35] However, 
the ring that once belonged to disgraced pitcher Brandon Puffer, when offered 
for sale on the August 15, 2013, episode of Pawn Stars could not be sold. 
The shop declined to make an offer, claiming Puffer's off-field problems 
destroyed the resale value of the ring.[35] The National Baseball Hall 
of Fame and Museum contains an exhibit on World Series rings.[36] The New 
York Yankees Museum, located in Yankee Stadium, has an exhibit with replicas 
of all Yankees' World Series rings, including the pocket watch given after 
the 1923 World Series.[37] Yogi Berra won the most World Series rings with 
15, combining his time as a player and as a coach.[6] He often asked for 
a pendant to be made for his wife instead; he later had the other rings
