David Stearns (born 1984 or 1985) is an American baseball executive who 
serves as the general manager of the Milwaukee Brewers of Major League 
Baseball (MLB). Stearns previously served as the assistant general manager 
of MLB's Houston Astros, worked for the Office of the Commissioner of Baseball, 
the Arizona Fall League, and in the baseball operations departments for 
the Cleveland Indians and New York Mets. Stearns graduated from Harvard 
University with a degree in political science[1] in 2007. While he attended 
Harvard, he interned with the Pittsburgh Pirates of Major League Baseball 
(MLB).[2] After graduating from Harvard, Stearns worked for the baseball 
operations departments for the New York Mets and the Arizona Fall League.[3] 
He joined the MLB Central Office in 2008, where he worked on the negotiating 
team for MLB's collective bargaining agreement.[2][4] He spent his last 
13 months in the central office as manager of labor relations, where he 
aided teams going through the process of salary arbitration. In December 
2011, the Cleveland Indians hired Stearns and Derek Falvey as their co-directors 
of baseball operations, with Stearns focusing on player contracts, data 
analysis, and strategy, and Falvey working on player acquisitions.[5] In 
November 2012, the Houston Astros, who had lost over 100 games in both 
of the past two seasons, hired Stearns as assistant general manager, second 
only to Jeff Luhnow, the general manager.[3] While many organizations have 
multiple assistant general managers, the Astros employed only Stearns in 
the role.[6] When talking about August 2015, Luhnow said of his staff: 
“There’s several people in our organization that have GM potential, and 
David’s one of them."[7] At that time, the Milwaukee Brewers began searching 
for a new general manager, prioritizing youth and experience with data 
analytics, which the Astros used in their rebuild.[7] On September 21, 
2015, the Milwaukee Brewers named Stearns their next general manager, succeeding 
Doug Melvin, who they announced would remain with the team in an advisory 
role.[8] At thirty years of age, he became the youngest general manager 
in MLB, and is one year younger than the Brewers' Ryan Braun.[9][a] At 
his introductory press conference, Stearns endorsed Craig Counsell as the 
Brewers' manager.[10] Stearns fired five of the Brewers' seven coaches,[11] 
and began to restructure the front office by reassigning Gord Ash, the 
assistant general manager, and Reid Nichols, the farm director within the 
organization,[12] and hiring Matt Arnold from the Tampa Bay Rays as assistant 
general manager.[13] During his first offseason as general manager, Stearns 
replaced half of the members of the Brewers' 40-man roster.[14] Stearns 
was born and raised in Manhattan. He is engaged to Whitney Ann Lee.[15]
