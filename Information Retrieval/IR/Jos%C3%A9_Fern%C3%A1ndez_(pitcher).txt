José D. Fernández (July 31, 1992 – September 25, 2016) was a Cuban-born 
American professional baseball pitcher. He played in Major League Baseball 
(MLB) for the Miami Marlins from 2013 until his death in 2016. Fernández 
was born in Santa Clara, Cuba. He made three unsuccessful attempts at defecting 
before he was successful in 2008. He enrolled at Braulio Alonso High School 
in Tampa, Florida, and was selected by the Marlins in the first round of 
the 2011 MLB draft. Fernández made his MLB debut with the Marlins on April 
7, 2013. He was named to the 2013 MLB All-Star Game and won the National 
League (NL) Rookie of the Month Award in July and August. After the season, 
he won the NL Rookie of the Year Award and finished third in Cy Young Award 
balloting. He underwent "Tommy John" surgery during the 2014 season, and 
made the MLB All-Star Game again in 2016. Fernández died in a boating accident 
off Miami Beach on September 25, 2016. The Marlins announced that they 
will retire his uniform number to honor him. José Fernández grew up in 
Santa Clara, Cuba. There, he lived on the same street as, and was friends 
with, future Major League Baseball (MLB) shortstop Aledmys Díaz.[1] They 
played for the same youth baseball team, and Díaz's father and uncle encouraged 
Fernández's mother to bring him to the ballpark. Fernández commented that 
had Díaz's uncle not been an influence early in his life, he would not 
have pursued a professional baseball career.[2][3] Ramón Jiménez, Fernández's 
stepfather, defected from Cuba in 2005, settling in Tampa, Florida. Fernández 
attempted to defect unsuccessfully three times, with each failed defection 
attempt followed by a prison term. Fernández, along with his mother and 
sister, defected in 2007. On that successful attempt, José's mother fell 
overboard when the boat hit turbulent waters, and José had to dive into 
the water to save her life.[4] They reached Mexico, and then moved to Tampa 
in 2008.[5] Knowing Orlando Chinea, a coach who had trained some of Cuba's 
top pitchers before he defected from Cuba, lived in the area, Jiménez had 
his son train with Chinea.[6] He attended Braulio Alonso High School in 
Tampa, Florida.[7] Playing on the high school baseball team, Fernández 
was part of the Florida Class 6A state champions in his sophomore and senior 
seasons.[8] Before his senior year in 2011, the Florida High School Athletic 
Association ruled that Fernández was ineligible, as he entered the ninth 
grade while in Cuba in 2006 and had therefore exhausted his eligibility. 
MLB's Cincinnati Reds were prepared to sign Fernández as an international 
free agent to a $1.3 million signing bonus. Fernández won an appeal and 
was declared eligible for his senior year, ending Cincinnati's pursuit.[9] 
As a senior, Fernández pitched to a 13–1 win–loss record with a 2.35 earned 
run average (ERA) and 134 strikeouts. He also threw two no-hitters.[8] 
The Florida Marlins selected Fernández in the first round, with the 14th 
overall selection, of the 2011 MLB draft.[7] Fernández signed with the 
Marlins, receiving a $2 million signing bonus.[8] After he signed with 
the Marlins, he made one start for the Gulf Coast Marlins of the Rookie-level 
Gulf Coast League and one start for the Jamestown Jammers of the Class 
A-Short Season New York–Penn League.[10] Pitching for the Greensboro Grasshoppers 
of the Class A South Atlantic League (SAL) to start the 2012 season, Fernández 
threw the first six innings of a combined no-hitter.[7] He was twice named 
the SAL pitcher of the week.[11] Fernández was named to appear in the 2012 
All-Star Futures Game.[12] After pitching to a 7–0 win-loss record and 
a 1.59 ERA in 14 games for Greensboro, the Marlins promoted Fernández to 
the Jupiter Hammerheads of the Class A-Advanced Florida State League.[10] 
He finished the 2012 season with a 14–1 win-loss record, a 1.75 ERA, and 
158 strikeouts in 134 innings pitched at Greensboro and Jupiter. He was 
named the Marlins' Minor League Pitcher of the Year.[13] Prior to the 2013 
season, Baseball America ranked Fernández as the Marlins' best prospect 
and the fifth best prospect in all of baseball.[14][15] The Marlins invited 
Fernández to spring training but sent him to minor league camp before the 
season began. However, they chose to add Fernández to their 25-man Opening 
Day roster, due in part to injuries to Nathan Eovaldi and Henderson Álvarez.[16] 
Also, Marlins owner Jeffrey Loria hoped that promoting Fernández would 
buy him goodwill with the fans, following a fire sale the previous offseason.[17] 
He was planned to be limited to approximately 150 to 170 innings during 
the 2013 season in order to protect his development.[18] He was the second 
youngest National League player that season, older only than the Nationals' 
Bryce Harper.[19] The Marlins scheduled his major league debut on April 
7 against the New York Mets.[20] In his MLB debut, Fernández pitched five 
innings, allowing one run on three hits with eight strikeouts. He became 
the seventh pitcher under the age of 21 to record at least eight strikeouts 
in his MLB debut since 1916.[21] He impressed in his second start.[22] 
Despite a rough outing against the Tampa Bay Rays on May 27, Rays' manager 
Joe Maddon took to Twitter soon after watching Fernández pitch, saying, 
"José Fernández might be the best young pitcher I've ever seen, at that 
age. I believe he will go far."[23] On July 6, 2013, Fernández was selected 
to represent the Miami Marlins for the National League All Star team. He 
pitched a perfect 6th inning in the 2013 All-Star Game in which he struck 
out Dustin Pedroia, induced Miguel Cabrera to pop up for a flyout and struck 
Chris Davis out. With this performance, Fernández is one of only three 
pitchers in the history of the All-Star Game who struck out two batters 
prior to their 21st birthday for their All-Star debut, the other two being 
Dwight Gooden and Bob Feller.[24] Against the Pittsburgh Pirates on July 
28, Fernández recorded 13 strikeouts, earning the 3–2 victory.[25] With 
Fernández's 14-strikeout performance against the Cleveland Indians on August 
3, 2013, he became just the sixth pitcher since 2000 to strike out 13 or 
more batters in consecutive games.[26] He established the Marlins' rookie 
record for most strikeouts in one game. For his performance in July 2013, 
Fernández was named the Rookie of the Month for the National League, leading 
all qualified rookie pitchers in ERA.[27] He followed up his July by compiling 
a 1.15 ERA with 49 strikeouts in 39 innings pitched in August, which resulted 
him in receiving a second consecutive Rookie of the Month Award.[28] Fernández's 
rookie season has been considered historic[29][30] as his 4.2 Wins Above 
Replacement places him in the Top 10 player seasons among those under 21 
years old since 1900. Fernández's Adjusted ERA+ of 174[31] on the season 
also places him in the Top 10 all-time for pitchers under the age of 21, 
and he is only the fourth pitcher to record this feat in the past 100 years.[32] 
His strikeout rate is the highest in his league, pacing the National League 
at 9.81 strikeouts per nine innings.[33] At the time after his last start 
of his rookie season, Fernández was in the top 10 of many pitching statistics 
in the National League, including sixth in strikeouts (187), first in strikeouts 
per nine innings (9.75) and hits allowed per nine innings (5.759), second 
in ERA (2.19) and Adjusted ERA+ (176), and third in WAR (6.3).[34] Fernández 
won the Sporting News Rookie of the Year Award and the National League 
Rookie of the Year Award.[35][36] He came in third place in the Cy Young 
Award voting behind Adam Wainwright and winner Clayton Kershaw.[37] Fernández 
started his sophomore campaign as the Opening Day starter for the Marlins, 
making him the youngest Opening Day starting pitcher since Dwight Gooden 
in 1986.[38] Fernández recorded nine strikeouts while walking none, and 
he joined Bob Gibson, Steve Carlton, Ferguson Jenkins, Walter Johnson, 
and Cy Young as the only pitchers to do so on Opening Day.[39] On May 12, 
Fernández was placed on the 15-day disabled list due to a right elbow sprain. 
An MRI revealed that the elbow had a torn ulnar collateral ligament, which 
prematurely ended Fernández's 2014 season.[40][41] He underwent Tommy John 
surgery on May 16. He made eight starts, going 4–2 with a 2.44 ERA and 
70 strikeouts in 2014.[42] Fernández began the 2015 season on the 15-day 
disabled list but was later moved to the 60-day disabled list to continue 
recovery from Tommy John surgery.[43] It was announced by the Marlins on 
June 15 that he would make his season debut on July 2.[44] In his debut, 
Fernández recorded six strikeouts in six innings. He also hit a home run.[45] 
Fernández returned to the disabled list in August with a biceps strain 
in his pitching arm.[46] He returned to the mound in September and set 
a major league record for consecutive wins at home by a single pitcher 
with his seventeenth such win on the 25th of that month.[47][48] To aid 
his recovery from Tommy John surgery, Fernández cut back on the use of 
his fastball during spring training in 2016 and began working on his secondary 
pitches.[49] Appearing as a pinch hitter in the 12th inning against the 
Atlanta Braves on July 1, Fernández doubled in two runs to put the Marlins 
ahead 7–5, which ended up being the final score. He became just the second 
pitcher in Marlins history to produce a game-winning hit, following Dennis 
Cook on August 1, 1997.[50] Fernández appeared in the 2016 MLB All-Star 
Game.[51] Fernández's last game was on September 20. He pitched eight shutout 
innings in a 1–0 win against the division-leading Nationals, striking out 
12 batters and allowing just three hits with no walks. Afterward, Fernández 
told a teammate it was "the best game he ever pitched", Marlins infielder 
Martín Prado later recalled.[52] He finished 2016 with a MLB-leading 12.5 
strikeouts per nine innings, and a new Marlins' season record of 253 strikeouts, 
in 182 1⁄3 innings. He won 16 games, the best of his four-year career, 
while losing eight, with a 2.86 ERA. For his career he had a 38–17 win-loss 
record for a .691 winning percentage and a 2.58 ERA.[53] On November 10, 
2016, Fernandez was posthumously awarded MLB NL Comeback Player of the 
year. Fernández threw four pitches: a four-seam fastball that averaged 
94–97 miles per hour (151–156 km/h) and touched 101 miles per hour (163 km/h), 
a slurve at 80–86 miles per hour (129–138 km/h), a changeup at 85–88 miles 
per hour (137–142 km/h), and a sinker at 88–94 miles per hour (142–151 km/h).[54] 
Fernández considered his grandmother, Olga, the "love of his life".[55] 
After six years apart, Olga and José were reunited in Miami after the 2013 
baseball season.[56][57] On April 24, 2015, Fernández became a citizen 
of the United States.[58][59] Fernández announced that his girlfriend was 
pregnant with their first child on September 20, 2016.[60] Early on the 
morning of September 25, 2016, Fernández was killed in a boating accident 
off Miami Beach, Florida, that also killed two others.[61] The U.S. Coast 
Guard found the boat, Kaught Looking, at about 3:00 a.m., overturned on 
a jetty near Government Cut and South Pointe Park, and found three victims.[61][62] 
A Florida Wildlife Commission official confirmed that Fernández had not 
been driving the boat, and also that he had been killed from the impact 
of the crash.[63] The commission received a toxicology report from the 
medical examiner of Miami-Dade County, but opted not to release the results.[64] 
The Marlins canceled their game against the Atlanta Braves that day.[60] 
Teams around the major leagues honored Fernández after his death, paying 
tribute with a league-wide moment of silence and the display of his jersey.[65] 
The Miami Dolphins also observed a moment of silence before their Sunday 
game against the Cleveland Browns.[66] The next day, the Marlins announced 
that they would retire Fernández's uniform number, No. 16, in his honor, 
and all players wore his jersey for the final time for Monday's game, a 
7-3 win over the New York Mets.[67] The city of Miami and the Marlins held 
a public memorial and funeral procession for Fernández on September 28.[68] 
His ashes were scattered in the sea on October 2.[69] In a search warrant 
affidavit, Miami-Dade County authorities stated that a strong odor of alcohol 
was found on Fernández and the two other men in the boat. Also, it states 
that investigators allegedly found evidence that the boat's driver was 
speeding and driving with "recklessness" that was "exacerbated by the consumption 
of alcohol".[70][71] Additionally, cocaine and twice the legal limit of 
alcohol were found in Fernández's system at the time of his death.[72]
