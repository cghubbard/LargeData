Chuck Swirsky (born January 30, 1954) is an American radio sports announcer. 
He is the play-by-play voice of the Chicago Bulls of the National Basketball 
Association (NBA). Swirsky's association with Chicago sports started in 
1979 with his WCFL AM 1000 talk show which debuted on August 27 of that 
year. Outside of Chicago, Swirsky called play-by-play for both University 
of Michigan basketball and football and was formerly the play-by-play voice 
of the Toronto Raptors. Born in Norfolk, Virginia, Swirsky grew up in Bellevue, 
Washington and is a graduate of Interlake High School. Starting in 1979, 
Swirsky hosted a nightly sports radio show on WCFL (AM 1000) where he talked 
Chicago sports with callers. Swirsky then moved to WLUP (The Loop) where 
he provided afternoon sports updates and hosted a Sunday night sports radio 
show from 9-11 PM thru 1981. During this time Swirsky was named the Chicago 
Bulls public address announcer from 1980 to 1983. Swirsky next joined WGN 
radio in 1981 and remained through the mid-1990s. Swirsky hosted various 
sports talk shows and provided sports updates. While he was with WGN he 
also did play-by-play for DePaul games alongside former coach Ray Meyer 
and also did Chicago Bears pre-game and post-game coverage. He also made 
frequent appearances on the Bob Collins radio show discussing Chicago sports, 
with Collins dubbing him "The Swirsk" as a nickname. During his time at 
WGN, a man dressed as Max Headroom hijacked a broadcast of Doctor Who and 
made a mocking reference to Swirsky. Bruce Wolf frequently parodied Swirsky 
with a fictional character, "Chet Chitchat", which is a blended caricature 
of Chicago sportscasters Chet Coppock and Swirsky. During his time at WGN 
Radio, Swirsky filled in as a sports anchor on an occasional basis at WGN-TV. 
Swirsky left WGN for Detroit where he did play-by-play for both University 
of Michigan basketball and football in the mid-1990s. Rob Pelinka was among 
his Michigan color commentators.[1] Swirsky next moved to Toronto to become 
the play-by-play voice of the Toronto Raptors during the 1998–99 NBA season, 
first on the radio then for television beginning in 2001. On March 23, 
2007, Swirsky was honored by the Raptors when they gave out 18,000 bobbleheads 
with his likeness.[2] He was known for his famous "Salami & Cheese" phrase, 
which was used to advertise Raptors game packs during the 2007–08 season.[3][4] 
Another catch phrase was "Onions, Baby, Onions." This was said when a player 
makes a three-point shot, and was used to advertise Raptors NBA TV HD.[5] 
He became a Canadian citizen on January 14, 2008.[6] During the middle 
of his tenure in Toronto, Swirsky also hosted a sports radio show on CJCL 
(The Fan 590) called The Chuck Swirsky Show. Swirsky took listener calls 
and provided sports news with the show ending on July 31, 2008. On May 
6, 2008, Swirsky left the organization for personal reasons related to 
his family.[7] His vacated position was filled by Matt Devlin. He has since 
returned to Chicago to carry out the radio play-by-play for the Chicago 
Bulls[8] on its flagship station WMVP, which is the same station as Swirsky's 
first employer, WCFL. He has also called Chicago White Sox games in 2015 
on a fill-in basis as substitution for the current play by play broadcaster, 
Ken "The Hawk" Harrelson.[9] On September 7, 2016 Swirsky was inducted
