Samuel Edward Thomas McDowell (born September 21, 1942 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania), 
is a former professional baseball pitcher. He played fifteen seasons in 
Major League Baseball, with the first 11 coming for the Cleveland Indians 
before a 1971 trade to the San Francisco Giants, followed by stints with 
the New York Yankees and Pittsburgh Pirates. A six-time All-Star (1965, 
1966, 1968, 1969, 1970 and 1971), McDowell was primarily a starting pitcher 
during his major league career. Tall (6 feet, 5Â inches) and powerful, his 
left-handed fastball was delivered with an unusually calm pitching motion 
which led to his memorable nickname: Sudden Sam. His strikeout prowess 
was sometimes nullified by periodic control problems. Prior to the 1960 
season, McDowell signed with the Indians for a $75,000 bonus.[1] After 
spending 1960 with the Class-D Lakeland Indians, he was promoted to the 
Triple-A Salt Lake City Bees of the Pacific Coast League. He finished the 
year there with a record of 13-10 and a 4.42 earned run average. This was 
enough to earn him a promotion to the majors in September, and one week 
before his 19th birthday he made his MLB debut for the Indians. Starting 
against the Minnesota Twins, McDowell pitched 6.2 scoreless innings, giving 
up just three hits. However, in a harbinger of things to come, he also 
walked five batters before being relieved by Frank Funk. Funk gave up three 
runs in the 9th inning to lose the game, 3-2.[2] McDowell did not pitch 
again in 1961. McDowell started the next season in Salt Lake City, but 
was quickly called up in mid-April for a start against the New York Yankees. 
His second start was not as good as his first: although the Indians won 
9-3, McDowell did not make it out of the fifth inning, once again walking 
five batters and failing to qualify for a win.[3] McDowell remained with 
the Indians as a swingman until the end of May, when he was sent back to 
the minors with a 6.04 ERA and 24 walks in 25.1 innings. After posting 
a 2.02 ERA in 6 games, he was recalled in July. The results were similar, 
as he finished with an ERA of 6.06 and 70 walks (a rate of 7.2 BB/9), but 
also 70 strikeouts (also a rate of 7.2 K/9) in 87.2 innings. McDowell's 
1963 season represented something of an improvement over 1962. He started 
out well, pitching his first major league complete game on April 16 against 
the Washington Senators. McDowell gave up just two hits while striking 
out 13, but his control continued to be an issue as he also walked seven 
hitters.[4] Although he improved his ERA to 4.85 and his BB/9 to 6.1 while 
increasing his K/9 to 8.7, McDowell was sent down to the Indians top farm 
club (now the Jacksonville Suns) at the end of June and spent the rest 
of the season there. He also threw seven wild pitches, ninth-most in the 
league, despite only pitching 65 innings. In 1964, the Indians again switched 
farm teams, this time assigning McDowell to the Portland Beavers. McDowell 
started out the season on fire, winning all eight of his decisions in only 
nine starts, including a no-hitter, with an impressive ERA of 1.18. Perhaps 
more impressively for Sam, he struck out 102 batters while walking just 
24 in 76 innings. Once again, he was called up to the majors. It would 
be the last time McDowell would spend in the minor leagues. After winning 
a game in relief on May 31, McDowell pitched a complete game on June 2 
against the Chicago White Sox, beating the White Sox 3-2. In a sign that 
his control might be coming around, he walked just three in the game while 
striking out 14. He continued to show flashes of brilliance during the 
season, finishing with a record of 11-6 with an ERA of 2.70, seventh-best 
in the American League. He also led the league in K/9 with 9.2, striking 
out 177 in 173.1 innings. His strikeout total was good for eighth in the 
AL. His BB/9 also continued to improve, dropping to 5.2, although he still 
walked an even 100 hitters, the fourth-highest total in the league. If 
1964 was the year McDowell established himself as a major leaguer, 1965 
was the year he showed that he was among the elite pitchers in the league. 
He was selected to the All-Star team in 1965, the first of six such selections 
over his career. He pitched two innings in the 1965 All-Star Game and wound 
up taking the loss for the AL.[5] At the end of the year, "Sudden Sam" 
was at the top of several American League leader lists, including ERA (2.18), 
strikeouts (325), K/9 (10.7), Hits per nine innings (5.9) and home runs 
per nine innings (0.3). The strikeout total stands as the second-highest 
in franchise history to Bob Feller's 348 in 1946.[6] His 273 innings pitched 
were second only to the Yankees' Mel Stottlemyre. He also finished 17th 
in the voting for Most Valuable Player. His control was perhaps the only 
flaw on his excellent season, as he also led the league in most walks allowed 
with 132, even though his BB/9 rate continued to drop, to 4.4. The Indians 
were also improving, as they finished the season with their first winning 
record since 1959, with McDowell leading the way. Together with Sonny Siebert, 
Sam was the first American League starting pitcher duo to post K/9 rates 
over 9.[citation needed] The Indians pitching staff as a whole led the 
AL with 1156 strikeouts, leading the league for the first of what would 
be five straight seasons. McDowell slumped somewhat in 1966. Although he 
started hot, he missed several games due to arm problems during the year.[1] 
While he led the league in strikeouts for the second straight season, his 
total dropped to 225, as he managed just 194.1 innings. He posted a 2.87 
ERA but won only nine games against eight losses. Of those nine wins, five 
were shutouts, a total that also led the league. He also made his second 
All-Star team, although he did not appear in the game. In 1967, although 
he didn't miss any time, McDowell's numbers continued to decline. He won 
13 games while losing 15, and he led the league in walks allowed, earned 
runs allowed, and wild pitches while posting a below-average 3.85 ERA. 
He also failed to lead the league in K/9 for the first time since becoming 
a full-time major leaguer, finishing second to teammate Luis Tiant with 
a 9.0 rate. The team as a whole set a record striking out 1189 batters. 
One of his few personal highlights came not as a pitcher, but as a batter, 
as he hit his first major league home run on May 21 off Boston Red Sox 
pitcher Bucky Brandon.[1] In 1968, following the raising of the pitcher's 
mound, Major League Baseball went through what is often called the "Year 
of the Pitcher". Fittingly, it was also the year McDowell began to return 
to his pre-1966 form. He posted a career-best 1.81 ERA, second to Tiant, 
who posted a 1.60 mark. He also returned to his place atop the leader boards 
in strikeouts (283) and K/9 (9.5). While he led the league in walks allowed 
with 110, he posted his best BB/9 rate to date with a 3.7. The Indians 
also finished higher than 4th for the first time since 1959, finishing 
3rd with a record of 86-75. McDowell's own record was 15-14. In 1969, McDowell 
won 18 games, his best total thus far, while losing 14. He continued to 
lead the league in strikeouts (279) and K/9 (8.8). Although it was the 
first season McDowell had posted a strikeout rate of less than 9, he also 
posted a career-low BB/9 at 3.2, and for the first time did not lead the 
league in total walks allowed without missing time due to injuries or time 
in the minors, finishing sixth with 102. His 18 complete games were the 
third-most in the AL, and his four shutouts were fourth-most. He also was 
selected to the All-Star Game for the fourth time, striking out four batters 
in two innings, including Roberto Clemente.[7] On June 27, he notched his 
1,500th career strikeout.[1] In 1970, McDowell put together some impressive 
totals. For the first and only time in his career, he reached the 20-win 
mark, posting a record of 20-12. He also led the American League in innings 
pitched, topping the 300 mark (also for the first and only time) at 305. 
He reached the 300-strikeout mark as well for the first time since 1965 
at 304, just barely missing out on a K/9 rate of 9.0, although he led the 
league in both those categories again. He also threw a career-high 19 complete 
games, second in the league to Mike Cuellar, giving him 37 complete games 
in the last two seasons. All this, combined with a fifth-best 2.92 ERA, 
led to his selection as "AL Pitcher of the Year" by The Sporting News. 
However, there were still some warning signs, as McDowell's BB/9 jumped 
back up to 3.9, and he led the league in walks allowed with 131. He led 
the league in wild pitches again with 17, the first time he had done so 
since 1967. He also gave up a career-high 25 home runs. 1971 started on 
a rocky note for the newly minted Pitcher of the Year. He held out during 
spring training, hoping for a six-figure contract.[1] The contract he did 
sign was voided by Commissioner Bowie Kuhn because it contained illegal 
incentive clauses, and McDowell decided to leave the team again.[1] He 
eventually returned to the team, only to be suspended again later in the 
season.[1] Among all the turmoil, McDowell's performance suffered. His 
record slipped to 13-17, and his ERA jumped to 3.40. His K/9 was just 8.0, 
lowest since 1962, although it was still second in the league. However, 
his control problems returned full-force, as he walked a career-high 153 
batters in just 214.2 innings for a BB/9 of 6.4, also his worst since 1962. 
At the end of the season, McDowell demanded a trade, and Indians general 
manager Gabe Paul obliged.[1] On November 29, he was traded to the San 
Francisco Giants for pitcher Gaylord Perry and shortstop Frank Duffy. The 
trade turned out to be a disaster for the Giants. In 1972, McDowell had 
his worst season as a starting pitcher, posting his highest earned run 
average since 1963 at 4.33 while posting a 10-8 record. Although his control 
settled down a bit, as he posted a 4.7 BB/9 in 164.1 innings, he pitched 
just four complete games and failed to post a shutout for the first time 
since 1962, while his K/9 fell to 6.7, his worst to date. Meanwhile, Perry 
posted 24 wins with a 1.92 earned run average for Cleveland, winning his 
first Cy Young Award. McDowell was sent to the bullpen to start the 1973 
season. He had contemplated retirement during the offseason due to persistent 
back and neck pains, but he felt better after treatment and returned to 
the team.[1] He started just three games for the Giants in the first two 
months, appearing 15 times in relief. He had a 1-2 record for the Giants 
with three saves and a 4.50 ERA. On June 7 McDowell was sold by the Giants 
to the Yankees in a straight cash deal.[8] McDowell was moved back into 
the starting rotation for the Yankees, and his numbers improved somewhat. 
He started off hot, winning five of his first six starts, but failed to 
win another game after that. With the Yankees in 1973, he went 5-8 with 
a 3.95 ERA. In 1974, McDowell was again hampered by injuries. A slipped 
disc cost him two months of the season,[1] and even when he was available 
to pitch, he was used sparingly, appearing in only 13 games, seven of them 
starts. His results on the field continued to decline, as he posted career-worsts 
in K/9 (6.2) and BB/9 (7.7), winning just one game while losing six with 
a 4.69 ERA. On September 13, he left the team, and after the season asked 
for and was granted his release.[1] McDowell did not sign a contract until 
almost Opening Day in 1975, finally catching on with the Pittsburgh Pirates 
on April 2 after having to fight for a job during spring training.[1] He 
returned to the bullpen, and his numbers began to improve. In 14 games 
for the Pirates, he posted a 2.86 ERA, while his K/9 (7.5) and BB/9 (5.2) 
both improved over the past two seasons. However, it wasn't enough, as 
the Pirates released him on June 26. Following his "retirement", the drinking 
increased, finally to the point where it cost him his marriage. His wife 
left him, taking their two children with her, leaving him desolate and 
broke.[9] A failed business venture had left McDowell $190,000 in debt, 
and by early 1980 was living with his parents at his childhood home in 
Pittsburgh while selling insurance.[9] Eventually, McDowell checked himself 
into Gateway Rehab, a rehabilitation facility located outside of Pittsburgh.[10] 
After repaying his debts, he enrolled at the University of Pittsburgh, 
where he earned associate degrees in sports psychology and addiction. Eventually, 
McDowell returned to the major leagues as a sports addiction counselor 
with the Toronto Blue Jays and Texas Rangers.[9] McDowell earned a World 
Series ring while working with the 1993 Blue Jays. McDowell also works 
as a consultant with the Baseball Assistance Team (BAT) and the Major League 
Players Alumni Association (MLBPAA).[9] In 2001, McDowell remarried, and 
started a retirement community for former players. He became chairman and 
CEO at The City of Legends, a retirement resort in Clermont, Florida.[9] 
McDowell married a second time after meeting Eva, a Slovak tourist, when 
asking for directions in Florida.[10] The character of Sam Malone, the 
alcoholic ex-Red Sox pitcher portrayed by Emmy Award winning actor Ted 
Danson in the television program Cheers, was based on the baseball life 
of McDowell.[11] In a 2011 interview with the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, 
McDowell joked "I would say I'm better with women than [Sam Malone] was,"[10] 
McDowell finished with 2,453 career strikeouts and an average of 8.86 strikeouts 
per nine innings pitched, ranking him ninth all-time as of 2011.[12] At 
the time of his retirement, his strikeout rate was bested by only two pitchers: 
Nolan Ryan and Sandy Koufax. His ratio of 7.03 hits allowed per nine innings 
also places him ninth all-time as of 2011.[13] He ranks eighth all time 
on the list of career ten or more strikeout games with 74, tied with Bob 
Gibson.[14] His 2,159 strikeouts as an Indian place him second all time 
on the team's career list, behind Bob Feller.[6] In four All-Star appearances, 
McDowell struck out twelve NL All-Stars over eight innings, and was the
