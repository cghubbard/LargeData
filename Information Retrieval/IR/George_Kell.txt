George Clyde Kell (August 23, 1922 – March 24, 2009) was an American Major 
League Baseball third baseman who played fifteen seasons for the Philadelphia 
Athletics (1943–46), Detroit Tigers (1947–52), Boston Red Sox (1952–54), 
Chicago White Sox (1954–56), and Baltimore Orioles (1956–57). Kell went 
on to become a Detroit Tigers broadcaster for thirty-seven years. He was 
inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1983.[1] Kell was an 
All-Star for ten seasons. In 1949, he won the American League (AL) batting 
title hitting .343 with 59 runs batted in (RBI). In 1950, he hit .340 with 
101 RBI and led the AL in hits and doubles. In 1951, he hit .319 with 59 
RBI and led the AL in hits, singles, and doubles. He hit .300 or more for 
nine seasons. Kell also was hard to strike out; he struck out only 287 
times in 6,702 at-bats during his career. In college, Kell played for Arkansas 
State University, where the baseball facility, Tomlinson Stadium–Kell Field, 
is named after him.[2] A solid right-handed hitter and a sure-handed fielder, 
Kell was a 10-time All-Star, batted over .300 nine times and topped the 
league's third basemen in assists and total chances four times and in fielding 
percentage seven times. He won his only batting title in 1949 (.343), denying 
Ted Williams his third Triple Crown; until the final week of the season, 
Williams had led the batting race. On October 2, 1949, Kell went 2-for-3 
while Williams was hitless in two official at bats.[3] Kell's final mark 
was .3429, Williams's .3427. One year later, Kell batted .340, leading 
the league with 218 hits and 56 doubles, but lost the batting title to 
Williams' teammate, Red Sox second baseman Billy Goodman. Kell finished 
his career with the Baltimore Orioles (1956–57) where he helped another 
Arkansan and Hall of Famer Brooks Robinson take over the third base position 
for the team. In his final season he batted .297 in 345 at bats. In his 
career, Kell batted .306, with 78 home runs and 870 runs batted in, 881 
runs scored, 2054 hits, 385 doubles, 50 triples, 51 stolen bases, a .414 
slugging average, and 621 walks for a .367 on-base percentage. Kell was 
inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame by the Veterans Committee in 1983. 
A memorable quote from his induction speech at the Hall of Fame goes as 
follows, "I have always said that George Kell has taken more from this 
great game of baseball than he can ever give back. And now I know, I am 
deeper in debt than ever before."[3] Following his retirement as a player, 
Kell worked as a play-by-play announcer for CBS television (1958) and the 
Tigers (1959–1963, 1965–1996). Kell also helped call the 1959 National 
League tie-breaker series[4][5][6] for ABC television along with Bob DeLaney, 
the 1962 National League tie-breaker series for NBC television along with 
Bob Wolff,[7] the 1962 World Series for NBC Radio along with Joe Garagiola, 
and Games 3-5 of the 1968 World Series (for which the Tigers were the home 
team) for NBC television along with Curt Gowdy. Kell initially called Tigers 
games on both radio and television, splitting the play-by-play with Van 
Patrick in his first season and then with Ernie Harwell. Following the 
1963 season he briefly retired from broadcasting, citing a desire to spend 
more time at his Arkansas home; after a one-year absence, he was persuaded 
to return in 1965 working the (then-infrequent) TV games exclusively while 
Harwell did radio. Kell's television partners included Ray Lane, Larry 
Osterman, and (beginning in 1975) fellow Hall of Famer and former Tiger 
Al Kaline as color commentator, the latter pairing lasting for the remainder 
of Kell's broadcast career. Kell had a relaxed, easygoing "country-gentleman" 
style of announcing. In contrast to Harwell, who opened his radio broadcasts 
with "Hiya, Tiger fans!", Kell traditionally opened his broadcasts with 
"Good afternoon, everyone!" or "Good EVE-ning, everyone!" When paired with 
Larry Osterman on Tigers telecasts in the late 1960s and early '70s, the 
opening was often "Thank you, Larry, and good afternoon." Kell was also 
known for particular colloquialisms in his style, such as always referring 
to a high pitch near the batter's eyes as being "up in his wheelhouse", 
or a hard-hit home run being "tommyhawked" into the stands. A particularly 
good catch was exemplified by "Speared by (Aurelio) Rodríguez! Whale of 
a play!" His home run call was simple but delivered with rising pitch: 
"And a long drive...way back...could be... and it is. Whoa, he hit it a 
mile!" The game-ending out, whether it meant a Tiger win or loss, usually 
merited a decrescendo: "Fly ball to center field...this should be the ball 
game... it is." Kell also relayed stories of his Hall of Fame career in 
the same folksy style. A favorite story of his was about the incident when 
his jaw was broken by a line drive off the bat of Joe DiMaggio. "I got 
up, made the play at third, then passed out." In 2009, the Detroit Sports 
Broadcasters Association gave Kell its highest individual honor, an honorary 
lifetime membership. The association was founded in 1948 by pioneer Tigers 
announcer Ty Tyson. Kell served ten years on the Arkansas State Highway 
Commission (1973–83) and owned a car dealership, George Kell Motors, in 
Newport. Kell's brother, Everett "Skeeter" Kell, played the 1952 season 
for the Philadelphia Athletics.[8] Kell married his childhood sweetheart 
Charlene; they remained married for 50 years until her death from cancer 
in 1991. They had one daughter, Terrie Jane, and one son, George Kell Jr. 
Best-selling author Elmore Leonard in the 1990 anthology Cult Baseball 
Players wrote that Kell was his favorite player. When the novelist threw 
out the first pitch at a June 15, 1999 Tigers game, Leonard wore a No. 
21 jersey that was presented to him by the Tigers in an homage to Kell. 
Kell is survived by his second wife, Carolyn. Kell died at age 86 in his 
sleep in his hometown of Swifton, Arkansas on March 24, 2009.[3][9][10] 
Fox Sports Detroit (the Detroit Tigers' current local TV rights holder) 
honored Kell with re-airings of the special FSN Basement: All Star Edition 
2005 featuring interviews with George Kell and Al Kaline, each recalling 
their memories of playing for the Tigers and working together in the television
