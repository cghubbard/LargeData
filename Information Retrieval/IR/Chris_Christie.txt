Christopher James "Chris" Christie (born September 6, 1962) is an American 
politician and attorney. He is a member of the Republican Party and has 
been the 55th Governor of New Jersey since January 2010. His term ends 
January 16, 2018. Born in Newark, Christie volunteered for Thomas Kean's 
gubernatorial campaign at age 15. After graduating in 1984 from the University 
of Delaware, he earned a J.D. at Seton Hall. He practiced law 1987–2002. 
He was elected county freeholder for Morris County, serving 1995–1998. 
By 2002, he had campaigned for Presidents George H. W. Bush and George 
W. Bush; the latter appointed him U.S. Attorney for New Jersey, a position 
he held 2002–2008. Christie won the 2009 Republican primary for Governor 
of New Jersey, defeating the incumbent in the general election. He was 
re-elected in 2013. After the start of his second term as governor, Christie's 
standing was damaged by the Fort Lee lane closure scandal.[1][2][3][4][5] 
He was seen as a potential candidate in the 2012 presidential election, 
but did not run. He was shortlisted for nominee Mitt Romney's running mate, 
and keynoted the 2012 Republican National Convention.[6] Christie chaired 
the Republican Governors Association for the 2014 election cycle.[7] On 
June 30, 2015, he announced his candidacy for the Republican nomination 
in the 2016 presidential election. He suspended his candidacy on February 
10, 2016[8][9][10][11][12][13] and soon after endorsed Donald Trump, who 
named him head of his transition planning team.[14] Soon after the election 
Christie was replaced, and three of his close associates removed from the 
transition team.[15][16][17] Christie was born in Newark, New Jersey, to 
Sondra A. (née Grasso), a telephone receptionist, and Wilbur James "Bill" 
Christie, a certified public accountant.[18][19][20] His mother was of 
Sicilian ancestry, and father is of German, Scottish, and Irish descent.[21][22][23][24][25] 
Christie's family moved to Livingston, New Jersey, after the 1967 Newark 
riots,[26] and Christie lived there until he graduated from Livingston 
High School in 1980.[27] At Livingston High School, Christie served as 
class president and played catcher for the baseball team.[26] Christie's 
father and mother were Republican and Democratic, respectively. He has 
credited, however, his Democratic-leaning mother for indirectly making 
him a Republican by encouraging him in 1977 to volunteer for the gubernatorial 
candidate who became his role model: Tom Kean.[19] Christie had become 
interested in Kean after the politician, then a state legislator, spoke 
to Christie's junior high school class.[26] Christie graduated from the 
University of Delaware with a Bachelor of Arts in political science in 
1984 and Seton Hall University School of Law with a J.D. in 1987. He was 
admitted to the New Jersey State Bar Association and the Bar of the United 
States District Court, District of New Jersey, in December 1987. Later 
in life, he was awarded honorary doctorate degrees by Rutgers University 
and Monmouth University.[28][29] In 1986, Christie married Mary Pat Foster, 
a fellow student at the University of Delaware. After marrying, they shared 
a studio apartment in Summit, New Jersey.[30] Mary Pat Christie pursued 
a career in investment banking and eventually worked at the Wall Street 
firm Cantor Fitzgerald; she left the firm in 2001 following the September 
11 attacks.[19] Through April 2015 she was a managing director at the Wall 
Street investment firm Angelo, Gordon & Co.[31] Christie and Mary Pat have 
four children: two boys, Andrew (b. 1993) and Patrick (b. 2000), and two 
girls, Sarah (b. 1996) and Bridget (b. 2003).[32] The family resides in 
Mendham Township.[33][34] Christie's hobbies have included coaching Little 
League, cheering for the New York Mets, and attending Bruce Springsteen 
concerts (141 of them).[35][36] Christie's other favorite sports teams 
are the New York Knicks, New York Rangers, and Dallas Cowboys.[37] In 1987, 
Christie joined the law firm of Dughi, Hewit & Palatucci of Cranford, New 
Jersey.[38] In 1993, he was named a partner in the firm.[38] Christie specialized 
in securities law, appellate practice, election law, and government affairs. 
He is a member of the American Bar Association and the New Jersey State 
Bar Association and was a member of the Election Law Committee of the New 
Jersey State Bar Association. From 1999 to 2001, Christie was registered 
statehouse lobbyist for Dughi and Hewit.[39] Christie volunteered for President 
George H. W. Bush's 1992 re-election campaign in New Jersey, and became 
close to Bush's state director, Bill Palatucci. Following the campaign, 
Christie decided to run for office, and moved to Mendham Township. In 1993, 
Christie launched a primary challenge against the New Jersey Senate Majority 
Leader, John H. Dorsey. However, Christie's campaign ended after Dorsey 
successfully challenged the validity of Christie's petition to appear on 
the ballot.[26] In 1994, Christie was elected as a Republican to the Board 
of Chosen Freeholders for Morris County, New Jersey, after he and a running 
mate defeated incumbent freeholders in the party primary. Following the 
election, the defeated incumbents filed a defamation lawsuit against Christie 
based on statements made during the primary campaign.[40] Christie had 
incorrectly stated that the incumbents were under "investigation" for violating 
certain local laws. The lawsuit was settled out of court, with Christie 
acknowledging that the prosecutor had actually convened an "inquiry" instead 
of an "investigation", and apologizing for the error, which he said was 
unintentional.[41][42] As freeholder, Christie required the county government 
to obtain three quotes from qualified firms for all contracts. He led a 
successful effort to bar county officials from accepting gifts from people 
and firms doing business with the county. He voted to raise the county's 
open space tax for land preservation; however, county taxes on the whole 
were decreased by 6.6% during his tenure. He successfully pushed for the 
dismissal of an architect hired to design a new jail, saying that the architect 
was costing taxpayers too much money. The architect then sued Christie 
for defamation over remarks he made about the dismissal, eventually dropping 
the suit without explanation.[43][44] In 1995, Christie announced a bid 
for a seat in the New Jersey General Assembly; he and attorney Rick Merkt 
ran as a ticket against incumbent Assemblyman Anthony Bucco and attorney 
Michael Patrick Carroll in the Republican primary. Christie ran as a pro-choice 
candidate and supporter of the ban on assault weapons.[45] Bucco and Carroll, 
the establishment candidates, defeated the up-and-comers by a wide margin. 
After this loss, Christie's bid for re-nomination to the freeholder board 
was unlikely, as unhappy Republicans recruited John J. Murphy to run against 
Christie in 1997. Murphy defeated Christie in the primary.[46] Murphy, 
who had falsely accused Christie of having the county pay his legal bills 
in the architect's lawsuit, was sued by Christie after the election. They 
settled out of court with the Freeholders admitting wrongdoing and apologizing.[47] 
Christie's career in Morris County politics was over by 1998.[46] When 
Christie's part-time position as a Chosen Freeholder lapsed, he returned 
full attention to his law firm Dughi, Hewit & Palatucci. Alongside fellow 
partner and later, gubernatorial campaign fundraiser Bill Palatucci, Christie's 
firm opened an office in the state capital, Trenton, devoted mainly to 
lobbying.[48][49][50] Between 1999 and 2001, Christie and Palatucci lobbied 
on behalf of, among others, GPU Energy for deregulation of New Jersey's 
electric and gas industry;[49] the Securities Industry Association to block 
the inclusion of securities fraud under the state's Consumer Fraud Act; 
Hackensack University Medical Center for state grants; and the University 
of Phoenix for a New Jersey higher education license.[51] During the 2000 
presidential election, Christie served as George W. Bush's campaign lawyer 
for the state of New Jersey.[26] On December 7, 2001, President George 
W. Bush appointed Christie the U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey.[52] 
Some members of the New Jersey Bar professed disappointment at Christie's 
lack of experience. At the time, he had never practiced in a federal courtroom 
before, and had little experience in criminal law. Christie received the 
overwhelming support of the Republican Party in New Jersey. A spokesperson 
for Acting Governor Donald DiFrancesco, who selected nominees for the position, 
said that he received hundreds of letters of support for Christie "from 
everyone from the Assembly speaker down to the county level, close to every 
member of the Legislature and every county chairman." Christie was also 
a top fundraiser for Bush's 2000 presidential campaign. He helped raise 
$350,000 for Bush, qualifying him as a "Pioneer", and also donated to DiFrancesco.[53][54] 
Democrats seized upon the role played by Bush's political adviser, Karl 
Rove, after Christie's law partner, William Palatucci, a Republican political 
consultant and Bush supporter, boasted that he had selected a United States 
attorney by forwarding Christie's résumé to Rove.[55] According to New 
Jersey's senior Senator, Bob Torricelli, Christie promised to appoint a 
"professional" with federal courtroom experience as deputy if confirmed. 
By Senate tradition, if a state's senior Senator opposes the nomination 
of a U.S. Attorney, the nomination is effectively dead, but Christie's 
promise was enough for Torricelli to give the nomination his blessing.[54] 
He was unanimously confirmed by the United States Senate on December 20, 
2001, and sworn into office on January 17, 2002. The brother of Christie's 
uncle (his aunt's second husband), Tino Fiumara, was an organized crime 
figure; according to Christie, the FBI presumably knew that when they conducted 
his background check.[56] Later, Christie recused himself from the case 
and commented about what he had learned growing up with such a relative: 
"It just told me that you make bad decisions in life and you wind up paying 
a price."[56] Christie served as the Chief Federal Law Enforcement Officer 
in New Jersey from January 17, 2002, to December 1, 2008. His office included 
137 attorneys, with offices in Newark, Trenton, and Camden. Christie also 
served on the 17-member Advisory Committee of U.S. Attorneys for Attorneys 
General John Ashcroft and Alberto Gonzales. Soon after taking office, Christie 
let it be known that his office would make public corruption a high priority, 
second only to terrorism.[54] During his six-year tenure, he received praise 
for his record of convictions in public corruption cases. His office convicted 
or won guilty pleas from 130 public officials, both Republican and Democratic, 
at the state, county and local levels.[57] The most notable of these convictions 
included those of Democratic Hudson County Executive Robert C. Janiszewski 
in 2002 on bribery charges,[58] Republican Essex County Executive James 
W. Treffinger in 2003 on corruption charges,[59] former Democratic New 
Jersey Senate President John A. Lynch, Jr., in 2006 on charges of mail 
fraud and tax evasion,[60] State Senator and former Newark Democratic mayor 
Sharpe James in 2008 on fraud charges,[61] and Democratic State Senator 
Wayne R. Bryant in 2008 on charges of bribery, mail fraud, and wire fraud.[62] 
According to Rachel Barkow and Anthony Barkow, both of NYU Law School, 
Christie negotiated seven deal deferred prosecution agreements (DPAs) during 
his tenure, some of which were controversial.[63] Under agreements like 
these, corporations avoid prosecution if they promise not just to obey 
the law or pay for bad acts, but also promise to change personnel, or revamp 
business practices, or adopt new types of corporate governance. They are 
typically used in lieu of prosecution when there is evidence of particularly 
egregious corporate misconduct. Since 2002, these types of agreements have 
been sharply on the rise among federal prosecutors, with 23 between 2002 
and 2005, and 66 between 2006 and 2008.[63] Outside monitors are appointed 
in about half of all DPAs, to make sure that the corporations comply.[63] 
In one case, Christie recommended appointment of The Ashcroft Group, a 
consulting firm owned by his former boss John Ashcroft, as an outside monitor 
of Zimmer Holdings—a contract worth as much as $52 million from Zimmer, 
which was an amount in line with fee structures at that time.[64][65] In 
another instance, Christie's office deferred criminal prosecution of pharmaceutical 
company Bristol Myers in a deal that required the company to dedicate $5 million 
for a business ethics chair at Seton Hall University School of Law, Christie's 
alma mater.[66][67] Christie defended the appointment of Ashcroft as someone 
with the necessary prominence and legal acumen,[68] and he defended the 
Seton Hall donation as happenstance given that there was already a business 
ethics endowed chair at the only other law school in the state.[69] Still, 
cases like these led to new rules within the Justice Department,[64][70] 
and sparked a congressional hearing on the subject.[63][71][72] Besides 
doubling the size of the anticorruption unit for New Jersey,[73] Christie 
also prosecuted other federal crimes. For example, he obtained convictions 
of brothel owners who kept Mexican teenagers in slavery as prostitutes, 
convicted 42 gang members of the Double II Set of various crimes including 
more than 25 murders, and convicted British trader Hemant Lakhani of trying 
to sell missiles.[74] Despite claims of entrapment,[75] Lakhani was convicted 
by jury in April 2005 of attempting to provide material support to terrorists, 
unlawful brokering of foreign defense articles, and attempting to import 
merchandise into the U.S. by means of false statements, plus two counts 
of money laundering. He was sentenced to 47 years in prison.[76] In 2007, 
Christie prosecuted the planners of the averted 2007 Fort Dix attack plot, 
which he has frequently mentioned as a career highlight.[77] During the 
second term of George W. Bush, a controversy arose about the administration's 
dismissal of several U.S. attorneys, allegedly for political reasons. When 
it was revealed that Christie had been on a preliminary version of the 
hit list, New York Senator Charles Schumer said: "I was shocked when I 
saw Chris Christie's name on the list last night. It just shows a [Justice] 
department that has run amok."[78] Pat Meehan, the U.S. attorney in Philadelphia, 
said: "Among his peers, Chris stands out as one of the most admired. If 
you were to create a list of the U.S. attorneys who have had the greatest 
impact, Chris would be one of the top two or three names I'd put on it. 
This defies explanation."[78] Christie's opponents claimed that he had 
gotten off the Bush administration's hit list by going after Congressman 
Robert Menendez; for example, New York Times columnist Paul Krugman wrote, 
"Menendez's claims of persecution now seem quite plausible."[78] Christie 
had issued a subpoena regarding Menendez 65 days before the 2006 Senate 
election, in which Menendez defeated Republican Thomas Kean, Jr. to become 
New Jersey's junior Senator.[26][79] Christie's biographers (journalists 
Michael Symons and Bob Ingle) concluded that, "The timing of the Menendez-related 
subpoena doesn't line up right to support the critics' theory."[78] Christie's 
aides have said that the subpoena was prompted by a newspaper report about 
Menendez,[80] which prosecutors feared might imminently lead to destruction 
of documents and other evidence. The investigation of Menendez continued 
for years after Christie left office as U.S. Attorney, until Menendez was 
finally cleared on October 5, 2011.[78] Christie filed as a candidate for 
the office of governor on January 8, 2009.[81] Former Governor Thomas Kean 
helped Christie campaign and raise money.[26] In the primary on June 2, 
Christie won the Republican nomination with 55% of the vote, defeating 
opponents Steve Lonegan and Rick Merkt.[82] He then chose Kimberly Guadagno, 
Monmouth County sheriff, to complete his campaign ticket as a candidate 
for lieutenant governor. On November 3, Christie defeated Jon Corzine by 
a margin of 49% to 45%, with 6% of the vote going to independent candidate 
Chris Daggett.[83] Christie took office as Governor of New Jersey on January 
19, 2010.[84] He chose not to move his family into Drumthwacket, the governor's 
official mansion, and instead resides in a private Mendham Township, New 
Jersey, residence.[85] Christie has promised not to raise taxes. He has 
also vowed to lower the state income and business taxes, with the qualification 
that this might not occur immediately: "I'm not saying I'm cutting taxes 
in the first year. The first thing we have to do is get our fiscal house 
in order, and that's going to be tough."[86] During his term as governor, 
Christie delivered balanced budgets annually for the state as required 
by the New Jersey Constitution. He claims to have done so without increasing 
taxes, though this has been debated as he has made reductions to tax credits 
such as the earned income tax credit and property tax relief programs.[87][88] 
Under Christie, there have so far been no rate increases in the state's 
top three revenue generators: income tax, sales tax, and corporate business 
tax.[88] Christie originally proposed a 10 percent income tax cut for all 
residents of the State, but he later targeted his proposal for people earning 
less than $400,000 per year, and it would be in the form of an income tax 
credit equal to 10 percent of their property taxes, capped at $10,000 (phased 
in over four years).[89] The Democratic-controlled state legislature has 
refused to implement it to date, taking the view that there would never 
be enough money to fund a tax cut.[89] On February 11, 2010, Christie signed 
Executive Order No. 14, which declared that a "state of fiscal emergency 
exists in the State of New Jersey" due to the projected $2.2 billion budget 
deficit for the current fiscal year (FY 2010).[90] In a speech before a 
special joint session of the New Jersey Legislature on the same day, Christie 
addressed the budget deficit and proposed various fiscal measures to close 
the gap. Christie also suspended funding for the Department of the Public 
Advocate and called for its elimination.[91] Some Democrats criticized 
Christie for not first consulting them on his budget cuts and for circumventing 
the Legislature's role in the budget process.[92] In late June 2011, Christie 
utilized New Jersey's line item veto to eliminate nearly $1 billion from 
the proposed budget, signing it into law just hours prior to the July 1, 
2011, beginning of the state's fiscal year.[93] In 2010, Christie signed 
legislation to limit annual property tax growth to 2 percent.[94] During 
his second year in office, Christie signed into law a payroll tax cut reducing 
funding of the Temporary Disability Insurance (TDI) fund by $190 million 
per year. Effective calendar year 2012, the tax cut authorizes the New 
Jersey Department of Labor and Workforce Development to reduce payroll 
deduction for most employees from $148 to $61 per year. According to Labor 
Commissioner Harold J. Wirths, New Jersey workers had been paying much 
more into the disability fund than what is needed to keep it solvent. The 
changes took effect on January 1, 2012.[95] Under Christie's governorship, 
New Jersey's credit rating has been downgraded nine times (across Standard 
& Poor, Fitch Ratings, and Moody's Investors Service), leaving only Illinois 
with a lower rating among US states.[96][97] As Governor of New Jersey, 
Christie has received grades of B in 2012[98][99] and B in 2014[100][101] 
from the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, in their biennial Fiscal 
Policy Report Card on America's governors. On September 18, 2013, Christie 
signed legislation to overhaul the state's business tax incentive programs. 
The legislation reduces the number of tax incentive programs from five 
to two, raises the caps on tax credits, and allows smaller companies to 
qualify. It increases the credits available for businesses in South Jersey.[102] 
In March 2010, Christie signed into law three state pension reform bills, 
which had passed with bipartisan support. The laws decreased pension benefits 
for future hires and required public employees to contribute 1.5 percent 
of their salaries toward their health care. The laws prompted a lawsuit 
by the police and firefighters' unions.[103] In his campaign for governor, 
Christie opposed any change in pension benefits for firefighters and law 
enforcement officers, including "current officers, future officers or retirees". 
He described the pension agreement as "a sacred trust".[104] Later that 
year, he called for further cuts, including the elimination of cost-of-living 
adjustments for all current and future retirees.[105] In June 2011, Christie 
announced a deal with the Democratic leadership of the legislature on a 
reform of public employee pensions and benefits. The deal raised public 
employees' pension contributions, mandated the state to make annual payments 
into the system, increased public employee contributions toward health 
insurance premiums, and ended collective bargaining for health benefits. 
The reform is projected to save the state $120 billion over 30 years.[106] 
In June 2013, Christie signed a $33 billion state budget that makes a record 
$1.7 billion payment to the state's pension fund and also increases school 
funding by almost $100 million. The budget resulted from negotiations between 
Christie and Democratic leaders in the state legislature and was the first 
that Christie has signed as passed, without vetoing any of its provisions.[107] 
In May 2014, Christie cut the contributions to New Jersey public workers' 
pension funds for a 14-month period by nearly $2.5 billion to deal with 
a revenue shortfall in the state budget of $2.75 billion.[108] The state 
will instead make a $1.3 billion payment during the period. Christie cited 
the state constitution's requirement to have a balanced budget for his 
decision to cut payments to pensions for state workers, and follows Christie's 
changes to the state’s pension formula earlier in 2014 to save $900 million 
through the end of his term.[109] Christie, whose own children attend Catholic 
parochial school, is a strong supporter of the state granting tax credits 
to parents who send their children to private and parochial schools.[110] 
He also supports the introduction of state-funded vouchers, which parents 
of students in failing school districts could use to pay the tuition of 
private schools, or of public schools in communities other than their own 
which agree to accept them.[111] Christie supports merit pay for teachers.[112] 
On August 25, 2010, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services announced 
$400 million in federal Race to the Top education grants to New Jersey 
would not be funded due to a clerical error in the state's application 
made by an unidentified mid-level state official. Christie responded by 
saying that the Obama administration bureaucracy had overstepped its authority 
and that the error lay in an administration failure to communicate with 
the New Jersey government.[113] However, information later came to light 
that the issue had already been raised with Christie's Education Commissioner 
Bret Schundler, and in response Christie had asked for Schundler's resignation; 
Schundler initially agreed to resign, but the following morning asked to 
be fired instead, citing his need to claim unemployment benefits. Schundler 
maintained that he told Christie the truth and that Christie was misstating 
what actually occurred.[114] In January 2011, the Christie administration 
approved 23 new charter schools, including the state's first independent 
school for children with autism. The approvals increased the number of 
charter schools in the state to 96.[115] On August 6, 2012, Christie signed 
a law reforming the tenure system for New Jersey public school teachers. 
Under the new law, teachers will be required to work four years, instead 
of three, in order to earn tenure. Additionally, teachers will need to 
earn positive ratings two years in a row before tenure can be awarded. 
Tenured teachers with poor ratings for two consecutive years will be eligible 
for dismissal. Finally the law limits the hearing process for appeals related 
to dismissal of tenured teachers to 105 days.[116] On March 6, 2013, the 
Christie administration released proposed regulations to overhaul the process 
of evaluating public school teachers in New Jersey. Under the proposal, 
a percentage of teachers' evaluations would be based on student growth 
on state tests or based on student achievement goals set with principals.[117] 
In September 2014, Christie signed a partnership with Mexico on a higher 
education project to foster economic cooperation. The program will focus 
on research ventures, cross-border fellowships, student and teacher exchanges 
and conferences—among other educational opportunities.[118] Christie has 
stated that he believes that the New Jersey Department of Environmental 
Protection is too big and is "killing business" with permit delays and 
indiscriminate fines. He announced that, if elected, the agency would be 
his first target for government reduction: he would reduce its workforce 
and strip it of its fish and wildlife oversight.[119] Christie has stated 
that he intends to simultaneously spur growth in the state's manufacturing 
sector and increase New Jersey's capability to produce alternative energy. 
He has proposed a list of policy measures to achieve this, including giving 
tax credits to businesses that build new wind energy and manufacturing 
facilities, changing land use rules to allow solar energy on permanently 
preserved farmland, installing solar farms on closed landfills, setting 
up a consolidated energy promotion program, and following a five-to-one 
production to non-production job ratio in the creation of new energy jobs.[120] 
In August 2010, legislation to encourage the development of wind power 
in New Jersey was signed by Christie at the Port of Paulsboro The Offshore 
Wind Economic Development Act authorized New Jersey Economic Development 
Authority to provide up to $100 million in tax credits for wind energy 
facilities.[121] The governor has pledged to ban coal-fired power plants, 
and to reach 22.5% renewable generation in the state by 2021.[122] On May 
26, 2011, Christie announced he would pull the state out of Regional Greenhouse 
Gas Initiative.[123] This was challenged in court which ruled in March 
2014 that Christie had acted illegally in doing so since state regulations 
do not permit it.[124] His administration is seeking to repeal the rules.[125] 
Christie has rejected permanent bans on hydraulic fracturing (fracking) 
in New Jersey and vetoed measures that would ban the process and disposal 
of hydraulic fracturing waste in the State. New Jersey has few proven shale 
reserves and the process is not practiced there. Christie argued that the 
vetoed Senate Bill (S253) was premature because of an ongoing study to 
be completed in 2014 and would discriminate against other states, a violation 
of the Dormant Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution.[126] Supporters 
of legislation have said that hydraulic fracturing waste from Pennsylvania 
makes its way into New Jersey for treatment, although how much is not clear. 
They also criticized Christie's legal analysis saying that the Office of 
Legislative Services have said that the bill is constitutional.[126] Christie's 
settled a lawsuit with Exxon Mobil by allowing the corporation to pay $225 
million in damages for environmental contamination at two sites, less than 
3% of the $8.9 billion that the state's lawyers had sought, and extended 
the compensation to cover other damages not named in the original lawsuit.[127] 
Jeff Tittel of the Sierra Club called this move "a violation of the public 
trust."[127] The New Jersey State Senate also condemned the deal.[128] 
The previous gubernatorial administration, that of Democrat Jon Corzine, 
had also attempted to settle with Exxon, for $550 million, though this 
offer was made before a 2009 ruling that strengthened the state's bargaining 
position.[129] By tradition since the 1947 state constitution, the seven 
member New Jersey Supreme Court maintains a political balance and is composed 
of four members of either the Democratic Party or Republican Party and 
three of the other.[130] Christie broke with the tradition in May 2010 
when he chose not to renominate Justice John E. Wallace, Jr.[131] Christie 
had said the court "had inappropriately encroached on both the executive 
and legislative function, and that if elected governor, I would take steps 
through the decisions I made regarding the court to bring back an appropriate 
constitutional balance to the court."[132] Since taking office, Christie 
has been in a major conflict with the New Jersey Legislature over the court's 
partisan balance.[133][134] The stand-off between the governor and the 
New Jersey Senate has resulted in longstanding vacancies, with temporarily 
assigned appellate judges filling in.[135][136] In January 2013, Christie 
vetoed a New Jersey Legislature bill that would have raised the minimum 
wage from $7.25 to $8.50 per hour.[137][138] The following November, the 
issue was placed on the ballot as a constitutional amendment referendum, 
passing with 61% of the vote.[139][140] On September 21, 2012, Christie 
signed Assembly Bill No. 2647 (A-2647) into law that requires employers 
to post and distribute notice of employees' rights to gender-equal pay, 
but conditionally vetoed other gender parity bills, requesting revision.[141] 
In June 2013, Christie vetoed S1921, an animal welfare bill introduced 
by the Humane Society of the United States to prohibit the use of gestation 
crates on pregnant pigs in the state. The bill had passed in the General 
Assembly with a vote of 60–5 and the Senate 29–4.[142][143][144] A 2013 
survey by Mason-Dixon Polling & Research Inc. showed 91% of New Jersey 
voters supported the legislation.[145] An attempt to override the veto 
did not come to a vote.[146] In October 2014 a similar bill banning gestation 
crates, S998, was proposed with a vote in the Senate of 32–1 and in the 
Assembly of 53–13 (with 9 abstentions)[147][148] While campaigning in Iowa 
in November, in a conversation with the former president of the Iowa Pork 
Producers Association, Christie indicated he would veto the bill.[149] 
He did so on November 27, 2014.[150] The bill's sponsor, Senator Raymond 
Lesniak, has vowed to override it.[151] Christie emphasizes the need to 
secure the border, and believes it is premature to discuss legalization 
of people who came to the United States unlawfully.[152] While serving 
as U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey, Christie stressed that 
simply "[b]eing in this country without proper documentation is not a crime," 
but rather a civil wrong; and that undocumented people are not criminals 
unless they have re-entered the country after being deported. As such, 
Christie stated, responsibility for dealing with improperly documented 
foreign nationals lies with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, not 
the U.S. Attorney's Office.[153] Christie has been critical about section 
287(g) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, enacted in 1996, which can 
be used to grant local law enforcement officers power to perform immigration 
law enforcement functions.[154] In December 2013 Christie signed legislation 
allowing unauthorized immigrants who attend high school for at least three 
years in New Jersey and graduate to be eligible for the resident rates 
at state college and universities and community colleges.[155] Christie 
indicated in 2009 that he would veto any bill legalizing same-sex marriage 
in the state,[86] saying, "I also believe marriage should be exclusively 
between one man and one woman... If a bill legalizing same sex marriage 
came to my desk as Governor, I would veto it."[156] On February 13, 2012, 
the State Senate passed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage by a vote of 
24 to 16, and on February 16, the Assembly passed it by a vote of 42 to 
33, with three Republicans and one Democrat not voting, and one seat temporarily 
vacant. In neither house was the bill passed by a veto-proof majority. 
Governor Christie vetoed the bill the next day and called for a constitutional 
amendment for same-sex marriage to be presented to the voters as a ballot 
referendum.[157] He also called for creation of an ombudsman to ensure 
compliance with the state's existing civil union law.[158] Christie's veto 
was overturned in a court decision in the Garden State Equality v. Dow 
case, in which the judge stated New Jersey was "... violating the mandate 
of Lewis and the New Jersey Constitution's equal protection guarantee". 
Following the decision, the Christie administration immediately asked the 
state Supreme Court to grant a stay of the decision pending appeal, which 
was denied on October 18, 2013 in a 7–0 decision of the court which stated 
that it could "find no public interest in depriving a group of New Jersey 
residents of their constitutional right to equal protection while the appeals 
process unfolds".[159] Three days later Christie withdrew the state's appeal.[160][161] 
Christie believes that homosexuality is innate, having said, “If someone 
is born that way, it’s very difficult to say then that that’s a sin.”[162] 
On August 19, 2013, Christie signed a bill outlawing gay conversion therapy 
for children, making New Jersey the second state to institute such a law.[163] 
The law was challenged in the courts,[164] with Christie, in his official 
capacity as governor, named an appellee.[165] In September 2014, a panel 
of the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the law, saying it did 
not violate free speech or religious rights.[166] In his early political 
career, Christie was pro-choice, stating in an interview that "I would 
call myself … a kind of a non-thinking pro-choice person, kind of the default 
position".[167] Later on Christie evolved his position to be against abortion: 
"I am pro-life. Hearing the strong heartbeat of my unborn daughter 14 years 
ago at 13 weeks gestation had a profound effect on me and my beliefs."[156] 
He has stated, with respect to his opposition to abortion, that he would 
not use the governor's office to "force that down people's throats", but 
does favor restrictions on abortion such as banning "partial-birth abortion", 
requiring parental notification, and imposing a 24-hour waiting period.[86] 
In 2014, campaigning in Alabama for incumbent governor Robert Bentley, 
Christie stated that he was the first "pro-life governor" elected in New 
Jersey since Roe v. Wade in 1973.[168] He also stated that he had vetoed 
funding for Planned Parenthood five times as governor.[168] In March 2015, 
Christie joined other potential 2016 Republican presidential candidates 
in endorsing a ban on abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy.[169] On August 
4, 2015, Christie stated that he has used birth control other than the 
rhythm method.[170][171][172][173] This discussion was made during a town 
hall meeting when Christie was talking about his Catholic faith. The "New 
Jersey Compassionate Use Medical Marijuana Act" was enacted in January 
2010.[174][175] As of 2013[update] New Jersey is one of 20 states where 
medical marijuana is available. In August 2013 Christie signed a bill to 
ease restrictions for children in the program.[176] Christie is opposed 
to legalization of recreational marijuana use.[177] He believes marijuana 
to be a gateway drug and that taxes from its sale are "blood money".[178] 
Christie said he would "crack down" on states that have ended the prohibition 
of cannabis if he were president.[179] Christie responded to calls by President 
Obama to prevent the spread of measles by saying that parents should have 
a choice.[180] The governor's office said that he "believes vaccines are 
an important public health protection and with a disease like measles there 
is no question kids should be vaccinated",[181] but that he was unaware 
of a free national program to provide new parents with a vaccine checklist.[182] 
On December 20, 2010, Christie signed a letter ordering the release of 
Brian Aitken, who had been sentenced to seven years for transporting three 
guns within the state.[183] Christie has said that each state has the right 
to determine firearms laws and that the federal government should not interfere 
in the making of guns laws for New Jersey.[184] When announcing his candidacy 
in 2009 he said he supported strict and aggressive enforcement of the state's 
current gun laws.[86] In 2013 he chose not to defend a legal challenge 
to the state's most stringent gun law which requires individuals to prove 
an urgent threat of violence before getting permits to carry handguns.[185][186] 
On July 2, 2014, Christie vetoed legislation that would have reduced the 
allowed legal size of ammunition magazines. Instead he re-wrote it, proposing 
a new standard for involuntary commitment of people who are not necessarily 
deemed dangerous “but whose mental illness, if untreated, could deteriorate 
to the point of harm” as well as other forms of involuntary mental health 
treatments.[187] Christie had previously vetoed proposed legislation that 
would bar the state pension fund from investing in companies that manufacture 
or sell assault firearms for civilian use and a bill to prohibit the sale 
of .50-caliber rifles to civilians.[188] In July 2015, Christie vetoed 
a bill passed the Assembly by a 74–0 (six abstentions) and the Senate by 
a 38–0 (2 abstentions) which would required anyone seeking to have their 
mental health records expunged to purchase a firearm to notify the State 
Police, their county prosecutor and their local police department when 
petitioning the court.[189] In October 2015, the New Jersey Senate voted 
to override Christie's veto.[190] Christie has raised tolls and fares, 
which he calls “user fees” on the New Jersey Turnpike, Garden State Parkway, 
Hudson River crossings and NJ Transit buses and trains during his administration 
to fund projects throughout the state.[191] In 2014, Christie authorized 
the increase of numerous other fees charged by the state for various licensing 
and administrative fees.[192][193] In 2010, Christie cancelled the Access 
to the Region's Core project, which would have constructed two new tunnels 
under the Hudson River and a new terminal station in New York City for 
NJ Transit commuter trains.[194] He cited possible cost overruns as the 
reason for his decision.[195] Proponents of the project said it would have 
created 6,000 construction jobs per year and 45,000 secondary jobs once 
complete.[196] After the cancellation, New Jersey had to return $95 million 
to the federal government, and used $1.8 billion of Port Authority of New 
York and New Jersey money from the project budget to pay for repairs to 
the Pulaski Skyway, since the New Jersey Transportation Trust Fund that 
should fund such maintenance is effectively bankrupt.[197] The termination 
of the project has made the need for increased rail capacity under the 
Hudson River more urgent, and Amtrak's Gateway Project to bore new tunnels 
is currently unfunded.[198] On December 28, 2012, the U.S. Senate approved 
an emergency relief bill to provide $60 billion for states affected by 
Hurricane Sandy.[199] The House did not vote until the next session on 
January 3. On January 2, Christie criticized the delay as "selfishness 
and duplicity", and blamed the House Republican leadership.[200] A bill 
for relief was passed in the House on January 15.[201] Starting in 2014, 
the U.S. Department of Justice started an investigation of Christie for 
making state grants of Hurricane Sandy relief funds to New Jersey cities 
conditional on support for other projects.[202][203][204] Continuing the 
tradition of earlier New Jersey governors since the 1980s, Christie traveled 
to Israel in April 2012.[205][206][207] During the visit, which included 
meetings with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and President Shimon Peres, 
Christie commented that "Jerusalem has never been better or freer than 
under Israeli control."[208][209] Christie subsequently called a helicopter 
tour of the West Bank "eye-opening", and cautioned against Israeli withdrawal 
from the West Bank, Jerusalem or the Golan Heights.[210] The official title 
given to the trip was "Jersey to Jerusalem Trade Mission: Economic Growth, 
Diplomacy, Observance".[211] The visit to Israel was Christie's first official 
overseas trip since taking office.[212] From Israel, Christie continued 
with his family to Jordan, as guests of King Abdullah II.[213] On November 
26, 2012, Christie filed papers to run for a second term in office, which 
would begin in January 2014.[214][215] Christie won the election over Barbara 
Buono on November 5, 2013, by a large margin, earning himself the position 
of governor for a second straight term. His advisors say that his strategy 
was to focus on winning a huge margin in New Jersey against Democratic 
opponent Buono, which would help position the governor for the presidential 
primaries and develop a model for other Republican candidates.[216] Christie 
began building a national fundraising network, aided by the fact that only 
one other state had a gubernatorial contest in 2013, and those financial 
resources were intended to support a major outreach effort toward blacks, 
Hispanics and women.[216] He also ordered a $25 million special election 
to fill the seat of the deceased Senator Frank Lautenberg. The move was 
believed to be motivated by a desire to keep Newark Mayor Cory Booker from 
sharing an election day, 20 days afterward, with Christie, thereby depressing 
otherwise anticipated black voter turnout that tended to vote Democratic.[217] 
From September 9 through September 13, 2013, two of the three traffic lanes 
in Fort Lee normally open to access the George Washington Bridge and New 
York City were closed on orders from a senior Christie aide and a Christie 
administration appointee. The lane closures in the morning rush hour resulted 
in massive traffic back-ups on the local streets for five days.[218][219] 
One common theory as to why the lanes were closed is that it was political 
retribution against Democratic Fort Lee Mayor Mark Sokolich, for not supporting 
Christie in the 2013 gubernatorial election.[220][221] Another possible 
motive involves a major real estate development project, which was a top 
priority for Sokolich, that was underway at the Fort Lee bridge access 
point.[221][222] Several of Christie's appointees and aides resigned, and 
Christie fired others, as investigations into the closures intensified.[223][224] 
In a radio interview on February 3, 2014, Christie indicated that he "unequivocally" 
had no knowledge of, did not approve, and did not authorize plans to close 
the toll lanes, and stated that he first found out about the traffic jams 
from a Wall Street Journal story after the lanes had been reopened.[225] 
In an interview on ABC, Christie reiterated that he was shocked by the 
actions of his former aides, stating that "Sometimes, people do inexplicably 
stupid things."[226] Other investigations were conducted by the United 
States Attorney for the District of New Jersey, the New Jersey Legislature, 
and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. On September 18, 2014, 
WNBC reported that unnamed federal sources said the US Attorney investigation 
had found no evidence that Christie had prior knowledge of or directed 
the closures.[227][228] An interim report[229] by the NJ legislative committee 
investigating the closures was released in December 2014. The committee 
had been unable to determine if Christie had advance knowledge since it 
was asked by the US Attorney to postpone interviewing certain key witnesses.[230] 
At a press conference on May 1, 2015, U.S. Attorney Paul J. Fishman stated 
that, based upon the evidence that was available, his office would not 
bring any more charges in the case.[231] However, in September 2016, federal 
prosecutors in a trial of two New Jersey government officials over their 
involvement in "Bridgegate" said that a defendant and a witness boasted 
about their actions to the governor at the time, confirming what Donald 
Trump had said in December 2015 while opposing Christie for the Republican 
nomination for the 2016 presidential election.[232] On October 13, 2016 
a complaint of official misconduct that alleges that the governor knew 
of the closures of access lanes while they were ongoing but failed to act 
to reopen them was allowed to proceed.[233][234] In response to the complaint 
filed by a local citizen, Bergen County Municipal Presiding Judge Roy McGeady 
said; "I'm satisfied that there's probable cause to believe that an event 
of official misconduct was caused by Governor Christie. I'm going to issue 
the summons."[235] On November 4, 2016, the federal jury returned guilty 
verdicts for former high-ranking Chris Christie government officials Bill 
Baroni and Bridget Anne Kelly — the result was convictions on all counts.[236][237] 
On March 2, 2016, following Christie's endorsement of Donald Trump, six 
New Jersey-based Gannett Company-owned newspapers, the Asbury Park Press, 
Courier-News (Bridgewater), The Courier-Post (Cherry Hill), Home News Tribune 
(East Brunswick), Daily Record (Morristown), The Daily Journal, (Vineland) 
in a joint editorial called for Christie's resignation.[238][239] On March 
3, 2016 the New Jersey Advance Media-owned The Star-Ledger, the state's 
largest daily newspaper, called for Christie's resignation.[240] On March 
6, 2016 The New York Times editorial stated that while it would be satisfying 
"to join the chorus calling for Mr. Christie to quit, perhaps it is better 
to let him keep his latest promise" that he would do his job as governor.[241] 
On March 2, 2016, Philip D. Murphy, a potential Democratic candidate for 
NJ Governor in 2017, began a petition calling for Christie to "do his job" 
or quit.[242] New Jersey GOP lawmakers Jennifer Beck (R-Monmouth), Amy 
Handlin (R-Monmouth), Jack Ciattarelli (R-Somerset) said that Christie 
cannot continue to serve as governor if he goes on the campaign trail for 
Trump.[243] On March 15, 2016, Mayor of Jersey City Steve Fulop said Christie 
should step down and began circulating a website and petition asking for 
him to do so.[244][245] In April 2016 a Rutgers-Eagleton survey found the 
governor's approval rating had dropped to 26 percent. A similar result 
was again found by the Institute in September 2016.[246] In May 2016 the 
Quinnipiac University Polling Institute found 64% of voters disapprove 
of the job Christie is doing, compared to 29% percent who approve.[247] 
In June 2016, a Monmouth University poll found that just 27 percent of 
New Jersey adults approve of Christie's job performance, with 63 percent 
disapproving. The poll found that 79 percent of New Jersey adults say that 
Christie was more concerned with his political future than with governing 
the state.[248] Poll results released on November 7, 2016 by Rutgers-Eagleton 
stated that 19% of New Jersey voters viewed Christie favourably, his lowest 
approval rating ever.[249][250] On November 21, 2013, Christie was elected 
Chairman of the Republican Governors Association, succeeding Louisiana 
Governor Bobby Jindal.[251] Christie campaigned extensively on behalf of 
Republican governors who are up for re-election.[252] In the first three 
months of 2014, the RGA raised a record sum for the first quarter of a 
mid-term election year, and almost double the amount raised by the Democratic 
Governors Association during the same period.[253] Christie presided over 
net gains for Republican governships in the 2014 elections, including Bruce 
Rauner in Illinois, Larry Hogan in Maryland and Charlie Baker in Massachusetts, 
three states that are overwhelmingly Democrat.[254] Christie was considered 
a leader of the Republican Party.[255][256] He was the subject of ongoing 
speculation that he would attempt a run for President of the United States 
in 2012 by competing in the Republican primaries. Through 2013 he denied 
any interest in launching a presidential bid. In September 2011, a number 
of press stories cited unnamed sources indicating Christie was reconsidering 
his decision to stay out of the race. An Associated Press story dated September 
30 indicated a decision on whether he would run for president in 2012 would 
be made "soon".[257] In a late September speech at the Reagan Library, 
he had again said he was not a candidate for president, but the speech 
also coincided with his "reconsideration" of the negative decision. One 
commentator at that time reviewed reported support from David H. and Charles 
G. Koch, Kenneth Langone, and others for Christie's potential candidacy.[258] 
Retired General Electric CEO Jack Welch went on the Charlie Rose Show to 
articulate his and others' support for a candidacy,[259] and Langone went 
on the interview show October 4.[260] On October 4, 2011, Christie acknowledged 
he had in fact reconsidered his decision but then, again, declined to run.[261] 
It was "for real this time", as one report put it. "Now is not my time", 
Christie said.[262] "New Jersey, whether you like it or not, you're stuck 
with me," Christie added in the one-hour Trenton press conference held 
to announce the decision.[263] On October 11, 2011, Christie endorsed Mitt 
Romney for president.[264] The New York Post has cited anonymous sources 
as saying Christie was not willing to give up the governorship to be Romney's 
running mate because he had doubts about their ability to win. The Romney 
campaign was reported to have asked him to resign his governorship if he 
became the vice-presidential nominee because "pay to play" laws restrict 
campaign contributions from financial corporation executives to governors 
running for federal office when the companies do business with the governor's 
state.[265] A memo from the campaign attributed Romney's decision not to 
choose Christie as his running mate, in part to unanswered questions during 
the vetting process regarding a defamation lawsuit following Christie's 
initial campaign for Morris County Freeholder, a Securities and Exchange 
Commission investigation of Christie's brother, as well as his weight.[266][267] 
Christie gave the keynote address at the Republican National Convention 
in August 2012.[268] On October 30, 2012, during a press conference to 
discuss the impact of Hurricane Sandy, Christie praised the disaster relief 
efforts of President Barack Obama.[269][270][271] Christie stated he still 
supported Mitt Romney and was opposed to many of Obama's policies, but 
thought Obama deserved credit for his help in the disaster reliefs in New 
Jersey.[272] Christie had campaigned with Romney for much of the election, 
but stated Romney did not ask him to join him in campaigns for the last 
week before the election, to allow Christie to focus on disaster relief.[273] 
Christie faced significant backlash before and after the election from 
conservative Republicans who accused him of acting to bolster his own personal 
political standing at the expense of Romney and the party.[274][275] Political 
commentators debated whether Christie's weight would or should affect his 
viability as a 2012 presidential candidate, either for medical or social 
reasons.[276] In 2011, columnist Eugene Robinson applied the term "extremely 
obese" to Christie, citing medical guidelines established by the National 
Institutes of Health. Christie himself was reportedly concerned about his 
weight and its implications for his health, describing himself as relatively 
healthy overall.[277] The Obesity Society, a nonprofit scientific group, 
released a statement asserting, "To suggest that Governor Christie's body 
weight discounts and discredits his ability to be an effective political 
candidate is inappropriate, unjust, and wrong."[278] Christie underwent 
lap-band stomach surgery in February 2013 and disclosed the surgery to 
the New York Post in May of that year.[279] In the aftermath of the election, 
Christie maintained his national profile and continued to clash with conservatives 
in his party by strongly criticizing House Speaker John Boehner regarding 
aid for Hurricane Sandy[280] and then the National Rifle Association for 
their ad that mentioned President Obama's children.[281] Christie was subsequently 
not invited to speak at the 2013 Conservative Political Action Conference 
(CPAC), which is largely seen as a stepping-stone for Republicans running 
for president. The CPAC chair explained that Christie was not invited "for 
decisions that he made", but that "hopefully next year he's back on the 
right track and being a conservative."[282] On February 3, 2014, CPAC announced 
on their Facebook account that Governor Christie would be a speaker at 
the yearly conference.[citation needed] In January 2015, Christie took 
his first formal step towards a potential presidential candidacy when he 
formed a political action committee (PAC)[283] in order to raise funds 
and set the groundwork for what Time magazine called "a likely 2016 presidential 
campaign".[284] On June 27, 2015, Christie launched his presidential campaign 
website. He formally announced his candidacy on June 30, 2015.[285][286][287][288] 
Christie dropped out of the race on February 10, 2016 after the New Hampshire 
primary following a poor showing and low poll numbers. He received 7.4% 
of the overall vote in the New Hampshire primary.[289] Despite having criticized 
Donald Trump prior to leaving the race,[290] he endorsed Trump on February 
26, 2016.[291] On May 9, 2016, Trump named Christie to head up a transition 
team in the event of a Trump presidency.[292] He soon emerged as a major 
power with the Trump campaign.[293] On July 12, 2016, it was reported that 
Christie was on the shortlist to be Trump's running mate in the general 
election, alongside former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich and Governor 
of Indiana Mike Pence.[294][295] On July 15, 2016, Trump officially announced 
Pence as his running mate.[296] In September 2016, Christie acknowledged 
that the Fort Lee lane closure scandal, also known as Bridgegate, was a 
factor in his being denied the nomination. Trump had said earlier that 
Christie knew about the closures, which Christie denies.[297][298] Following 
the Trump tape controversy, Christie called Trump's comments "completely 
indefensible", but also added "I don't think it’s the only way you should 
make a judgment". [299] After calls for his impeachment as Governor and 
felony convictions in U.S. federal court for high-ranking members of his 
staff in the Bridgegate scandal, Christie was dropped by Trump as leader 
of the transition team, in favor of Mike Pence.[300][301] On the same day, 
Christie's close associates Richard Bagger and Bill Palatucci were both 
removed by Trump from the transition team.[300][301][302] Former Congressman 
Mike Rogers, a national security expert on the Trump transition team, was 
additionally another close associate of Chris Christie who was also removed
