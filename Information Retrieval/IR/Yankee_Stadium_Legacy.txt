The Yankee Stadium Legacy set is a 6,743-card compilation chronicling every 
single game New York Yankees game ever played at the original Yankee Stadium, 
and other notable events. The card set was manufactured by Upper Deck and 
made its official debut by being randomly inserted into packs of Upper 
Deck’s 2008 Series 1 Baseball.[1] As part of a promotion related to the 
set, the first five collectors who completed the set of all 6,661 cards 
inserted into 2008 Upper Deck Baseball products, were to travel to New 
York during the 2009 New York Yankees season to attend a game at the new 
Yankee Stadium and meet Yankee Captain, Derek Jeter.[2] The Yankee Stadium 
Legacy cards representing the 2008 New York Yankees season appeared in 
2009 Upper Deck Series One Baseball packs in February 2009 and put an end 
to the Yankee Stadium Legacy promotion.[1] The five contest winners would 
receive the 82 cards representing the final season at Yankee Stadium. Tommy 
Baxter, a 36-year-old from Little Rock, Arkansas, was the first collector 
to put together Upper Deck’s Yankee Stadium Legacy (YSL) Collection. Baxter 
was a Cubs fan.[3] Baxter's accomplishment was commemorated with a card 
in 2009 Upper Deck Series One Baseball. Some of the notable cards in the 
set commemorate some of the most famous sporting events that have taken 
place at Yankee Stadium. Some of these events include: According to a January 
2008 Upper Deck press release,[1] The Guinness World Book of Records would 
certify Yankee Stadium Legacy as the largest baseball card set ever produced, 
once all the cards are released.[4] However, the 1998 Topps TEK set contained 
90 different player cards, that were each available in 90 different variations, 
for a total of 8100 different cards which some collectors consider to be 
an even larger complete set.[5] The various sets where the Yankee Stadium 
Legacy cards were inserted into were: Spectrum; Piece of History; SPx; 
Upper Deck Series Two; SP Legendary Cuts (Hobby-only); SP Authentic; UDx; 
and UD Masterpieces. Upper Deck started the website www.OwnTheLegacy.com 
so that collectors could find out more about the Yankee Stadium Legacy 
set. Alphanumeric codes found on the backs of Yankee Stadium Legacy cards 
can be entered at the site, and collectors will can use the site to manage 
their collections online, and track their collections against other collectors 
via a leader board. The cards commemorating the 2008 New York Yankees season 
were featured in Series 1 of 2009 Upper Deck baseball.[6] Two of the more 
notable cards include YSL-AG (commemorating the 2008 Major League Baseball 
All-Star Game) and card YSL-6742 featuring Andy Pettite commemorating the
