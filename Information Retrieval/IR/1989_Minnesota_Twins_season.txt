to accomplish the feat. When Jeff Reardon got his 30th save on September

Puckett led the AL in batting with a .339 average and hits with 215. Kirby 
hit 9 HR, drove in 85 runs, scored 75, and was rewarded with a Silver Slugger 
Award. Kent Hrbek hit .272 with 25 HR and 84 RBI. Gary Gaetti hit 19 HR 
and 75 RBI. Al Newman led the team with 25 stolen bases. Only two Twins

Viola was 8-12 before being traded to the New York Mets on July 31. Reliever 
Jeff Reardon had 31 saves. Third baseman Gary Gaetti and center fielder
