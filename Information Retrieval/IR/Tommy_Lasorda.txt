As player As manager Thomas Charles "Tommy" Lasorda (born September 22, 
1927) is a former Major League Baseball player who has had a lengthy career 
in sports management. In 2009, he marked his sixth decade in one capacity 
or another with the Brooklyn/Los Angeles Dodgers organization, the longest 
discontinuous (he played one season with the Kansas City Athletics) tenure 
anyone has had with the team, edging Dodger broadcaster Vin Scully by a 
single season. He was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame 
as a manager in 1997. Tommy Lasorda signed with the Philadelphia Phillies 
as an undrafted free agent in 1945 and began his professional career with 
the Concord Weavers in 1945. He then missed the 1946 and 1947 seasons because 
of a stint in the United States Army. He served on active duty from October 
1945 until spring 1947. He returned to baseball in 1948 with the Schenectady 
Blue Jays of the Canadian–American League. On May 31, 1948, he struck out 
25 Amsterdam Rugmakers in a 15-inning game, setting a professional record 
(since broken), and drove in the winning run with a single.[1] In his next 
two starts, he struck out 15 and 13, gaining the attention of the Dodgers, 
who drafted him from the Phillies chain and sent him to the Greenville 
Spinners in 1949. Lasorda also pitched for the Cristobal Mottas in the 
Canal Zone Baseball League in Panama from 1948 through 1950, winning the 
championship in '48. Lasorda played for Almendares (Cuba) from 1950–52 
and 1958–60, compiling a 16–13 record in four seasons, including 8–3 with 
a 1.89 ERA in 1958–59. Lasorda made his major league debut on August 5, 
1954, for the Brooklyn Dodgers. Though he did not play in the 1955 World 
Series, he won a World Series ring as a member of the 1955 Brooklyn Dodgers. 
He pitched for the Dodgers for two seasons, then for the Kansas City Athletics 
for one season after the Athletics bought him from the Dodgers. Kansas 
City traded Lasorda to the New York Yankees in 1956. He appeared in 22 
games for the Triple-A Denver Bears in 1956–57, and then was sold back 
to the Dodgers in 1957. During his brief tenure with the Bears, Lasorda 
was profoundly influenced by Denver skipper Ralph Houk, who became Lasorda's 
role model as an MLB manager. "Ralph taught me if that if you treat players 
like human beings, they will play like Superman", he told Bill Plaschke 
in the biography, I Live for This: Baseball's Last True Believer. "He taught 
me how a pat on a shoulder can be just as important as a kick in the butt."[2] 
Lasorda was first optioned to the Montreal Royals of the International 
League in 1950. He also played winter baseball for Almendares (Cuba) from 
1950–52 and 1958–60, compiling a 16–13 record in four seasons, including 
8–3 with a 1.89 ERA in 1958–59. He pitched for Montreal from 1950–54 and 
1958–1960 and is the winningest pitcher in the history of the team (107–57) 
(Lasorda was sent back down to Montreal in 1954 after the Dodgers were 
forced to keep a young Sandy Koufax on their roster due to the Bonus Rule. 
He later joked that it took Koufax to keep him off the Dodger pitching 
staff). He led Montreal to four straight Governors' Cups from 1951 to 1954, 
and a fifth one in 1958. On June 24, 2006, he was inducted into the Canadian 
Baseball Hall of Fame.[3] He played only in the minors for the Yankees, 
and the Dodgers returned him to the Montreal team, where he was voted the 
International League's Most Valuable Pitcher in 1958, when he won his fifth 
minor league championship. The Dodgers released him on July 9, 1960. Lasorda's 
first off-field assignment with the Dodgers was as a scout from 1961 to 
1965. In 1966, he became the manager for the Pocatello Chiefs in the rookie 
leagues, then managed the Ogden Dodgers to three Pioneer League championships 
from 1966 to '68. He became the Dodgers AAA Pacific Coast League manager 
in 1969 with the Spokane Indians (1969–71) and remained in the position 
when the Dodgers switched their AAA farm club to the Albuquerque Dukes 
(1972). His 1972 Dukes team won the PCL Championship. Lasorda was also 
a manager for the Dominican Winter Baseball League team Tigres del Licey 
(Licey Tigers). He led the team to the 1973 Caribbean World Series title 
in Venezuela with a series record of 5 wins and 1 loss. In 1973, Lasorda 
became the third-base coach on the staff of Hall of Fame manager Walter 
Alston, serving for almost four seasons. He was widely regarded as Alston's 
heir apparent, and turned down several major league managing jobs elsewhere 
to remain in the Dodger fold. Lasorda became the Los Angeles Dodgers manager 
September 29, 1976, upon Alston's retirement. He compiled a 1,599–1,439 
record as Dodgers manager, won two World Series championships in (1981 
and 1988), four National League pennants, and eight division titles in 
his 20-year career as the Dodgers manager. His 16 wins in 30 NL Championship 
games managed were the most of any manager at the time of his retirement. 
His 61 postseason games managed ranks fourth all-time behind Bobby Cox, 
Casey Stengel, and Joe Torre. He also managed in four All-Star games. Lasorda 
managed nine players who won the National League Rookie of the Year award. 
The winners came in two strings of consecutive players. From 1979 to 1982, 
he managed Rick Sutcliffe, Steve Howe, Fernando Valenzuela, and Steve Sax. 
From 1992 to 1995, he managed Eric Karros, Mike Piazza, Raúl Mondesí, and 
Hideo Nomo. Before retiring during the 1996 season, he had also managed 
that year's rookie of the year, Todd Hollandsworth. His final game was 
a 4–3 victory over the Houston Astros, at Dodger Stadium (att. 35,467), 
on June 23, 1996. The following day (June 24), he drove himself to the 
hospital complaining of abdominal pains, and in fact he was having a heart 
attack. He officially retired on July 29, 1996. His 1,599 career wins ranks 
16th all-time in MLB history. He was inducted into the Baseball Hall of 
Fame in 1997 as a manager in his first year of eligibility. The Dodgers 
retired his uniform number (2) on August 15, 1997 and renamed a street 
in Dodgertown as "Tommy Lasorda Lane". In 2014, a new restaurant named 
"Lasorda's Trattoria" opened at Dodger Stadium. Lasorda came out of retirement 
to manage the United States team at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, 
Australia. He led the Americans to the gold medal, beating heavily favored 
Cuba, which had won the gold medals at the two previous Olympics. In doing 
so, he became the first manager to win a World Series Championship and 
lead a team to Olympic Gold Medal. Lasorda coached the 2001 All-Star Game 
as third base coach. While at the plate, Vladimir Guerrero lost his bat 
while swinging, and it flew towards Lasorda, causing him to fall backwards, 
but Tommy was unharmed. As a joke, Giants outfielder Barry Bonds gave Lasorda 
a chest protector to wear while manning the third-base coaching box. During 
spring training in 2008, the Dodgers were invited to play a series of exhibition 
games in China. Dodger manager Joe Torre took a group of players with him 
for that series. The majority of the team remained behind in Florida to 
finish out the Grapefruit League season. Lasorda briefly came out of retirement 
to manage the team while Torre was away.[4] An unnamed Dodger executive 
came up with the idea of having Dodger manager Don Mattingly ask Lasorda 
to be an honorary coach on Lasorda's 84th birthday against the San Francisco 
Giants.[5] Tommy Lasorda was named Vice-President of the Dodgers upon his 
retirement from managing in 1996. On June 22, 1998 he became the Dodgers 
interim General Manager upon the mid-season firing of Fred Claire. He resigned 
as General Manager after the season and was appointed as Senior Vice-President 
of the Dodgers. After the sale of the team to Frank McCourt, Lasorda took 
on his current position of Special Advisor to the Chairman where his responsibilities 
include scouting, evaluating and teaching minor league players, acting 
as an advisor and ambassador for the Dodgers' international affiliations, 
and representing the organization at more than 100 speaking engagements 
and appearances to various charities, private groups and military personnel 
each year.[7] Lasorda and his wife Jo celebrated their 60th wedding anniversary 
in 2010. They have resided in Fullerton, California, for more than 50 years 
and they have two children. They named a gymnasium and youth center in 
memory of their son, Tom Jr., in Yorba Linda, California on September 7, 
1997.[7][9] In 1991, Tom, Jr. (known as "Spunky") died of complications 
related to AIDS.[10] Lasorda denied that his son was gay,[11] according 
to sportswriter Bill Plaschke, he insists his son died of cancer.[12] In 
June 2005, President George W. Bush asked Lasorda to serve as a delegate 
to the U.S. National Day at the World Exposition in Aichi, Japan.[13] Lasorda 
was famous for his colorful personality and outspoken opinions regarding 
players and other personnel associated with baseball. He had a number of 
obscenity-filled tirades, some of which were taped and became underground 
classics. The most famous of these is his "Dave Kingman tirade" in 1978, 
in which Lasorda ranted at reporter Paul Olden, who asked him about Kingman 
hitting three home runs against the Dodgers that day.[14] In 1996, he voiced 
the role of Lucky Lasorta, a Rough Collie commentating the baseball game 
in the film Homeward Bound II: Lost in San Francisco He made a cameo appearance 
in the 1992 movie Ladybugs alongside Rodney Dangerfield. Lasorda portrayed 
the Dugout Wizard in the syndicated children's television show The Baseball 
Bunch.[15] His other television credits playing himself include Silver 
Spoons, Who's The Boss, CHiPs, Hart to Hart, Fantasy Island, Hee Haw, Simon 
& Simon, Everybody Loves Raymond, and American Restoration. Lasorda partially 
owned the food company Lasorda Foods, which was known primarily for pasta 
sauces that Lasorda stated were based on a family recipe passed down to 
his wife, Jo.[16] In September 1989, the company became a wholly owned 
subsidiary of the Denver firm Discovery Capital Corp, of which Lasorda 
continued to own 10%.[17] The parent company through which Lasorda maintained 
his stake in the Lasorda Foods, Lasorda Foods Holding Corp Inc., was initially 
based in Fountain Valley, California, before moving to Irvine and then 
Paramount. A Boca Raton, Florida-based company, Modami Services, acquired 
Lasorda Foods Holding Corp Inc. in August 1993. Lasorda and Lasorda Foods 
President Steven Fox, who together owned a majority of Lasorda Foods' stock, 
were paid in Modami shares.[16] Lasorda is the godfather to Thomas Piazza, 
the younger brother of Major League Hall of Fame catcher Mike Piazza, both 
of whom are from Norristown. Thomas was named after Lasorda and it has 
been widely misstated that Lasorda is Mike's godfather.[18] Lasorda is 
also the godfather to Alex Avila, a catcher with the Chicago White Sox. 
Alex's grandfather, Ralph Avila, is a former scout with the Dodgers and 
friend to Lasorda of over 50 years. Alex's middle name of Thomas was named 
for Lasorda.[19] In 2008, the government of Japan conferred the Order of 
the Rising Sun, Gold Rays with Rosette, which represents the fourth-highest 
of eight classes associated with the award. The decoration was presented 
in acknowledgment of his contributions to Japanese baseball.[20] Lasorda 
became a local celebrity in the Dominican Republic due to his many visits 
in search of young baseball talents in this land of many famous players 
in the major leagues, especially after becoming a devoted fan of the "chicharrones" 
(deep fried pork skins) commonly sold on the streets of the Villa Mella 
neighborhood of Santo Domingo.[citation needed] On June 3, 2012, at age 
84, Lasorda was hospitalized in New York City after suffering a heart attack.
