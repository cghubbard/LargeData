Thomas Francis "Tom" Hallion (born September 5, 1956) is an American umpire 
in Major League Baseball (MLB) who has worked in the National League (NL) 
from 1985 to 1999 and throughout both major leagues since 2005. He is a 
crew chief. Hallion has worn number 20 during his MLB career. He resigned 
from the NL in 1999 as a failed mass bargaining strategy, but he was rehired 
by MLB before the 2005 season. Hallion was born on September 5, 1956, to 
Alice and Francis Hallion in Saugerties, New York. He has two sisters, 
Kathy Cotich and Maribeth, and a brother, Francis.[1] Hallion attended 
the University at Buffalo. He married Elizabeth "Betsy" Carnright on September 
11, 1983. They have three children, Corey, Kyle and Jacob, and reside in 
Louisville, Kentucky.[2][3] While a student at the University at Buffalo, 
Hallion got his first umpiring job through his friend Jack Keeley; he worked 
games for the Saugerties Athletic Association softball league. In 1979, 
he attended Bill Kinnamon Umpiring School. He began his professional umpiring 
career in the New York–Penn League (1979), which was followed by stints 
in the Carolina League (1980–1981), Eastern League (1982) and American 
Association (1983–1985) before joining the NL staff. He was among the umpires 
who lost their jobs after resigning as part of a failed union bargaining 
strategy in 1999, but he was rehired in a December 2004 settlement with 
MLB.[4] He has officiated in the World Series in 2008, the League Championship 
Series in 1998, 2007, 2009, 2010, and 2011, and in the Division Series 
in 1996, 1997, 2008, 2012, 2013, and 2014. He has also worked the All-Star 
Game in 1992 and 2008, being at second base for the latter contest at Yankee 
Stadium which went a record 15 innings. In 2013, Hallion was fined by MLB 
for swearing at pitcher David Price.[5] Hallion is known for his exciting 
and demonstrative strikeout signal in which he twists his body 180 degrees. 
Hallion wore uniform number 20 during his NL career and retained the number 
when he rejoined the MLB umpire staff in 2005. Hallion was the home plate 
umpire on July 12, 1997 when Francisco Córdova and Ricardo Rincón of the 
Pittsburgh Pirates combined on a 3-0, 10-inning no-hitter against the Houston 
Astros.[6] In 2009, he was the home plate umpire for the first game at 
the New Yankee Stadium.[7] On July 10 of that season, Hallion was the first 
base umpire when San Francisco Giants pitcher Jonathan Sánchez no-hit the 
San Diego Padres.[8] On June 8, 2010, he was behind the plate when Stephen 
Strasburg struck out 14 batters in his MLB debut.[9] Hallion was the second 
base umpire for Henderson Álvarez's no-hitter on September 29, 2013.[10] 
Hallion has umpired in international play several times. He worked the 
2006 World Baseball Classic, and was behind the plate for the championship 
game between Japan and Cuba. His crew was also selected to umpire the 2012 
MLB Japan Series between the Seattle Mariners and Oakland Athletics. Hallion
