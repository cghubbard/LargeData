The 1990 Minnesota Twins, three years after their World Series title in 
1987, fell to the bottom of the AL West once again. However, the season 
was not completely bad, as there were some bright spots that included pitchers 
Rick Aguilera and Scott Erickson. Aguilera converted from starter to closer 
and recorded 32 saves, while Erickson was promoted to the Twins in June 
from AA and went 8-4 with a 3.27 ERA. The highlight of the season came 
on July 17, in Boston, when the Twins turned 2 triple plays. In the 4th 
inning, with the bases loaded and Scott Erickson pitching, former Twin 
Tom Brunansky hit a sharp grounder to Gary Gaetti at third base, who stepped 
on the bag for the force out, fired to Al Newman at second, whose relay 
to Kent Hrbek was in time to get Brunansky at first. In the 8th inning, 
with John Candelaria pitching and runners on first and second, Jody Reed 
hit a one-hopper at Gaetti who again started a 5-4-3 triple play. This 
was the first time in MLB history that two triple plays were recorded in 
a game, a feat that has not been duplicated since.[3] The following night, 
still in Boston, both teams combined for a MLB-record-tying ten double 
plays. Boston tied an American League record by grounding into six DPs 
in the game, only escaping the twin killings in the sixth and seventh innings. 
Both games were won by Boston. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10]
