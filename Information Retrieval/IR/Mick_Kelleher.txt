As player As coach Michael Dennis Kelleher (born July 25, 1947) is an American 
former professional baseball player and coach. He played in Major League 
Baseball for the St. Louis Cardinals, Houston Astros, Chicago Cubs, Detroit 
Tigers, and California Angels. He coached for the Pittsburgh Pirates, Tigers, 
and the New York Yankees. As a minor leaguer with the Tulsa Oilers in 1972, 
Kelleher set an American Association record for shortstops with a .979 
fielding percentage.[1] Perhaps Kelleher's most famous moment as a Major 
Leaguer came as a Cub in 1977. That August 7, in the second game of a doubleheader 
against the San Diego Padres at Wrigley Field, Kelleher, at 5–9 and 170 
pounds, responded to Dave Kingman's hard slide into him on a double play 
attempt (Kingman was apparently angered over being hit by a Steve Renko 
pitch) by jumping on the 6–6, 210-pound Kingman's back and pummeling him 
with blows; the ensuing bench-clearing brawl resulted in the ejections 
of both players. The two became teammates the following season, after Kingman 
signed with the Cubs as a free agent. In 11 seasons, Kelleher was an infielder 
for the St. Louis Cardinals (1972–73 and 1975), Houston Astros (1974), 
Chicago Cubs (1976–80), Detroit Tigers (1981–82) and California Angels 
(1982). He was a member of the 1982 AL Western Division Champions, playing 
mostly shortstop and hitting .163 in 49 at bats. He did not appear in the 
playoffs. Playing in 622 games, Kelleher recorded a career .213 batting 
average in 1,081 at bats. He is the most recently retired non-pitcher to 
have more than 1,000 at-bats and no home runs. Kelleher consistently worked 
in major league baseball after his playing career ended. He was a minor 
league coach and a scout. He also served as a first base coach for the 
Pittsburgh Pirates in 1986 and for the Detroit Tigers from 2003 to 2005.[2] 
Prior to being named first base coach for the Yankees, he was a defensive 
coordinator for the Yankees’ minor league system. His main assignment with 
the Yankees was originally to monitor the development of Robinson Canó, 
whom he coached in the minor leagues.[3] He spent six seasons as the team's 
first base coach, and was a member of their coaching staff during the 2009 
World Series. On October 10, the Yankees announced Kelleher would not return 
for the 2015 season.[4] Kelleher subsequently retired from baseball on
