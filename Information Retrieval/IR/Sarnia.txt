Sarnia is a city in Southwestern Ontario, Canada, and had a 2011 population 
of 72,366.[4] It is the largest city on Lake Huron and in Lambton County. 
Sarnia is located on the eastern bank of the junction between the Upper 
and Lower Great Lakes where Lake Huron flows into the St. Clair River, 
which forms the Canada-United States border, directly across from Port 
Huron, Michigan. The city's natural harbour first attracted the French 
explorer La Salle, who named the site "The Rapids" when he had horses and 
men pull his 45 tonnes (50 short tons; 44 long tons) barque "Le Griffon" 
up the almost four-knot current[5] of the St. Clair River on 23 August 
1679.[6] This was the first time anything other than a canoe or other oar-powered 
vessel had sailed into Lake Huron,[7] and La Salle's voyage was thus germinal 
in the development of commercial shipping on the Great Lakes.[8] Located 
in the natural harbour, the Sarnia port remains an important centre for 
lake freighters and oceangoing ships carrying cargoes of grain and petroleum 
products.[9] The natural port and the salt caverns that exist in the surrounding 
areas,[10] together with the oil discovered in nearby Oil Springs in 1858[11] 
led to the massive growth of the petroleum industry in this area. Because 
Oil Springs was the first place in Canada and North America to drill commercially 
for oil, the knowledge that was acquired there led to oil drillers from 
Sarnia travelling the world teaching other nations how to drill for oil.[12] 
The complex of refining and chemical companies is called Chemical Valley 
and located south of downtown Sarnia.[13] While in 2011, the city had the 
highest level of particulates air pollution of any Canadian city, it has 
since dropped down to 30th.[14] About 60 percent of the particulate matter, 
however, comes from the neighboring United States.[15] Lake Huron is cooler 
than the air in summer and warmer than the air in winter; therefore, it 
moderates Sarnia's humid continental climate, which makes temperature extremes 
of hot and cold very rare.[3] In the winter, Sarnia experiences lake-effect 
snow because Arctic air blows across the warmer waters of Lake Huron and 
condenses to form snow squalls once over land.[16] Culturally, Sarnia is 
a large part of the artistic presence in Southern Ontario.[17] The city's 
International Symphony Orchestra is renowned in the area and has won the 
Outstanding Community Orchestra Award given by the Detroit Music Awards 
in 2011.[18] Michael Learned graced the stage of the Imperial Theatre for 
a 2010 production of Driving Miss Daisy.[19] The largest event that happens 
in Sarnia is Sarnia Bayfest, which is a popular music festival that takes 
place during the summer. In 2013, organizers cancelled the event because 
of money troubles but look forward in 2015 to combining with the International 
Powerboat Festival and presenting a joint event.[20][21][22][23] The name 
"Sarnia" is Latin for Guernsey, which is a British Channel Island.[24] 
In 1829 Sir John Colborne, a former governor of Guernsey, was appointed 
Lieutenant Governor of Upper Canada.[25] In this capacity, he visited two 
small settlements in 1835 that had been laid out on the shores of Lake 
Huron. One of these, named "The Rapids," consisted then of 44 taxpayers, 
nine frame houses, four log houses, two brick dwellings, two taverns and 
three stores.[26][27] The villagers wished to change its name but were 
unable to agree on an alternative.[28] The English settlers favoured the 
name "Buenos Aires" and the Scottish "New Glasgow". Sir John Colborne suggested 
Port Sarnia. On 4 January 1836, the name was formally adopted by a vote 
of 26 to 16, and Colborne also named the nearby village Moore after British 
military hero Sir John Moore.[28][29] Sarnia adopted the nickname "The 
Imperial City" on 7 May 1914 because of the visit of Canada's Governor 
General, H.R.H. the Duke of Connaught, and his daughter Princess Patricia.[30] 
First Nations peoples have lived, hunted, and traveled across the area 
for at least 10,000 years, as shown by archaeological evidence on Walpole 
Island.[31] These peoples were drawn from an amalgamation of Ojibwa, Odawa, 
and Potowatami clans, which formed the Three Fires Confederacy, also called 
the Council of Three Fires, in A.D. 796.[32] These clans came together 
through common links in both language and culture, developing a self-sufficient 
society where tasks and responsibilities were equally shared among all 
members.[33] During the 1600s and 1700s, The Three Fires Confederacy controlled 
much of the area known as the hub of the Great Lakes, which included the 
Canadian shore where Sarnia is now located.[32] During this time, it maintained 
relations with many of the First Nations, including Huron, Sioux, and Iroquois, 
as well as the countries of Great Britain and France. Their trading partners, 
the Huron, welcomed La Salle and the Griffon in 1679 after he sailed into 
Lake Huron.[6] The Ontario Heritage Trust erected a sign under the Blue 
Water Bridge in commemoration of the voyage, as shown by the photo of the 
sign. Because of this beginning of the incursion of Europeans into the 
area, the members of the Confederacy helped shape the development of North 
America throughout the 18th century, becoming a center of trade and culture.[34] 
Great Britain supported this strengthening of the tribes in the area as 
a set of allies against the French and the Iroqouis. The people of the 
Three Fires Confederacy, however, sided with the French during the Seven 
Years' War and only made peace with Great Britain after the Treaty of Fort 
Niagara in 1764.[32][35] It also fought on the side of the British during 
the War of 1812.[36] The Three Fires Confederacy also broke several treaties 
with the United States prior to 1815, but finally signed the Treaty of 
Springwells in September of that year and ceased all hostilities directed 
at the United States.[37] The Grand Council survived intact until the middle 
to late 19th century, when more modern political systems began to evolve.[38] 
After the War of 1812, the first Europeans in the area were French settlers 
loyal to the British Crown who moved north from Detroit. They successfully 
traded with the Three Fires Confederacy, which contributed to the growth 
of the area.[39] After its foundation, Port Sarnia expanded throughout 
the 19th century; on 19 June 1856, the residents passed the Act to Incorporate 
the Town of Sarnia and the name Port Sarnia was officially changed to Sarnia 
effective 1 January 1857. The Act mentioned 1,000 inhabitants in three 
wards.[40] The wealth of adjoining stands of timber, the discovery of oil 
in nearby Oil Springs in 1858 by James Miller Williams, and the arrival 
of the Great Western Railway in 1858 and the Grand Trunk Railway in 1859 
all stimulated Sarnia's growth.[41] The rail lines were later linked directly 
to the United States by the opening of the St. Clair Tunnel under the St. 
Clair River at Sarnia in 1890, by the Grand Trunk Railway, which was the 
first railroad tunnel ever constructed under a river.[42] The tunnel was 
an engineering marvel in its day, achieved through the development of original 
techniques for excavating in a compressed air environment. Canada Steamship 
Lines formed in 1913 from many previous companies that plied the waters 
of the St. Clair River. One of these companies was Northwest Transportation 
Company of Sarnia, which was founded in 1870.[43] By 20 April 1914, when 
the residents passed Act to Incorporate the City of Sarnia, the population 
had grown to 10,985 in six wards.[44] Sarnia officially became a city as 
of 7 May 1914.[30] Sarnia's grain elevator, which is the sixth largest 
currently operating in Canada,[45] was built after the dredging of Sarnia 
Harbour in 1927.[46] Two short years later, grain shipments had become 
an important part of Sarnia's economy.[47] The grain elevator rises above 
the harbour, and next to it is the slip for the numerous bulk carriers 
and other ships that are part of the shipping industry that includes vessels 
from all over the world. The waterway between Detroit and Sarnia is one 
of the world's busiest, as indicated by the average of 78,943,900 tonnes 
(87,020,800 short tons; 77,697,100 long tons) of shipping that annually 
travelled the river going in both directions during the period 1993â€“2002.[48] 
Lake freighters and oceangoing ships, which are known as "salties,"[49] 
pass up and down the river at the rate of about one every seven minutes 
during the shipping season.[50] During this same period, The Paul M. Tellier 
Tunnel, which was named after the retired president of CN in 2004, was 
bored and began operation in 1995. It accommodates double-stacked rail 
cars and is located next to the original tunnel, which has been sealed.[51] 
While there had been a petroleum industry in the Sarnia area since 1858, 
the establishment of Polymer Corporation in 1942 to manufacture synthetic 
rubber during World War II was a great success and began Sarnia's rise 
as a major petrochemical centre.[52] Because of Sarnia's importance in 
this industry, it appeared on a United States Government list of possible 
Soviet targets as part of its Anti-Energy nuclear strike strategy during 
the Cold War.[53] On 1 January 1991, Sarnia and the neighbouring town of 
Clearwater (formerly Sarnia Township) were amalgamated as the new city 
of Sarnia-Clearwater. The amalgamation was originally slated to include 
the village of Point Edward, although that village's residents resisted 
and were eventually permitted to remain independent of the city. On 1 January 
1992, the city reverted to the name Sarnia.[26] Sarnia's population experienced 
a continual growth from 1961 to 1991, with a 1991 population of 74,376. 
In 2001 the population had declined by approximately 3,000. Since 2001 
Sarnia's population has been growing slowly, with a 2011 population count 
of 72,366.[54][55] Despite these gains, an April 2010 report "Sarnia-Lambton's 
Labour Market" states: "Large petrochemical companies are the community's 
main economic drivers. Over the recent past, several plants have shutdown,[sic] 
and of those still in operation, increased automation and outsourcing has 
led to significantly fewer workers."[56] These shutdowns and the resulting 
loss of jobs, and therefore population as workers search for employment 
elsewhere, will contribute to a general decline shown by one August 2011 
study, which shows that the population will decline by 17% over the next 
twenty-five years.[57] The Monteith-Brown study cited outlines a plan for 
restructuring the city based on hybrid zoning areas, which will bring work 
opportunities closer to the neighborhoods where people live. The City of 
Sarnia and Lambton County are also implementing an economic development 
plan with an emphasis on bio-industries and renewable energy.[58] Sarnia 
is located on the eastern shore of Lake Huron at its extreme southern point 
where it flows into the St. Clair River. Most of the surrounding area is 
flat, and the elevation ranges from 169 metres (554Â ft) and 281 metres 
(922Â ft) above sea level.[61] The soil mostly comprises clay.[62] Despite 
this high percentage of clay, the soil is remarkably rich for cultivation. 
Prior to the Ice Age, glaciers covered most of the area, as can be seen 
not only by the existence of the Great Lakes themselves but also of alluvial 
sand deposits, terminal moraines, and rich oil reserves. The entire area 
was submerged and plant and animal matter formed many layers of sediment 
as they settled after the waters receded.[63] Sarnia is not part of the 
Canadian Shield and is located just beyond its southernmost reaches, 290 
kilometres (180Â mi) west of Toronto and 106 kilometres (66Â mi) north of 
Detroit.[64] Wiltshire Park, Woodland, Oak Acres, Wees Beach, Oakwood Corners, 
Woodrow Shores, and Blackwell, are part of the North End of Sarnia, which 
begins immediately north of Ontario Highway 402 and terminates at the shore 
of Lake Huron. Coronation Park, Heritage Park, College Park, The Tree Streets, 
and Sherwood Village are some of the neighbourhoods south of the highway. 
[65] The village of Blue Water was built to house workers and their families 
in Chemical Valley during the construction of Polymer Corporation and at 
one point had nearly 3,000 residents. In 1961, all the residents were relocated, 
mostly to the North End, to make way for expansion of the chemical industry. 
The village was demolished, and all that remains now is an historical marker 
at the corner of Vidal Street and Huron Avenue. This neighbourhood was 
largely forgotten until historian Lorraine Williams penned two books about 
it and was instrumental in the dedication of the plaque.[66] [67] Sarnia 
has a humid continental climate (KÃ¶ppen climate classification Dfb).[68] 
Winters are cold with a few short-lasting Arctic air masses that dip far 
enough south and bring with them daily high temperatures lower than âˆ’10Â Â°C 
(14Â Â°F).[3] Sarnia, while not quite located in the southwestern Ontario 
snowbelt, sometimes receives large quantities of lake-effect snow. Sarnia 
averages 112.0Â cm (44.1Â in) of snow per year, while London averages 194.3Â cm 
(76.5Â in). The lake creates a seasonal lag, and compared to the rest of 
Canada and inland Ontario, Sarnia has a noticeably longer warm period following 
summer.[69] However, cooler temperatures tend to prevail for longer after 
winter. Lake Huron can also create large temperature differences within 
the city in spring and early summer, particularly on hot days in late May, 
early June. Finally, extreme temperatures, particularly lows, are rarely 
ever seen. Daily lows less than âˆ’10Â Â°C (14Â Â°F) are seen an average of 30 
days a year, and less than âˆ’20Â Â°C (âˆ’4Â Â°F) two days a year. Summers are 
warm to hot and usually humid. Humidex readings can be very high at times 
from late May to late September. In fact, Sarnia has the second greatest 
number of high humidex days at or above 35Â Â°C (95Â Â°F) (with 23.16 days 
on average per year) and humidex days at or above 30Â Â°C (86Â Â°F) (with 61.20 
days on average per year) in Canada, both after Windsor, Ontario.[70] Thunderstorms 
can become quite severe from April to September.[71] Destructive weather 
is very rare in the area but has occurred, such as the tornado event of 
1953. In the 2011 Census, the City of Sarnia had a population of 72,366, 
an increase of 1.3% from the 2006 Census. With a land area of 164.71Â km2 
(63.59Â sqÂ mi), it had a population density of 439.354/km2 (1,137.92/sqÂ mi) 
in 2011.[88] In 2011, Sarnia had an overwhelmingly white population; only 
7000461000000000000â™ 4.61% were visible minorities, and 7000393000000000000â™ 3.93% 
were Aboriginal.[89] In 2011, 7001893100000000000â™ 89.31% of Sarnians called 
English their mother tongue, 7000246000000000000â™ 2.46% listed French, 6999870000000000000â™ 0.87% 
stated both of those languages, and 7000737000000000000â™ 7.37% said another 
language was their mother tongue.[90] The median age in Sarnia is 44.5 
which is older than the Canadian median of 40.95,[91] indicative of Sarnia's 
aging population.[92] According to the 2011 Census, Sarnia is predominately 
Christian as 7001284600000000000â™ 28.46% of the population were Catholic, 
7001124000000000000â™ 12.4% were members of the United Church of Canada, 
7000730000000000000â™ 7.3% were Anglican, and 7001200609999900000â™ 20.06% 
were of other Christian faiths, Muslim, or Jewish; 7001283800000000000â™ 28.38% 
professed no religious preference or were atheists.[93] The median income 
counting all persons 15 years old or older in Sarnia in 2010 was $29,196, 
while median family income was $76,523, both of which were slightly lower 
than average for Ontario, at $30,526 and $80,987, respectively.[94] The 
cost of living in Sarnia, however, is significantly lower than it is in 
Ontario as a whole. The median value of a dwelling, for instance, is $179,266, 
compared to the $300,862 of Ontario as a whole. The Sarnia-Lambton Workforce 
Development Board states in its March 2011 Labour Market Report that: "Even 
though employment in both the petrochemical and agricultural industries 
has declined significantly in recent years, these two industries remain 
central drivers of the Sarnia Lambton economy."[95] When World War II threatened 
tropical sources of natural latex for rubber, Sarnia was selected as the 
site to spearhead development of synthetic petroleum-based rubbers for 
war materials, and Polymer Corporation was built by Dow Chemical at the 
request of the Government of Canada.[96] Large pipelines bring Alberta 
oil to Sarnia, where oil refining and petrochemical production have become 
mainstays of the city's economy.[97] Shell Canada, Imperial Oil, and Suncor 
Energy (Sunoco) operate refineries in Sarnia.[98] Large salt beds found 
under the city became a source of chlorine and other significant ingredients 
which contributed to the success of Chemical Valley.[99] Chemical companies 
operating in Sarnia include NOVA Chemicals, Bayer (Lanxess and H.C. Starck), 
Cabot Corporation and Ethyl Corporation.[100] Dow ceased operations at 
its Sarnia site in 2009. The plant was decommissioned, and the land has 
been sold to neighbouring TransAlta Energy Corporation.[101] TransAlta 
produces power and steam for industry, and is the largest natural gas co-generation 
plant in Canada. It has created the Bluewater Energy Park on the former 
Dow site. Lanxess produces more than 150,000 tonnes (170,000 short tons; 
150,000 long tons) of butyl rubber annually at its Sarnia location, and 
is the sole producer of regulatory-approved, food-grade butyl rubber, used 
in the manufacture of chewing gum.[102] Within the boundaries of its Sarnia 
plant Lanxess has also created the Bio-industrial Park Sarnia.[103] Chemical 
Valley and the surrounding area are home to 62 facilities and refineries.[104] 
These industrial complexes are the heart of Sarnia's infrastructure and 
economy. They directly employ nearly 8,000, and contribute to almost 45,000 
additional jobs in the area.[105] In 1971, the Canadian government deemed 
this area so important to the economic development of the country that 
it printed an image of a Sarnia Oil Refinery on the reverse of the Canadian 
$10 note.[106] The huge industrial area is the cause of significant air 
and water pollution. The Canada Wide Daily Standard for airborne particulate 
matter and ozone pollution, regulation PM2.5, is 30 micrograms per cubic 
metre.[107] Forty-five percent of this particulate air pollution in Sarnia 
comes from Chemical Valley,[108][109][110] and the rest drifts over the 
St. Clair River from the neighbouring United States in the form of what 
is known as "Transboundary Air Pollution."[111] Sarnia is the location 
of Enbridge's Sarnia Photovoltaic Power Plant. The facility went into full 
commercial operation in December 2009, with 20 MW of power. As of September 
2010, the plant was the largest photovoltaic (PV) solar power generation 
facility in the world, putting out 97 MW.[112] The 80-acre Western University 
Research Park, Sarnia-Lambton Campus was established in 2003 by the University 
of Western Ontario as a joint initiative with the County of Lambton and 
the City of Sarnia.[113] The park is also the location of the Bioindustrial 
Innovation Centre, Canada's centre for the commercialization of industrial 
biotechnology.[114] In late 2013, BioAmber began construction of a $125 
million plant that will use corn sugar to manufacture succinic acid, a 
chemical used to make plastic, cosmetics, and other products. After construction 
began, the company announced plans to construct a second plant.[115] Solutions4CO2 
is developing a 50,000 square foot demonstration facility at Bluewater 
Energy Park. This company captures waste gas/water streams to process into 
value-added co-products, pharmaceutical drugs, and biofuels.[116] PlantForm 
Corporation, a Canadian biotech startup company producing ultra-low-cost 
therapeutic antibody drugs, opened an office at the Western University 
Research Park in 2011.[117] At the same Park, from summer 2012 to summer 
2016, KmX Corporation operated a pilot plant to produce membranes that 
filter wastewater from industrial processes. KmX production in Sarnia has 
since moved to Ottawa and Edmonton.[118] Sarnia has two large malls: Lambton 
Mall with 72 stores, and the Bayside Centre with 9 stores, and several 
government and medical services.[119][120] These large malls combine with 
several smaller shopping centres, discount stores, dollar stores, convenience 
stores, and a collection of antique and specialty stores to form the crux 
of Sarnia's retail business.[121][122] Travellers can choose from eight 
branded and many family-owned hotels and motels.[123] The Blue Water Bridge 
links Sarnia and its neighbouring village of Point Edward to the city of 
Port Huron in the United States. It spans the St. Clair River, which connects 
Lake Huron to Lake St. Clair. The bridge's original three-lane span, opened 
in 1938, was twinned on 22 July 1997,[124] making the bridge the fourth 
busiest border crossing in Ontario.[125] The Blue Water Bridge border crossing 
makes use of both the NEXUS (frequent traveler program) and the Free and 
Secure Trade (FAST) program. Linking Highway 402 with the American Interstate 
94 (I-94) and I-69, the bridge forms part of the NAFTA Superhighway, and 
is one of the most important gateways on the northâ€“south truck routes.[126] 
Public transportation within the City of Sarnia, including conventional 
bus transit, transportation of people with disabilities, transportation 
support for major events, and charter services, is provided by Sarnia Transit.[127][128] 
From the city's local airport, Sarnia Chris Hadfield Airport, Air Georgian 
operates services to and from Toronto Pearson International Airport on 
behalf of Air Canada Express.[129] For rail travel, Sarnia is one of the 
two western termini, along with Windsor, of the Via Rail Quebec City â€“ 
Windsor Corridor, over which a service departs Sarnia station in the morning 
and arrives in the evening.[130] Sarnia is served by Bluewater Health, 
a hospital with 188 acute care beds, 70 complex continuing care beds and 
27 rehabilitation beds.[131] The hospital opened in 2010, following the 
amalgamation of several smaller facilities.[132][133] Bluewater Health 
was recently recognized by Healthcare Insurance Reciprocal of Canada, one 
of the country's largest hospital insurers, for its continued improvement 
in patient safety and care quality.[134] Sarnia's musical and theatrical 
presence in Southern Ontario is significant.[17] The International Symphony 
Orchestra plays at the Imperial Theatre for an annual season lasting from 
September to April. In addition to symphonic concerts, the Imperial Theatre 
offers year-round dramatic productions;[135] Michael Learned played the 
lead in Driving Miss Daisy at the theatre in 2010.[19] Former Max Webster 
frontman Kim Mitchell has returned to his hometown on occasion to play 
a concert, including his visit in 2008 for Sarnia's popular Ribfest, a 
competition where local amateur chefs share their recipes for barbecued 
ribs and compete against each other.[136] Canadian composer and music educator 
Raymond Murray Schafer was born in Sarnia and developed his radical schizophonia 
techniques there.[137][138] Musicians and groups such as Aerosmith, KISS, 
Keith Urban, Jon Bon Jovi and Rascal Flatts have played at Sarnia Bayfest 
in the past.[139][140] The Sarnia Bayfest, which was preceded by the "Festival 
by the Bay," is an annual concert festival that features big-name rock 
and country bands, typically during the second or third weekend of July. 
The year 2013 would have marked the fifteenth anniversary of the annual 
festival, but financial problems caused the event's cancellation. Prior 
to December 2013, organizers stated that it is "not the end" and that they 
planned on coming back on solid financial footing sometime in the future.[20][22][141] 
As of December 2013, however, Bayfest organizers indicated they planned 
on merging with the International Powerboat Festival for a joint event 
in 2015.[23] Besides the single museum in Sarnia proper, six other museums 
in the local area document Sarnia's history, including its legacy as the 
home of the North American Oil Industry.[142] Gallery Lambton offers 12 
annual art exhibitions.[143] In 2012 the Judith and Norman Alex Art Gallery 
opened. It is an international Category A art gallery,[144] featuring exhibitions 
of Canadian art history, including paintings from the Group of Seven.[145] 
During the Christmas season, the city of Sarnia presents the annual "Celebration 
of Lights" in Centennial Park. The event was created in 1984 by Dr. Wills 
Rawana and a committee funded by the retail chain Hudson's Bay, and the 
national telecommunications company Telus.[146] From modest beginnings 
the event has garnered numerous awards as it has grown, including second 
place in the 2002 Canadian Government's Canada WinterLights competition.[147] 
The Celebration, was incorporated in its national prizewinning year and 
is now run by a voluntary Board of Directors.[148] There are over 100 parks 
in Sarnia,[149] the largest being Canatara Park, which covers over 200 
acres along the shore of Lake Huron.[149] Canatara is an Ojibwe word that 
means Blue Water. The park was opened 24 May 1933.[150] Within the park 
is Lake Chipican, a haven for 280 different species of birds on their migration 
routes.[150] The park also maintains a Children's Animal Farm as part of 
Sarnia's commitment to wildlife.[150] The annual "Christmas on the Farm" 
weekend event held at the Farm in early December is a popular community 
event enjoyed by families.[151] Canatara Park is one of the first parks 
in southern Ontario to feature an outdoor fitness equipment installation.[152] 
The largest recreational park in Sarnia is Germain Park, which incorporates 
five baseball diamonds, four soccer fields, an outdoor pool, and the Community 
Gardens.[149] As a memorial to Canadian aviators who gave their lives in 
World War II, one of the remaining Canadair Sabres in Canada is on display 
in the park.[153][154] Centennial Park was opened on Dominion Day in 1967, 
as part of Canada's centenary celebrations.[155] The City of Sarnia decided 
in 2013 to close much of Centennial Park, after the discovery of toxic 
lead and asbestos in the soil.[156] Sarnia has one remaining museum within 
its city limits, "Stones 'N Bones", which houses over 6,000 exhibits. The 
collection includes rocks, artifacts, fossils, and bones from all over 
the world.[157] A previous museum, the Discovery House Museum, has been 
converted into a hospice. This historic house, built between 1869 and 1875, 
is recognized as a testament to Victorian Era construction.[158] The city's 
sandy fresh water beaches are a popular tourist attraction, while the sheltered 
harbour houses marinas for recreational sailing. Since 1925, the 400Â km 
(250Â mi) Mackinac race from Sarnia/Port Huron to Mackinac Island at the 
north end of the lake has been the highlight of the sailing season, drawing 
more than 3,000 sailors each year.[159] Sarnia's fresh-cut fries are another 
popular tourist attraction, and thousands of visitors annually visit the 
chip trucks parked under the Blue Water Bridge. Niagara-based cookbook 
author and food e-magazine publisher Lynn Ogryzlo visited the chip trucks 
in August 2012 and stated "I was blown away by Sarnia," not only by the 
city's waterfront, where the chip trucks are located, but also by the chip 
trucks themselves.[160] She also published an article in her e-magazine, 
The Ontario Table, recognizing the outstanding quality of the fresh-cut 
fries.[161] Guelph-based travel writer Pat Brennan also recognized the 
quality of Sarnia's fries in his 2007 piece "Sarnia Boasts Best Fries in 
the World."[162] In 2012, Sarnia officials even created a special detour 
to reach the chip trucks during a period of construction.[163] Realizing 
the popularity of Sarnia's chip trucks, the Ontario Medical Association
