Green, orange           The Troy Trojans were a Major League Baseball team 
in the National League for four seasons from 1879 to 1882. Their home games 
were played at Putnam Grounds (1879) and Haymakers' Grounds (1880-1881) 
in the upstate New York city of Troy, and at Troy Ball Clubs Grounds (1882) 
across the Hudson in Watervliet, or "West Troy" as it was known at the 
time. Overall, the franchise won 131 games and lost 194. The Trojans, along 
with Worcester's unnamed NL team, were expelled from the league shortly 
before the end of the 1882 season, as Troy and Worcester were seen as too 
small for the league's ambitions, but were encouraged to play out the rest 
of their seasons as lame duck teams. On September 28, 1882, only 6 fans 
appeared to watch Worcester host the Trojans in the second-to-last game 
of the season, then only 25 arrived for the last game between the two teams. 
Among games that have had at least one paying attendee, the attendance 
figure of 6 is the lowest attendance ever recorded at a Major League baseball 
game.[1] In 1883 the New York Gothams, later becoming the New York and 
San Francisco Giants, took the Trojans' former slot in the National League. 
Four of the original Gotham players were former members of the disbanded 
Trojans, including three Hall of Famers, Buck Ewing, Roger Connor and Mickey 
Welch. A previous team named the Union Base Ball Club Lansingburgh was 
organized in 1860, the successor to the Victories of Troy, and was a member 
of the National Association of Base Ball Players. That team was given the 
nickname Haymakers by a defeated New York City team.[2] Notable players 
for the Trojans included Hall of Famers Dan Brouthers, Connor, Ewing, Tim 
Keefe, and Welch. Another Troy Trojans minor league team would continue
