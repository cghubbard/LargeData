WXYT-FM (97.1 MHz) — branded 97-1 The Ticket — is a commercial FM radio 
station licensed to Detroit and serving the Metro Detroit, Michigan media 
market. WXYT-FM is owned by CBS Radio and broadcasts a sports radio format. 
Most programming is local with CBS Sports Radio supplying overnight and 
some weekend shows. (Sister station WXYT 1270 AM carries the CBS Sports 
Radio Network around the clock.) WXYT-FM's studios and transmitter are 
located in suburban Southfield, off Lincoln Drive.[1] It transmits its 
signal from an antenna 891 feet (272 m) height above average terrain with 
an effective radiated power of 15,000 watts. WXYT-FM is the flagship station 
of the Detroit Red Wings hockey team[2] and Detroit Tigers baseball team[3] 
WXYT-FM broadcasts three channels in the HD Radio format, with its second 
and third subchannels simulcasting sister stations WWJ Newsradio 950 and 
WXYT 1270 respectively.[4] 97.1 FM began broadcasting as an experimental 
Apex band station called W8XWJ in 1936. In 1940, the station ceased broadcasting 
while owner Evening News Association (parent company of WWJ 950 and The 
Detroit News) waited for the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to 
approve its move to the newly created FM band. Approval came in late October 
1940 and on May 10, 1941 the station (now renamed W45D) signed on at 44.5 MHz 
with 3,000 watts of power, becoming the first FM radio station in Michigan 
and the seventh in the United States. When the FCC created the new 88-108 MHz 
broadcast band, W45D was moved to 96.9 as WENA in September 1945. By 1948, 
the station had settled on its present 97.1 home as WWJ-FM, originally 
simulcasting WWJ. In the 1960s and 1970s, WWJ-FM was one of several stations 
competing for Detroit's beautiful music audience, along with 95.5 WLDM 
and 96.3 WJR-FM. In November 1981, WWJ-FM changed its call letters to WJOI, 
which helped it distinguish itself more from its AM all-news sister station. 
WJOI's format remained beautiful music, although the station changed syndicators 
from the "FM 100 Plan" (distributed by Chicago's successful beautiful music 
station WLOO) to the Bonneville and later Schulke packages. 96.3 WJR-FM's 
change to "Hot Hits" WHYT in September 1982 left WJOI (nicknamed "Joy 97") 
as Detroit's only beautiful music stationr. (The other easy-listening stations 
WNIC, WOMC and WCZY all evolved to soft adult contemporary formats by that 
time). As a result, WJOI enjoyed consistent top ten or top five showings 
in the Arbitron ratings through most of the rest of the 1980s, and even 
reached #1 12+ in the Arbitron results in the spring 1984 book (1), topping 
WJR, at a time when the beautiful music format had nearly disappeared in 
other markets. However, most of the station's listeners were older than 
the demographics usually courted by advertisers. Thus, in early 1991, the 
station made some adjustments to its format, dropping the syndication and 
going to a staff of live announcers and at the same time adding more soft 
pop and mellow rock vocals to the mix while replacing many of the traditional 
orchestra-based instrumentals with new-age and smooth jazz cuts. The "freshening 
up" of the format, however, did not reverse the station's fortunes, and 
ratings steadily declined. The WJOI call sign is now in use at an AM adult 
standards music station in Norfolk, Virginia. Losing the easy listening 
battle, WJOI became WYST (aka "Star 97") on September 2, 1994, and featured 
a 1970s oldies/classic hits format.[5] WYST positioned itself as "The Greatest 
Hits of the '70s," although the station did branch its playlist out somewhat 
into the late '60s and early '80s. WYST was also Detroit's outlet for syndicated 
morning show host Don Imus. On February 3, 1997, Imus' show moved to AM 
sister WXYT 1270, making room for The Howard Stern Show. WYST switched 
its format to Active Rock, as "97ROCK" (later taking the call letters WKRK 
and the on-air identifier "97-1 K-Rock" in June of that year).[6] Competing 
with WRIF (Detroit's other active rock station), "K-Rock" caught the ears 
of fans of harder rock and metal. However, K-Rock's penchant for making 
fun of WRIF, mostly for long stretches between songs, turned off many a 
listener just as quickly. Ratings continued to be less than impressive, 
and on August 31, 1998, WKRK repositioned itself as "Extreme Radio" with 
its format evolving toward Hot Talk.[7] By March 1999, the majority of 
the station's music programming on weekdays was gone and the station soon 
took on the name "97-1: Detroit's FM Talk Station". This was later changed 
to simply "97.1 FM Talk". During this period it carried syndicated talk 
shows such as Loveline, The Tom Leykis Show, and Mancow's Morning Madhouse, 
as well as local shows. WKRK relaunched as "Live 97.1" in May 2003. In 
August 2004, WKRK became the flagship radio station for the Detroit Lions. 
In October 2005, WKRK added the "Free FM" identifier being used by CBS 
Radio on many of its hot-talk properties across the country. Once Howard 
Stern left for Sirius Satellite Radio on January 3, 2006, WKRK began airing 
Rover's Morning Glory in morning drive. Rover continued as the morning 
show until September 2006, when low ratings led to a switch to the syndicated 
Opie and Anthony. On October 1, 2007, at 3 PM, WKRK ended its eight-year 
run as a hot talk station, and flipped to an all-sports format, simulcasting 
with 1270 WXYT, and changing its call letters to WXYT-FM, with the simulcast 
being named "97-1 FM & 1270 AM: Detroit's Sports Powerhouse".[8] Of its 
"Free FM" lineup, Deminski & Doyle were moved to mornings, and Bill McAllister 
remained. On November 6, 2007, the simulcast was renamed "97-1 FM The Ticket." 
The 1270 AM frequency was then only mentioned at the top of the hour. Another 
change was the names of the midday show "The Big Show" and afternoon show 
"The Sports Inferno". Both of the shows names were dropped, with both being 
renamed to "Karsch & Anderson", and "Valenti & Foster", respectively. A 
few months later, after Deminski & Doyle left for WCSX, current morning 
show "Motor City Mornings" was renamed "Jay Towers & Bill McAllister Mornings". 
This was all done to "promote the personalities." Jay Towers left WXYT 
in December 2009, and the show then renamed "The Morning Show" with Bill, 
Sara and Mike "Stoney" Stone filling in. In November 2010, the morning 
show was renamed "Stoney & Bill". On February 5, 2009, WXYT acquired the 
rights to become the Detroit Pistons flagship station starting in the 2009-2010 
season. WWJ 950 AM covered Pistons games when they conflicted with The 
Ticket's coverage of Lions, Tigers, or Red Wings games. [9] 1270 AM also 
provided, and continues to provide, coverage of Tigers or Red Wings game 
in case of conflicting schedules. The Lions and The Ticket renewed their 
partnership for three more seasons on October 9, 2009.[10] On July 23, 
2010, WXYT-FM extended its broadcast agreements with the Tigers and Red 
Wings for multiple years.[11] In 2013, all CBS owned radio stations in 
Detroit moved their operations in Southfield, MI to the recently vacated 
Panasonic Building.[12] On November 20, 2015, it was announced that the 
Detroit Lions would move to WJR beginning in the 2016 NFL season, ending 
the team's 20-year relationship with CBS Radio. Officials stated that CBS 
had dropped the Lions over demands that it censor on-air content that was 
critical of the team. In particular, the Lions specifically demanded that 
the station fire popular on-air personality Mike Valenti as a condition 
of any extension to its broadcast rights; Valenti has had a history of 
making remarks critical of the Lions and their poor performance.[13][14]
