Catholic church building located at 1007 Superior Avenue in Cleveland, 
Ohio, in the United States. Completed and consecrated in 1852, it is the 
cathedral of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Cleveland. Numerous renovations 
have changed some aspects of the cathedral, but it remains essentially 
the same since its construction. Large numbers of Catholics started to 
arrive in the Western Reserve region of Ohio in the 1830s and were served 
by visiting priests sent north by the Archdiocese of Cincinnati. A small 
group of Irish settlers established St. Mary's of the Flats in 1826. The 
congregation met in several locations before beginning construction on 
its own sanctuary in 1837.[1] When Pope Pius IX established the Diocese 
of Cleveland in 1847, he named Louis Amadeus Rappe as its first bishop. 
Bishop Rappe established St. John's Cathedral on Superior Street and Erie 
Street (today's East 9th Street) on land purchased in 1845 by St. Mary's 
pastor Rev. Peter McLaughlin. He selected architect Patrick Keely, who 
designed the building in an ornamental gothic style and the Bishop laid 
the cornerstone October 22, 1848.[2] Until the new building was completed 
in 1852, St. Mary's served as cathedral for the diocese.[1] At the time 
of its completion, the new cathedral was the well beyond Cleveland's Public 
Square. Alterations and additions began on the church almost as soon as 
the initial construction was complete. In 1857, a boys' school was added 
and within ten years, it was joined by a parish hall and girls' school. 
In 1879, the parish raised sufficient funds to complete interior and exterior 
decoration and add a spire. To fund the initial construction, Bishop Rappe 
was forced to seek donations from sources as far away as New York City 
and France.[2] In 1884, the church interior was redecorated and stained 
glass windows were added along with walnut furninshings in the sanctuary 
and the windows were replaced again in 1902 with art glass windows from 
Munich.[2] On August 20, 1920, the cathedral was the site of the funeral 
for famed baseball player Ray Chapman. Thousands gathered inside and around 
the cathedral for one of the largest funerals in the history of Cleveland.[3] 
Chapman was a popular player that only days before was killed when hit 
in the head by a pitched baseball. He remains the only player to have been 
fatally injured during a Major League baseball game.[4] In 1943, Archbishop 
Joseph Schrembs announced a plan to renovate the Cathedral, but due to 
World War II the plan did not move forward until 1945. After World War 
II, Schremb's successor, Edward Francis Hoban continued Schrembs' plan. 
Construction began in 1946 when the old cathedral was enlarged and the 
brick exterior refaced in orange Tennessee Crabtree limestone, in an ashlar 
pattern. The architectural firm of Stickle, Kelly and Stickle oversaw construction 
which also included a new bell tower and interior decoration. However, 
the tower held no bells until 1988. John W. Winterich and Associates supervised 
creation of a new reredos and other interior decoration. The new cathedral 
contained several new chapels including The Resurrection Chapel, which 
holds the tombs of former bishops, and the relics of St. Christine, which 
Pope Pius XI presented to Archbishop Scrembs in 1928. The 4368 pipe/72 
rank organ constructed by the Holtkamp Organ Company of Cleveland that 
was installed during the renovation still serves the church today. The 
organ may be operated from a console in the loft of another behind the 
cathedra.[5] On September 4, 1948, Archbishop Hoban with Cardinal Francis 
Spellman of New York City celebrated a Mass to mark the renovation of St. 
John's Cathedral. The renovation added a structure to house St. John's 
College. St. John's later merged with Ursuline College and the building 
was demolished to construct the Eaton Center in 1981. In 1964, St. John's 
added a dormitory tower which was later remodeled to house Diocesan offices. 
In 2007, the Diocese relocated its offices and this was demolished to create 
a parking lot for the burgeoning Avenue District around St. Clair Avenue 
and East 12th Street. A parking garage was built nearby to accommodate 
parishioners. In 1977, Bishop James Hickey carried out additional renovations 
due to Vatican II reforms. The altar was moved west from the apse to its 
current location in the crossing. This is approximately where the altar 
of the original cathedral stood.[2] Parishioners raised funds in 1988 to 
install bells in the tower that was added during the 1946-48 renovation. 
The six bells range from 375 lb (170 kg) to 3,300 lb (1,500 kg) and are 
named for saints and blesseds who played a role in US history. The bells 
first rang to celebrate the Christmas Masses in 1988.[5] In 1996, Cleveland's 
Italian American community provided funds to renovate the sacristy in celebration 
of Bishop Anthony Pilla's election as President of the United States Conference 
of Catholic Bishops in 1995. In 1997, the Diocese celebrated its 150th 
anniversary. That year ABC-TV produced a special on celebrating Christ's 
splendor at the cathedral. Bishop Pilla dedicated a Holy Door in 2000 as 
part of the Holy Year proclaimed by Pope John Paul II. In 2002, the cathedral 
renovated its flagpole and rededicated it on September 11, 2002, one year 
after the September 11, 2001 attacks. In 2006, Bishop Pilla retired and 
Pope Benedict XVI named Bishop Richard Lennon of Boston as 10th Bishop
