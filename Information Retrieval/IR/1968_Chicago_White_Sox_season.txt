The 1968 Chicago White Sox season was the team's 68th season in the major 
leagues, and its 69th season overall. They finished with a record 67–95, 
good enough for eighth place in the American League, 36 games behind the 
first-place Detroit Tigers. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] To 
demonstrate there still was support for big-league ball in Milwaukee, Bud 
Selig's group contracted with Chicago White Sox owner Arthur Allyn to host 
nine White Sox home games at Milwaukee County Stadium in 1968. A 1967 exhibition 
game between the White Sox and Minnesota Twins had attracted more than 
51,000 spectators, and Selig was convinced the strong Milwaukee fan base 
would demonstrate the city would provide a good home for a new club. The 
experiment was staggeringly successful – those nine games drew 264,297 
fans. In Chicago that season, the Sox drew 539,478 fans to their remaining 
58 home games. In just a handful of games, the Milwaukee crowds accounted 
for nearly one-third of the total attendance at White Sox games. In light 
of this success, Selig and Allyn agreed County Stadium would host Sox home 
games again the next season. Infielders Coaches Note: G = Games played;
