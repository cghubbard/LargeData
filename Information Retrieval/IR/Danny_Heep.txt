Heep (born July 3, 1957), is a retired Major League Baseball outfielder. 
Heep played for five different ballclubs during his 13-year career: the 
Houston Astros (1979–1982), New York Mets (1983–1986), Los Angeles Dodgers 
(1987–1988), Boston Red Sox (1989–1990), and Atlanta Braves (1991). Heep 
played for two different World Series champions: the New York Mets in 1986, 
and the Los Angeles Dodgers in 1988. Heep played baseball for, and graduated 
from, Lee High School in San Antonio. Heep played for St. Mary's University 
in San Antonio where he was twice an All-American, in 1976 and 1978, as 
a pitcher. At St. Mary's he earned his bachelor's degree in physical education, 
and he is a member of that school's Athletic Hall of Fame. Originally drafted 
by the Houston Astros in the 1979 Major League Baseball Draft, he would 
compile a .331 batting average, 23 home runs and 108 RBIs in a little over 
a year in the minors to earn his first major league call up. His major 
league debut came on August 31, 1979 against the New York Mets.[1] He would 
remain with the Astros through the end of the season, compiling just a 
.143 average and two runs batted in. The second RBI, however, was a game 
winner against the Los Angeles Dodgers on September 30.[2] He was traded 
to the New York Mets for future Cy Young Award winner Mike Scott. Danny
