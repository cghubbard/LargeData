The 1921 Chicago White Sox season involved the White Sox attempting to 
win the American League pennant. However, with the core of the team banned 
after the Black Sox Scandal broke, they fell back to seventh place. Owner 
Charles Comiskey struggled to find replacements for his stars. For example, 
new third baseman Eddie Mulligan had a .623 OPS, lowest among the team's 
regulars and quite a drop from Buck Weaver's .785 in 1920. The pitching 
staff took a much worse beating. Chicago had lost its two best starters 
in Eddie Cicotte and Lefty Williams and could not recover. Red Faber won 
25 games with a league-leading 2.48 ERA. The only other pitcher over .500 
was Dickey Kerr, who indeed allowed more hits and earned runs than anyone 
else in the majors. Number three starter Roy Wilkinson went 4â€“20, and nobody 
else started more than 10 games. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] Infielders
