Daniel Lee "Dan" Jennings (born April 17, 1987) is an American professional 
baseball pitcher for the Chicago White Sox of Major League Baseball (MLB). 
He previously played for the Miami Marlins. He attended the University 
of Nebraska, and is listed as 6'3" and 190 lbs. He bats and throws left 
handed. Though born in Berkeley, California,[1] Jennings was raised in 
West Des Moines, Iowa.[2] There, he attended Valley High School. Playing 
for the schools baseball team,[3] he led the team to back-to-back state 
championships in 2004 and 2005. As a senior in 2005, Jennings pitched to 
a 9–0 win–loss record and 0.85 earned run average (ERA), earning All-State 
honors.[2] Jennings attended the University of Nebraska, where he played 
college baseball for the Cornhuskers. He was drafted by the Marlins in 
the ninth round of the 2008 MLB draft.[2] He made his professional debut 
that season for the Jamestown Jammers of the Class A-Short Season New York–Penn 
League.[1] Across three levels of minor league baseball in 2009, Jennings 
had a combined 1–2 record, six saves, and 2.15 ERA in 45 games overall, 
allowing with 26 walks and while striking out 69 batters in 62⅔ innings 
pitched for the Greensboro Hornets of the Class A South Atlantic League, 
the Jupiter Hammerheads of the Class A-Advanced Florida State League, and 
the Jacksonville Suns of the Class AA Southern League.[1][4] Baseball America 
rated Jennings as the Marlins' fourth best pitching prospect, and 13th 
best overall.[4] Returning to Jacksonville in 2010, Jennings was suspended 
for 50 games for violating minor league baseball's policy banning the use 
of performance-enhancing drugs.[1][2] The Marlins added Jennings to their 
40-man roster after the 2011 season to protect him from the Rule 5 draft. 
Jennings began the 2012 season with the New Orleans Zephyrs of the Class 
AAA Pacific Coast League. In nine appearances, he had a 2.08 ERA.[5] The 
Marlins promoted Jennings to MLB on April 30, 2012, and he pitched a scoreless 
inning in relief in his debut that day.[2] On August 7, 2014, Jennings 
was pitching in relief against the Pittsburgh Pirates when Jordy Mercer 
hit a line drive that accidentally struck Jennings in the head, inflicting 
a concussion in the process. Jennings was kept overnight in a Pittsburgh 
hospital for observations instead of accompanying the Marlins to Cincinnati 
for their next series against the Cincinnati Reds after the game. Jennings 
later thanked Pirates fans on Twitter for their support after the crowd 
at PNC Park gave Jennings a standing ovation when he was carted off the 
field and gave the crowd a thumbs-up.[6] He was traded to the Chicago White 
Sox on December 11, 2014 in exchange for Andre Rienzo.[7] Jennings has 
been confused for the son of Dan Jennings, who was an executive for the 
Marlins when the younger Jennings was pitching for them.[4] His parents, 
Bob and Janet Jennings, live in West Des Moines. Jennings has a brother, 
Tom, who currently works as a tennis professional at the Quad City Tennis 
Club. He is married. Jennings' parents, fiancee, and her parents all flew
