Matthew Thomas "Matt" Holliday (born January 15, 1980) is an American professional 
baseball left fielder who is currently a free agent. He has played in Major 
League Baseball (MLB) for the Colorado Rockies, Oakland Athletics and St. 
Louis Cardinals. A World Series champion in 2011, Holliday, with prodigious 
hitting contributions, has played in seven postseasons and is regarded 
as a key figure of the Rockies' first-ever World Series appearance in 2007 
and Cardinals' playoff success of the 2010s. His distinctions include a 
National League (NL) batting championship, the 2007 NL Championship Series 
Most Valuable Player Award (NLCS MVP), seven All-Star selections, and four 
Silver Slugger Awards. Other career accomplishments include nearly 2,000 
hits and 300 home runs, more than 100 stolen bases while batting over .300. 
The Colorado Rockies selected Holliday in the seventh round of the 1998 
MLB draft from high school in Oklahoma, where he was also a highly touted 
NFL quarterback prospect.[1] He debuted in the major leagues in 2004, becoming 
the Rockies' starting left fielder and a middle of the lineup presence. 
In 2006, he became the 19th player ever to reach 195 hits, 30 home runs, 
45 doubles, 115 runs and 110 RBI in one season. The next season, he won 
his first batting title, September National League Player of the Month 
honors and NLCS MVP[2] as the Rockies won 21 of 22 games at the end of 
the regular season and in the playoffs en route to their first World Series 
appearance.[3] In the first of four consecutive NLCS appearances, he batted 
.435 with a .652 slugging percentage in the 2011 NLCS on his way to winning 
his first World Series ring with the Cardinals. In 2014, he became just 
the fifth player in MLB history to amass nine consecutive seasons of at 
least 20 home runs, 30 doubles, 75 RBI and 80 runs scored each season. 
In addition to his presence as a leader on the field, Holliday is active 
in charity work and assisting his teammates off the field. Thus, the St. 
Louis chapter of the Baseball Writers Association of America has awarded 
him the Darryl Kile Good Guy Award. Because of his hitting abilities and 
strength, he has sometimes been called the "Stillwater Stinger." Matt Holliday 
was born and raised in Stillwater, Oklahoma. With easy athletic skill, 
he showed marked talent in baseball, football and basketball as a youth.[4] 
He was also physically larger than most of his friends, so when they played 
games, they often modified the rules to offset his size advantage. In football, 
Holliday was required to play quarterback for both teams. In baseball, 
every three of his home runs were credited as one.[5] He spent much of 
his free time with his father, Tom Holliday, and brother, Josh, at the 
Oklahoma State University (OSU) baseball field and training complex, where 
his father was a coach. There, the Holliday boys learned about the fundamentals 
of the sport, voluntarily trained and practiced, and watched future major 
leaguers such as Robin Ventura play and develop. In addition, he played 
American Legion Baseball during the summer. In spite of the extensive time 
spent around the sport of baseball, Tom Holliday abstained from attempting 
to influence his sons on which sport or sports to concentrate.[4][6] At 
Stillwater High School, Holliday played both baseball and football. He 
was a quarterback while playing football. As a senior, he earned All-American 
honors in football and baseball and also earned his region's Gatorade Player 
of the Year award in both sports. He also competed for the 1997 USA Junior 
National Team. In his next-to-last football game for Stillwater, he helped 
bring the Pioneers back from a 42–21 deficit against Tulsa Union by throwing 
three touchdowns (TD) in the final six minutes of the game for a 43–42 
score.[7] However, his high school football career ended with a 63–0 loss 
to Jenks in the state semifinal contest. His career passing totals included 
6,211 yards and 68 TD. His 35 TD passes as a junior set a then-11 man state 
record.[7] He garnered so much attention as a National Football League 
(NFL) prospect that former Dallas Cowboys head coach Jimmy Johnson once 
forecasted to Tom Holliday that his son "couldn't miss."[6] He was also 
rated the third-best quarterback prospect in the nation after graduating 
from Stillwater in 1998.[8] Numerous connections throughout college and 
professional baseball span Holliday's family ties. His father, Tom Holliday, 
is the pitching coach for the Tigers of Auburn University, and former baseball 
head coach of OSU.[9] Current Atlanta Braves MLB scout, Dave Holliday, 
is an uncle.[10] His older brother, Josh, is currently the head baseball 
coach at OSU, and a former minor league player in the Toronto Blue Jays 
organization.[11] A cousin, Heath Holliday, has also played baseball as 
a catcher for OSU.[12] With football recruiting overtures from colleges 
and universities all over the country – including OSU – Holliday instead 
chose professional baseball after graduating high school. The Rockies selected 
him in the seventh round of the 1998 Major League Baseball draft as a third 
baseman.[13] Widespread concerns that he would choose football over baseball 
prevented him from being drafted earlier since he had already committed 
to OSU on paper to play football.[6] Thus, Rockies scouting director Pat 
Daugherty signed him for an above-slot $840,000,[14] the most money paid 
to any player in that round.[1] In Holliday's inaugural professional season, 
the Rockies assigned him to their Arizona League affiliate, who finished 
with a 42–14 record and won the league championship. He played 32 games 
and assembled 40 hits (H) in 117 at bats (AB) for a .342 batting average 
(AVG), collected four doubles (2B), a triple (3B), five home runs (HR) 
and 23 runs batted in (RBI); his HR total placed third in the league.[15] 
He played 1999 for the Asheville Tourists, batting .264 with 76 runs scored 
and 16 HR. With the bases loaded, he was 3-for-9 with one grand slam and 
11 RBI. At third base, Holliday turned in an .871 fielding percentage and 
57 putouts (PO).[16] Holliday played for Salem in 2000 and 2001. For the 
2000 season, he totaled 510 plate appearances, successfully collected 126 
hits, 28 doubles, two triples, seven home runs, drove in 72 runs, and batted 
.274 with a .335 OBP and .389 OBP. He spent 112 at third base, was charged 
with 32 errors in 300 total chances for a fielding percentage of .893, 
and turned 13 double plays.[17] In 2001, the Rockies moved Holliday to 
the outfield.[18] He was named the Carolina League Player of the Month 
for June, batting .324 with seven multi-hit games, three 2B, seven HR, 
and 22 RBI. He played 72 games on the season after undergoing elbow surgery 
in July ended his season.[19] The Rockies promoted Holliday to the Carolina 
Mudcats of the AA Southern League (SL) in 2002, where he was named a mid-season 
All-Star. He was named the league's Hitter of the Week on June 27, after 
collecting nine hits in 24 AB with one home run and eight RBI. He won the 
same award on July 18, after scoring seven runs and driving in 10, and 
a career-best six RBI against Birmingham on July 14. Holliday ended the 
season with 128 hits in 463 AB, 10 HR, and 64 RBI, batting .276 with 79 
runs scored and 16 stolen bases.[20] He played for the Mesa Solar Sox of 
the off-season Arizona Fall League (AFL) in 2002 and 2003, batting .316 
with four home runs, 21 RBI and 10 stolen bases in 35 total AFL games.[21] 
Holliday remained at the AA level for the 2003 season as the everyday left 
fielder for the Tulsa Drillers of the Texas League, batting .253, 28 doubles, 
72 RBI, 132 hits, 45 extra-base hits and 206 total bases. His 15 outfield 
assists tied for second in the league. He earned a spot on the USA Baseball 
team in the Olympic Qualifying Tournament in Panama. They were eliminated 
from advancing to the 2004 Summer Olympics.[20] The Rockies assigned Holliday 
to their Triple-A affiliate, the Colorado Springs Sky Sox, at the outset 
of the 2004 season, intending for him to spend much of the season there. 
Injuries to outfielders Preston Wilson and Larry Walker expedited his progress 
to the Major Leagues after just six games with Colorado Springs. He made 
his major league debut in left field on April 16[22] at Busch Memorial 
Stadium against one of his future teams, the St. Louis Cardinals. Holliday 
went hitless in three at-bats.[23] Two days after his debut, Holliday recorded 
his first career hit, a single, and then, RBI against the Cardinals' Woody 
Williams, doubling in Kit Pellow.[24] Holliday's first career home run 
came against José Lima of the Los Angeles Dodgers on April 22. Five days 
later, he, Jeromy Burnitz, and Charles Johnson collaborated for back-to-back-to-back 
home runs against the Florida Marlins, the sixth such occasion in franchise 
history.[22] Holliday's first career multi-HR game came against the Cincinnati 
Reds on May 18. Both home runs came as part of back-to-back HR events with 
Burnitz, making them the first teammates in franchise history to hit back-to-back 
HR twice in the same game, and the first teammate duo to do so since Mike 
Cameron and Bret Boone of the Seattle Mariners in 2002. His first MLB grand 
slam came against the Tampa Bay Devil Rays on June 12, immediately tying 
a game in which the Rockies had faced a 5–1 deficit. For the month of June, 
he hit .357.[22] The Rockies traded Walker to the Cardinals in August, 
clearing more outfield playing opportunities for Holliday.[25] A sprained 
elbow while diving for a ball against the San Diego Padres on September 
12 ended his season. His final batting line included a .290 AVG in 121 
games, with 31 2B, 14 HR, 57 RBI, 48 extra-base hits, .349 OBP, 65 runs 
scored, .488 SLG and 195 total bases. He finished in the top five among 
NL rookies in each of those categories. After the season, Holliday was 
named to both Baseball America's All-Rookie Team and Topps' Major League 
Rookie All-Star Team, and finished fifth in the Rookie of the Year balloting.[22] 
In his second major league season, Holliday became the cleanup hitter behind 
franchise icon Todd Helton in the middle of the 2005 season.[26] After 
119 at bats into the season, Holliday hit his first home run against Noah 
Lowry of the San Francisco Giants on May 17. He hit his second career multi-homer 
game and first with three extra base hits against the Cardinals on June 
2. He was placed on the disabled list (DL) with a right fractured pinky[27] 
and returned to play on July 18.[27] He earned his first NL Player of the 
Week award for July 25 to July 31, after batting .444 with three HR, eight 
RBI, an .852 slugging percentage and a league-leading 12 hits and 23 total 
bases.[28] In September, Holliday led the NL with 32 RBI, setting a Rockies 
record for that month. On September 20 against the Padres, he hit two home 
runs and tied a Rockies' single-game record with eight RBI in a Rockies 
20–1 victory, the highest single-game RBI total in the NL in 2005[29] and 
second-highest in the major leagues.[27] He ended the season with a seven-game 
hitting streak[27] and reached base in each of the Rockies' final 22 games.[30] 
Holliday totaled 125 games and improved in nearly all offensive categories 
from the his rookie year, including 147 hits, 19 home runs, 87 RBI, 68 
runs, 14 stolen bases, 242 total bases, 505 SLG and .361 OBP. His .307 
batting average placed eighth in the NL.[27] The club picked up his option 
for 2006, which was worth $500,000 ($606,832.5 today), or about $100,000 
($121,366.5 today) more than the average for a player with equivalent service 
time.[26] He was selected as the Rockies Player of the Year.[31] Holliday 
was selected to Team USA for the 2006 World Baseball Classic prior to the 
start of the MLB season.[32] Despite batting just .255 through May 1, 2006, 
Holliday accumulated 24 RBI in 25 games.[33] From May 1 until the end of 
the season – a span of 131 games – he collected 169 hits for a .339 batting 
average, the fourth-highest in the major leagues.[33] He batted .404 from 
June 1–27, second in the NL in that period.[34] An All-Star selection to 
the game at PNC Park in Pittsburgh for the first time in his career, Holliday 
was hitting .339 with 16 home runs and 56 RBI at the time of his selection.[35] 
In the game, Holliday played right field for the first time as a major 
leaguer.[33] On September 19, 2006, Holliday hit the longest home run of 
2006 in MLB against Matt Cain of the Giants. While the official distance 
was 443 feet (135 m), HitTracker estimated it at 496 feet (151 m).[36] 
His grand slam and triple five days later against the Braves assisted the 
Rockies' comeback from a 7–0 deficit to a 9–8 final victory.[37] He garnered 
his second NL Player of the Week for the week ending September 24, after 
hitting four homers, three doubles and a triple, helping propel the Rockies 
to win five of seven games.[38] In 155 total games, Holliday batted .326 
with 196 hits, 45 doubles, 34 home runs, 114 RBIs, 119 runs, 10 stolen 
bases, 353 total bases, .586 slugging percentage, and .387 on-base percentage. 
He became just the 19th player ever to meet or exceed 195 hits, 30 home 
runs, 45 doubles, 115 runs and 110 RBI in one season. He finished in the 
top five of the National League in batting average, hits, runs, extra base 
hits, total bases and slugging percentage. After the season, received his 
first Silver Slugger Award as an outfielder.[33] Continuing to evolve as 
a hitter, Holliday started the 2007 season as in the Rockies' lineup as 
the number five hitter, but changed to the third slot for the final five 
months of the season. He fashioned a new career-high 14-game hitting streak 
that spanned from April 17 to May 1.[39] His two outfield assists on April 
21 against San Diego in the sixth inning tied a club record for outfield 
assists in one inning.[40] In the April 29 contest against the Braves, 
Holliday hit his first career walk-off home run in the bottom of the 11th 
off Bob Wickman to provide a 9–7 victory.[41] From May 22 to June 7, he 
established a new career-high 15 game hitting streak.[42] In 87 first half 
games, Holliday totaled 30 doubles, 15 HR, 69 RBI, 122 hits, a .341 average 
and .573 SLG.[39] NL players and coaches selected him in with 725 votes 
to play in the All-Star Game at AT&T Park in San Francisco for the second 
straight season. He also participated in the Home Run Derby.[43] Holliday 
hit .361 (86-for-238) in the final 60 games of the season.[43] For the 
week ending July 29, he earned National League Player of the Week honors 
as the Rockies won four of the six games, batting .364 with a .481 OBP 
and four home runs, two doubles and 10 RBI.[44] From August 10 to 27, he 
strung together another new career-best 17-game hitting streak.[43][45] 
In reaching base safely each game from July 22 to August 31 against the 
Diamondbacks, Holliday's feat of 36 consecutive games eclipsed a Rockies 
record which Helton and Walker previously shared,[46] eventually ending 
at 38.[43] Holliday gained his second NL Player of the Week selection of 
the season and fourth of his career on September 16, after hitting six 
home runs, driving in 11, batting .407 with a .500 on-base percentage, 
and leading the NL each with a 1.148 slugging percentage, 11 runs scored 
and 31 total bases.[47] In a 12-game span from September 9–20, he hit 11 
home runs;[48] only Alex Rodríguez matched that feat in 2007. One of the 
home runs was the 100th of his career and his 200th hit of the season, 
occurring on September 19 in a 9–8 victory over the Dodgers.[49] His September 
totals included a .367 batting average, 29 R, six doubles, 12 HR, 30 RBI, 
and .796 slugging percentage, prompting MLB to award him NL Player of the 
Month honors[50] as the Rockies won 13 of their 14 final scheduled games.[51] 
He garnered copious attention for the Most Valuable Player (MVP) award 
throughout the season, which increased even more that September.[47][52][53] 
The Rockies and Padres finished the scheduled portion of their regular 
seasons tied for the NL wild card position with identical 89–73 records, 
for which MLB declared a one-game extension to the regular season to determine 
the wild-card winner.[54] Holliday's triple in the bottom of the 13th inning 
off Padres closer Trevor Hoffman scored Troy Tulowitzki as the tying run.[55] 
Holliday scored the winning run on Jamey Carroll's sacrifice fly in a bloody 
collision with catcher Michael Barrett, although controversy arose as to 
whether he touched home plate. Thus, the Rockies entered the playoffs for 
the first time in Holliday's career.[56][57] After hitting a career-best 
.340, Holliday won his first batting title.[58] He played in 158 games 
and posted career-highs as the National League leader in hits (216), doubles 
(50), RBI (137), extra base hits (92) and total bases (386). Additionally, 
he placed third in each of runs scored (120), slugging percentage (.607) 
and OPS (1.012), and fourth in HR (36) and adjusted OPS+ (150). The 63 
walks were a new career-high[59] at the time. He became just the fifth 
National Leaguer in the previous 59 years to lead the NL in both batting 
average and RBI,[60] and only the 13th major league player in the previous 
45 years with at least 200 hits and 50 doubles.[61] In the National League 
Division Series (NLDS) against the Phillies, Holliday homered twice as 
the Rockies swept.[62][63][64][65] Colorado then advanced to the National 
League Championship Series (NLCS) to face the Diamondbacks and swept them 
in four games. Holliday batted .333 with two home runs and four RBI on 
his way to being named the NLCS MVP.[3] Now having won 21 of 22 games,[66] 
the Rockies earned their first-ever trip to the World Series[3][67] where 
they opposed the Boston Red Sox. Holliday collected four hits in Game 2,[68] 
but, after his fourth hit in the eighth inning with the Red Sox leading 
2–1, closer Jonathan Papelbon immediately picked him off first base for 
the third out,[68] and the Red Sox won by that same score. Boston eventually 
won the title by sweeping the Rockies, thus ending their season on a four-game 
losing streak.[69][70] Following the season, Holliday placed second in 
the MVP voting with 336 points to Phillies shortstop Jimmy Rollins with 
363,[2] in what was the closest result for the NL MVP since Atlanta Braves 
third baseman Terry Pendleton edged Pittsburgh Pirates left fielder Barry 
Bonds by 15 points in 1991.[71] Holliday was selected as the Rockies' Player 
of the Year for the second time[31] and The Sporting News named him to 
their All-Star team.[43] On December 14, Stillwater High School retired 
Holliday's high school jersey number 24. Businesses in Stillwater were 
asked to honor him that day by posting a "Welcome Home Matt Holliday" message 
on a marquee or window. The city counsel voted to change the name of the 
baseball field from Babcock Park to Matt Holliday Field and name the day 
"Matt Holliday, Stillwater's Major League Baseball Hero Day." Then-Oklahoma 
Governor Brad Henry also declared the day "Matt Holliday Day" throughout 
the state.[72] On January 18, 2008, Holliday signed a two-year, $23 million 
contract with the Rockies, covering his final two years of arbitration.[74] 
The Rockies also offered a four-year, $72 million extension, with a club 
option for a fifth year at $12 million. The team viewed the contract extension 
with the two years covering arbitration as a singular deal worth approximately 
$107 million. In contrast, Holliday and his agent, Scott Boras, regarded 
the extension as an $84-million free agent contract undervalued compared 
to similar players. Therefore, negotiations stalled in spring training.[75] 
Holliday collected three hits[76] and hit the go-ahead home run in the 
eighth inning against the Braves on April 7, giving the Rockies a 2–1 win.[77] 
In a three-game sweep of Atlanta, he hit .462 (6-for-13), with a double, 
triple and home run, and six RBI. He earned the NL Player of the Week award 
for the period ending April 13 as the Rockies won four of six. Holliday 
led the NL with a .480 batting average and 10 RBI, while homering twice 
with an .880 slugging percentage and .519 on-base percentage.[78] He hit 
the game-tying home run against New York Mets closer Billy Wagner in the 
bottom of the ninth inning on May 23, then the game-winning single off 
Aaron Heilman in the bottom of the 13th to drive in Jonathan Herrera.[79] 
Two days later, the Rockies placed Holliday on the 15-day DL due to a strained 
left hamstring,[80] and reactivated him on June 10.[81] The Rockies posted 
the largest comeback in team history in a nine-run deficit on July 4 against 
the Florida Marlins. After the Marlins led 13–4, Holliday provided two 
home runs, including a grand slam to reduce the Marlins' lead to 17–16 
in an eventual 18–17 win.[82] On July 6, Holliday was named a reserve outfielder 
for National League in the All-Star Game for the third consecutive year.[83][84] 
He replaced Chicago Cubs outfielder Alfonso Soriano, who did not play due 
to injury, as the starter in right field,[85] and hit a solo home run in 
the top of the fifth inning.[86] For the month of July, he batted .370 
with eight home runs and 24 RBI, .660 SLG and 24 runs scored in 27 games.[87] 
Holliday's August totals included 11 stolen bases and 30 runs scored in 
28 games, six home runs, nine doubles and a .392 OBP.[87] In 139 total 
games, he batted .321 with 173 hits, 25 home runs, 88 RBI, 107 runs, and 
290 total bases. He led the club with 28 stolen bases while posting a .409 
OBP, both career highs, and won his third consecutive Silver Slugger Award.[88] 
Defensively, Holliday was first in ultimate zone rating (.900), fourth 
in fielding percentage (.991), fifth in total chances (252) and fifth in 
putouts (240) among all MLB left fielders. His total chances and putouts 
came in approximately 100 fewer innings than those players ahead of him.[89] 
Unable to agree to an extension, the Rockies traded Holliday on November 
12, 2008, to the Oakland Athletics for pitchers Huston Street and Greg 
Smith, and outfielder Carlos González.[90] Holliday began working with 
former A's and Cardinals first baseman Mark McGwire as a personal hitting 
coach during the 2008–09 off-season,[91] who became the Cardinals' official 
hitting coach the following off-season.[92] After spending most of the 
off-season on the trade market with the Rockies, Holliday was again a frequent 
subject of rumors during the spring. The Athletics failed to get off to 
a strong start[93] and it was unlikely the club would have been able to 
re-sign him over the course of the season or if he would have had become 
a free agent following the season.[94] He also got off a slow start as 
minor injuries hampered him while playing in Oakland.[95] His first home 
run of the season came on the last day of April against the Texas Rangers.[96] 
He batted .240 in April,[97] and, from May 11 until the St. Louis Cardinals 
acquired him, improved to .316, .420 OBP and .489 SLG over 65 games.[98] 
Reaching base five times in May 17 loss to the Detroit Tigers at Comerica 
Park, he scored his first four-hit game and stolen base of the season.[99] 
The A's defeated the Minnesota Twins 14–13 on July 20 following a 10-run 
comeback, the largest in team history. Holliday contributed two home runs 
and six RBI, including a seventh-inning grand slam that tied the score 
at 13. This game marked the second time in his career in which he hit a 
grand slam plus another home run in his team's record-breaking comeback.[100] 
The first such comeback had occurred with the Rockies the previous year, 
on July 4, against the Marlins.[82] Two days later, he added three more 
hits and three runs scored against the Twins in a 16–1 victory.[101] An 
offensive surge that boosted his trade value significantly by hitting .390 
with a .422 on-base percentage and a .756 slugging percentage in his final 
two weeks in Oakland. His overall totals with the club included 93 games 
played while batting .286 with 11 HR and 54 RBI.[102] On July 24, 2009, 
the A's traded Holliday to the St. Louis Cardinals for prospects Brett 
Wallace, Clayton Mortensen, Shane Peterson[103] and $1.5 million.[104] 
He represented an instant offensive upgrade for Cardinals left fielders, 
who had batted .212 with a .294 on-base percentage and a .342 slugging 
percentage in 2009,[105] and for cleanup hitters, who had batted .250 with 
.325 OBP and .443 SLG. He hit in the fourth slot in the lineup behind All-Star 
first baseman Albert Pujols.[106] Because Pujols already wore jersey number 
5, the number Holliday previously wore with Colorado and Oakland, St. Louis 
issued him the number 15.[105] In his Cardinals debut, Holliday augmented 
four hits with an RBI and a stolen base in an 8–1 win, for his 15th career 
four-hit game.[107] He reprised his debut with 20 hits in 33 AB in his 
next nine games for a .606 AVG, .659 on-base percentage, 1.061 slugging 
percentage, six doubles, three homers and 10 RBI.[108] Each of those nine 
games featured Holliday with at least one hit and twice reaching base.[109] 
His combined totals in 26 July games with Oakland and St. Louis included 
40 hits, 20 runs scored, a .412 AVG, .487 OBP, .612 SLG, 13 doubles, four 
home runs, 22 RBI, 16 walks and four SB.[110] The Cardinals segued into 
improved play with a 20–6 record in August to stretch a National League 
Central division lead from one-half game on August 1 to ten on September 
1[111] In the third inning against the Milwaukee Brewers on September 3, 
he collected his 1,000th MLB hit.[112] The Cardinals won the National League 
Central division crown to claim a playoff berth for the first time in three 
years.[111] During the 65 games with Holliday on the roster, they dispatched 
an NL-best .600 winning percentage; he batted .353 with 13 home runs and 
55 RBI; twelve were game-winning RBI. After the All-Star break, he ranked 
in the top ten in MLB in batting average (.357), HR (16) and RBI (66).[109] 
His aggregate totals with the A's and Cardinals included a .313 batting 
average, 24 home runs and 109 RBI.[106] In spite of the inspired play after 
acquiring Holliday, the Cardinals did not fare well in the postseason, 
where they battled the Dodgers in the NLDS. Following a Game 1 defeat, 
Holliday hit a go-ahead home run off starter Clayton Kershaw in Game 2.[113] 
With the Cardinals maintaining a 2–1 advantage and two outs in the ninth 
inning, Holliday dropped a line drive off James Loney's bat. Had he caught 
the ball, that play would have ended the contest for a Cardinals win and 
a 1–1 Series tie. Instead, Loney ended up on second base, setting the Dodgers 
up to eventually score the game-winning run for a 3–2 final margin.[114] 
Los Angeles swept the best-of-five series, ending the Cardinals' season,[111] 
and the Game 2 error left Holliday with a reputation as a "goat."[106][115][116] 
Holliday filed for free agency on November 5.[117] He finished 16th in 
the NL MVP voting – including a fourth-place vote – despite playing nearly 
100 games in the American League.[118] Both trades involving Holliday were 
later panned as failures for the A's, as two of the players they dealt 
away became multiple All-Stars.[119][120] One was González, who won the 
2010 batting title, Silver Slugger and Gold Glove Awards with the Rockies.[121] 
Street was the other All-Star.[122][123] Jesse Spector of Sporting News 
augured that the second deal was a "landslide win" for the Cardinals, even 
if they had never resigned Holliday in his free agency.[124] On January 
21, 2010, the Cardinals signed Holliday to a seven-year, $120 million deal 
($130.4 million today), and he switched his uniform number to 7 in honor 
of fellow Oklahoman Mickey Mantle. The contract features a full no-trade 
clause and a $17 million team option for 2017 or $1 million buyout.[126][127] 
It was the richest contract in team history[106] and the largest of the 
2009–10 offseason.[128][129] At the Cardinals' annual Winter Warm Up, he 
was bestowed with a new nickname – "The Stillwater Stinger".[130] Batting 
second, Holliday homered in four consecutive games from June 18 to 22. 
In a weekend series against Oakland from June 18 to 20, he drove in eight 
of the Cardinals' 12 runs. He was named the National League Player of the 
Week for June 20, batting .435 with four home runs and eight RBI.[131] 
Selected to the All-Star Game on July 4 as a reserve player, he also participated 
in the Home Run Derby.[132] In the 10 games against both his former clubs, 
he batted .487, seven home runs, 13 RBI and nine runs scored. He batted 
.431 in a 16-game hitting streak from September 9–24. His .364 average 
for September and October ranked second in the NL.[131] For the season, 
Holliday played in 158 games, batting .312 with 186 hits, 45 doubles, 28 
HR, 103 RBI, 95 runs scored, 69 walks, a .390 OBP and .532 slugging percentage. 
He finished tied for second in the National League in doubles, third in 
hits, fourth with 317 total bases and 52 multi-hit games, fifth in batting, 
sixth in OBP and extra base hits with 74, and seventh in slugging and RBI.[131] 
He earned another Silver Slugger award, was named to The Sporting News 
All-Star Team and placed 12th in the NL MVP voting.[131] The St. Louis 
chapter of the Baseball Writers' Association of America recognized his 
charitable work and role as a team leader with the Darryl Kile Good Guy 
Award.[133] After hitting a home run the day before on Opening Day of 2011, 
Holliday had an emergency appendectomy.[134] He returned just nine days 
later despite a forecast to miss four to six weeks.[135] In seven consecutive 
plate appearances against the Houston Astros on April 26 and 27, he reached 
base and [136] did so in 10 of 15 plate appearances in that series.[137] 
He made his fifth MLB All-Star Game appearance and third Home Run Derby.[138] 
After two appearances on the disabled list twice that season, a different 
"injury bug" struck Holliday in a late August game against the Dodgers. 
During the eighth inning, he left the game due to pain developing after 
a moth had lodged itself deep within his ear. Team trainers removed it 
without further incident.[139] As of August 28, the Cardinals were 10 1⁄2 
games behind the Braves for the wild card playoff berth with 28 left to 
play.[140] In a September 1 contest against the Brewers, Holliday hit his 
200th career home run, becoming the 300th player in MLB history to do so.[141] 
Tendonitis developed in his right hand on September 13, limiting him to 
three more starts the rest of the season.[136] St. Louis won 20 of their 
final 28 games, enabling them to overtake the Braves for the wild card 
position[142] in the last game of the regular season; it was the largest 
lead surrendered in MLB history with 28 games left to play.[140][143] In 
124 games, Holliday batted .296 with 22 home runs, 75 RBI, 36 doubles, 
.388 OBP, .525 SLG, .912 OPS and 151 OPS+, placing sixth in the NL in OBP, 
seventh in OPS and OPS+ and ninth in doubles. In the NLDS against the Phillies, 
Holliday's tendonitis reemerged,[144] limiting him to start two of the 
five games in the series. He was in better health for the NLCS against 
Milwaukee, batting .435 with 10 hits,[136] six runs scored, five RBI and 
a home run. The Cardinals defeated the Brewers,[116] advancing to the World 
Series[145] against the Texas Rangers.[116] Holliday was injured again 
in Game 6 on a play diving into third base where catcher Mike Napoli and 
third baseman Adrián Beltré had picked him off,[146] and the injury also 
kept him out of Game 7. The Cardinals won again and the Series, giving 
him his first World Series ring.[147] Although he had just three hits in 
19 AB, Holliday walked seven times – the most since Bonds' 13 in the 2002 
Fall Classic — boosting his OBP to .385 as he scored five runs.[136] In 
41 straight starts spanning from June 22 to August 8, 2012, Holliday reached 
base.[148] His 15-game hitting streak from June 27 to July 16 was a season-high 
for the club.[149] From June 16 to July 6, he batted .500 with 10 doubles, 
17 runs scored, four home runs, and 21 RBI; his batting average, on-base 
percentage (.549) and slugging percentage (.824) each led MLB. Holliday 
was named the NL All-Star team to replace teammate Yadier Molina when he 
went on the bereavement list.[150] On July 21, Holliday hit the longest 
home run recorded to date at Busch Stadium. The ball traveled 469 feet 
(143 m), flying past the 'Big Mac Land' sign into the second deck in left 
field.[151] He held the record until Brandon Moss surpassed that distance 
four years later.[152] Safely hitting four times in five AB on August 26 
against Cincinnati, he also had four RBI and missed hitting for the cycle 
by a home run.[153] He singled in the first inning against the Nationals 
on August 30 for his 1,500th career hit.[154] Holliday finished the season 
with a .295 batting average with 27 home runs and 102 RBI.[151] During 
the NLCS against the Giants in Game 2, he slid into second baseman Marco 
Scutaro during a routine ground ball double play and ended up on top of 
him. Scutaro left the game to have x-rays taken. Controversy arose and 
persisted as to whether Holliday intentionally attempted to injure him. 
The Giants trailed 1–0 at that point, but scored seven runs to win, 7–1.[155][156][157] 
Eventually, the Giants won the series. The Missouri Athletic Club named 
Holliday their Sports Personality of the Year for 2012.[18] Holliday hit 
a grand slam on June 9, 2013, during a seven-run 10th inning against the 
Reds in an 11–4 victory.[158] He left the July 11 game against the Cubs 
early because of a tightened right hamstring sustained while running to 
first base,[159] prompting the Cardinals to place him on the DL. He returned 
July 27 against the Braves.[160] In another game against the Reds on August 
26, Holliday's three-run home run was the longest at Busch Stadium in 2013 
at 442 feet (135 m).[161] During the final road trip of the season, he 
collected 13 hits in 26 at bats. However, back spasms kept him out of several 
games at the end of the regular season.[162] The Cardinals set an all-time 
MLB team record by batting .330 with runners in scoring position, and Holliday 
was fourth in MLB in those situations that year at .390.[163] In all, he 
finished with 22 home runs, 94 RBI, and a .300 batting average. His MLB-leading 
31 double plays grounded into were a career high and set a new Cardinals' 
single-season franchise record.[164] The Cardinals clinched the best record 
in the NL at 97–65, granting Holliday his fifth career postseason entrance, 
and fourth with the Cardinals. Faced with a must-win Game 4 situation against 
the Pirates in the NLDS, he hit a two-run home run in a 2–1 victory.[165] 
The Cardinals advanced to their third consecutive NLCS against the Dodgers.[166] 
Holliday started 0-for-13, but his Game 3 home run off Ricky Nolasco to 
help St. Louis win, 4–2.[167][168] The Cardinals defeated the Dodgers in 
six games, securing Holliday's third trip to the Fall Classic,[169] and 
second against the Red Sox. Holliday collected six hits in 24 AB with one 
double, one triple and two home runs for a .625 SLG; however, the Red Sox 
claimed the title in six games.[170] In the 2013 postseason, Holliday hit 
four home runs, 10 RBI and a .507 slugging percentage.[116] By reaching 
base in each of his first 30 home games of 2014, Holliday authored the 
longest such streak to start a season in franchise history since Solly 
Hemus had 33 straight in 1953, extending a streak of 42 dating back to 
the previous September 6.[171] He singled in Jon Jay to drive in the 1,000th 
run of his career on June 17 at Busch Stadium against Washington, the 277th 
player in MLB history to do so.[172] While batting against Dan Haren of 
the Dodgers on July 19, Holliday hit his 400th career double and hit a 
435 feet (133 m) home run for his 1,000th run scored.[173] The Arizona 
Fall League announced on July 20 that Holliday, along with fellow outfielder 
Carl Crawford, were selected to their Hall of Fame.[21] For the week ending 
September 2, Holliday was the NL Player of the Week, following a major 
league-leading 13 RBI – four of which each won separate contests – and 
an NL-leading four HR, .889 SLG and 24 total bases while the Cardinals 
took over first place in the NL Central.[174] On September 12, his 467 
feet (142 m) home run against the Rockies was the longest home of the season 
at Busch Stadium and the second-longest in the stadium's history, just 
after the one he had hit two years earlier against the Cubs.[175] From 
August 30 to the end of the season, he batted .538 with RISP.[176] He finished 
the season with a .272 average, 20 HR, 90 RBI (eighth in the NL), 37 doubles, 
83 runs scored, 74 BB (eighth), 247 times on base (sixth), .370 OBP (10th) 
and .443 SLG.[177] Seventeen of Holliday's 20 home runs traveled at least 
400 feet (120 m); his home run true distance average of 417.9 feet (127.4 m) 
led all MLB.[178][179] For the ninth consecutive season, Holliday recorded 
at least 20 HR, 30 doubles, 75 RBI and 80 runs scored, becoming just the 
fifth player in MLB history to do so. The others with this exploit were 
Stan Musial, Manny Ramirez (10), Pujols (10), and Miguel Cabrera (nine).[171] 
The Cardinals finished first in the NL Central division to enter the postseason 
for the fifth time[8] and faced the Dodgers in an NLDS for the second time 
in six seasons since acquiring Holliday. After finding themselves down 
6–1 in Game 1, Holliday provided a three-run home run off reliever Pedro 
Báez that was the difference in a 10–9 victory.[180] The Cardinals faced 
the Giants in an NLCS rematch but were defeated in five games.[181] For 
the National League MVP voting, he placed 14th, marking the eighth time 
he received votes.[182] Holliday opened the 2015 season with a 12-game 
hitting streak[183] that turned into 45 consecutive games reaching base, 
breaking Pujols' National League record of 42 games to open a season which 
he set in 2008, and 47 in all dating back to the end of 2014.[184][185] 
It was the longest such streak since Derek Jeter garnered 53 in 1999.[186] 
Holliday's streak ended on June 2 against the Brewers after umpire Joe 
West ejected him for arguing a called third strike, the fourth ejection 
of his career.[187] On June 8, Holliday suffered a right quadriceps strain 
while attempting to catch a fly ball off the bat of the Rockies' Carlos 
González, and the Cardinals placed him on the 15-day DL. At the time, he 
was batting .303 with three home runs and 26 RBI,[188] and had been receiving 
strong fan support in the All-Star Game voting. In spite of missing a month 
and being rendered unable to play in the game due to the injury, he was 
voted a starting outfielder for the first time in his career.[189][190] 
After returning from the DL, Holliday's first home run was a grand slam 
on July 21 against Carlos Rodon of the Chicago White Sox in an 8–5 win,[191] 
his sixth career grand slam.[192] He reinjured the right quadriceps on 
July 30, prompting the club to retract him to the DL.[193] The Cardinals 
reactivated him on September 15 after missing 41 games.[194] Holliday played 
73 games and finished the season with a .279 batting average, .394 OBP, 
.410 SLG, .804 OPS, four home runs and 35 RBI in 277 plate appearances.[195] 
The Cardinals started Holliday at first base on Opening Day of the 2016 
season, a position he had not previously played during his career.[196] 
On May 6 against Pittsburgh, Holliday collected his 512th hit at Busch 
Stadium, breaking his personal tie of 511 hits at Coors Field. Having already 
achieved 500 hits at both stadiums, he became the only active player with 
at least 500 hits at multiple stadiums, and just the fourteenth to do so 
within the previous 50 years.[197] Holliday hit a home run on May 30 that 
traveled 466 feet (142 m) off Jhan Mariñez and nearly exited Miller Park 
in a 6–0 defeat of the Brewers.[198] The next day, also against the Brewers, 
he collected his 1,000th career hit with the Cardinals.[199] A 94 miles 
per hour (151 km/h) fastball from the Cubs' Mike Montgomery on August 11, 
2016, struck Holliday on the right thumb, fracturing it. The Cardinals 
placed him on the DL.[200] Presented with the option to either allow the 
thumb to heal naturally or with surgery, Holliday elected surgery as that 
would have potentially allowed him to return before season's end.[201][202] 
He encountered multiple delays in recovery. Having been informed in the 
final days of the 2016 season that the Cardinals would not pick up the 
option for 2017 worth $17 million, he was activated from the DL − although 
his thumb was still fractured − in time for the September 30 game against 
Pittsburgh. He hit his first career pinch-hit home run in that game and 
20th of the season.[203][204] Holliday released a statement: "While I'm 
disappointed this could be it here in St. Louis, I understand that it might 
be time to move on."[205] Notes: Through 2015 season. Per Baseball-Reference.com.[177] 
July 20, 2009 [100] Former Cardinals hitting coach Mark McGwire described 
Holliday as "a very good on-base guy. He’ll take the walks. He knows how 
to work the count. He uses the whole field. Once in a while he’ll tap into 
his strength and hit homers. He's just really good." Comparing his approach 
to that of Pujols and Adrian Gonzalez, McGwire also commented that "Matt's 
very strong mentally. I can’t emphasize enough how this game is a mental 
grind. The stronger ones do survive, and the stronger ones you see throughout 
their career, the numbers are always there."[206] Pundits and fans have 
consistently questioned Holliday's durability, and thus his effectiveness 
as a hitter, into the final guaranteed year of the contract he signed in 
2010. However, during each of its first five seasons, he played no fewer 
than 124 games. In each of the first 11 seasons of his career, including 
his rookie year, he played at least 121 games.[207] Throughout his career, 
Holliday has received criticism for his defense.[208] The contract to which 
Holliday and the Cardinals agreed before the 2010 season was widely viewed 
as a great success.[209][210][211][212] Over its first five seasons, he 
averaged 147 games per season, .295 batting average, .383 OBP and .496 
SLG for a 141 OPS+; his counting stats average included 24 HR, 93 RBI, 
and 92 runs scored.[176] He totaled 119 homers and 185 doubles in that 
span.[211] Since being acquired from Oakland, Holliday ranked fifth in 
MLB in RBI, doubles, and runs scored, ninth in extra-base hits, and 14th 
in OPS.[176] Fangraphs' Wins Above Replacement (WAR) formula rated Holliday's 
production equivalent to nearly $110 million in value while actually being 
paid just $84 million. In that span, he ranked 11th in all MLB, and fifth 
among outfielders, with 23.8 WAR.[211][213] In spite of potentially costing 
the Cardinals the 2009 NLDS with the Game 2 line drive gaffe, Holliday 
was a key factor in the 2011 championship run with a big NLCS.[124] With 
RISP, Holliday had hit .315 with a .407 OBP and .486 SLG during his Cardinals 
years. Since Busch Stadium opened in 2006, he hit .309 with a .403 OBP, 
.542 SLG; only Pujols had more HR, RBI and a higher OPS.[176] At $17.2 
million in total earnings, Forbes magazine ranked Holliday as the 99th-highest 
paid athlete in the world in 2014.[214] In spite of missing significant 
time in 2015 and 2016, Holliday contributed 24.1 WAR during the life of 
his 2010−16 contract with St. Louis, worth $168.6 million in total contributions 
according to Fangraphs.[204] Matt Holliday and his wife, Leslee, married 
on December 30, 2000. They met on a blind date in 1999 in Stillwater during 
the baseball offseason when Matt had returned home from his first professional 
season following his selection by the Rockies in the MLB draft and Leslee 
was an undergraduate at OSU−Stillwater. Matt’s best friend was dating a 
friend of Leslee’s, and they wanted to do a double date, so her friend 
asked if she would go with Matt. The Hollidays currently reside in St. 
Louis, Missouri, and Jupiter, Florida, and have four children.[215] They 
have three sons, Jackson (born December 4, 2003), Ethan (b. February 23, 
2007), and Reed (b. July 24, 2013) and a daughter, Gracyn (b. November 
7, 2009). They formerly resided in Austin, Texas, during the offseason 
until December, 2010, following his signing of the contract with the Cardinals 
in January, 2010.[216] During the offseason, Holliday and his family have 
also lived in Stillwater, where he also has worked with his brother, Josh, 
on his swing.[217] In the 2014−15 offseason, Holliday and his family moved 
to South Florida, allowing him to stay in optimal shape year-round, and 
his sons to continue to play sports in winter months.[218] Holliday's favorite 
player growing up was Cal Ripken, Jr. He has stated that if he had a dream 
car it would be a Bentley Continental GT, rather than a sports car, because 
he is "too big for small sports cars."[219] He is a Christian and is part 
of a Bible study group with fellow Christian teammates. He has spoken about 
his faith saying, "I play for God. It says in the Bible that we are to 
do all things for Him. ... So I try to do the best that I can for Him. 
This is my job, not who I am."[220] Leslee has led a Bible study in the 
St. Louis area for professional athletes' wives.[215] Scott Boras has represented 
Holliday as his agent since he turned professional. Holliday described 
his relationship with Boras and his staff in that he "enjoy(s) sitting 
down and talking to them. Scott is as accessible as you want him to be. 
I could call him right now. He's got a lot of clients and people say they 
don’t hear from Scott but he’ll give you as much or as little attention 
as you want." Holliday further explained that due to the amenities the 
Boras Corporation provides, including a staff psychologist, research to 
assist players in prolonging careers, studies into arbitration cases, and 
statistical performance computation, he felt that Boras' agency gave him 
the best opportunities to succeed.[221][222] Known primarily as a reserved 
figure, Holliday has played for years in the shadows of such franchise 
icons as Todd Helton and Albert Pujols, which accommodated his demeanor 
well. However, has emerged as a veteran presence for the Cardinals willing 
to assist and entertain younger players and top prospects as they attempt 
to adjust to a lifestyle of playing baseball. In January, 2012, he invited 
Matt Adams, Ryan Jackson, Charlie Tilson and Kolten Wong for a weeklong 
stay in St. Louis at the Tony Frontenac hotel. Activities included eating 
out, hitting, working out and attending a St. Louis Blues game. Holliday 
also became more active on his Twitter account and more readily availed 
himself as a guest on talk radio shows. Further, he befriended former teammate 
David Freese, who, shortly after Holliday's arrival in St. Louis in 2009, 
was arrested for driving under the influence. However, after becoming daily 
workout partners and socializing, teammates noted a "positive influence" 
on Freese.[223] With intense off-season physical training regimens, Holliday 
plays squash and likes to incorporate an NFL approach. He has trained with 
teammates, such as Freese, and pitcher Trevor Rosenthal, in activities 
such as "sled pushing, tire flipping and some fireman carries", and each 
player taking turns carrying each other for about 20 metres.[224] One opponent 
with long-time ties to the Hollidays is Boston Red Sox manager John Farrell. 
Farrell pitched for Tom Holliday at OSU, helping propel them to four College 
World Series appearances. When Matt and Josh were still toddlers, Farrell 
often babysat them when their parents went out. Years later, when Matt 
Holliday was a member of the Rockies team that played the Red Sox in the 
2007 World Series, Farrell was the Red Sox pitching coach. Six years after 
that, as a member of the St. Louis Cardinals, Holliday again played against 
Farrell. This time, he was the Red Sox manager.[225] In both Series, however, 
Farrell's teams were victorious over Holliday's.[70][170] Active in charity 
work, Holliday has represented his teams around the community. After former 
teammate Albert Pujols signed with the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim in 
2011, the St. Louis-based Pujols Family Foundation remained in St. Louis 
and partnered with Holliday for coordination of events, such as the Albert 
Pujols Golf Classic. Pujols and his wife, Deidre, started the foundation 
to raise funds and awareness of poverty and infirm children in Pujols' 
native Dominican Republic.[226] With his mother, Kathy Holliday, and the 
Alvin J. Siteman Cancer Center of the Barnes-Jewish Hospital and Washington 
University School of Medicine, Holliday raised awareness for colorectal 
cancer screening. Kathy Holliday had been treated for colorectal cancer 
while the Cardinals played the Giants in the 2012 NLCS.[227] Other charitable 
participation includes "Homers for Health", a pledge-based drive that Holliday 
endorsed with Freese in 2012 for Cardinal Glennon Children's Hospital. 
For each home run the Cardinals hit that season, fans were encouraged to 
pledge 25 cents.[228] At times, Holliday has maintained a low profile regarding 
charity work. Others have divulged that he is a frequent visitor to children's 
hospitals, including Labor Day of 2011 when he, his wife and two sons, 
spent more than two hours at Shriners Hospitals for Children attending 
to a 14-year-old boy recuperating from hip surgery. Although he has not 
established his own charitable foundation, others who know Holliday have 
elaborated that he has written "very significant" checks to charities.[223]
