"I remember facing Ron Darling of the Mets in my first big-league game. 
My second game was against Dwight Gooden, and my third was against Ed Lynch. 
I ended up getting my first big-league hit off the former general manager 
of the Cubs – a line drive over the second baseman. Every time I see Ed, 
he says 'Yeah, yeah, I know.' That was my claim to fame in 1985." ... Spent

appearance in the MLB. Darrin pitched the last two innings of the game, 
allowing 3 hits, walking 2 batters, and allowing two earned runs. Darrin 
had this to say about his pitching performance "We were losing like 11-4 
in Houston (6) and my manager, Greg Riddoch, knew I'd been messing around 
in the bullpen. The pitching part wasn't the most difficult thing. It was 
after. I could barely move and my butt was killing me from stretching out 
the glutes and hamstring. It took me five days not to feel sore. I was 
throwing 86-87 m.p.h. I didn't throw a curveball because I was scared to 
hit somebody." 1992 Set career highs in games (155), RBI (70), hits (146)
