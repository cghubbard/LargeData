Kenneth Roy Williams (June 28, 1890 – January 22, 1959) was an American 
professional baseball player.[1] He played as an outfielder in Major League 
Baseball from 1915 to 1929. Williams began his major league career with 
the Cincinnati Reds before spending the majority of his playing days with 
the St. Louis Browns, and finally ended his career playing for the Boston 
Red Sox.[1] He batted left-handed and threw right-handed.[1] Williams was 
the first member of Major League Baseball's 30–30 club, for players who 
have reached the 30 home runs and 30 stolen bases plateaus in the same 
season.[2] Williams began his professional baseball career in 1913 at the 
age of 23, playing for the Regina Red Sox of the Western Canada League.[3] 
In 1914, he played for the Edmonton Eskimos before moving to the Spokane 
Indians in 1915.[3] After posting a .340 batting average in 79 games for 
the Indians, he made his major league debut with the Cincinnati Reds on 
July 14, 1915.[1] He hit for a .242 average in 71 games for the Reds during 
the peak of the dead-ball era when only 6 players in the league hit above 
the .300 mark.[4] He played in only 10 games for the Reds in 1916, spending 
most of the season with Spokane and with the Portland Beavers of the Pacific 
Coast League.[1][3] Williams hit 24 home runs along with a .313 batting 
average for Portland in 1917 before being purchased by the St. Louis Browns.[3] 
Williams was drafted into the United States Army in April 1918, and appeared 
in only two games for the Browns that season.[5] He returned to the Browns 
in 1919 and hit .300 with 6 home runs in 65 games.[1] In 1920, Major League 
Baseball outlawed specialty pitches such as the spitball and experienced 
a subsequent jump in the league batting averages as well as home runs.[6] 
In Williams's first full season as a regular player in 1920, he posted 
a .307 batting average along with 10 home runs and 72 runs batted in.[1] 
He continued to improve in 1921 with a .347 batting average with 24 home 
runs, 117 runs batted in and a career-high .429 on-base percentage.[1] 
Williams had the best season of his career in 1922, leading the American 
League with 39 home runs and 155 runs batted in, as the Browns finished 
the season one game behind the pennant-winning New York Yankees.[1][7] 
32 of his 39 home runs were hit at home in Sportsman's Park.[8] On August 
7, 1922, during a game against the Washington Senators, he became the first 
player in American League history to hit two home runs in one inning.[9][10] 
His 39 home runs topped Babe Ruth, who had led the league the previous 
four seasons, although Ruth had been suspended well into the 1922 season 
by Baseball Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis for violating a curb on 
barnstorming.[2][11] He was one of only two players to break Babe Ruth's 
twelve-year string in which he led the American League in home runs (the 
other being Bob Meusel).[11] Also in 1922, Williams also became the first 
player in major league history to have 30 home runs and 30-plus stolen 
bases in the same season; a feat which would not be achieved again until 
Willie Mays accomplished it with the New York Giants in 1956.[11] In August 
1923, the Washington Senators came into possession of one of Williams' 
bats and discovered that it had been bored out and plugged with a lighter 
wood.[12] The bat was turned over to National League umpire George Hildebrand 
for investigation and the Senators protested all the victories by the Browns 
in which Williams had used the bat.[12] Williams explained that he had 
ordered the bat specially made, but when he received it, he found it to 
be too heavy, so he plugged it with a lighter wood.[12] He was cited in 
the 1924 Reach Guide for using a corked bat, although major league baseball 
hadn't ruled plugged bats illegal at the time.[11][13] He finished the 
1923 season with a career-high .357 batting average along with 29 home 
runs and 91 runs batted in and ended the season 15th in Most Valuable Player 
Award balloting.[1][14] In November 1924, it was rumored that the Yankees 
were trying to trade for Williams, which would have teamed him with Ruth 
to make one of the most powerful home run combinations in baseball. However, 
St. Louis manager George Sisler's insistence on the Yankees trading Waite 
Hoyt for Williams was too high a price for Yankees owner Jacob Ruppert.[15] 
Williams had another productive season in 1925, hitting .331 with 25 home 
runs and 105 runs batted in, and led the league with a .613 slugging percentage.[1] 
Williams continued to hit well for the remainder of his career with St. 
Louis until December 15, 1927, when he was purchased by the Boston Red 
Sox for $10,000.[1] He played two more seasons for the Red Sox, hitting 
for a .345 average in 1929 at the age of 39.[1] Williams returned to the 
minor leagues in 1930 to play two more seasons for the Portland Beavers 
before retiring in 1931 at the age of 41.[3] In a fourteen-year major league 
career, Williams played in 1,397 games, accumulating 1,552 hits in 4,862 
at bats for a .319 career batting average along with 196 home runs, 913 
runs batted in and an on-base percentage of .393.[1] He retired with a 
.958 fielding percentage.[1] As baseball evolved out of the dead-ball era, 
Williams finished in the top four in the American League in home runs in 
seven consecutive seasons (1921–1927). He posted ten seasons with a batting 
average above .300, and three seasons in which he scored more than 100 
runs.[1] As of 2016, Williams' .319 career batting average ranks 53rd all-time 
in major league history.[16] His .924 career on-base plus slugging percentage 
and his .530 career slugging percentage, rank 45th and 48th respectively 
all-time among major league players.[17][18] Williams holds the St. Louis 
Browns / Baltimore Orioles single season record for runs batted in with 
155 in 1922.[19] He is the St. Louis Browns' all-time leader in on-base 
percentage (.403), slugging percentage (.558) and OPS (.961).[19] Williams 
returned to Grants Pass and worked as a police officer before becoming 
owner and operator of the Owl Club, a restaurant and billiard parlor on
