Harold Wayne Smith (born December 7, 1930) is an American former professional 
baseball player. He was a utilityman — a catcher, third baseman and first 
baseman — in Major League Baseball from 1955 to 1964 who played for five 
different teams, but is best known for his key role during the 1960 World 
Series as a member of the Pittsburgh Pirates.[1] During his playing career, 
he threw and batted right-handed, stood 6 feet (1.8 m) tall, and weighed 
195 pounds (88 kg). Smith was signed as an amateur free agent by the New 
York Yankees in 1949[2] but he never played for the Yankees. He was included 
in a 17-player trade (one of the largest in Major League annals) to the 
Baltimore Orioles after the 1954 season and he made his big-league debut 
with the Orioles as their starting catcher on Opening Day 1955, going hitless 
in three at bats against Bob Porterfield of the Washington Senators. During 
his rookie season, Smith appeared in a career-high 135 games, 113 as a 
starting catcher, but in 1956 he lost his regular job to Gus Triandos (who 
had also been traded by the Yankees to the Orioles in the 17-player deal). 
Smith was swapped to the Kansas City Athletics for fellow backstop Joe 
Ginsberg in August 1956; he would play in Kansas City through 1959 as a 
catcher and third baseman, batting over .300 in 1957. Inter-league trading 
without waivers was inaugurated after the 1959 season, and on December 
9, Smith was dealt to the Pirates for relief pitcher Dick Hall and two 
other players. As a right-handed batter, Smith platooned with left-handed 
hitting Smoky Burgess behind the plate during the Pirates' pennant-winning 
1960 regular season. In 95 games, 66 as a starting catcher, Smith set a 
career high in runs batted in (45), while swatting 11 home runs and hitting 
.295. During the World Series against the Yankees, Smith started Games 
3 and 6 against ace left-hander Whitey Ford and went two for seven as Ford 
shut out the Pirates in each outing. Smith began Game 7 on the bench, but 
entered the contest in the eighth inning after starter Burgess was removed 
for a pinch runner. Smith came to bat in the bottom of the eighth with 
two outs, two runners on base, and the Pirates trailing by a score of 7–6. 
With two strikes, Smith hit a dramatic three-run home run off right-hander 
Jim Coates to give the Pirates a 9–7 lead. His home run electrified the 
Forbes Field crowd, who thought his blast would win the World Series for 
the Pirates. However, his hit would be overshadowed: the Yankees then battled 
back to tie the game at nine in the top of the ninth, leading to Bill Mazeroski's 
walk-off homer to win the Series in the bottom of the inning. But the eighth-inning 
blow was pivotal, and Smith would always be known as one of the heroes 
of the 1960 World Series.[3] Smith and Burgess returned as the Pirates' 
platoon catchers in 1961, but Smith slumped to a .223 average with only 
three home runs. He was left unprotected in the 1961 Major League Baseball 
expansion draft and was selected by the Houston Colt .45s in the premium 
phase of the lottery. Smith was the catcher for the first Major League 
game in Houston baseball history, going two for four with a home run and 
a double in an 11–2 rout of the Chicago Cubs on April 10, 1962.[4] He was 
the Colt .45s' regular catcher during their maiden National League season 
and hit 12 home runs, third on the club, but batted only .235. In 1963, 
rookie John Bateman claimed the starting catcher job and Smith split his 
season between Houston and the Colt .45s' Oklahoma City 89ers affiliate. 
He then wrapped up his MLB career in 1964 as a backup catcher with the 
Cincinnati Reds, hitting only .121 in 32 games. Smith appeared in 879 games 
over ten Major League seasons, with his 715 hits including 148 doubles 
and ten triples. In addition, during the 1960–61 seasons, he was one of 
two Hal Smiths catching in the National League. The other, Harold Raymond
