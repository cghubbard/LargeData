Michael Eugene LaValliere (born August 18, 1960), nicknamed Spanky, is 
a former catcher in Major League Baseball whose 11-year career included 
tenures in both the National and American Leagues. He batted left-handed 
and threw right-handed. Signed by the Philadelphia Phillies as an amateur 
free agent in 1981, LaValliere started out as a third baseman but was converted 
to catcher in 1982. He was sent to the St. Louis Cardinals during the 1984 
season as part of a conditional deal. Signing with the Cards as a free 
agent in 1985, LaValliere spent two years with the club, which included 
a trip to the World Series. Excellent at throwing out potential base stealers, 
he won a Gold Glove award in 1987. LaValliere went to the University of 
Massachusetts Lowell. Throughout his career he was known as a great defensive 
catcher, he even reached a 75% caught stealing percentage in 1993 for the 
White Sox. He definitely had one of the best catching arms to ever play 
the game. In spring training of the 1987 season, LaValliere was traded 
to the Pittsburgh Pirates alongside Andy Van Slyke and Mike Dunne in exchange 
for fellow catcher Tony Peña. LaValliere and Van Slyke later became stalwarts 
on the hugely successful Pirates teams of the early 1990s, when Pittsburgh 
went to three consecutive National League Championship Series from 1990–1992. 
Unfortunately for the Pirates, they lost in all three of their NLCS appearances, 
in 1990 to the eventual World champion Cincinnati Reds and in 1991 and 
1992 to the Atlanta Braves. In the 1992 NLCS, LaValliere was involved in 
the famous final play of Game 7, as Atlanta first baseman Sid Bream slid 
and just barely beat the tag to score the Series-winning run for the Braves. 
During the 1993 season, LaValliere was released by Pittsburgh, and signed 
a contract with the Chicago White Sox. The White Sox won the American League 
West division title, but lost in the ALCS to the eventual World champion 
Toronto Blue Jays. LaValliere would spend two more seasons in Chicago before 
retiring. He now teaches baseball lessons and holds camps at a place called
