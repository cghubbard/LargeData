Paul Victor Godfrey, CM,[2] OOnt[3] is a businessman and former Canadian 
politician.[4] During his career, Godfrey was a North York alderman, Chairman 
of Metro Toronto, President of the Toronto Sun and head of the Toronto 
Blue Jays. He was instrumental in bringing the Toronto Blue Jays to Toronto 
and has campaigned to bring the National Football League to Toronto.[5][6] 
He had been named president and CEO of The National Post, starting in 2009.[7] 
On November 27, 2009, Godfrey was announced as the chair of the Ontario 
Lottery and Gaming Corporation,[8] a role in which he served until being 
dismissed in 2013. He has been President and CEO of Postmedia Network, 
since July 13, 2010. Born in Toronto, Ontario, Godfrey grew up in a working 
class Jewish family near the Kensington Market neighbourhood of Toronto[9][unreliable 
source?]) and later moved to the Bathurst and Lawrence area of North York. 
After graduating from C.W. Jefferys Collegiate Institute, he attended the 
University of Toronto and graduated with a Bachelor of Applied Science 
in chemical engineering.[10] In 1999, he was made a Member of the Order 
of Canada.[2] In 2010, he was appointed to the Order of Ontario.[3] Godfrey 
is married to Gina with whom he has three sons, Rob, Noah and Jay. His 
jaw was surgically corrected, a trait for which he was satirized.[11] He 
entered politics as an alderman in the borough of North York in 1964, serving 
until 1973.[9] That year, he was appointed Chairman of Metropolitan Toronto, 
serving until 1984. In 1985 it was reported that Godfrey had joined the 
new Ontario Premier Frank Miller's informal 'kitchen cabinet', a group 
that got together Thursday mornings at the Sutton Place Hotel to discuss 
issues of the day during breakfast. This was similar to a 'breakfast club' 
set up by the previous premier Bill Davis but with a more right-wing bent.[12] 
In 1984, after he left politics he joined the Toronto Sun as publisher 
and CEO. In 1991 he succeeded founder Doug Creighton as president and chief 
operating officer of Toronto Sun Publishing. In 1992 he became CEO of the 
Toronto Sun Publishing replacing founder Doug Creighton. Creighton was 
forced to resign by the board of directors and the parent company, Maclean 
Hunter.[13] In 1996, Godfrey led a successful attempt by Sun management 
to buy back control, allowing it to become an independent entity once again. 
Two years later, Godfrey organized a deal with Conrad Black to swap the 
Financial Post with four daily newspapers in southwestern Ontario. These 
included the Hamilton Spectator, Kitchener-Waterloo Record, Guelph Mercury, 
and Cambridge Reporter.[14] In October 1998, Sun Media was approached by 
Torstar Corporation in an unsolicited takeover bid for $748 million. Godfrey 
said he was surprised by the move.[15] Two months later Quebecor Media 
Inc. made a higher and eventually more successful bid for a reported $983 
million. Godfrey was a key figure in seeking out Quebecor as an alternative 
buyer.[16] After the sale, Quebecor, initially heralded as a 'white knight' 
buyer, forced Godfrey to cut 180 jobs from his newspaper.[17] In November 
2000, Godfrey announced that he was stepping down as CEO of Sun Media. 
There was some speculation that he was uncomfortable while under the control 
of Quebecor. He remained on the board of Sun Media.[10] In 1984 he was 
appointed to the board of a new crown agency called the Stadium Corporation 
of Ontario along with Larry Grossman and Hugh Macaulay. Its mandate was 
to choose the location and design for a new domed stadium that would eventually 
become the SkyDome.[18] Godfrey stayed on the board until February 1989 
when he resigned. He had been accused of being in a conflict of interest 
because of his involvement with a group lobbying for a NFL franchise in 
Toronto. Godfrey denied that there was any conflict and also denied that 
this had anything to do with his resignation.[19] However, Godfrey remained 
on the board of directors of the Stadium Corporation, a separate entity, 
until 1998 when he resigned shortly before the SkyDome filed for bankruptcy. 
He claimed that his resignation would have no effect on the process. Godfrey 
said "... It didn't make much sense to me to have separate directors and 
shareholder meetings when the shareholders should be making all the decisions ... 
My resignation just streamlines the process."[20] In 2000, Godfrey became 
president and CEO of the Toronto Blue Jays baseball club. He stepped down 
as president on September 22, 2008 after eight years.[4][21] During his 
tenure, the Jays' payroll increased from $46 million US to $98 million 
US. While the Jays posted four out of eight seasons better than .500, they 
achieved no better than 2nd place in the tough American League East division.[22] 
In 2004, the Blue Jays purchased SkyDome for a paltry $25 million, far 
below its original construction cost of $600 million. The purchase gave 
Godfrey more latitude in controlling the total game experience.[23] Godfrey 
was chair of the Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation from 2009 until 
he was fired on May 16, 2013 by Premier Kathleen Wynne.[24] He is also 
a member of the board of directors of CanWest Global Communications,[25] 
RioCan Real Estate Investment Trust, CargoJet Income Fund and Astral.[7]
