The 1996 New York Yankees season was the 94th season for the Yankees. The 
1996 New York Yankees were managed by Joe Torre, and played at Yankee Stadium 
in the Bronx. The team finished first in the American League Eastern Division 
with a record of 92–70, 4 games ahead of the Baltimore Orioles and won 
their first division title since 1981 (the 1994 team had the best record 
in the American League, but the strike took it away). The team defeated 
the Texas Rangers in the American League Division Series, three games to 
one. The Yankees went on to defeat the Orioles in the American League Championship 
Series four games to one. In the 1996 World Series the Yankees beat the 
National League champion Atlanta Braves four games to two, winning four 
consecutive games to overcome a two-games-to-none deficit. The Yankees 
earned their 23rd World Series title and their first since 1978. [1] [2]

Arlington, Texas The Ballpark in Arlington, Arlington, Texas On October 
9, 1996, the Yankees trailed the Orioles 4–3 in the bottom of the eighth 
inning when shortstop Derek Jeter hit a deep fly ball to right field. Right 
fielder Tony Tarasco moved near the fence and appeared "to draw a bead 
on the ball"[20] when then-12 year old fan Jeffrey Maier reached over the 
fence separating the stands and the field of play 9 feet below and deflected 
the ball into the stands. While baseball fans are permitted to catch (and 
keep) balls hit into the stands, if "a spectator reaches out of the stands, 
or goes on the playing field, and touches a live ball"[21] spectator interference 
is to be called. October 20, 1996 at Yankee Stadium in The Bronx, New York
