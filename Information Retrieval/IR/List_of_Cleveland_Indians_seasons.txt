The Cleveland Indians are a professional baseball team based in Cleveland, 
Ohio. They were a founder member of the American League in 1901 as the 
Cleveland Blues and Cleveland Naps, and established themselves in professional 
baseball during the 1900s and 1910s. They won the first of two World Series 
in 1920 at their first attempt. Since then, the Indians have had two major 
periods of success. The first was from 1947 to 1956, when they had winning 
records in every season, including a 111–43 record in 1954, which remains 
the best Major League Baseball regular season record since the 1909 Pirates, 
and won their only other World Series in 1948. The Indians’ other highly 
successful period was from 1994 to 2001, when they had eight consecutive 
winning seasons but were unable to win the World Series, losing in both 
of their appearances during this stretch (1995 and 1997). The Indians have 
also experienced failure in their history. From the split of the American 
League into two divisions in 1969 until 1993, the Indians did not make 
a single postseason appearance and played only four winning seasons. They 
posted 100 losses four times during the era. Since 2002, the Indians have 
had six winning seasons and have appeared in the postseason in three of 
those six years, making a trip to the World Series in 2016. George Burns
