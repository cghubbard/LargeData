Gerald Sidney Davis (born February 22, 1953) is an umpire in Major League 
Baseball. Having worked in the National League from 1982 to 1999, he became 
a member of the unified umpiring staff for Major League Baseball in 2000. 
He has been a crew chief since 1999. He has umpired five World Series, 
nine League Championship Series and eleven League Division Series. He has 
also worked in the All-Star Game four times. Davis has worn uniform number 
12 throughout his career. As of the start of the 2015 season, Davis is 
MLB's second-most senior umpire (after Joe West). Davis began umpiring 
in the minor leagues in 1976. He worked in the Midwest League, Eastern 
League and American Association before being promoted to the majors in 
1982.[1] He has officiated in 21 postseasons, including the World Series 
in 1996, 1999, 2004, 2009 and 2012; the League Championship Series in 1990, 
1992, 1995, 1998, 2000, 2001, 2005, 2010, 2013, and 2014; the Division 
Series in 1996, 1999, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2011, 2012, 
and 2015; and the Wild Card Game in 2013 and 2014. He also umpired the 
All-Star Game in 1989, 1997, 2002 and 2012; he called balls and strikes 
on the last two occasions.[2][3] In the 2014 season, Davis's crew was Phil 
Cuzzi, Brian Knight, and a AAA Fill In Umpire, until Quinn Wolcott was 
officially hired as a full-time umpire in July 2014 due to the retirement 
of Gary Darling.[4] In 2016, his crew includes Sam Holbrook, Rob Drake 
and a AAA Call-Up Umpire. Davis was reprimanded by Major League Baseball 
on September 1, 2014 for making 'crybaby' faces at Oakland A's players. 
The league statement said, "We expect our Umpires to remain professional 
on the field at all times."[5] Davis was the second base umpire for the 
perfect game pitched by Randy Johnson on May 18, 2004. On September 19 
at Tropicana Field, instant replay would overturn a call on the field for 
the first time ever in Major League Baseball. A fly ball hit by Tampa Bay 
Rays' first baseman Carlos Peña, the umpires ruled, was interfered with 
by a fan sitting in the front row of the stands, when the ball hit the 
hands of the fan and fell back onto the field of play. After Joe Maddon 
requested the umpires hold a conference to discuss the play, the umpires, 
headed by Gerry Davis, decided to look at instant replay. Just over four 
minutes later, Davis returned to the field and signaled that the ball was 
a home run. Davis was the home plate umpire for the last game played at 
Shea Stadium on September 28, 2008. With his assignment to the 2012 World 
Series, Davis set an officiating record for most postseason games umpired 
in Major League history with 115 and since then this mark has moved forward 
to 128 games.[6] On April 23, 2014, Davis ejected New York Yankees starting 
pitcher Michael Pineda for having pine tar on his neck.[7] Davis owns a 
company, Gerry Davis Sports, which specializes in umpiring equipment and 
clothing. Gerry Davis Sports sells specially designed leg guards which 
give a small area at the top for the hands to rest, consistent with Davis's 
unique umpiring stance. (When umpiring behind the plate, Davis bends down 
only about three-quarters as far as the conventional stance. He leans his 
back forward slightly and grabs the top of his leg guards with his extended 
arms.) These leg guards also eschew the normal straps with metal hooks, 
in favor of straps with plugs that hook into little notches. List of Major
