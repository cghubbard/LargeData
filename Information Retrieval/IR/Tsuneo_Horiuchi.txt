As player As manager Tsuneo Horiuchi (堀内 恒夫, Horiuchi Tsuneo?, born January 
16, 1948, in Kōfu, Yamanashi) is a former professional baseball player 
in Japan's Nippon Professional Baseball, and a politician. A right-handed 
pitcher, in 2008 he was voted into the Japanese Baseball Hall of Fame.[1] 
Horiuchi played for the Yomiuri Giants his whole career, from 1966–1983; 
he was an integral part of the team's ten Japan Series championships during 
that period (including nine in a row). His first season he went 16-2 with 
a league-leading 1.39 earned run average, winning both the Eiji Sawamura 
Award and the Central League Rookie of the Year award. He led the league 
in winning percentage and also in most bases on balls allowed. He led the 
league in winning percentage again in 1967, going 12-2 to post an amazing 
two-year stretch of 28-4. That year he also threw a no-hitter, against 
the Hiroshima Carp. The next three seasons were all successful. but he 
again led the league in walks all three years. (Horiuchi also gave up 31 
home runs in 1968 to lead the league.) 1972 was Horiuchi's finest season, 
as he went 26-9 with a 2.91 ERA and 26 complete games, again winning the 
Eiji Sawamura Award (this despite the fact he led the league in hits and 
home runs allowed). That year he also won the Central League MVP. In 1974 
Horiuchi led the Central League in complete games with 21. Horiuchi finished 
his career with 203 wins, earning him a spot in Meikyukai. He managed the 
Yomiuri Giants in 2004–2005 (the team went 133-144 under his leadership). 
He has also acted as a TV analyst for Giants broadcasts. Horiuchi stood 
as a candidate of the House of Councillors election, 2010 for the LDP[2] 
but lost. Receiving 101,840 preference votes nationwide, he ranked 13th 
on the LDP list[3] – the party received only twelve proportional seats 
– and was thus the top replacement candidate for a possible kuriage-tōsen, 
i.e. the first candidate to be elected without an additional vote if an 
LDP proportional seat in the 2010 class of Councillors fell vacant. As 
a result, he became a member of the House of Councillors in the proportional 
representation segment of the class of 2010 in August 2013 as the replacement
