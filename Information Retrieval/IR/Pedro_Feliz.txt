Pedro Julio Feliz (born April 27, 1975) is a Dominican former professional 
baseball third baseman in Major League Baseball. Feliz hit 20 or more home 
runs in four of his first five seasons as a starting third baseman and 
was an above average fielder at third base.[1] He spent the first eight 
years of his major league career with the San Francisco Giants (2000 through 
2007) before signing a free agent contract with the Philadelphia Phillies 
in 2008. Feliz was signed by the San Francisco Giants[2] as an amateur 
free agent on February 7, 1994. He spent parts of seven seasons in the 
San Francisco Giants' farm system before being called up to the Giants 
when the rosters expanded in September 2000.[3] Feliz played for the Giants 
from 2000 to 2007, and was their only homegrown position player from 2002 
through 2007.[1] After a few seasons coming off the bench and starting 
occasionally, a number of injuries on the Giants gave Feliz the opportunity 
to become a regular player in 2004. He filled in for regular Edgardo Alfonzo 
for 51 games at third base, played 70 games for the injured J. T. Snow 
at first base, appeared in 20 at shortstop and four in the outfield. With 
the bat, Feliz posted career highs in ((batting average)) (.276), ((home 
runs)) (22), ((RBI)) (84), ((at bats)) (603), and ((games played)) (144). 
Feliz has been moved around defensively throughout, especially during the 
Giants' injury-riddled 2005 season. By 2007, he had settled into the role 
of the Giants' starting third baseman. Although Feliz is a decent power 
hitter, his career batting average prior to the 2006 season was only .255, 
and he draws few walks, having never posted an on-base percentage above 
.305 or an OPS above .793. He has often been criticized for his lack of 
patience at the plate.[1] In 2006, he struck out a career-high 112 times. 
On June 8, 2007, in a game against the Oakland Athletics, Feliz played 
catcher for the first time in his major league career. During that game, 
the Giants' starting catcher Bengie Molina left on a double switch. Their 
backup catcher, Eli√©zer Alfonzo, was injured on a play at the plate and 
had to leave the game in the 10th inning. With the Giants out of position 
players, Feliz moved to catcher, Randy Winn moved from center field to 
third, Dan Ortmeier moved from right field to center, and pitcher Noah 
Lowry came into the game in right. After the season, Feliz was honored 
with a Fielding Bible Award as the best fielding third baseman in MLB in 
2007.[4] He was seeking a 3-year contract extension with the Giants following 
the conclusion of his contract after the 2007 season, but the Giants decided 
against such an offer. Feliz declined salary arbitration and filed for 
free agency.[5] On January 31, 2008, Feliz signed a two-year deal with 
the Philadelphia Phillies.[6] The Giants offered Feliz more guaranteed 
money, but Feliz felt alienated by the Giants' demeanor during negotiations. 
In 2008, struggling with an inflamed lower back, Feliz's power declined 
from previous seasons,[7] but he delivered one of the most important base 
hits in Phillies' history when he batted in Eric Bruntlett to score the 
winning run for the team in its Game 5 World Series clinching win over 
the Tampa Bay Rays. On November 8, 2009, Philadelphia management declined 
Feliz' option for the 2010 season. On December 10, 2009, Feliz signed a 
$4 million 1-year deal with the Houston Astros.[8] On August 19, 2010, 
Feliz was traded to the Cardinals in exchange for cash considerations and 
minor league pitcher David Carpenter. On February 3, 2011, Feliz was signed 
to a minor league deal by the Kansas City Royals, with an invitation to 
Spring training. On March 28, Feliz was released. Feliz signed with the 
Camden Riversharks in the independent leagues on May 13, 2011.[9] On August 
10, 2011, Feliz signed a minor league contract with the San Diego Padres 
and was assigned to the Triple-A Tucson Padres.[10] Pedro returned to the 
Riversharks for the 2012 season.[11][12] Feliz and his wife Niurka Mateo
