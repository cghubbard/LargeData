Mapleton is a neighborhood in Brooklyn, New York City between Bensonhurst 
or Borough Park, and sometimes mixed up with either or both. The area was 
originally part of Borough Park and developed around 1913-1919. It is bounded 
by 16th Avenue on the west, Dahill Road on the east, 57th Street on the 
north, and 65th Street on the south. The Mapleton School is located at 
18th Avenue and 60th Street, and the Brooklyn Public Library has a Mapleton 
Branch at 17th Avenue and 60th Street. The neighborhood of Mapleton was 
sometimes known as Mapleton Park. The park named Mapleton Park, also Mapleton 
Oval, existed from at least 1916 to 1920, located at 62nd Street and 20th 
Avenue. The field was the home of the Mapleton Park Nine baseball team.[1] 
The oval may have been named after an old neighborhood name for the area. 
Today, the legacy of the name Mapleton Park exists in a local synagogue, 
the Young Israel of Mapleton Park, near 65th Street and Bay Parkway (22nd 
Avenue). Mapleton contains Washington Cemetery, the largest inhabited Jewish 
cemetery in New York. Many Orthodox Jews are buried there, as are many 
prominent people. The cemetery is located on Bay Parkway and stretches 
from 59th Street to East 3rd Street. Coordinates: 40°37′05″N 73°58′48″W﻿
