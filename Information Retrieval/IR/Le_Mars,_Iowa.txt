Le Mars is a city in and the county seat of Plymouth County, Iowa, United 
States.[4] It is located on the Floyd River and northeast of Sioux City. 
The population was 9,826 at the 2010 census. Le Mars is the home of Wells 
Enterprises, Inc., perhaps the world's largest producer of ice cream novelties 
in one location and is the self-proclaimed "Ice Cream Capital of the World". 
Wells is best known for its Blue Bunny products. Le Mars was platted in 
1869, but no lots were sold until the Chicago and North Western Transportation 
Company arrived in 1879. According to town legend, CNW investor John I. 
Blair and a group of women arrived at the town, which was then called St. 
Paul Junction. Blair asked the women to name the town, and they submitted 
an acronym based upon their first names' initials: Lucy Underhill, Elizabeth 
Parson, Mary Weare, Anna Blair, Rebecca Smith and Sarah Reynolds.[5] In 
1885, Frederick Brooke Close, a young Englishman who had passed up attending 
Cambridge University to live in Iowa, founded the Northwestern Polo League 
in Le Mars.[6][7] During the Great Depression in 1933, at a time when banks 
were foreclosing on many farmers, Le Mars caught the attention of the nation 
when "over five hundred farmers crowded the court room in Le Mars", according 
to an account by historian Arthur Schlesinger, Jr.. The farmers were there 
to demand that Judge Charles C. Bradley suspend foreclosure proceedings 
until recently-passed laws could be considered. Judge Bradley refused. 
One farmer remarked that the court room wasn't his alone, that farmers 
had paid for it with their taxes. The crowd rushed the judge, slapped him, 
and placed a rope around his neck and a hub cap on his head. They did not, 
however lynch him.[8] Fred H. Wells opened a milk route in Le Mars in 1913. 
By 1925, Wells and his sons had opened an ice cream manufacturing plant 
there. However, the plant (and the Wells name) was purchased by Fairmount 
Ice Cream in 1928. In 1935, Fred and his sons sought to begin selling ice 
cream again, but could no longer use their name. They therefore sponsored 
a “Name That Ice Cream” contest in the Sioux City Journal. The winner of 
the $25 prize suggested "Blue Bunny" because his son had enjoyed seeing 
blue bunnies in department store windows at Easter.[9] Dominating the skyline 
of present-day Le Mars is Wells' Blue Bunny Dairy's 900,000-square-foot 
(84,000 m2) plant with a 12-story tall refrigeration tower called the "South 
Ice Cream Plant" - so-named because it is on the south side of town. As 
of 2005, the plant employed 1,000 and produces 75 million gallons of frozen 
treats, the milk coming mainly coming from three large Iowa dairy farms.[10] 
The size of this plant has led to speculation that the company is the world's 
largest family-owned and managed dairy processor and the world's largest 
manufacturer of ice cream in one location, with Le Mars claiming to be 
the "Ice Cream Capital of the World".[citation needed] President George 
W. Bush came to Le Mars on November 3, 2006, to campaign for Jim Nussle, 
then candidate for Iowa governor.[11] He spoke at Le Mars Community High 
School to a crowd of a couple thousand.[citation needed] Le Mars is located
