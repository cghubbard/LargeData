David Keith Stewart (born February 19, 1957) is an American professional 
baseball executive, pitching coach, sports agent and retired starting pitcher, 
and also served as the general manager of the Arizona Diamondbacks of Major 
League Baseball (MLB). The Los Angeles Dodgers' 16th-round selection in 
the 1975 MLB draft, Stewart's MLB playing career spanned from 1978 through 
1995, winning three World Series championships while compiling a career 
3.95 earned run average (ERA) and a 168–129 won–lost record, including 
winning 20 games in four consecutive seasons. He pitched for the Dodgers, 
Texas Rangers, Philadelphia Phillies, Oakland Athletics, and Toronto Blue 
Jays. Stewart was an MLB All-Star and was known for his postseason performance 
– winning one World Series Most Valuable Player Award and two League Championship 
Series Most Valuable Player Awards – and for staring down batters when 
pitching to them. After his playing career, he served as a pitching coach 
for the San Diego Padres, Milwaukee Brewers, and Blue Jays and as an assistant 
GM. General managers he has worked under include: Sandy Alderson, Kevin 
Towers, Gord Ash, and Dean Taylor. He later became a sports agent based 
in San Diego until the Diamondbacks hired him as GM at the end of the 2014 
season. Stewart was born in Oakland, California. His father, David, was 
a longshoreman and his mother, Nathalie, worked at a cannery.[1] His father 
didn't want Stewart to play sports, because he felt nobody could make a 
living hitting a ball, so his older brother taught him how to play.[1] 
Stewart attended St. Elizabeth High School in Oakland, where he earned 
All-American honors in both baseball (where he played catcher) and in football 
(where he was a linebacker and tight end). He also averaged 16 points per 
game as a small forward on the basketball team.[2][3] He was offered 30 
college scholarships to play football, but turned them all down to sign 
with the Los Angeles Dodgers, who selected him in the 16th round of the 
1975 Major League Baseball draft.[3] The Dodgers decided to turn Stewart 
into a pitcher because of his strong arm.[2] He made his professional debut 
with the Bellingham Dodgers of the Northwest League. He had a 0–5 win–loss 
record with a 5.51 earned run average) (ERA) in 22 games pitched, five 
of which were games started,[4] for a Bellingham team that set a record 
by losing the first 24 games of the season.[5] He was promoted to the Midwest 
League at the end of the 1976 season and with the Clinton Dodgers in 1977 
he had a breakout season: 17–4 with a 2.15 ERA in 24 starts, including 
15 complete games and 3 shutouts.[4] Despite his impressive season, he 
lost out on the Midwest League MVP and Top prospect honors to future Hall 
of Famer Paul Molitor, then with the Burlington Bees.[6] Stewart was promoted 
to the AA San Antonio Dodgers of the Texas League for the 1978 season. 
He was 14–12 with a 3.68 ERA in 28 starts for San Antonio.[4] Stewart made 
his major league debut on September 22, 1978, pitching two innings of relief 
against the San Diego Padres. He allowed only one hit and no runs, while 
striking out one batter (Jim Beswick).[7] That was his only appearance 
for the Dodgers that season and he spent all of the 1979 and 1980 seasons 
in AAA with the Albuquerque Dukes. Despite an 11–12 record and 5.24 ERA 
in 28 games for the Dukes in 1979,[4] Stewart felt he pitched well and 
was disappointed when he did not receive a September call-up.[8] In 1980, 
he was 15-10 with a 3.70 ERA for a Dukes team that won the Pacific Coast 
League (PCL) Championship.[9] He led the PCL in innings pitched (202), 
starts (29) and tied for the lead in wins.[4][8] Stewart went to spring 
training with the Dodgers in 1981. Because he was out of options, the Dodgers 
could not send him back down to the minors without risk of losing him to 
another team. They had decided to release him, but reversed their minds 
and cut Don Stanhouse instead.[10] He made the Dodgers opening day roster[8] 
and pitched in relief that season, appearing in 32 games with a 2.49 ERA 
and six saves. He got his first Major League win in his first appearance 
of the season, on April 13 against the San Francisco Giants, when he worked 
two scoreless innings in relief of Bob Welch.[11] His first save was recorded 
on August 16 against the Atlanta Braves.[12] When the baseball players 
went on strike on June 12, Stewart was hard pressed financially and went 
to work for a Dodger fan that owned a metal fastener business and worked 
out with a semi-pro team along with teammate Bobby Castillo.[8] The Dodgers 
made the playoffs that season and Stewart saw his first taste of post-season 
action, being credited as the losing pitcher in the first two games of 
the Division Series against the Houston Astros. He allowed a walk-off homer 
to Alan Ashby in game one[13] and allowing the winning runs to reach base 
in the eleventh inning of game two.[14] He redeemed himself by not allowing 
a run in the two games he appeared in for the Dodgers in the 1981 World 
Series against the New York Yankees, which the Dodgers won in six games.[15] 
He spent time as both a starter and a reliever in 1982, appearing in 45 
games (starting 14 of them) and was 9–8 with a 3.81 ERA.[16] The Dodgers 
almost traded Stewart to the Texas Rangers after the 1982 season in a package 
for catcher Jim Sundberg, however, Sundberg wouldn't waive his no-trade 
clause and the deal fell apart.[17] In 1983, he appeared in 46 games for 
the Dodgers, all but one as a relief pitcher, with a 5–2 record and a 2.96 
ERA.[16] On July 11, he was part of a play that Dodgers Manager Tommy Lasorda 
called one of the "craziest" moments he'd ever seen, when three runs scored 
on a wild pitch.[18] On August 19, 1983, the Dodgers traded Stewart with 
a player to be named later (Ricky Wright) to the Rangers for Rick Honeycutt. 
The trade was controversial at the time, in that many felt that Rangers 
GM Joe Klein had gotten too little for the teams best pitcher at the time.[19] 
The Rangers placed him in the starting rotation and he made eight starts 
down the stretch for them. He was 5–2 with a 2.14 ERA.[16] In 1984, however, 
he struggled. He produced a 7–14 record and a 4.73 ERA in 27 starts before 
losing his rotation spot.[16][17] Tom House joined the organization in 
January 1985 as the team's new pitching coach. He decided that Stewart 
needed a new pitch and started teaching him a split-fingered fastball.[17] 
He became a relief pitcher for the Rangers in 1985, but the results were 
not good. On May 22 he gave up a three-run homer to Jorge Orta of the Kansas 
City Royals, giving up the lead. The home fans booed him off the field 
and after the game he called the fans "idiots" and challenged them to come 
on to the field and do his job for him.[17] The team's new General Manager, 
Tom Grieve, fined Stewart $500 for his remarks, but that wasn't enough 
for the Rangers owner Eddie Chiles, who demanded that Grieve trade him.[17] 
After finding a weak market for him, the Rangers finally managed to trade 
Stewart to the Philadelphia Phillies on September 13, 1985, for pitcher 
Rick Surhoff.[17] In 42 games for the Rangers in 1985, he was 0–6 with 
a 5.42 ERA.[16] In the off season, he negotiated with the Yomiuri Giants 
of Nippon Professional Baseball,[20] but they did not agree to terms on 
a contract so he re-signed with the Phillies.[21] Stewart appeared in 12 
games for the team over parts of the 1985 and 1986 seasons, recording a 
6.00 ERA.[16] There were rumors that Stewart was pitching hurt but they 
released him on May 9, 1986.[17] He later said that the Phillies lied to 
him, that they had said if he kept his nose clean he would get somewhere, 
but instead he was released.[22] Stewart had a try-out with the Baltimore 
Orioles but they told him they didn't even have a spot for him in Double-A.[22] 
He wound up signing a free agent contract with the Oakland Athletics on 
May 23, 1986.[22] After one game with The Triple-A Tacoma Tigers,[4] Stewart 
joined the A's roster. In a game on July 1, he punched Pat Corrales, the 
manager of the Cleveland Indians, during a game, which initiated a bench-clearing 
brawl.[23] He was suspended four games and fined for his actions.[24] Also 
in 1986, Stewart developed a forkball to supplement his fastball and slider.[25] 
He pitched in 29 games for the Athletics in 1986, with 17 starts. He was 
9–5 with a 3.74 ERA.[16] Stewart signed a two-year $500,000 contract with 
the Athletics prior to the 1987 season.[26] He won 20 games in 1987, while 
posting a 3.68 ERA and striking out 205 batters.[16] He credited pitching 
coach Dave Duncan with helping improve his pitches.[26] In 1988 he won 
his first eight games[27] and claimed the Major League Baseball Pitcher 
of the Month Award.[28] He went 21–12, 3.23 ERA while leading the American 
League (AL) with 14 complete games and 275 2⁄3 innings pitched.[16] Stewart 
started two games in the A's four game sweep of the Boston Red Sox in the 
1988 American League Championship Series.[29] After the series, his manager 
Tony La Russa said he had "never met a player or person of higher quality."[30] 
Stewart was the starting pitcher in Game one of the 1988 World Series against 
the Dodgers. Prior to the game, he told Dodgers' second baseman Steve Sax 
that he was going to hit him in the neck during the game. He came close, 
drilling Sax in the left shoulder and glaring at him.[31] He allowed three 
runs in eight innings and was in line for the win before Kirk Gibson's 
walk-off homer off closer Dennis Eckersley gave the game to the Dodgers.[32] 
Working on three days rest, Stewart wasn't as good in Game four, allowing 
four runs (only two earned) and leaving the game with one out in the sixth 
to pick up the loss.[33] The Dodgers finished off their championship with 
a win in Game five.[34] In 1989, Stewart was 21–9 with a 3.32 ERA in 36 
starts.[16] His manager, La Russa, was also the manager of the American 
League team at the All-Star Game and picked Stewart to start for the AL 
team over fan favorite Nolan Ryan.[35] He allowed two runs to score in 
his one inning of work in the game.[36] He finished second in the voting 
for the American League Cy Young Award to Kansas City Royals pitcher Bret 
Saberhagen.[37] In the 1989 American League Championship Series, Stewart 
won both of the games he pitched with a 2.81 ERA.[38] In the World Series, 
Stewart pitched a complete game shutout in the first game against the San 
Francisco Giants.[39] The series was interrupted when a earthquake struck 
the Bay Area just prior to the start of Game 3.[40][41] When the series 
resumed, 10 days later, Stewart started game three for the A's, and picked 
up his second win of the series when he allowed three runs in seven innings.[42] 
The A's swept the series in four games and Stewart was selected as the 
MVP of the series.[43] Stewart signed a new two-year $7 million contract 
extension with the Athletics after the season. This was the largest contract 
in baseball at the time.[44] In 1990, Stewart was 22–11 (his fourth straight 
20-win season) with a 2.56 ERA in 36 starts. He led the league in innings 
pitched (267), complete games (11) and shutouts (4) while being second 
in ERA and finishing third in the Cy Young voting.[16] On June 29, he no-hit 
the Toronto Blue Jays, at SkyDome, the first no-hitter by an African American 
since Jim Bibby in 1973.[45] That same day, Fernando Valenzuela of the 
Dodgers no-hit the St. Louis Cardinals at Dodger Stadium – the first time 
in Major League history that no-hitters had been thrown in both leagues 
on the same day.[46] The A's won their third straight pennant, beating 
the Boston Red Sox in the American League Championship Series, and Stewart 
was named the ALCS MVP going 2–0 with a 1.13 ERA.[47] Stewart got the start 
in Game one of the 1990 World Series for the heavily favored A's against 
the Cincinnati Reds. However, Eric Davis hit a two run home run off him 
in the first inning and he only lasted four innings as the Reds pulled 
off the upset.[48] He pitched better in game four, allowing only one earned 
run while pitching a complete game.. but the Reds won the game and finished 
off a sweep of the series.[49] After the 1990 season, Stewart was part 
of a Major League All-Star team that played an eight-game series in Japan 
against a Japanese all-star team.[50] He went on the disabled list for 
the first time in his career in 1991 because of a strained rib muscle,[51] 
which caused him to miss three weeks of the season. When he returned he 
was not as dominant as he had been before.[52] His troubles were partly 
because of an inability to throw his forkball for strikes and as a result 
he was pitching with less confidence.[53] In 35 starts, Stewart finished 
11–11 with a high 5.18 ERA in 1991 and the Athletics missed the playoffs 
for the first time since 1987.[16] Stewart was bothered by elbow tendinitis 
for much of the 1992 season[54] but still made 31 starts (his fewest since 
1986) and had a 12–10 record and 3.66 ERA.[16] The A's returned to the 
playoffs, but this time were seen as underdogs to the Toronto Blue Jays 
in the American League Championship Series.[54] Stewart started the opener 
of the series and pitched 7.2 innings while allowing only three runs in 
a game the A's won.[55] The A's lost the next three games and were on the 
verge of elimination, so he called a team meeting in order to give his 
teammates a pep talk.[56] He responded by pitching a complete game victory 
in game five, allowing only two hits.[57] It was the first complete game 
victory in an ALCS game since Bruce Hurst of the Boston Red Sox pitched 
one in 1986 against the California Angels.[58] However, the Blue Jays won 
the next game to take the series and eliminate the A's from the post-season.[59] 
Stewart signed a two-year, $8.5 million contract with the Blue Jays on 
December 8, 1992. He said that he was sad to leave the A's, whom he had 
envisioned spending the rest of his career with, but he felt the Blue Jays 
treated him with more respect with their offer.[60] He said that the A's 
General Manager, Sandy Alderson, was disrespectful of him and all he had 
done for Oakland and was insulted that he was accused of disloyalty when 
he signed with the Blue Jays.[61] As a member of the Blue Jays rotation 
in 1993, Stewart made 26 starts and was 12–8 with a 4.44 ERA.[16] He suffered 
from a number of injuries during the season but the Blue Jays stuck with 
him because of his heart and competitiveness as well as the support he 
offered to other pitchers on the staff.[61] The Blue Jays made it to the 
ALCS where Stewart got the call in game two. He allowed only one run in 
six innings of work to pick up the win.[62] The day before his next start, 
while the rest of his team was already in Chicago, he was in Toronto helping 
the Salvation Army deliver food to the homeless on Thanksgiving Day in 
Canada.[63] He made it to the game on time, and pitched 7.1 innings for 
his second win of the series, in the clinching game six that sent the Blue 
Jays back to the World Series.[64] He was selected as ALCS MVP for the 
second time in his career.[65] In the 1993 World Series against the Philadelphia 
Phillies, Stewart got the start in game two and struggled, allowing five 
runs in six innings to take a rare post-season loss.[66] Nevertheless, 
he was confident heading into his next start, in game six, saying he was 
pitching for respect as much as for another championship.[61] He allowed 
four runs in six innings but that was enough as the Blue Jays, thanks to 
a three-run walk-off homer by Joe Carter won the game 8–6 and with it took 
the series, 4 games to 2.[67] Stewart remained with the Blue Jays for the 
1994 season, making 22 starts for them with a 7–8 record and 5.87 ERA[16] 
before the 1994–95 Baseball strike wiped out the rest of the season. He 
had planned to retire at the end of the season but was bothered by the 
lack of empathy on the part of the fans towards the players.[68] He would 
later say that he never felt the same passion for baseball after the strike.[69] 
When the strike finally ended, he re-signed with the Athletics on April 
8, 1995 and was their opening day starter on April 26, 1995. However, he 
could not recapture his prior form. Stewart was rocked for nine runs and 
was removed from the game with only one out in the second inning.[70] In 
16 starts, he was 3–7 with a 6.89 ERA,[16] prompting the manager to announce 
publicly that Stewart would move to the bullpen for the first time since 
1986 and be replaced in the rotation by Todd van Poppel.[71] Stewart chose 
to retire rather than make the move to the pen. He made the public announcement 
on July 24, 1995, saying it was a low point in his life and he just couldn't 
perform like he wanted to anymore.[71][72] Over his career, he started 
18 games in the postseason, compiling a stellar 2.84 ERA and 10–6 record. 
In the LCS, he was especially dominant, going 8–0.[16] Stewart served as 
the assistant to Sandy Alderson, the general manager of the Athletics, 
in 1996.[73] In 1997, he left that position to serve in a similar capacity 
under Kevin Towers of the San Diego Padres.[74] In 1998, he agreed to become 
the Padres' pitching coach, despite some worry that it would detract from 
his goal of becoming a GM and some personal conflict between him and team 
president Larry Lucchino.[74] He turned around a pitching staff that had 
been awful the year before and helped get the team into the World Series. 
Several of the Padres pitchers (including Andy Ashby, Sterling Hitchcock 
and Joey Hamilton) credited Stewart directly with the improvement of the 
staff.[75] He maintained some of his front office duties, including running 
the Latin America scouting department, during the season and often remarked 
that he would leave for the right front office position.[76] Stewart left 
San Diego after the season and interviewed for assistant GM positions with 
Oakland and the Florida Marlins. He was a finalist to replace Frank Wren 
in Florida but his concern about the high crime rate in South Florida led 
him to turn down the position. His familiarity with the Blue Jays organization 
was the main reason he accepted the job there under Gord Ash.[77] When 
the Blue Jays fired pitching coach Rick Langford in the middle of the 2000 
season, Stewart moved into the position on July 24, 2000.[78] After the 
2001 season, when the Blue Jays had an opening at general manager, they 
passed on Stewart, hiring J. P. Ricciardi instead. Stewart chose to resign 
from his dual role as pitching coach and assistant general manager. He 
was outspoken about the fact that he felt minorities were being discriminated 
against in the front office and that the decision by team president Paul 
Godfrey was racist. Frustrated, he said, "I think the whole process is 
a waste of time."[79] He joined the Milwaukee Brewers as their pitching 
coach for the 2002 season under manager Davey Lopes. After the team started 
3–12, Lopes was fired and Stewart was a candidate to replace him but it 
instead went to bench coach Jerry Royster.[80] He resigned on July 29, 
2002 in order to care for his mother and spend more time with family.[81] 
After leaving that position he was the pitching coach for the United States 
national baseball team at the Olympic Qualifying tournament.[82] Stewart 
started a sports agency called Sports Management Partners. His first big 
deal was negotiating a six-year $66 million contract extension between 
the A's and third baseman Eric Chavez. He also negotiated contracts for 
Matt Kemp and Chad Billingsley.[83][84] On September 25, 2014, the Arizona 
Diamondbacks hired Stewart to become their general manager, replacing Towers. 
He reports to La Russa, his former manager when he played for Oakland, 
who serves as the Diamondbacks' chief baseball officer.[85] He transferred 
his management company to former A's teammate Dave Henderson when he took 
the Diamondbacks job.[86] On December 4, 2015, the Diamondbacks agreed 
to a six-year contract with free agent pitcher Zack Greinke worth a total 
of $206.5 million. At that time, it held the highest annual average value 
in MLB, exceeding $34.4 million per year, and was also the largest contract 
by total value in team history.[87] Stewart later said of the contract, 
"It could be franchise-changing for us, if everything goes well."[88] Stewart 
and his ex-wife, Vanessa, have two children, Adrian and Alyse.[1] In 1985, 
Stewart was arrested on suspicion of lewd conduct with a prostitute later 
revealed to be a transvestite.[89] After pleading no contest to a lesser 
charge of soliciting a prostitute, Stewart's judgment was a fine, probation, 
and a suspended sentence.[90] Stewart later admitted he was ashamed of
