Paul John Quantrill (born November 3, 1968) is a former Major League Baseball 
right-handed relief pitcher. He earned a reputation for being very durable 
and having impeccable control. He regularly appeared in 80 or more games 
a season and did not walk more than 25 batters in a season since 1996. 
Commentators often joked that he had a "rubber arm". Quantrill was drafted 
in 1986 by the Los Angeles Dodgers in the 26th round, 660th overall, and 
again by the Boston Red Sox in the sixth round of the 1989 amateur draft, 
161st overall, and made his Major League debut on July 20, 1992. Originally 
considered a starter, Quantrill eventually found consistency as a reliever 
after several years of splitting time between the bullpen and the starting 
rotation for several teams. Some of his best years came for the Toronto 
Blue Jays, a team located in his home province of Ontario. Quantrill allowed 
a game-winning home run to Boston Red Sox DH David Ortiz in Game 4 of the 
2004 American League Championship Series. Boston avoided elimination in 
this game and went on to win its first World Series in 86 years. Before 
the 2004 season, Quantrill signed a two-year $6.8-million deal with the 
New York Yankees. Due to poor performance, arguably due to overuse by Joe 
Torre, in late 2004 and early 2005, Quantrill was designated for assignment 
on July 1, 2005. The next day he was traded to the San Diego Padres for 
pitchers Tim Redding and Darrell May.[1] Quantrill was then traded to the 
Florida Marlins and spent the rest of the year in the bullpen. In the middle 
of March while playing in the Baseball World Classic, Quantrill said he 
would retire at the end of the World Baseball Classic. Quantrill was one 
of the coaches for Team Canada during the 2009 World Baseball Classic. 
On June 19, 2010, Quantrill was inducted, along with former Blue Jay Roberto 
Alomar, into the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame in St. Marys, Ontario.[2] 
Since retirement, Quantrill lives in Port Hope, Ontario.[3] His son Cal 
was a pitcher at Stanford University[4][5] and was selected in the first 
round, eight overall, in the 2016 Major League Baseball draft by the San 
Diego Padres.[6] As of June 2016, Quantrill serves as a Special Assistant
