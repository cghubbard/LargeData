Alfred John Smith (October 12, 1907 – April 28, 1977) was an American professional 
baseball baseball player, a left-handed pitcher for the New York Giants 
(1934–1937), Philadelphia Phillies (1938–1939) and Cleveland Indians (1940–1945) 
of Major League Baseball. Smith is remembered for being the starting pitcher 
who halted Joe DiMaggio's 56-consecutive-game hitting streak on July 17, 
1941. DiMaggio grounded out twice to third baseman Ken Keltner, who made 
outstanding defensive plays in each case, and also drew a base on balls 
from Smith in three plate appearances. Then, in his final at bat, against 
relief pitcher Jim Bagby, Jr., DiMaggio bounced into a double play. His 
New York Yankees won the game, however, 4–3.[1] Smith also is notable for 
having served as a nominal coach at age 25 on manager Bill Terry's New 
York Giants staff in 1933—the year before Smith made his debut as an active 
player in the Major Leagues. In 1932, Smith had won 17 games in the Class 
B Piedmont League and was acquired by the Giants. But Terry, realizing 
he had no room on his 1933 pitching staff, decided to keep Smith on his 
ball club as a coach and batting practice pitcher, rather than risk losing 
him in the minor league draft. According to the Associated Press in a January 
5, 1934, story, "Smith was tabbed as great prospect last spring, but Terry 
had so many experienced moundsmen to bank upon that there was no place 
for the young portsider. Rather than farm him out where he might have been 
grabbed by some rival club, the Giants elected to carry him as a coach."[2] 
The same story claims that the 1933 World Champion Giant hitters struggled 
against Smith's "wide breaking curves" whenever he was called upon to pitch 
batting practice.[2] He made his Major League pitching debut on May 5, 
1934, against the Pittsburgh Pirates at Forbes Field and allowed one run 
in two innings pitched in relief of Freddie Fitzsimmons.[3] Born in Belleville, 
Illinois, the 5 ft 11 in (1.80 m), 180 lb (82 kg) Smith had a 17-year professional 
career. He helped the Giants win the 1936 and 1937 National League pennants 
and appeared in relief in the 1936 and 1937 World Series, both against 
the Yankees, allowing four earned runs in 3⅓ innings pitched. He led the 
NL in shutouts (four) in 1936. Smith's best season was in 1943, when he 
was named to the American League All-Star team and finished 15th in voting 
for the AL MVP Award for having a 17–7 win–loss record in 29 games (27 
started), 14 complete games, three shutouts, two games finished, one save, 
208⅓ innings pitched, 186 hits allowed, 74 runs allowed, 59 earned runs 
allowed, seven home runs allowed, 72 bases on balls, 72 strikeouts, 862 
batters faced, a 2.55 earned run average and a 1.238 WHIP. In 12 seasons 
he had a 99–101 record, 356 games (202 started), 75 complete games, 16 
shutouts, 96 games finished, 17 saves, 1,662⅓ innings pitched, 1,707 hits 
allowed, 827 runs allowed, 688 earned runs allowed, 94 home runs allowed, 
587 walks allowed—and the same number of strikeouts—as well as 32 hit batsmen, 
27 wild pitches, 7,112 batters faced, 3 balks, a 3.72 ERA and a 1.380 WHIP. 
Al Smith died in Brownsville, Texas, at the age of 69. He is not to be 
confused with Alfred Kendricks Smith, a right-handed pitcher who appeared
