Louisiana Superdome (1975–2011) The Mercedes-Benz Superdome, often referred 
to simply as the Superdome, is a domed sports and exhibition venue located 
in the Central Business District of New Orleans, Louisiana, United States. 
It primarily serves as the home venue for the New Orleans Saints of the 
National Football League (NFL), and is also the home stadium for the Sugar 
Bowl and New Orleans Bowl in college football. Plans were drawn up in 1967 
by the New Orleans modernist architectural firm of Curtis and Davis and 
the building opened as the Louisiana Superdome in 1975. Its steel frame 
covers a 13-acre (5.3 ha) expanse and the 273-foot (83 m) dome is made 
of a lamellar multi-ringed frame and has a diameter of 680 feet (210 m), 
making it the largest fixed domed structure in the world.[7] It is adjacent 
to the Smoothie King Center. Because of the building's size and location 
in one of the major tourist destinations of the United States, the Superdome 
routinely hosts major sporting events, including the Super Bowl, College 
Football Championship Game, and the Final Four in college basketball. The 
stadium was also the long-time home of the Tulane Green Wave football team 
of Tulane University until 2013 and was the home venue of the New Orleans 
Jazz of the National Basketball Association (NBA) from 1975 until 1979. 
The Superdome gained international attention of a different type in 2005 
when it housed thousands of people seeking shelter from Hurricane Katrina. 
The building suffered extensive damage as a result of the storm, and was 
closed for many months afterward. It was eventually decided the building 
would be fully refurbished and reopened in time for the Saints' 2006 home 
opener on September 25. On October 3, 2011, it was announced that German 
automaker Mercedes-Benz purchased naming rights to the stadium. The new 
name took effect on October 23, 2011.[8] At that time, it was the third 
stadium that has naming rights from Mercedes-Benz (and first in the United 
States), after the Mercedes-Benz Arena, the stadium of Bundesliga club 
VfB Stuttgart, in Stuttgart, Germany, and the Mercedes-Benz Arena in Shanghai, 
China. Atlanta's Mercedes-Benz Stadium, set to open in 2017, will become 
the fourth stadium (and second in the NFL) to bear the name of the German 
automaker. The Superdome is located on 70 acres (28 ha) of land, including 
the former Girod Street Cemetery. The dome has an interior space of 125,000,000 
cubic feet (3,500,000 m3), a height of 253 feet (77.1 m), a dome diameter 
of 680 feet (207.3 m), and a total floor area of 269,000 square feet (24,991 m2). 
The Superdome has a listed football seating capacity of 76,468 (expanded) 
or 73,208 (not expanded) and a maximum basketball seating capacity of 73,432. 
However, published attendance figures from events such as the Sugar Bowl 
football game have exceeded 79,000. The basketball capacity does not reflect 
the NCAA's new policy on arranging the basketball court on the 50-yard 
line on the football field, per 2009 NCAA policy.[9] In 2011, 3,500 seats 
were added, increasing the Superdome's capacity to 76,468. The Superdome's 
capacity was 75,167 for WWE WrestleMania XXX.[citation needed] The actual 
capacity is 73,208 people. The chronology of the capacity for football 
is as follows: The Superdome's primary tenant is the NFL's New Orleans 
Saints. The team regularly draws capacity crowds.[27] The NFL has hosted 
seven Super Bowls at the Superdome, most recently Super Bowl XLVII in 2013. 
The 1976 Pro Bowl was held at the Superdome on Monday, January 26, 1976. 
It was the NFL's 26th annual all-star game.[28] Tulane University played 
their home games at the stadium from 1975 to 2013 (except 2005) before 
moving to on-campus Yulman Stadium.[29] The BCS National Championship Game 
was played at the Superdome four times. The College Football Playoff semifinal 
game is played every three years in the stadium. Two other bowl games are 
also played there annually: the Sugar Bowl and New Orleans Bowl. The Superdome 
also hosts the Bayou Classic, a major regular-season game between two of 
the state's historically black colleges and universities, Grambling State 
and Southern. In 2013, the Arena Football League New Orleans VooDoo played 
their last six home games of the season at the stadium. From 1991 to 1992 
the New Orleans Night of the AFL played at the stadium. The annual Louisiana 
Prep Classic state championship football games organized by the Louisiana 
High School Athletic Association have been held at the Superdome since 
1981, except in 2005 following the extreme damage of Hurricane Katrina. 
The first state championship game in the stadium matched New Orleans Catholic 
League powers St. Augustine and Jesuit on December 15, 1978. The Purple 
Knights won their second Class AAAA title in four seasons by ousting the 
Blue Jays 13-7 in front of over 42,000 fans. Home field advantage Since 
the Superdome's reopening in the wake of Hurricane Katrina and the increased 
success of the New Orleans Saints, the Superdome has developed a reputation 
for having a very strong home field advantage. While all domed stadiums 
possess this quality to some degree, the Superdome is known to get extremely 
loud during games, especially during offensive drives by the visiting team. 
During a pregame interview before the Minnesota Vikings' opening game of 
the 2010 NFL season against the Saints, Brett Favre, reflecting on the 
Vikings' loss to the Saints in the 2009–10 NFC Championship Game, said 
of the Superdome: "That was, by far, the most hostile environment I've 
ever been in. You couldn't hear anything." It was during that loss that 
some of the Vikings players elected to wear earplugs, including Favre. 
It was the first game of the season that they had chosen to do so.[30] 
When the plaza level seats remained moveable, the capacity for baseball 
was 63,525 and the field size was as followed: 325 feet to both left field 
and right field, 365 feet to both left-center field and right-center field, 
421 feet to center field, and 60 feet to the backstop. Due to the reconfiguration 
of the lower bowl that began in 2011, the stadium can no longer host baseball 
games. The first baseball game in the Superdome was an exhibition between 
the Minnesota Twins and the Houston Astros on April 6, 1976.[31] Superdome 
officials pursued negotiations with Oakland Athletics officials during 
the 1978–79 baseball off-season about moving the Athletics to the Superdome. 
The Athletics were unable to break their lease at the Oakland–Alameda County 
Coliseum and remained in Oakland.[32] Superdome officials met with the 
Pittsburgh Pirates in April 1981 about moving the club to New Orleans when 
the Pirates were unhappy with their lease at Three Rivers Stadium.[33] 
Minor League Baseball The American Association New Orleans Pelicans played 
at the Superdome during the 1977 season. The Pelicans' season attendance 
was 217,957 at the dome.[34] Major League Baseball Exhibitions The Minnesota 
Twins and the Houston Astros played an exhibition game on April 6, 1976.[31] 
The New York Yankees played exhibition games at the Superdome in 1980, 
1981, 1982, and 1983. The Yankees hosted the Baltimore Orioles on March 
15 and 16, 1980. 45,152 spectators watched the Yankees beat the Orioles 
9–3 on March 15, 1980. The following day, 43,339 fans saw Floyd Rayford 
lead the Orioles to a 7–1 win over the Yankees.[35] In 1981, the Yankees 
played the New York Mets, Philadelphia Philles and Pittsburgh Pirates in 
the dome. In 1982, the Yankees played the Montreal Expos and Texas Rangers 
and late in 1982, the Yankees considered opening the 1983 regular season 
at the Superdome if Yankee Stadium would not be ready yet after renovations.[36] 
The 1983 New York Yankees also played the Montreal Expos and Toronto Blue 
Jays in the Superdome that year.[37] The Philadelphia Phillies and St. 
Louis Cardinals closed the 1984 spring training season with two games at 
the dome on March 31, 1984 and April 1, 1984.[38] In what was a preview 
of the 1989 World Series, the Oakland A's played the San Francisco Giants 
in two games on March 28–29, 1989.[39] In 1991, the Los Angeles Dodgers 
played the Oakland A's in two games on March 22–23, 1991. The A's also 
played the New York Mets in two contests on March 26–27, 1993. In 1994, 
the Boston Red Sox played the New York Yankees in two games on April 1–2, 
1994. The last professional baseball games played in the Superdome occurred 
on April 3–4, 1999, when the Chicago Cubs and Minnesota Twins played a 
two-game series dubbed the "New Orleans Major League Baseball Classic."[39] 
Busch Challenge/Winn-Dixie Showdown The Busch Challenge/Winn-Dixie Showdown 
was a college baseball tournament held in the Superdome from 1987 to 1999. 
LSU, Tulane and University of New Orleans played an in-state team and out-of-state 
teams from Alabama, Arkansas, California, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, 
North Carolina, Oklahoma and Texas in the annual tournament. The in-state 
team was Louisiana-Lafayette. The out-of-state teams were Alabama, Arkansas, 
Auburn, Cal State Fullerton, Duke, Florida, Florida State, Georgia, Georgia 
Southern, Georgia Tech, Houston, Lamar, Miami (FL), Mississippi State, 
NC State, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Oklahoma State, Ole Miss, Oral Roberts, 
South Alabama, Southern California, Southern Mississippi, Texas A&M, UCLA.[40] 
The NCAA has hosted the Men's Final Four at the Superdome five times in 
1982, 1987, 1993, 2003, and 2012. The stadium hosted regional semifinals 
and finals in 1981 and 1990, as well as first- and second-round games in 
1999 and 2001. The NBA's New Orleans Jazz used the Superdome as their home 
court, from 1975 to 1979. In 1977, the Jazz set a then-record in attendance 
for an NBA game, with 35,077 watching the Jazz led by Pete "Pistol Pete" 
Maravich against the Philadelphia 76ers,[41] led by fellow future Hall 
of Famer Julius Erving. Tulane used the Superdome as its primary home court 
from its opening in 1975 through 1982. It played occasional games there 
in the 1990s against high-profile opponents before the opening of the New 
Orleans Arena in 1999. On October 14, 1975, the Dome hosted Muhammad Ali 
Appreciation Day. The Muhammad Temple of Islam 46 in New Orleans organized 
the activities, with Ali's appearance as the day's highlight. Speakers 
included Dr. Na'im Akbar, Wallace D. Muhammad and Louis Farrakhan.[42] 
The Superdome hosted the September 15, 1978 fight some called the Ali rematch 
where Muhammad Ali won the world Heavyweight title for the third time by 
beating Leon Spinks in front of a crowd of 65,000. It was Ali's last professional 
win. Leonard–Durán II, also known as the No Más Fight, took place on November 
25, 1980 at the Louisiana Superdome. In the match, Sugar Ray Leonard defeated 
Roberto Durán to regain the WBC Welterweight Championship. The match gained 
its famous appellation in the end of the eighth round when Durán turned 
away from Leonard, towards the referee and quit by saying "No más" (Spanish 
for "No more"). On December 3, 1982, the Superdome hosted the Carnival 
of Champions. In the first of two co-main events, Wilfredo Gómez would 
defend his WBC world Jr Featherweight championship against WBC's world 
Bantamweight champion Lupe Pintor. In the second, Wilfred Benítez defended 
his WBC world Jr Middleweight championship against the former WBA Welterweight 
champion of the world Thomas Hearns.[43] The USSR National Gymnastics Team 
performed for the first time in Louisiana in 1976. The Superdome event 
featured Olga Korbut, Nelli Kim, Nicolai Andrianov and Alexander Dityatin. 
At the 1995 U.S. Gymnastics National Championships,[44] Dominique Moceanu 
became the youngest Women's All-Around National Champion in U.S. history 
at 13 years old, a record that still stands.[45] John Roethlisberger also 
won his fourth and final U.S. Men's All-Around National Championship. In 
2017, The all-star Gymnastics classic will be held at the dome. This will 
be the first time a gymnastic meet to be held in the state of Louisiana 
after the second all-star gymnastic classic is held in Atlanta in 2018. 
It is said to be one of the largest gymnastic event in U.S. history. The 
venue is also sometimes used for Monster Jam. The Superdome hosted an AMA 
Supercross Championship round from 1977 to 1980, 1998 to 2002, 2009 and 
2012. On June 4, 1977, 40,000 fans watched Jimmy Weinert win the sixth 
of 12 races for a $250,000 purse. 20 million pounds of dirt were piled 
into the center of the Superdome for the event.[46] The Superdome was scheduled 
to host a rugby union match on August 1, 2015 between English Premiership 
team Saracens and New Zealand's Super Rugby team Crusaders.[47] The match 
was organized by RugbyLaw, organizers of the National Rugby Football League. 
The match was cancelled, however, as USA Rugby, the governing body of the 
sport in the United States, refused to approve the artificial turf playing 
surface.[48] The first soccer match to be held in the Superdome, on September 
5, 1976, pitted New Orleans local club teams, The Costa Rica Soccer Club 
and The Olympia Soccer Club. This match was immediately followed by the 
second soccer match to be held in the Superdome which pitted The New York 
Cosmos and the Dallas Tornado. The Brazilian star Pelé and Kyle Rote, Jr. 
led their respective teams. The USWNT played their Final Victory Tour game 
against China on December 16, 2015 in what was the final match for Abby 
Wambach. China won 1-0 with the attendance of 32,950, making it a record 
setting attendance for a soccer match in Louisiana. The Superdome was renowned 
for hosting many of Mid-South Wrestling's large, "Blow Off" events that 
were culminations of weeks or months of feuds and rivalries. Bill Watts 
was the promoter of this territory and gained much notoriety from promotion 
of his events in the Superdome. April 19, 1986 saw Jim Crockett Promotions 
(in association with Bill Watts' UWF and All Japan Pro Wrestling) host 
the first of three annual Jim Crockett Sr. Memorial Cup Tag Team Tournaments. 
24 teams competed in a single day show with an afternoon 1st rounds and 
finals in the evening. The tournament final saw The Road Warriors prevail 
over Magnum T.A. and Ron Garvin. Besides tag team tournament the Superdome 
attendance of 13,000 saw NWA World Champion Ric Flair retain the title 
via disqualification from Dusty Rhodes and Mid-South North American Champion 
Hacksaw Jim Duggan beat Buzz Sawyer. The 30th annual WrestleMania pay-per-view 
event, WrestleMania XXX, was held at the Superdome on April 6, 2014. This 
was the first time WWE held its annual event in New Orleans. At the event, 
The Undertaker's WrestleMania winning streak was ended by Brock Lesnar 
in front of 75,167 in attendance. Also, Daniel Bryan won two matches. The 
first match was won against Triple H for a spot in the Triple Threat match 
for the WWE World Heavyweight Championship, which he went on to win later 
in the evening against Randy Orton and Batista.[49] The Superdome held 
its official dedication ceremonies on August 3, 1975. Jazz musicians Al 
Hirt and Pete Fountain played for the event. Between August 28 and September 
14, 1975, the Superdome continued to celebrate its grand opening, with 
appearances by Bob Hope, Chayl Jhuren, Telly Savalas, Dorothy Lamour, Karen 
Valentine, and Raquel Welch. The Allman Brothers, the Marshall Tucker band, 
Wet Willie, the Charlie Daniels band, the O'Jays, the Isley Brothers, the 
Temptations, Donald Byrd and the Blackbyrds, and the Ringling Brothers 
and Barnum & Bailey Circus also performed.[50] On October 3, 1975, June 
Carter, Johnny Cash, Merle Haggard, Waylon Jennings and Jessi Colter performed 
in the Dome. Fans included then Governor Edwin Edwards, wife Elaine, children 
Anna, Victoria, Steven and David, and Edwards' grandhcildren.[51] The Superdome's 
1977 New Year's Eve celebration opened with The Emotions and Deniece Williams, 
followed by Earth, Wind and Fire. On May 29, 1977, the First Annual Superdome 
KOOL Jazz Spectacular featured Aretha Franklin, Al Green, The Spinners 
and The Mighty Clouds of Joy. Jimmie "J.J." Walker from the TV series "Good 
Times" was the guest M.C. On December 5, 1981, a concert by The Rolling 
Stones attracted more than 87,500 spectators, with attendees filling in 
the floor area, as well as the regular seating sections.[52] Governor Edwin 
Edwards held his third inaugural ball at the Superdome March 12, 1984. 
Headline acts included Doug Kershaw and Susan Anton. The Seventh-day Adventist 
Church held its 54th General Conference session at the Superdome in June 
and July 1985. Pope John Paul II addressed 80,000 children at the stadium 
in 1987.[41] The Republican National Convention was held there in 1988, 
nominating then-Vice President George H. W. Bush for President and U.S. 
Senator Dan Quayle of Indiana as Vice President.[41] The annual Essence 
Music Festival has been held in the Superdome every year since 1995 except 
for 2006, when it was held in Houston, Texas due to Hurricane Katrina repairs. 
In June 1996, The Hunchback of Notre Dame, Disney's 34th animated feature, 
had a gala world premiere at this stadium, with over 65,000 people attending 
the event. NSYNC performed here during their 2001 PopOdyssey Tour. The 
August 22nd show was filmed and released on VHS and DVD. In August 2001, 
the Bassmaster Classic XXXI final weigh-in was held in the stadium. Beyoncé 
performed on July 7, 2013 during The Mrs. Carter Show World Tour. The concert 
was a part of the Essence Music Festival and broke the attendance record.[53] 
On April 6, 2014, World Wrestling Entertainment held WrestleMania XXX at 
the Superdome in front of 75,167 fans. Sports visionary David Dixon (who 
decades later founded the United States Football League) conceived of the 
Superdome while attempting to convince the NFL to award a franchise to 
New Orleans. After hosting several exhibition games at Tulane Stadium during 
typical New Orleans summer thunderstorms, Dixon was told by NFL Commissioner 
Pete Rozelle that the NFL would never expand into New Orleans without a 
domed stadium. Dixon then won the support of the governor of Louisiana, 
John McKeithen. When they toured the Astrodome in Houston, Texas in 1966, 
McKeithen was quoted as saying, "I want one of these, only bigger", in 
reference to the Astrodome itself. Bonds were passed for construction of 
the Superdome on November 8, 1966, seven days after commissioner Pete Rozelle 
awarded New Orleans the 25th professional football franchise. The stadium 
was conceptualized to be a multifunctional stadium for football, baseball 
and basketball [with moveable field level stands that would be arranged 
specifically for each sport and areas with dirt (for the bases and pitchers 
mound) covered with metal plates on the stadium floor (they were covered 
by the artificial turf during football games)] and there are also Meeting 
Rooms that could be rented for many different purposes. Dixon imagined 
the possibilities of staging simultaneous high school football games side-by-side 
and suggested that the synthetic surface be white.[54] Blount International 
of Montgomery, Alabama was chosen to build the stadium.[55] As the dome 
was being constructed, various individuals developed eccentric models of 
the structure: one was of sugar, another consisted of pennies. The so-called 
"penny model" traveled to the Philadelphia Bicentennial '76 exhibition. 
New Orleanian Norman J. Kleintz built the model with 2,697 pennies and 
donated it to the Superdome Board of Commissioners in April, 1974.[56] 
It was hoped the stadium would be ready in time for the 1972 NFL season, 
and the final cost of the facility would come in at $46 million. Instead, 
due to political delays, construction did not start until August 11, 1971, 
and was not finished until August 1975, seven months after Super Bowl IX 
was scheduled to be played in the stadium. Since the stadium was not finished 
in time for the Super Bowl, the game had to be moved to Tulane Stadium, 
and was played in cold and rainy conditions. Factoring in inflation, construction 
delays, and the increase in transportation costs caused by the 1973 oil 
crisis, the final price tag of the stadium skyrocketed to $165 million. 
Along with the state police, Elward Thomas Brady, Jr., a state representative 
from Terrebonne Parish and a New Orleans native, conducted an investigation 
into possible financial irregularities, but the Superdome went forward 
despite the obstacles.[57] First Saints game The New Orleans Saints opened 
the 1975 NFL season at the Superdome, losing 21–0 to the Cincinnati Bengals 
in the first regular-season game in the facility. Tulane Stadium, the original 
home of the Saints, was condemned for destruction on the day the Superdome 
opened. First Super Bowl The first Super Bowl played in the stadium was 
Super Bowl XII in January 1978, the first in prime time. Original turf 
The original artificial turf playing surface in the Superdome was produced 
by Monsanto specifically for the Superdome and was named "Mardi Grass."[3] 
New turf installation The Superdome converted its artificial grass surface 
to synthetic turf midway through the 2003 football season on November 16. 
Effect of Hurricane Katrina The Superdome was used as a "shelter of last 
resort" for those in New Orleans unable to evacuate from Hurricane Katrina 
when it struck in late August 2005. During the storm, a large section of 
the outer covering was peeled off by high winds. The photos of the damage, 
in which the concrete underneath was exposed, quickly became an iconic 
image of Hurricane Katrina. A few days later the dome was closed until 
September 25, 2006. Reopening after Katrina The Superdome cost $185 million 
to repair and refurbish. To repair the Superdome, FEMA put up $115 million,[58] 
the state spent $13 million, the Louisiana Stadium & Exposition District 
refinanced a bond package to secure $41 million and the NFL contributed 
$15 million. After being damaged from the flooding disaster, a new Sportexe 
MomentumTurf surface was installed for the 2006 season. On Super Bowl XL 
Sunday (February 5, 2006), the NFL announced that the Saints would play 
their home opener on September 24, 2006 in the Superdome against the Atlanta 
Falcons. The game was later moved to Monday night, September 25. The reopening 
of the dome was celebrated with festivities including a free outdoor concert 
by the Goo Goo Dolls before fans were allowed in, a pre-game performance 
by the rock bands U2 and Green Day performing a cover of The Skids' "The 
Saints Are Coming", and a coin toss conducted by former President George 
H. W. Bush. In front of ESPN's largest-ever audience at that time, the 
Saints won the game 23–3 with 70,003 in attendance and went on to a successful 
season reaching their first ever NFC Championship Game. The first bowl 
game played in the Superdome after Katrina was the New Orleans Bowl won 
by the Troy Trojans 41–17 over the Rice Owls. Renovations In early 2006, 
the Superdome began a $320 million renovation that consisted of three remodeling 
phases. First, the stadium was repaired and refurbished from damage suffered 
during Hurricane Katrina. In 2008, new windows were installed to bring 
natural light into the building. Later that year, the roof-facing of the 
Superdome was also remodeled, restoring the roof with a solid white hue. 
Between 2009 and 2010, the entire outer layer of the stadium, more than 
400,000 square feet (37,000 m2) of aluminum siding, was replaced with new 
aluminum panels and insulation, returning the building to its original 
champagne bronze colored exterior. An innovative barrier system for drainage 
was also added, allowing the dome to resemble its original facade. In addition, 
escalators were added to the outside of the club rooms. Each suite includes 
modernized rooms with raised ceilings, leather sofas, and flat-screen TVs, 
as well as glass brushed aluminum and wood-grain furnishings. A new $600,000 
point-of-sale system was also installed, allowing fans to purchase concessions 
with credit cards throughout the stadium for the first time. New turf installation 
During the summer of 2010 the Superdome installed 111,831 square feet (10,389.4 m2) 
of the Speed S5-M synthetic turf system by UBU Sports. The Superdome now 
has the largest continuous synthetic turf system in the NFL. Renovations 
Beginning in 2011, demolition and new construction began to the lower bowl 
of the stadium, reconfiguring it to increase seating by 3,500, widening 
the plaza concourse, building two bunker club lounges and adding additional 
concession stands. Crews tore down the temporary stairs that lead from 
Champions Square to the Dome, and replaced them with permanent steps. Installation 
of express elevators that take coaches and media from the ground level 
of the stadium to the press box were also completed. New 7,500-square-foot 
(700 m2) bunker lounges on each side of the stadium were built. The lounges 
are equipped with flat-screen TVs, granite counter tops and full-service 
bars. These state of the art lounges can serve 4,500 fans, whose old plaza 
seats were upgraded to premium tickets, giving those fans leather chairs 
with cup-holders. The plaza level was extended, closing in space between 
the concourse and plaza seating, adding new restrooms and concession areas. 
The renovations also ended the stadium's ability to convert to a baseball 
configuration.[59] The renovations were completed in late June 2011 in 
time for the Essence Music Festival. Naming rights The Superdome had not 
taken on corporate naming rights until Mercedes-Benz acquired the rights 
in 2011. Though the stadium is owned by the state of Louisiana, the New 
Orleans Saints' lease gives the team the authority to sell the rights.[60] 
Saints owner Tom Benson also owns Mercedes-Benz dealerships in New Orleans 
and San Antonio.[8] On July 27, 2012, a statue was unveiled at a plaza 
next to the Superdome. The work, titled Rebirth, depicts one of the most 
famous plays in Saints history—Steve Gleason's block of a Michael Koenen 
punt that the Saints recovered for a touchdown early in the first quarter 
of the team's first post-Katrina game in the Superdome.[61] Super Bowl 
XLVII power failure The Superdome hosted the Super Bowl XLVII football 
game on February 3, 2013. A partial power failure halted game play for 
about 34 minutes in the third quarter between the Baltimore Ravens and 
the San Francisco 49ers. It caused CBS, who was broadcasting the game, 
to lose some of its cameras as well as voiceovers by the commentators. 
At no point did the game go off the air, though the game had no audio for 
about two minutes. While the lights were coming back on, CBS reporters 
deployed around the stadium reported on the outage as a breaking news situation 
until power was restored enough for play to continue. On February 8, 2013 
it was reported that a relay device intended to prevent an electrical overload 
had caused the failure.[62] The device was located in an electrical vault 
owned and operated by Entergy, the electrical utility for the New Orleans 
area. That vault is approximately one quarter mile away from the Superdome. 
A subsequent report from an independent auditor confirmed the relay device 
as the cause.[63] The Superdome's own power system was never compromised. 
The Superdome was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 
2016.[64] End zone scoreboards and new lighting During the 2016 off-season, 
the smaller videoboards formerly located along the end zone walls above 
the upper seating bowl were replaced with two large Panasonic high definition 
LED displays that stretch 330 feet (100 m) wide and 35 feet (11 m) and 
are more visible throughout the bowl.[65] Other upgrades included a complete 
upgrade to the Superdome's interior floodlighting system to an efficient 
LED system with programmable coloring, light show effects, and instant 
on-off; in normal mode the stadium will have a more vibrant and naturally
