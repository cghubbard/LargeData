As player As general manager As coach Rubén Amaro Jr. (born February 12, 
1965) is an American former professional baseball player and General Manager 
that currently serves as the first base coach of the Boston Red Sox of 
Major League Baseball, his first coaching job. He played in Major League 
Baseball as an outfielder from 1991 to 1998. Amaro was named the General 
Manager of the Philadelphia Phillies on November 3, 2008, succeeding Pat 
Gillick and remained in that position until September 10, 2015. He is the 
son of former Major League Baseball player Rubén Amaro Sr. Born and raised 
in the Rhawnhurst neighborhood of Northeast Philadelphia, Amaro played 
Little League Baseball for Crispin Gardens. Amaro is Jewish; his mother 
Judy Amaro-Perez (née Herman)[1] is of Russian-Jewish heritage and his 
father is a Marrano Sephardic Mexican-Cuban.[2][3] He later was a batboy 
for the Phillies from 1980 to 1983 when his father, Rubén Amaro Sr., was 
their first base coach.[4] Amaro graduated from William Penn Charter School 
in 1983, where he played baseball and soccer. He graduated from Stanford 
University in 1987.[4] He was a member of the Stanford team that won the 
NCAA 1987 College World Series. He led the team in runs (77), triples (6), 
and stolen bases (38) that year. Drafted by the California Angels in the 
11th round of the 1987 amateur draft, he signed June 16, 1987.[5] In 1989 
he began the season by batting .360 for Quad Cities of the Midwest League, 
and then ended it by hitting .382 for the Midland of the Texas League. 
In 1990 he batted .317 between AA and AAA. He followed that by batting 
.326 in 1991 in AAA. In 3,117 at bats in the minor leagues, he batted .301 
with a .399 on-base percentage and 235 stolen bases.[6] He debuted in the 
major leagues on June 8, 1991. On December 8, 1991, he was traded by the 
Angels with Kyle Abbott to the Philadelphia Phillies for Von Hayes. In 
1992 he finished third in the NL with 9 hit-by-pitches. On November 2, 
1993, he was traded by the Phillies to the Cleveland Indians for Heathcliff 
Slocumb. Amaro made the Cleveland Indians World Series roster in 1995 over 
Dave Winfield. On November 9, 1995, he was released by the Indians. On 
January 24, 1996, he was signed as a free agent by the Toronto Blue Jays. 
On May 5, 1996, he was released by the Blue Jays, and the following day 
he signed as a free agent with the Phillies. He batted .313 for the Phillies 
that year with a .380 on-base percentage. In eight seasons in the major 
leagues, Amaro appeared in 485 games, batting .235 with 16 home runs and 
100 RBIs. He played for both the 1993 NL champion Phillies and the 1995 
AL champion Indians.[4] Amaro joined the Phillies front office immediately 
after his playing career ended in 1998, hired by then Phillies general 
manager Ed Wade. He served as assistant GM for the Phillies for 10 seasons 
before being named general manager. His first seven were under Wade, followed 
by three seasons under Gillick.[7] On November 1, 2008, the day after the 
Philadelphia Phillies second Broad Street Parade, it was confirmed that 
Amaro would be the new general manager as well as senior vice president 
of the Philadelphia Phillies.[8] Amaro signed a three-year contract.[4] 
The Phillies won the National League East the first three years of his 
tenure, appearing in the 2009 World Series and finishing with the best 
record in baseball during the 2010 and 2011 regular seasons. They have 
failed to reach the postseason since. Shortly after Amaro fired manager 
Charlie Manuel in 2013, Manuel was asked if he had enough pieces to win 
in 2012 and 2013 and he responded "The last two years? No. I can straight 
face tell you that." [9] In July 2014, a "Stay Or Go" poll was conducted 
by Philly.com with over 10,000 fans involved, and 93.6% of voters wanted 
Amaro to be removed from his position, with only 6.4% wanting Amaro to 
remain GM.[10] His performance with the Phillies was unlike his predecessor;[11] 
in May 2014, Sporting News ranked Amaro the worst general manager in Major 
League Baseball, noting his propensity to sign aging veterans who fail 
to perform at a level commensurate with their contract.[12] He was removed 
from his position with the Phillies on September 10, 2015.[13] Amaro was 
hired as first base coach by the Boston Red Sox for the 2016 season, returning 
to the field for the first time since retiring as a player.[14][15] In 
2008, Amaro was one of three people inducted into the All-American Amateur 
Baseball Association Hall of Fame.[16] In 2009, Amaro was inducted into 
the Philadelphia Jewish Sports Hall of Fame.[3][17] That same year, baseball 
fans nationwide voted him the MLB "This Year in Baseball Awards" 2009 Executive 
of the Year.[18] Also in 2009, the Philadelphia Sports Writers Association 
(PSWA) named him its Executive of the Year. Amaro is co-founder of the 
Richie Ashburn Harry Kalas Foundation, which provides baseball camps for 
underprivileged children in the Delaware Valley. He also serves on the
