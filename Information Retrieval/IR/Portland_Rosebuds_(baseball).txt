The Portland Rosebuds, sometimes called the Portland Roses, were a baseball 
team owned by Jesse Owens.[1] The Rosebuds were part of the West Coast 
Baseball Association, an all-black league headed by Abe Saperstein, the 
owner of the Harlem Globetrotters.[1] The Rosebuds played the Seattle Steelheads 
on their opening day, May 12, 1946 at Dudley Field in El Paso, Texas.[2] 
They followed opening day with two more days of games in El Paso and one 
in nearby Ciudad Ju√°rez.[2] The league was disbanded after only two months.[1][2]
