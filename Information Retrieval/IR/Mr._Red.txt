Mr. Red is the first mascot of the Cincinnati Reds baseball team. He is 
a humanoid figure dressed in a Reds uniform, with an oversized baseball 
for a head. Sometimes, Mr. Red is referred to by the team as "The Running 
Man" for the way he has posed on the logo c. 1968. Mr. Red made his first 
appearance on a Reds uniform as a sleeve patch in 1955. The patch featured 
Mr. Red's head, clad in an old-fashioned white pillbox baseball cap with 
red stripes. The following season, 1956, saw the Reds adopt sleeveless 
jerseys, and Mr. Red was eliminated from the home uniform. He was moved 
to the left breast of the road uniform, and remained there for one season 
before being eliminated entirely. In 1999, the Reds re-designed their uniform 
and "Mr. Red" was reintroduced as a sleeve patch on the undershirt. A human 
version of the mascot had appeared by at least 1975, certainly by Game 
5 of that year's World Series, when he appeared on screen during the NBC 
broadcast (see the DVD version available on A&E Video).[original research?] 
The mascot disappeared in the late 1980s for unknown reasons. The costumed 
mascot was reintroduced in 1997. Mr. Red was joined by Gapper, a new furry 
mascot created by David Raymond (the original Phillie Phanatic), as the 
franchise moved to Great American Ballpark in 2003. In 2007, the current 
Mr. Red has been supplemented by a retro 1950s version known as "Mr. Redlegs", 
complete with handlebar mustache and old fashioned baseball uniform. Throughout 
the 1970s and 1980s, Mr. Red wore uniform number 27. The humanoid Mr. Red 
retired in 2007 leaving "Gapper" and a mascoted "Mr. Redlegs" to take his 
place. In August 2008, a female companion named "Rosie Red" named in honor 
of the group that supports the team, the Rosie Reds, was introduced. A 
new Mr. Red Mascot was unveiled at Redsfest for the 2012 season, the new 
mascot will be on the field with "Gapper" and "Rosie Red" and "Mr. Redlegs."
