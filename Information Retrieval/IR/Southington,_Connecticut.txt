Southington is a town in Hartford County, Connecticut, United States. As 
of the 2010 United States Census, it had a population of 43,069.[1] Southington 
contains the villages of Marion, Milldale, and Plantsville. Much of the 
town is visible from Castle Craig, a landmark within Hubbard Park (a park 
mostly within adjacent town of Meriden, Connecticut). Southington is situated 
about 20 miles (32 km) southwest of Hartford, about 80 miles (130 km) northeast 
of New York City, 105 miles (169 km) southwest of Boston and 77 miles (124 km) 
west of Providence. It includes the areas of Plantsville, Marion and Milldale, 
each of which has its own post office and distinct architecture. The town 
rests in a valley of two mountains on its east and west sides. The town 
is located along exits 28 through 32 of Interstate 84, exit 4 of Interstate 
691, and bisected by Connecticut Route 10. Southington has the nickname 
of "The Apple Valley", due to the many orchards that still dot its landscape. 
The Quinnipiac River flows through the town. It is home to Mount Southington 
ski area, which has drawn visitors since the 1960s. Southington is located 
at geographical coordinates 41° 35′ 48" North, 72° 52′ 40" West (41.596588, 
-72.87767). According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has 
a total area of 36.6 square miles (94.9 km2), of which 35.9 square miles 
(93.0 km2) are land and 0.73 square miles (1.9 km2), or 1.99%, is water.[1] 
The Metacomet Ridge, a rugged trap rock mountain ridge that extends from 
Long Island Sound to the Massachusetts/Vermont border, passes through Southington. 
Notable peaks along the ridge form the eastern edge of town: Bradley Mountain, 
Ragged Mountain, Short Mountain, and part of the Hanging Hills. The ridge 
is traversed by the 51-mile-long (82 km) Metacomet Trail. Soltys Pond is 
also a well-known body of water to Southington locals. It was surveyed 
by Alexander Soltys in 1713 and was added to maps within the next year. 
[2] Southington's west ridge is home to an extremely rare geological formation 
called the Great Unconformity. Although Southington was formally established 
as a town in 1779, its roots go back to a much earlier time. Samuel Woodruff, 
Southington's first white settler, moved from Farmington to the area then 
known as "Panthorne" that was settled in 1698. The settlement grew, prospered, 
and came to be known as "South Farmington" and then later, the shortened 
version, Southington. The town's most important early visitor was General 
George Washington, who passed through the town in 1770 on his way to Wethersfield. 
The Marion section of Southington is one of the most historic places in 
the town. It is the site of an encampment by the great French general, 
Jean-Baptiste Donatien de Vimeur, comte de Rochambeau, and his troops during 
the American Revolutionary War. In June 1781, the French troops under Rochambeau's 
command left Farmington and marched 13 miles (21 km) to their eighth camp 
through Connecticut, near Asa Barnes Tavern in the Marion section of Southington, 
now the Marion Historic District. They camped there for four days. Rochambeau 
and his officers took shelter in the tavern, and the troops set up camp 
on a hill on the other side of the road. The area of the encampment has 
since become known as French Hill, and a marker on the east side of Marion 
Avenue commemorates the French campsite. According to Rev. Timlow's Sketches 
of Southington (1875), "Landlord Barnes gave a ball at his tavern, at which 
a large number of the young women of the vicinity were present; and they 
esteemed it something of an honor to have had a 'cotillion' with the polite 
foreigner." The celebrations-infused with spirits provided by Landlord 
Barnes-spanned the four nights they were in Southington. Rochambeau revisited 
Barnes's Tavern on the return march on October 27, 1782. According to Timlow, 
coins, buttons and other things were picked up in the vicinity many years 
after the two encampments. The Asa Barnes Tavern is now a private residence 
very near the camp site at 1089 Marion Avenue. Southington originally was 
a small, rural farming community. In the early 1900s, Southington developed 
as a manufacturing center, but still maintained a very small population 
of a few thousand residents. Some of the products invented there include 
the first cement that was able to harden under water, the first carriage 
bolt cutting machine, the break-neck rat trap, and a new tinware process. 
With the overall decline of industry in New England, and the construction 
of Interstate 84 in the mid 1960s, Southington developed into a bedroom 
community of which the town saw explosive growth and a population that 
has surged to over 42,000 today. 28% of the workers in Southington are 
still employed in manufacturing, most of them in the production of fabricated 
metals and aircraft. In May 1942, during World War II, the town was selected 
by the War Department to be highlighted in a defense booklet called Southington, 
CT—Microcosm of America. Photographers roamed the community taking photos 
of residents at work, at play and in their homes and churches. The final 
publication was intended to show friends and foes alike in Europe the typical 
American citizens and families, their traditions and values. Thousands 
of copies were dropped from military airplanes over Europe during the Nazi 
German Occupation. Also in 1942 the mural, Romance of Southington, was 
painted in the town post office by Ann Hunt Spence. Murals were produced 
from 1934 to 1943 in the United States through the Section of Painting 
and Sculpture, later called the Section of Fine Arts, of the Treasury Department. 
The WPA was the largest and most ambitious American New Deal agency, employing 
individuals to carry out public works projects.[3] Each year, Southington 
is home to the Apple Harvest Festival, an effort to bring together local 
businesses and denizens from the area and surrounding cities. This has 
been a tradition of the town since 1969, generally spanning six weekdays 
and two weekends. Its highlights include a town parade, carnival rides 
and games, musical performances, and a wide selection of unique recipes 
and foods served by community cornerstones including the Boy Scouts of 
America, local churches, the Southington Fire Department and Police Department, 
the Southington Rotary Chapter, and the Southington Jaycees. Southington 
is home to several farms and apple orchards, including Rogers Orchards, 
the largest in the state. Two of Southington's main state roads are ceremonially 
named for notable residents. Southington's portion of Route 10 is named 
the Louis G. Tolles Memorial Highway for the late state Grange leader and 
legislator (1885–1956). The road was dedicated on Aug. 6, 1960, and rededicated 
with new signs on Oct. 6, 2007. A section of Route 364 (Oakland Road and 
Berlin Street) was dedicated as the Officer Timothy Foley Memorial Highway 
on Sept. 11, 2009, in honor of the first (and to date the only) Southington 
police officer killed in the line of duty. He died six days after being 
struck by a vehicle on Dec. 30, 1937. In January 2011, John Weichsel retired 
as town manager after 44 years. He was hired by the first Town Council 
when the council/manager form of government was established in town in 
1966. His tenure as a town manager in the same community is one of the 
longest in the United States. Weichsel died in 2013. The Plantsville Green 
The Wilcox Factory located in Southington, in 1910. Asa Barnes Tavern, 
built in 1765 The town center As of the census[6] of 2010, there were 43,069 
people, 16,814 households, and 12,036 families residing in the town. The 
population density was 1,103.8 people per square mile (426.2/km²). There 
were 17,447 housing units at an average density of 432.2 per square mile 
(166.9/km²). The racial makeup of the town was 95.4% White, 1.9% African 
American, 0.4% Native American, 2.5% Asian, 0.1% Pacific Islander, 0.9% 
from other races, and 1.2% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of 
any race were 3.4% of the population. There were 16,814 households out 
of which 31.8% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 58.2% 
were married couples living together, 9.4% had a female householder with 
no husband present, and 28.8% were non-families. 24% of all households 
were made up of individuals and 11.8% had someone living alone who was 
65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.54 and the average 
family size was 3.01. In the town the population was spread out with 23.8% 
under the age of 18, 5.9% from 18 to 24, 29.3% from 25 to 44, 26.3% from 
45 to 64, and 14.7% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 
43.3 years. For every 100 females there were 94.1 males. For every 100 
females age 18 and over, there were 90.1 males. The mean income for a household 
in the town is $94,156, and the mean income for a family is $110,590. Males 
had a median income of $68,378 versus $50,599 for females. Households in 
Southington are relatively affluent with 37.7% of its households earning 
above $100,000. The per capita income for the town was $36,682 according 
to the 2010 census. About 2.2% of families and 3.5% of the population were 
below the poverty line, including 3.0% of those under age 18 and 5.6% of 
those age 65 or over. As with the decline of industry in the area, many 
old factories and buildings were left vacant. The latest to close was Ideal 
Forging, which filed for bankruptcy in 2001. This factory is located in 
the town center in the central business district. Meridian Development 
Partners of New York City became interested in the property in late 2003. 
This project was to create upscale homes, condominiums, store fronts, and 
parks on the former factory site. The factory parcel is contaminated and 
must be remediated before construction can begin. As of late, Meridian 
has accomplished adding zoning text to the town's regulations, rezoning 
the land, acquiring ownership of the property, applied for permits, and 
received approval for demolition from the Wetlands Commission. Demolition 
is currently underway as of October 2014. Southington has taken the initiative 
to spur its own revitalization. In 2002, the town completed the downtown 
renaissance project. This project replaced the sidewalks on Main Street 
and Center Street with granite curbing and brick pavers. Lifelong resident 
philanthropist Robert Petroske donated $50,000 to the revitalization effort, 
which led to the installation of decorative iron lamp posts, benches, and 
rubbish bins. Flowering trees were planted, and a former fountain and light 
fixture was restored and relocated from Recreation Park (where it had been 
moved in 1961) to the town center. A renaissance zone was created where 
private business owners in the zone could apply to the town to continue 
the project of granite, brick pavers, and lamp posts, of which the town 
would pay the difference of replacement concrete sidewalks versus the more 
expensive brick. The extension of brick pavers from Center Street to a 
section on the east side of Liberty Street was completed in July 2008 to 
connect with the pavers installed outside the new Liberty Square office 
building. The town water department, which built a new facility on West 
Queen Street in 2002, demolished its former facility located between Mill 
and High streets in June 2008 and developed the land into a landscaped 
park, along with a continuation of the sidewalks, iron fences and decorative 
lamp posts. The old water facility abuts the linear walking trail. The 
linear trail opened to the public in the summer of 2003. This trail was 
built over the town's old rail line which had ceased operation several 
years earlier. Dubbed the Farmington Canal Greenway, when completed it 
will stretch from New Haven, Connecticut, to Northampton, Massachusetts, 
following the route of the historical Farmington Canal. The second phase 
of construction on the trail, which officially opened in 2011, redeveloped 
the old train line from Plantsville center to the Cheshire town line. The 
project has brought landscaping, iron benches, and intersections of brick 
pavers where the trail crosses roads. This is seen as a major link for 
the further revitalization of downtown Southington and Plantsville. Eventually 
the trail will connect with the Cheshire-to-New Haven route. Southington 
has eight public elementary schools, two middle schools and one high school. 
It also has an alternative school for children in grades 8-12 called ALTA. 
Approximately 6,500 students are enrolled in Southington public schools, 
making it one of the larger districts in the state of Connecticut. Southington 
High School has a growing enrollment exceeding 2,200 students, of which 
90% of graduates attend post-secondary education. Due to Southington's 
popularity as a family suburb, the town has undertaken plans to expand 
all schools to accommodate the growing enrollment. Three elementary schools 
have been completed, and a new building and second cafeteria has been added 
to the high school campus. Voters recently approved expansion and renovations 
to two other elementary schools (with one to be demolished and rebuilt), 
as well as to the two middle schools. Southington also has three parochial 
schools; one is pre-kindergarten through eighth, one is kindergarten through 
fifth, and the last is pre-kindergarten through twelfth. On March 28, 2015, 
CTfastrak, Connecticut's first bus rapid transit corridor, opened. It provides 
a separated right-of-way between Hartford and New Britain; Express bus 
services travel between downtown Hartford and Waterbury, with service to 
Southington, with its free park-and-ride located at the corner of South 
Main and Mulberry streets. Following its creation, public transportation 
can now connect Southington residents to Waterbury station and the Metro-North 
Railroad, providing service to Bridgeport and ultimately Stamford and New 
York City. Southington is home to several highways, including Interstate 
84, also known as The Yankee Expressway, and Interstate 691. Southington 
boasts a fair share of large parks and open land, each serving several 
outdoor activities, and as a whole, a vast array of them. Public Recreation
