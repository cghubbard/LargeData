Jason David Schmidt (born January 29, 1973), is an American former Major 
League Baseball pitcher. In his career he has played for the Los Angeles 
Dodgers (2007–2009), San Francisco Giants (2001–06), Pittsburgh Pirates 
(1996–2001) and Atlanta Braves (1995–96), by whom he had been drafted in 
the eighth round, 206th overall, of the 1991 draft. Schmidt attended Kelso 
High School in Kelso, Washington, where he played football and basketball 
in addition to baseball. In 1991 as a senior he tossed a no-hitter, striking 
out 20 of 21 batters he faced. He was named Washington's Gatorade State 
Player of the Year and All-State MVP in baseball. He was offered a scholarship 
to the University of Arizona but chose to sign with the Atlanta Braves 
after they drafted him in the eighth round of the 1991 MLB Draft. Schmidt 
made his professional debut with the Gulf Coast Braves in 1991, starting 
eleven games and finishing with a 3–4 record and 2.38 ERA. He worked his 
way through the Braves farm system from 1992 to 1995, playing with the 
Pulaski Braves (1992-rookie league), Macon Braves (1992-Class A), Durham 
Bulls (1993-Class A), Greenville Braves (1994-Class AA) and Richmond Braves 
(1995-Class AAA). He made his major league debut in relief on April 28, 
1995, against the Los Angeles Dodgers. Schmidt recorded his first ML victory 
in his first start, pitching eight scoreless innings against the Chicago 
Cubs on September 3, 1995. In 1996 he started in the season in the Braves 
rotation but also spent time in Richmond and on the disabled list before 
he was traded to the Pittsburgh Pirates (with Ron Wright) for Denny Neagle 
on August 30, 1996. As a member of the Pirates, Schmidt won 10, 11, and 
13 games in 1997, 1998, and 1999, respectively. However, he was on a losing 
team each season in Pittsburgh. He was the last player on the team to wear 
number 42, as all of Major League Baseball retired it for Jackie Robinson 
in 1997, except those who chose to keep the number (e.g. Mariano Rivera). 
Schmidt then switched to number 22 for the remainder of his stay with the 
team, and wore number 29 after leaving the Pirates. Schmidt was then acquired 
by the Giants in 2001 with John Vander Wal in exchange for Armando Ríos 
and Ryan Vogelsong. Schmidt saw more success in San Francisco. Between 
his stints in Pittsburgh and San Francisco during the 2001 season, Schmidt 
compiled thirteen wins. Schmidt re-signed as a free agent with San Francisco 
that winter, in what would become a five-year $41 million deal. He went 
on to win thirteen again in 2002 when the Giants made a World Series appearance, 
but lost to the Anaheim Angels. Schmidt started Games 1 and 5 of the 2002 
World Series, picking up the win in Game 1 and a no-decision in Game 5. 
In 2003, he won 17 games. Schmidt threw a 2–0 shutout in Game 1 of the 
2003 NLDS, beating Josh Beckett, but his team lost once again in the playoffs, 
this time to the Florida Marlins. Schmidt was an All-Star this year as 
well as the league leader with a 2.34 earned run average. He placed second 
to Éric Gagné in the 2003 National League Cy Young Award voting. On May 
18, 2004, Jason Schmidt pitched a one-hitter against the Chicago Cubs and 
Matt Clement.[1] The Giants won the game, 1–0. This performance was overshadowed 
by Randy Johnson's perfect game the same day. Schmidt also pitched a one-hitter 
against the Boston Red Sox. Schmidt would go on to win 18 games in 2004 
and be voted the TSN Pitcher of the Year in the National League, and fourth 
in Cy Young voting. He also set a San Francisco single-season record of 
251 strikeouts, which was broken when Tim Lincecum struck out 265 in 2008. 
On June 6, 2006 at AT&T Park, in a 2-1 Win over the Florida Marlins, Schmidt 
pitched a complete game and struck out a career-high 16 batters. The game 
included a ninth-inning wild pitch that moved base runners to second and 
third with no outs. Schmidt struck out the final three batters of the game, 
starting with cleanup hitter Miguel Cabrera, Josh Willingham and Jeremy 
Hermida. Not only did he tie the franchise all-time single-game strikeouts 
record originally set by Christy Mathewson of the New York Giants on October 
3, 1904, against the St. Louis Cardinals, but he also surpassed Gaylord 
Perry's San Francisco Giants single-game strikeouts record, when Perry 
struck out 15 batters on July 22, 1966, against the Philadelphia Phillies. 
In addition, he set AT&T Park's individual single-game strikeout record 
in the short history of the ballpark. Schmidt signed a three-year, $47 million 
deal with the Los Angeles Dodgers prior to the 2007 season.[2] After only 
three starts he missed forty-five days with a right shoulder injury before 
being reactivated from the disabled list (DL) on June 5. He started three 
games after his return from the DL, the last two created more concern. 
On June 18 he was returned to the DL and underwent exploratory surgery 
to find the cause of his ineffectiveness. The damage to his shoulder was 
more severe than expected and he missed the rest of the 2007 season due 
to injury. The Dodgers hoped to have Schmidt back before the end of the 
2008 season, but manager Joe Torre later said that Schmidt would not be 
back, making only a few rehab starts in the minors during the year. Heading 
into 2009, Schmidt was expected to compete for a spot in the Dodgers' rotation 
but pitched poorly in spring training and began the season once more on 
the disabled list. After several rehab starts in the minors, Schmidt was 
activated on July 20, 2009, to start against the Cincinnati Reds, his first 
appearance in a Major League game since 2007. He went five innings, allowed 
three runs and picked up the win.[3] He made another start on July 26 against 
the Florida Marlins, but pitched poorly allowed five runs (four earned) 
in three innings and was credited with the loss.[4] He started against 
the Atlanta Braves on July 31 and pitched six shutout innings, getting 
the win as the Dodgers won 5–0. On August 7, he was again placed on the 
DL, with Torre speculating that Schmidt's career might be over.[5] San 
Francisco Giants Records Schmidt and his wife Bethany have three children: 
Makynlee (born January 14, 2001), Mason (born January 29, 2004), and Madden
