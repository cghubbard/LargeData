Haverford Township (named after the town of Haverfordwest in Wales, UK) 
is a home rule township[1] in Delaware County—a close-in inner commuting 
suburb of the city, it is located due west of Philadelphia, in southeastern 
Pennsylvania, United States, and is officially known as the Township of 
Haverford. Despite being under a home rule charter since 1977, it continues 
to operate under a Board of Commissioners divided into wards,[1] as do 
"First Class" townships that are still under the Pennsylvania Township 
Code. Haverford Township was founded in 1682 and incorporated in 1911. 
It a Main Line suburb of Philadelphia, so named as they were located along 
the Pennsylvania Railroad Main Line.[2] In northern Delaware County, the 
township is also skewered by US Route 30 which intersects with Interstate 
476 towards its western border.[2] Haverford Township contains portions 
of the communities of Haverford, Bryn Mawr, Ardmore, Drexel Hill, and Wynnewood. 
The unincorporated "town" of Havertown lies wholly within Haverford Township. 
The township population as of the 2010 census was 48,491. Haverford Township 
holds the distinction of having hosted two different men's major golf championships 
at two different golf clubs: Merion Golf Club hosted the 1934, 1950, 1971, 
1981, and 2013 U.S. Open, and Llanerch Country Club hosted the 1958 PGA 
Championship. Haverford, along with Upper Darby, Cheltenham, Lower Merion 
together form as the major inner ring suburbs of Philadelphia. Haverford 
Township was laid out by William Penn as part of the Welsh Tract or Barony—The 
original settlers, led by John Roberts, negotiated with William Penn in 
1684 to constitute the Tract as a separate county whose local government 
would use the Welsh language. In 1681, a representative group of Welsh 
Quakers met with Penn to discuss their settlement having purchased forty 
thousand acres of land which today comprises all of Haverford, Radnor and 
Lower Merion Townships. "Companies of Adventurers" were formed, with the 
most prominent person in each taking out the patent on 5,000 acres of land 
as trustee. The first three families arrived in Haverford Township in 1682. 
Lewis David, Henry Lewis and William Howell selected land along the southern 
border. The area was primarily agricultural until the second decade of 
the twentieth century. The census returns of 1860 show the value of livestock 
as $62,485.00; animals slaughtered $11,255.00; 46,049 bushels of grain 
harvested and the value of orchard and garden produce, $4,090.00. The two 
creeks that mark part of the township boundaries provided good millseats 
for the early settlers. On Darby Creek to the west, Richard Hayes Jr., 
David Morris and Samuel Lewis erected a gristmill, known as Haverford New 
Mill, in 1707. Later a sawmill was attached. This mill operated until 1904. 
Near the border with Marple Township, Humphrey Ellis operated a very early 
fulling mill. In 1807 Henry Lawrence built a sawmill on this site, and 
in 1832 his son, William, built a gristmill close by. The sawmill remained 
in the family ownership for more than 125 years, and is the oldest industry 
exant in Haverford Township. Toward the eastern boundary, Cobb's Creek, 
called Karakung by the Native Americans, was the site of a number of mills. 
Haverford Mill was the first, a gristmill built by William Howell in 1658. 
Daniel Humphreys purchased the property in 1703 and built a sawmill and 
fulling and dyeing mill. These were added to Dennis Kelly's holding in 
1826 and became the Castle Hill Mills. This site is just north of Eagle 
Road on the west bank of Cobb's Creek. About 1800 grist and sawmills were 
built on the headwaters of Cobb's Creek by Peter Brown, and in 1810 Jonathan 
Miller built grist and sawmills at what is now the Juncture of Mill Road 
and Karakung Drive. Israel Whelen, Sr., built the Nitre Hall Powder Mills 
on Cobb's Creek, which were in operation by 1810. During the American Revolution 
very little black powder was manufactured in this country, and it was needed 
for engineering and mining. Between 1810 and 1840 these mills were the 
second largest powder mills in the U.S. with production of 800,000 pounds 
in 1812. The mills ceased operations in 1840 and were sold to Dennis Kelly, 
who converted them for the manufacture of cotton and wooden goods. In 1814, 
Dennis Kelly borrowed capital to purchase a mill-seat on Cobb's Creek. 
He erected a small wooden factory known as Clinton Mills. This was a highly 
successful venture and, after enlarging the mill, he built Cedar Grove 
Mill further downstream. Dennis Kelly provided material for the U.S. government 
from 1817 until 1860 with contracts ranging from $1,800.00 to $41,370.00. 
Improved transportation opened the township to development. The Philadelphia 
and Columbia Railroad opened for use from Broad and Callowhill Streets 
to Paoli in 1833, and went as far as Pittsburgh by 1835. Tracks meandered 
through the countryside, going along Railroad Avenue in Haverford Township. 
This was the first railway for general commerce in the U.S., but offered 
little in the way of service to passengers until the late 1860s. The Pennsylvania 
Railroad bought the Columbia in 1857 and began changing the roadbed for 
what became the Main Line to the west. The Philadelphia and West Chester 
Turnpike Company first built the toll road, then formed the Philadelphia 
and West Chester Traction Company and built the trolley line, which opened 
in 1898. The addition of the Ardmore line in 1902 brought much new housing. 
The trolleys provided good transportation to Philadelphia and workers began 
to commute. Moderately priced homes on smaller lots were built in communities 
such as Llanerch, Brookline and Oakmont. The population of Haverford Township 
almost doubled between 1900 and 1925. In the beginning of the 20th Century 
much farmland was purchased by wealthy families who built mansions and 
developed gardens on their new estates. Several golf courses were developed. 
Merion Cricket Club Golf Association incorporated Clifton Hall an old farmhouse, 
in their clubhouse. They have 140 acres in the main course or East Course 
and 160 acres in the West Course. The Llanerch Country Club consists of 
126 acres. The Pennsylvania Railroad Golf Club was established in 1925 
on 109 acres bounded by Earlington Road, Manoa Road and City Line. This 
property was sold in 1943 to Warner West Corporation, which developed Chatham 
Park. The first building erected for educational purposes was the Federal 
School, in 1797. During the 1800s four additional one-room schools and 
one parochial school were built. The latter part of the 19th century was 
the beginning of the present school system. After World War II, additions 
were made to existing schools, a new high school and three one-story elementary 
schools were built. Today there is one middle school, one senior high, 
five elementary schools, four parochial schools and four private schools. 
David Lawrence was one of the early Welsh settlers in Haverford Township. 
He emigrated with his wife Elinor Ellis and her family in 1684, and took 
up part of his father-in-law’s land grant. His son Henry Lawrence purchased 
209 acres along Cobbs Creek in 1709. It has not been determined whether 
the log house predates this purchase, but a 2 1⁄2-story stone addition 
was built c. 1730, and later a clapboard summer kitchen was added. It became 
known as the Three Generation House, and remained in Lawrence family ownership 
until 1942.[3] The first record of the purchase of land for a school in 
Haverford Township was October 29, 1797. Alexander Symington received 5 
shillings for an irregularly shaped building lot of one quarter of an acre 
and three perches near the present day intersection of Darby and Coopertown 
Roads. Payment for the land was made by five trustees: Philip Sheaff, William 
Brook, Francis Lee, David Lyons and Benjamin Hayes Smith, "for the purpose 
of erecting a school thereon for the use of said Township of Haverford". 
The 1797 Federal School is on the National Register of Historic Places.[4] 
"Pont Reading House" is situated on the Easterly side of Haverford Road, 
Haverford Township, Delaware County, Pennsylvania, at the corner where 
the Ardmore Trolley passes en route between Brookline—Oakmont and Ardmore, 
and near Ardmore Junction Station of the Philadelphia and Western Railway. 
It was the home of Joshua Humphreys, the builder of the USS Constitution. 
Here, this beautiful specimen of early American homes still stands, in 
an excellent state of preservation and repair, as it has since 1813, when 
the front section was built and added to the middle three-story section 
erected 1730–60, which in turn was then added to the rear and original 
two-story structure, built possibly as early as 1683. One of the log walls 
of this first and original section can still be seen as one enters a door 
on one of the sides thereof, All surrounded and shaded with some large 
trees, of the original forest, still surviving.[5] The Nitre Hall Powder 
Mills, which gave the valley its name, were built by Israel Whelen shortly 
after 1800. The young nation had growing needs for explosives, and the 
mills prospered with an output of 800,000 pounds during the War of 1812. 
Nitre Hall Mills produced a quality and quantity of black powder in the 
U.S. second only to the Dupont Mills on the Brandywine. After the powder 
mills closed in 1840, Dennis Kelly bought the property and converted the 
buildings to the manufacture of textiles. Nitre Hall is on the National 
Register of Historic Places.[6] The Grange Estate, also known as Maen-Coch 
and Clifton Hall, is a historic mansion in Havertown, Pennsylvania, near 
Philadelphia, in Delaware County, Pennsylvania. Built in 1700 and expanded 
several times through the 1850s, it was purchased by Haverford Township 
in 1974. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places 
in 1976 as The Grange. According to the United States Census Bureau, the 
township has a total area of 10.0 square miles (26 km2), all of it land.
