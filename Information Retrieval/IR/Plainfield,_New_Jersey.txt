Plainfield is a city in Union County, New Jersey, United States, known 
by its nickname as "The Queen City".[1] As of the 2010 United States Census, 
the city's population increased to 49,808, its highest ever recorded population 
in any decennial census,[11][12][13] with the population having increased 
by 1,979 (+4.1%) from the 47,829 counted in the 2000 Census, which had 
in turn increased by 1,262 (+2.7%) from the 46,567 counted in the 1990 
Census.[21] The area of present-day Plainfield was originally formed as 
Plainfield Township, a township that was created on April 5, 1847, from 
portions of Westfield Township, while the area was still part of Essex 
County. On March 19, 1857, it became part of the newly created Union County.[22] 
Plainfield was incorporated as a city by an act of the New Jersey Legislature 
on April 21, 1869, from portions of Plainfield Township, based on the results 
of a referendum held that same day. The city and township coexisted until 
March 6, 1878, when Plainfield Township was dissolved and parts were absorbed 
by Plainfield city, with the remainder becoming Fanwood Township (now known 
as Scotch Plains).[22] The name "Plainfield", also used in both North Plainfield 
and South Plainfield, is derived from a local estate[23] or from its scenic 
location.[24] Plainfield was settled in 1684 by Quakers,[25] and incorporated 
as a city in 1869. Formerly a bedroom suburb in the New York metropolitan 
area, it has become the urban center of 10 closely allied municipalities, 
with diversified industries, including printing and the manufacture of 
chemicals, clothing, electronic equipment, and vehicular parts. Among the 
several 18th-century buildings remaining are a Friends' meetinghouse (1788),[26] 
the Martine house (1717), and the Nathaniel Drake House (1746), known as 
George Washington's headquarters during the Battle of Short Hills in June 
1777.[27][28] Nearby Washington Rock is a prominent point of the Watchung 
Mountains and is reputed to be the vantage point from which Washington 
watched British troop movements.[29][30] In 1902, the New Jersey Legislature 
approved measures that would have allowed the borough of North Plainfield 
to become part of Union County (a measure repealed in 1903) and to allow 
for a merger of North Plainfield with the City of Plainfield subject to 
the approval of a referendum by voters in both municipalities.[31][32] 
Plainfield is the birthplace of P-Funk. George Clinton founded The Parliaments 
while working in a barber shop in Plainfield. Parliament-Funkadelic was 
inducted in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1997. Plainfield has been 
home to former New Jersey governor James McGreevey.[33] In sports history, 
Plainfield is the birthplace and/or home of several current and former 
athletes, including professionals and well-known amateurs. Included in 
their number are Milt Campbell, the 1956 Olympic Decathlon gold medalist 
(the first African-American to earn this title),[34] Joe Black, the first 
African-American pitcher to win a World Series game, Jeff Torborg, former 
MLB player, coach and manager, and Vic Washington, NFL player.[35] Archibald 
Cox, the special prosecutor appointed to oversee prosecutions in the Watergate 
break-in and related criminal activity during the Nixon administration, 
was born in Plainfield. There are numerous sites, including homes, parks, 
and districts in the city that are listed on the National Register of Historic 
Places. While not listed, the Plainfield Armory, a prominent landmark completed 
in 1932, was sold by the state in 2013 as surplus property.[36] Plainfield's 
northeast corner, known as the "Sleepy Hollow" section of the city, was 
and still is characterized by its array of finely landscaped streets and 
neighborhoods with homes defined by a broad array of architectural styles, 
most built during the first half of the twentieth century. As one browses 
the tree-lines neighborhoods, it is obvious that the lot sizes vary, but 
the stateliness and distinction of each house is evident, whether a stately 
Queen Anne mansion or gingerbread cottage. Most lots are nicely landscaped 
and semi or fully private. Sleepy Hollow has remained a desirable place 
to buy and live despite the decay in other parts of the city.[37] In its 
heyday, Plainfield was a regional shopping and entertainment center. Residents 
of nearby Union, Middlesex and Somerset counties would drive to shop and 
explore the business districts of Plainfield. Other than during the holidays, 
peak shopping times in Plainfield were Thursday nights and Saturday, when 
Front Street and the areas around it bustled.[citation needed] Plainfield 
had several entertainment venues. At the peak, there were four operating 
movie theaters: the Strand, the Liberty, the Paramount and the Oxford theaters. 
Prior to 1960, Cedarbrook park, at the south end of town, and Greenbrook 
park, at the north end of town, provided every opportunity for recreation, 
including ice skating in the winter, fishing, hiking, visits to the ice 
cream vendor, playgrounds and quiet walks. As with much else in Plainfield, 
the ability to use the parks without the fear of predators eroded beginning 
in the early 1960s.[citation needed] Manufacturers of heavy goods included 
Chelsea Fan Corp., Mack Truck and National Starch and Chemical Corp. Plainfield 
Iron and Metal maintained a large scrapyard on the west end of town. Plainfield 
was affected by the Plainfield riots in July 1967. This civil disturbance 
occurred in the wake of the larger Newark riots. A Plainfield police officer 
died, about fifty people were injured, and several hundred thousand dollars 
of property was damaged by looting and arson. The New Jersey National Guard 
restored order after three days of unrest.[38] This civil unrest caused 
a massive white flight, characterized by the percentage of black residents 
rising from 40% in 1970 to 60% a decade later.[39] According to the United 
States Census Bureau, the city had a total area of 6.034 square miles (15.626 km2), 
including 6.023 square miles (15.599 km2) of land and 0.011 square miles 
(0.027 km2) of water (0.18%).[2][3] Unincorporated communities, localities 
and place names located partially or completely within the city include 
Netherwood.[40] The city is located in Central Jersey on the southwestern 
edge of Union County and is bordered by nine municipalities. Scotch Plains 
lies to the north and east, and Fanwood to the northeast. Bordered to the 
south are South Plainfield, and Piscataway. To the southwest lies Dunellen 
and to the southeast, Edison. All which are in Middlesex County. Green 
Brook Township lies to the northwest, North Plainfield lies to the north 
and Watchung borders to the northwest. All three of these municipalities 
are in Somerset County.[41] Plainfield is in the Raritan Valley, a line 
of cities in central New Jersey, and lies on the east side of the Raritan 
Valley along with Edison. Plainfield has a humid continental climate, characterized 
by brisk to cold winters and hot, muggy summers. The lowest temperature 
ever recorded was −17 °F (−27 °C) on February 9, 1934, and the highest 
temperature ever recorded was 106 °F (41 °C) on July 10, 1936, and August 
11, 1949.[42] According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Plainfield 
has a humid subtropical climate, which is abbreviated as "Cfa" on climate 
maps.[43] At the 2010 United States Census, there were 49,808 people, 15,180

are part of an Urban Enterprise Zone. In addition to other benefits to 
encourage employment within the Zone, shoppers can take advantage of a 
reduced 3½% sales tax rate (versus the 7% rate charged statewide) at eligible 
merchants.[56] The Plainfield Symphony performs concerts at Crescent Avenue 
Presbyterian Church. The orchestra was founded in 1919, making it one of 
the oldest continuously operating orchestras in the United States.[57] 
In October 2010, former Plainfield music teacher Anwar Robinson and performer 
Yolanda Adams joined with community residents to try to be recognized by 
Guinness World Records for assembling the world's largest gospel chorus.[58]

Gloria Taylor was appointed in January 2014 to fill the council seat expiring 
in December 2016 of Adrian Mapp who resigned to take office as mayor.[68] 
Taylor served on an interim basis until the November 2014 general election, 
when she was elected to serve the balance of the term of office.[65] Plainfield 
is located in the 12th Congressional District[69] and is part of New Jersey's 
22nd state legislative district.[12][70][71] Prior to the 2010 Census,

The Plainfield Public School District serves students in pre-Kindergarten 
through twelfth grade. The district is one of 31 former Abbott districts 
statewide,[105] which are now referred to as "SDA Districts" based on the 
requirement for the state to cover all costs for school building and renovation 
projects in these districts under the supervision of the New Jersey Schools 
Development Authority.[106][107] As of the 2011-12 school year, the district's 
15 schools had an enrollment of 6,407 students and 501.0 classroom teachers 
(on an FTE basis), for a student–teacher ratio of 12.79:1.[108] Schools 
in the district (with 2011-12 enrollment data from the National Center 
for Education Statistics[109]) are DeWitt D. Barlow Elementary School[110] 
(334; K-5), Cedarbrook Elementary School[111] (576; K-8), Clinton Elementary 
School[112] (335; K-8), Frederic W. Cook Elementary School[113] (264; K-7), 
Emerson Community School[114] (483; K-5), Evergreen Elementary School[115]

(79; 9-12) and Plainfield Academy for the Arts and Advanced Studies[124] 
(237; 7-10, to be expanded to 7-12).[125] The district's main high school 
was the 318th-ranked public high school in New Jersey out of 339 schools 
statewide in New Jersey Monthly magazine's September 2014 cover story on 
the state's "Top Public High Schools", using a new ranking methodology.[126] 
The school had been ranked 280th in the state of 328 schools in 2012, after 
being ranked 307th in 2010 out of 322 schools listed.[127] The school was 
removed in 2009 from the list of persistently dangerous schools in New 
Jersey.[128] Plainfield is also home to New Jersey's first high school 
focused on sustainability, the Barack Obama Green Charter High School.[129] 
Established in 1984, Koinonia Academy moved to Plainfield in 1997, where 
it serves students in PreK through twelfth grades and operates under the 
auspices of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Newark.[130][131] Union County 
College, a community college headquartered in nearby Cranford, maintains 
a campus in downtown Plainfield.[132] As of May 2010[update], the city 
had a total of 101.79 miles (163.82 km) of roadways, of which 87.58 miles 
(140.95 km) were maintained by the municipality, 14.21 miles (22.87 km) 
by Union County.[133] Plainfield is one of the few large suburban cities 
in central New Jersey to have no federal highway within it. The only major 
thoroughfare through Plainfield is U.S. Route 22, connecting Easton, Pennsylvania 
with Newark and U.S. Route 1/9. Route 22, a mecca for highway shopping 
and dining, is accessible from Plainfield through North Plainfield, Dunellen 
and Fanwood. In the early 1960s, Interstate highways were completed near, 
but not through Plainfield. Interstate 287 is accessible through South 
Plainfield and Piscataway, while Interstate 78 is accessible through Watchung 
/ Warren Township and neighboring communities. The busiest connecting thoroughfares 
in Plainfield are Park Avenue (north-south), traversing from U.S. 22 to 
and into South Plainfield and Edison; Front Street (east-west), connecting 
Fanwood with Dunellen; South Avenue and 7th Street, both of which parallel 
Front Street, connecting Scotch Plains/Fanwood with Piscataway, South Plainfield 
and the Middlesex County border. Plainfield has two NJ Transit rail stations 
on the Raritan Valley Line, formerly the mainline of the Central Railroad 
of New Jersey. The main Plainfield station is in the downtown and a second, 
smaller Netherwood station is in the Netherwood section, east of downtown 
and within a mile of the Fanwood border. A third station, located in the 
west end of town, was closed long ago. The New Brunswick train station 
is approximately 15 minutes away. The Central Railroad of New Jersey first 
offered service to Plainfield in 1839. At the height of popularity, the 
Plainfield "Jersey Central" train station, with its main station building 
constructed in 1902, was a hub for commuting to Newark and New York. (The 
Central Railroad of New Jersey terminal was in Jersey City, where ferries 
would take the rail passengers to New York City.) The station was located 
near the main post office and downtown stores. The station was serviced 
by the now defunct Railway Express postal carrier company.[134] NJ Transit 
provides bus service on the 113 and 114 to and from the Port Authority 
Bus Terminal in Midtown Manhattan; the 59, 65 and 66 (Limited) to Newark; 
and local service on the 819 and 822 routes.[135] In years past, Plainfield 
was serviced by the Somerset Bus Company with service from Union County 
to Essex and New York City, the Public Service Bus Company with similar 
service and Plainfield Transit, providing local service. Newark Liberty 
International Airport is approximately 30 minutes away. Solaris Health 
System, a nonprofit company which owns Muhlenberg Regional Medical Center, 
a hospital in Plainfield, asked for permission to close the hospital. This 
request has been opposed by People's Organization for Progress, an advocacy 
group based in Newark, New Jersey.[136][137][138] The closing has been 
attributed to the large number of uninsured patients served by the hospital.[139] 
At the height of popularity in the 1950s through the 1970s, Plainfield 
was a hub for medical practices. Park Avenue was lined with doctors and 
medical offices and was nicknamed "Doctors Row".[140] Plainfield Teacher's 
College was a mythical institution created as a hoax by a duo of college 
football fans in 1941. The phony college's equally nonexistent football 
team had its scores carried by major newspapers including The New York 
Times before the hoax was discovered.[141][142] People who were born in, 
residents of, or otherwise closely associated with Plainfield include:
