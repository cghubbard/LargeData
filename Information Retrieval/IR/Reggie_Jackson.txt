Reginald Martinez "Reggie" Jackson (born May 18, 1946) is an American former 
professional baseball right fielder who played 21 seasons for the Kansas 
City / Oakland Athletics, Baltimore Orioles, New York Yankees, and California 
Angels of Major League Baseball (MLB). Jackson was inducted into the National 
Baseball Hall of Fame in 1993. Jackson was nicknamed "Mr. October" for 
his clutch hitting in the postseason with the Athletics and the Yankees.[1] 
He helped Oakland win five consecutive American League West divisional 
pennants, three consecutive American League pennants and three consecutive 
World Series titles, from 1971 to 1975. Jackson helped New York win four 
American League East divisional pennants, three American League pennants 
and two consecutive World Series titles, from 1977 to 1981. He also helped 
the California Angels win two AL West divisional pennants in 1982 and 1986. 
Jackson hit three consecutive home runs at Yankee Stadium in the clinching 
game 6 of the 1977 World Series.[1] Jackson hit 563 career home runs and 
was an American League (AL) All-Star for 14 seasons. He won two Silver 
Slugger Awards, the AL Most Valuable Player (MVP) Award in 1973, two World 
Series MVP Awards, and the Babe Ruth Award in 1977. The Yankees and Athletics 
retired his team uniform number in 1993 and 2004.[2] Jackson currently 
serves as a special advisor to the Yankees.[3] Jackson was born in the 
Wyncote neighborhood of Cheltenham Township, just north of Philadelphia. 
His father was Martinez Jackson, a half Puerto Rican,[4] who worked as 
a tailor and who was a former second baseman with the Newark Eagles of 
Negro league baseball.[5] He was the youngest of four children from his 
mother, Clara. He also had two half-siblings from his father's first marriage.[6] 
His parents divorced when he was four; his mother took four of his siblings 
with her, while his father took Jackson and one of the siblings from his 
first marriage, though one sibling later returned to Wyncote.[6] Martinez 
Jackson was a single father, and theirs was one of the few black families 
in Wyncote. He was able to develop a social ease with the Jewish community 
in Wyncote, as all his friends, girlfriends, coaches, and teachers during 
that timeframe were Jewish.[7] In 1972, Jackson joined his Jewish teammates 
on the A's – Ken Holtzman and Mike Epstein – in wearing black armbands 
for the rest of the postseason after the Munich Massacre at the Olympics 
in September. At Cheltenham High School, he was a classmate of Yonatan 
Netanyahu, who led the Israeli raid on Entebbe in 1976. Jackson graduated 
from Cheltenham High in 1964, where he excelled in football, basketball, 
baseball, and track and field.[8] A tailback in football, he injured his 
knee in an early season game in his junior year. He was told by the doctors 
he was never to play football again, but Jackson returned for the final 
game of the season.[9] In that game, Jackson fractured five cervical vertebrae, 
which caused him to spend six weeks in the hospital and another month in 
a neck cast. Doctors told Jackson that he might never walk again, let alone 
play football, but Jackson defied the odds again.[9] On the baseball team, 
he batted .550 and threw several no-hitters.[10] In the middle of his senior 
year, Jackson's father was arrested for bootlegging and was sentenced to 
six months in jail.[10] In football, he was scouted by Alabama, Georgia, 
and Oklahoma, all of whom were willing to break the color barrier just 
for Jackson (Oklahoma had black football players before 1964- including 
Prentice Gautt, a star running back recruited in 1957, who played in the 
NFL with the St. Louis Cardinals).[10] Jackson declined Alabama and Georgia 
because he was fearful of the South at the time, and declined Oklahoma 
because they told him to stop dating white girls.[10] For baseball, Jackson 
was scouted by Hans Lobert of the San Francisco Giants who was desperate 
to sign him.[10] The Los Angeles Dodgers and Minnesota Twins also made 
offers, and the hometown Philadelphia Phillies gave him a tryout but declined 
because of his "hitting skills".[11] His father wanted his son to go to 
college,[11] where Jackson wanted to play both football and baseball.[11] 
He decided to attend Arizona State University on a football scholarship. 
His high-school football coach knew ASU's head football coach Frank Kush, 
and they discussed the possibility of him playing both sports. After a 
recruiting trip, Kush decided that Jackson had the ability and willingness 
to work to join the squad.[11] One day after football practice, he approached 
baseball coach Bobby Winkles asking if he could join the team. Winkles 
said he would give Jackson a look, and the next day while still in his 
football gear, he hit a home run on the second pitch he saw. In five at 
bats he hit three home runs.[12] He was allowed to practice with the team, 
but could not join the squad because the NCAA had a rule forbidding the 
use of freshman players.[12] Jackson switched permanently to baseball following 
his freshman year, as he did not want to become a defensive back.[13] To 
hone his skills, Winkles assigned him to a Baltimore Orioles-affiliated 
amateur team. He broke numerous team records for the squad, and the Orioles 
offered him a $50,000 signing bonus if he joined the team.[14] Jackson 
declined the offer stating that he did not want to forfeit his college 
scholarship.[12] In the beginning of his sophomore year in 1966, Jackson 
replaced Rick Monday (the first player ever selected in the Major League 
Baseball draft and a future teammate with the A's) at center field. He 
broke the team record for most home runs in a single season, led the team 
in numerous other categories and was first team All-American.[15] Many 
scouts were looking at him play, including Tom Greenwade of the New York 
Yankees (who discovered Mickey Mantle), and Danny Murtaugh of the Pittsburgh 
Pirates.[15] In his final game at Arizona State, he showed his potential 
by being only a triple away from hitting for the cycle, making a sliding 
catch, and having an assist at home plate.[15] Jackson was the first college 
player to hit a home run out of Phoenix Municipal Stadium.[16] In the 1966 
Major League Baseball draft on June 7, Jackson was selected by the Kansas 
City Athletics.[17] He was the second overall pick, behind 17-year-old 
catcher Steve Chilcott, who was taken by the New York Mets.[18][19] According 
to Jackson, Winkles told him that the Mets did not select him because he 
had a white girlfriend.[20] Winkles later denied the story, stating that 
he did not know the reason why Jackson was not drafted by the Mets.[21] 
It was later confirmed by Joe McDonald that the Mets drafted Chilcott because 
of need, yet again the person running the Mets at the time was George Weiss, 
a known racist, so the true motive may never be known.[21] Jackson, age 
20, signed with the A's for $85,000 on June 13 and reported for his first 
training camp with the Lewis-Clark Broncs of the short season Single-A 
Northwest League in Lewiston, Idaho,[22] managed by Grady Wilson.[23] He 
made his professional debut as a center fielder in the season opener on 
June 24 at Bethel Park in Eugene, Oregon, but was hitless in five at-bats.[24][25] 
In the next game, Jackson singled in the first inning and homered in the 
ninth.[26][27] In the home opener at Bengal Field in Lewiston on June 30, 
he hit a double and a triple.[28] In his final game as a Bronc on July 
6, Jackson was hit in the head by a pitch in the first inning, but stayed 
in the game and drove in runs with two sacrifice flies. Complaining of 
a headache, he left the game in the ninth inning, was admitted to St. Joseph's 
Hospital in Lewiston, and remained overnight for observation.[29][30] Jackson 
played for two Class A teams in 1966, with the Broncs for just 12 games,[30][31] 
and then 56 games with Modesto in the California League, where he hit 21 
homers. He began 1967 with the Birmingham A's in the Double-A Southern 
League in Birmingham, Alabama, where Jackson got his first taste of racism, 
being one of only a few blacks on the team.[32] He credits the team's manager 
at the time, John McNamara, for helping him through that difficult season. 
Jackson debuted in the major leagues with the A's in 1967 in a Friday doubleheader 
in Kansas City on June 9, a shutout sweep of the Cleveland Indians by scores 
of 2–0 and 6–0 at Municipal Stadium.[33] (Jackson had his first career 
hit in the nightcap, a lead-off triple in the fifth inning off of long 
reliever Orlando Peña.)[33][34] The Athletics moved west to Oakland prior 
to the 1968 season. Jackson hit 47 home runs in 1969, and was briefly ahead 
of the pace that Roger Maris set when he broke the single-season record 
for home runs with 61 in 1961, and that of Babe Ruth when he set the previous 
record of 60 in 1927.[35] Jackson later said that the sportswriters were 
claiming he was "dating a lady named 'Ruth Maris.'" That off-season, Jackson 
sought an increase in salary, and Athletics owner Charlie O. Finley threatened 
to send Jackson to the minors. Commissioner Bowie Kuhn successfully intervened 
in their dispute, but Jackson's numbers in 1970 dropped sharply, as he 
hit just 23 home runs while batting .237. The Athletics sent him to play 
in Puerto Rico, where he played for the Santurce team and hit 20 homers 
and knocked in 47 runs to lead the league in both departments. Jackson 
hit a memorable home run in the 1971 All-Star Game at Tiger Stadium in 
Detroit. Batting for the American League against Pittsburgh Pirates pitcher 
Dock Ellis, the ball he hit soared above the right-field stands, striking 
the transformer of a light standard on the right field roof. While with 
the Angels in 1984, he hit a home run over that roof. In 1971, the Athletics 
won the American League's West division, their first title of any kind 
since 1931, when they played in Philadelphia. They were swept in three 
games in the American League Championship Series by the Baltimore Orioles. 
The A's won the division again in 1972; their series with the Tigers went 
the full five games, and Jackson scored the tying run in the clincher on 
a steal of home. In the process, however, he tore a hamstring and was unable 
to play in the World Series. The A's still managed to defeat the Cincinnati 
Reds in seven games. It was the first championship won by a San Francisco 
Bay Area team in any major league sport. During spring training in 1972, 
Jackson showed up with a mustache. Though his teammates wanted him to shave 
it off, Jackson refused. Finley liked the mustache so much that he offered 
each player $300 to grow one, and hosted a "Mustache Day" featuring the 
last MLB player to wear a mustache, Frenchy Bordagaray, as master of ceremonies.[36] 
Jackson helped the Athletics win the pennant again in 1973, and was named 
Most Valuable Player of the American League for the season. The A's defeated 
the New York Mets in seven hard-fought games in the World Series. This 
time, Jackson was not only able to play, but his performance led to his 
being awarded the Series' Most Valuable Player award. In the third inning 
of that seventh game, which ended in a 5–2 score, the A's jumped out to 
a 4–0 lead as both Bert Campaneris and Jackson hit two-run home runs off 
Jon Matlack—the only two home runs Oakland hit the entire Series. The A's 
won the World Series again in 1974, defeating the Los Angeles Dodgers in 
five games. Besides hitting 254 home runs in nine years with the Athletics, 
Jackson was also no stranger to controversy or conflict in Oakland. Sports 
author Dick Crouser wrote, "When the late Al Helfer was broadcasting the 
Oakland A's games, he was not too enthusiastic about Reggie Jackson's speed 
or his hustle. Once, with Jackson on third, teammate Rick Monday hit a 
long home run. 'Jackson should score easily on that one,' commented Helfer. 
Crouser also noted that, "Nobody seems to be neutral on Reggie Jackson. 
You're either a fan or a detractor." When teammate Darold Knowles was asked 
if Jackson was a hotdog (i.e., a show-off), he famously replied, "There 
isn't enough mustard in the world to cover Reggie Jackson."[37] On June 
5, 1974, outfielder Billy North and Jackson engaged in a clubhouse fight 
at Detroit's Tiger Stadium. Jackson injured his shoulder, and catcher Ray 
Fosse, attempting to separate the combatants, suffered a crushed disk in 
his neck, costing him three months on the disabled list. The A's won the 
division again in 1975, but the loss of pitcher Catfish Hunter, baseball's 
first modern free agent, left them vulnerable, and they were swept in the 
ALCS by the Boston Red Sox. With the coming of free agency after the 1976 
season, and with team owner Finley unwilling to pay the higher salary that 
Jackson would ask for, Jackson was traded on April 2, 1976 along with minor 
leaguer Bill VanBommell and Ken Holtzman to the Baltimore Orioles for Don 
Baylor, Mike Torrez, and Paul Mitchell. Both his new team, the Orioles, 
and his former team, the Athletics, finished second in their respective 
divisions. The Yankees signed Jackson to a five-year contract totaling 
$2.96 million ($12,329,871 in current dollar terms) on November 29, 1976.[38][39] 
The number 9 that he had worn in Oakland and Baltimore was already used 
by Yankees third baseman Graig Nettles. Jackson asked for number 42 in 
memory of Jackie Robinson, but that number was given to pitching coach 
Art Fowler before the start of the season. Noting that Hank Aaron, at the 
time the holder of the career record for the most home runs, had just retired, 
Jackson asked for and received number 44 as a tribute to Aaron. Jackson 
wore number 20 for one game during spring training as a tribute to the 
also recently retired Frank Robinson, then he switched to number 44. Jackson's 
first season with the Yankees, 1977, was a difficult one. Although team 
owner George Steinbrenner and several players, most notably catcher and 
team captain Thurman Munson and outfielder Lou Piniella, were excited about 
his arrival, the team's manager, Billy Martin was not. Martin had managed 
the Tigers in 1972, when Jackson's A's beat them in the playoffs. Jackson 
was once quoted as saying of Martin, "I hate him, but if I played for him, 
I'd probably love him." The relationship between Jackson and his new teammates 
was strained due to an interview with SPORT magazine writer Robert Ward. 
During spring training at the Yankees' camp in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, 
Jackson and Ward were having drinks at a nearby bar. Jackson's version 
of the story is that he noted that the Yankees had won the pennant the 
year before, but lost the World Series to the Reds, and suggested that 
they needed one thing more to win it all, and pointed out the various ingredients 
in his drink. Ward suggested that Jackson might be "the straw that stirs 
the drink." But when the story appeared in the June 1977 issue of SPORT, 
Ward quoted Jackson as saying, "This team, it all flows from me. I'm the 
straw that stirs the drink. Maybe I should say me and Munson, but he can 
only stir it bad." Jackson has consistently denied saying anything negative 
about Munson in the interview and he has said that his quotes were taken 
out of context.[40] However, Dave Anderson of The New York Times subsequently 
wrote that he had drinks with Jackson in July 1977, and that Jackson told 
him, "I'm still the straw that stirs the drink. Not Munson, not nobody 
else on this club."[41] Regardless, as Munson was beloved by his teammates, 
Martin, Steinbrenner and Yankee fans, the relationships between them and 
Jackson became very strained. On June 18, in a 10–4 loss to the Boston 
Red Sox in a nationally televised game at Fenway Park in Boston, Jim Rice, 
a powerful hitter but notoriously slow runner, hit a ball into shallow 
right field that Jackson appeared to weakly attempt to field. Jackson failed 
to reach the ball which fell far in front of him, thereby allowing Rice 
to reach second base. Furious, Martin removed Jackson from the game without 
even waiting for the end of the inning, sending Paul Blair out to replace 
him. When Jackson arrived at the dugout, Martin yelled that Jackson had 
shown him up. They argued, and Jackson said that Martin's heavy drinking 
had impaired his judgment. Despite Jackson being 18 years younger, about 
two inches taller and maybe 40 pounds heavier, Martin lunged at him, and 
had to be restrained by coaches Yogi Berra and Elston Howard. Red Sox fans 
could see this in the dugout and began cheering wildly, and the NBC TV 
cameras showed the confrontation to the entire country. Yankees management 
defused the situation by the next day, but the relationship between Jackson 
and Martin was permanently poisoned. However, George Steinbrenner made 
a crucial intervention when he gave Martin the option of either having 
Jackson bat in the fourth or "cleanup" spot for the rest of the season, 
or losing his job. Martin made the change and Jackson's hitting improved 
(he had 13 home runs and 49 RBIs over his next 50 games), and the team 
went on a winning streak. On September 14, while in a tight three-way race 
for the American League Eastern Division crown with the Red Sox and Orioles, 
Jackson ended a game with the Red Sox by hitting a home run off Reggie 
Cleveland, giving the Yankees a 2–0 win. The Yankees won the division by 
two and a half games over the Red Sox and Orioles, and came from behind 
in the top of the ninth inning in the fifth and final game of the American 
League Championship Series to beat the Kansas City Royals for the pennant. 
During the 1977 World Series against the Dodgers, Munson was interviewed, 
and suggested that Jackson, because of his past post-season performances, 
might be the better interview subject. "Go ask Mister October", he said, 
giving Jackson a nickname that would stick. (In Oakland, he had been known 
as "Jax" and "Buck.") Jackson hit home runs in Games Four and Five of the 
Series. Jackson's crowning achievement came with his three-home-run performance 
in World Series-clinching Game Six, each on the first pitch, off three 
Dodgers pitchers. (His first plate-appearance, during the second inning, 
resulted in a four-pitch walk.) The first came off starter Burt Hooton, 
and was a line drive shot into the lower right field seats at Yankee Stadium. 
The second was a much faster line drive off reliever Elías Sosa into roughly 
the same area. With the fans chanting his name, "Reg-GIE! Reg-GIE! Reg-GIE!" 
the third came off reliever Charlie Hough, a knuckleball pitcher, making 
the distance of this home run particularly remarkable. It was a towering 
drive into the black-painted batter's eye seats in center, 475 feet away. 
Since Jackson had hit a home run off Dodger pitcher Don Sutton in his last 
at bat in Game Five, his three home runs in Game Six meant that he had 
hit four home runs on four consecutive swings of the bat against as many 
Dodgers pitchers. Jackson became the first player to win the World Series 
MVP award for two teams. In 27 World Series games, he amassed 10 home runs, 
including a record five during the 1977 Series (the last three on first 
pitches), 24 RBI and a .357 batting average. Babe Ruth, Albert Pujols, 
and Pablo Sandoval are the only other players to hit three home runs in 
a single World Series game. Babe Ruth accomplishing the feat twice – in 
1926 and 1928 (both in Game Four). With 25 total bases, Jackson also broke 
Ruth's record of 22 in the latter Series; this remains a World Series record, 
Willie Stargell tying it in the 1979 World Series. In 2009, Chase Utley 
of the Philadelphia Phillies tied Jackson's record for most home runs in 
a single World Series. An often forgotten aspect of the ending of this 
decisive Game 6 was the way Jackson left the field at the game's end. Fans 
had been getting somewhat rowdy in anticipation of the game's end, and 
some had actually thrown firecrackers out near Jackson's area in right 
field. Jackson was alarmed enough about this to walk off the field, in 
order to get a helmet from the Yankee bench to protect himself. Shortly 
after this point, as the end of the game neared, fans were actually bold 
enough to climb over the wall, draping their legs over the side in preparation 
for the moment when they planned to rush onto the field. When that moment 
came, after pitcher Mike Torrez caught a pop-up for the game's final out, 
Jackson started running at top speed off the field, actually body-checking 
past some of these fans filling the playing field in the manner of a football 
linebacker.[42] The Yankees' home opener of the 1978 season, on April 13 
against the Chicago White Sox, featured a new product, the "Reggie!" bar. 
In 1976, while playing in Baltimore, Jackson had said, "If I played in 
New York, they'd name a candy bar after me." The Standard Brands company 
responded with a circular "bar" of peanuts dipped in caramel and covered 
in chocolate, a confection which was originally named the "Wayne Bun" as 
it was made in Fort Wayne, Indiana. The "Reggie!" bars were handed to fans 
as they walked into Yankee Stadium. Jackson hit a home run, and when he 
returned to right field the next inning, fans began throwing the Reggie 
bars on the field in celebration. Jackson told the press that this confused 
him, thinking that maybe the fans did not like the candy.[43] The Yankees 
won the game, 4–2. But the Yankees could not maintain their success, as 
manager Billy Martin lost control. On July 23, after suspending Jackson 
for disobeying a sign during a July 17 game, Martin made a statement about 
his two main antagonists, referring to comments Jackson had made and team 
owner George Steinbrenner's 1972 violation of campaign-finance laws: "They're 
made for each other. One's a born liar, the other's convicted." It was 
moments like these that gave the Yankees the nickname "The Bronx Zoo." 
Martin resigned the next day (some sources have said he was actually fired[44]), 
and was replaced by Bob Lemon, a Hall of Fame pitcher for the Cleveland 
Indians who had been recently fired as manager of the White Sox. Steinbrenner, 
a Cleveland-area native, had hired former Indians star Al Rosen as his 
team president (replacing another Cleveland figure, Gabe Paul). Steinbrenner 
jumped at the chance to involve another hero of his youth with the Yankees; 
Lemon had been one of Steinbrenner's coaches during the Bombers' pennant-winning 
1976 season. After being 14 games behind the first-place Red Sox on July 
18, the Yankees finished the season in a tie for first place. The two teams 
played a one-game playoff for the division title at Fenway Park, with the 
Yankees winning 5–4. Although the home run by light-hitting shortstop Bucky 
Dent in the seventh inning got the most notice, it was an eighth-inning 
home run by Jackson that gave the Yankees the fifth run they ended up needing. 
The next day, with the American League Championship Series with the Royals 
beginning, Jackson hit a home run off the Royals' top reliever at the time, 
Al Hrabosky, the flamboyant "Mad Hungarian." The Yankees won the pennant 
in four games, their third straight. Jackson was once again in the center 
of events in the World Series, again against the Dodgers. Los Angeles won 
the first two games at Dodger Stadium, taking the second when rookie reliever 
Bob Welch struck Jackson out with two men on base with two outs in the 
ninth inning. The series then moved to New York, and after the Yankees 
won Game Three on several fine defensive plays by third baseman Graig Nettles, 
Game Four saw Jackson in the middle of a controversial play on the basepaths. 
In the sixth inning, after collecting an RBI single, Jackson was struck 
in the hip–possibly on purpose–by a ball thrown by Dodger shortstop Bill 
Russell as Jackson was being forced at second base. Instead of completing 
a double play that would have ended the inning, the ball caromed into foul 
territory and allowed Thurman Munson to score the Yankees' second run of 
the inning. In spite of the Dodgers' protests of interference on Jackson's 
part, the umpires allowed the play to stand. The Yankees tied the game 
in the eighth inning and eventually won in the tenth. Following a blowout 
win in Game Five, both teams headed back to Los Angeles. In Game Six, Jackson 
got his revenge against Welch by blasting a two-run home run in the seventh 
inning, putting the finishing touch on a series-clinching, 7-2 win for 
the Yankees. In 1980, Jackson batted .300 for the only time in his career, 
and his 41 home runs tied with Ben Oglivie of the Milwaukee Brewers for 
the American League lead. However, the Yankees were swept in the ALCS by 
the Kansas City Royals. As he entered the last year of his Yankee contract 
in 1981, Jackson endured several difficulties from George Steinbrenner. 
After the owner consulted Jackson about signing then-free agent Dave Winfield, 
Jackson expected Steinbrenner to work out a new contract for him as well. 
Steinbrenner never did (some say never intending to) and Jackson played 
the season as a free agent. Jackson started slowly with the bat, and when 
the 1981 Major League Baseball strike began, Steinbrenner invoked a clause 
in Jackson's contract forcing him to take a complete physical examination. 
Jackson was outraged and blasted Steinbrenner in the media. When the season 
resumed, Jackson's hitting improved, partly to show Steinbrenner he wasn't 
finished as a player. He hit a long home run into the upper deck in Game 
Five of the strike-forced 1981 American League Division Series with the 
Brewers, and the Yankees went on to win the pennant again. However, Jackson 
injured himself running the bases in Game Two of the 1981 ALCS and missed 
the first two games of the World Series, both of which the Yankees won. 
Jackson was medically cleared to play Game Three, but manager Bob Lemon 
refused to start him or even play him, allegedly acting under orders from 
Steinbrenner. The Yankees lost that game and Jackson played the remainder 
of the series, hitting a home run in Game Four. However, they lost the 
last three games and the World Series to the Dodgers. Jackson had faced 
the Dodgers four straight times in the World Series by 1981. No other player 
in Major League history has played against the same team more consecutive 
times in the Fall Classic. Jackson became a free-agent again once the 1981 
season was over. The owner of the California Angels, entertainer Gene Autry, 
had heard of Jackson's desire to return to California to play, and signed 
him to a five-year contract. On April 27, 1982, in Jackson's first game 
back at Yankee Stadium with the Angels, he broke out of a terrible season-starting 
slump to hit a home run off former teammate Ron Guidry. The at-bat began 
with Yankee fans, angry at Steinbrenner for letting Jackson get away, starting 
the "Reg-GIE!" chant, and ended it with the fans chanting "Steinbrenner 
sucks!" By the time of Jackson's election to the Hall of Fame, Steinbrenner 
had begun to say that letting him go was the biggest mistake he had made 
as Yankee owner. That season, the Angels won the American League West, 
and would do so again in 1986, but lost the American League Championship 
Series both times. On September 17, 1984, on the 17th anniversary of the 
day he hit his first home run, he hit his 500th, at Anaheim Stadium off 
Bud Black of the Royals. In 1987, he signed a one-year contract to return 
to the A's, wearing the number 44 with which he was now most associated 
rather than the number 9 he previously wore in Oakland. He announced he 
would retire after the season, at the age of 41. In his last at-bat, at 
Comiskey Park in Chicago on October 4, he collected a broken-bat single 
up the middle, but the A's lost to the White Sox, 5–2. Jackson was the 
last player in the major leagues to have played for the Kansas City Athletics. 
Jackson played 21 seasons and reached the post-season in 11 of them, winning 
six pennants and five World Series. His accomplishments include winning 
both the regular-season and World Series MVP awards in 1973, hitting 563 
career home runs (sixth all-time at the time of his retirement), maintaining 
a .490 career slugging percentage, being named to 14 All-Star teams, and 
the dubious distinction of being the all-time leader in strikeouts with 
2,597 (he finished with 13 more career strikeouts than hits) and second 
on the all-time list for most Golden sombreros (at least four strikeouts 
in a game) with 23 – he led this statistic until 2014, when he was surpassed 
by Ryan Howard. Jackson was the first major leaguer to hit one hundred 
home runs for three different clubs, having hit over 100 for the Athletics, 
Yankees, and Angels. He is the only player in the 500 home run club that 
never had consecutive 30 home run seasons in a career. During his freshman 
year at Arizona State, he met Jennie Campos, a Mexican-American.[13] Jackson 
asked Campos on a date, and discovered many similarities, including the 
ability to speak Spanish, and being raised in a single parent home (Campos's 
father was killed in the Korean War).[13] An assistant football coach tried 
to break up the couple because Jackson was black and Campos was considered 
white. The coach contacted Campos's uncle, a wealthy benefactor of the 
school, and he warned the couple that their being together was a bad idea.[45] 
But the relationship held up and she later became his first wife. Jackson 
has been divorced since 1973. Kimberly, his only child, was born in the 
late 1980s.[46] During the off-season, though still active in baseball, 
Jackson worked as a field reporter and color commentator for ABC Sports. 
Just over a month before signing with the Yankees in the fall of 1976, 
Jackson did analysis in the ABC booth with Keith Jackson and Howard Cosell 
the night his future team won the American League pennant on a homer by 
Chris Chambliss. During the 1980s (1983, 1985, and 1987 respectively), 
Jackson was given the task of presiding over the World Series Trophy presentations. 
In addition, Jackson did color commentary for the 1984 National League 
Championship Series (alongside Don Drysdale and Earl Weaver). After his 
retirement as an active player, Jackson returned to his color commentary 
role covering the 1988 American League Championship Series (alongside Gary 
Bender and Joe Morgan) for ABC. He also made appearances in the film The 
Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad!, in which he played an Angels 
outfielder diabolically programmed to kill the Queen of England. He also 
appeared in Richie Rich, BASEketball, Summer of Sam and The Benchwarmers. 
He played himself in the Archie Bunker's Place episode "Reggie-3 Archie-0" 
in 1982, a 1990 MacGyver episode, "Squeeze Play", and the Malcolm in the 
Middle episode "Polly in the Middle", from 2004. Jackson was also considered 
for the role of Geordi LaForge in the series Star Trek: The Next Generation,[47] 
a role which ultimately went to LeVar Burton. From 1981 to 1982 he hosted 
for Nickelodeon's Reggie Jackson's World of Sports. He co-authored a book 
in 2010, Sixty-Feet Six-Inches, with fellow Hall of Famer Bob Gibson. The 
book, whose title refers to the distance between the pitcher's mound and 
home plate, details their careers and approach to the game. The Sega Master 
System baseball video game Reggie Jackson Baseball, endorsed by Reggie 
Jackson, was sold exclusively in the United States. Outside of the U.S., 
it was released as American Baseball. Jackson has endured three fires to 
personal property, including a 1991 fire to his home in Oakland which destroyed 
his 1973 MVP Award. One of his warehouses holding several of his collectible 
cars was damaged in a fire, with several of the cars, valued at $3.2 million, 
ruined.[46] Jackson called on former San Francisco 49ers head coach and 
ordained minister Mike Singletary for spiritual guidance. Jackson credits 
Singletary, stating "he helped me drop that shell I put up."[46] Jackson 
and Steinbrenner would reconcile, and Steinbrenner would hire him as a 
"special assistant to the principal owner", making Jackson a consultant 
and a liaison to the team's players, particularly the minority players. 
By this point, the Yankees, long noted for being slow to adapt to changes 
in race relations, have come to develop many minority players in their 
farm system and seek out others via trades and free agency. Jackson usually 
appears in uniform at the Yankees' current spring training complex in Tampa, 
Florida, and was sought out for advice by such recent stars as Derek Jeter, 
before his retirement, and by current Yankee star Alex Rodriguez. "His 
experience is vast, and he's especially good with the young players in 
our minor league system, the 17- and 18-year old kids. They respect him 
and what he's accomplished in his career. When Reggie Jackson tells a young 
kid how he might improve his swing, he tends to listen", said Hal Steinbrenner, 
Yankees' managing general partner and co-chairperson.[46] Jackson was inducted 
to the Hall of Fame in 1993.[48] He chose to wear a Yankees cap on his 
Hall of Fame plaque[49] after the Oakland Athletics unceremoniously fired 
him from a coaching position in 1991.[50] The Yankees retired his uniform 
number 44 on August 14, 1993, shortly after his induction into the Hall 
of Fame. The Athletics retired his number 9 on May 22, 2004. He is one 
of only eight MLB players to have their numbers retired by more than one 
team, and one of only three to have different numbers retired by two MLB 
teams. In 1999, Jackson placed 48th on Sporting News 100 Greatest Baseball 
Players. That same year, he was named one of 100 finalists for the Major 
League Baseball All-Century Team, but was not one of the 30 players chosen 
by the fans. The Yankees dedicated a plaque in his honor on July 6, 2002, 
which now hangs in Monument Park at Yankee Stadium. The plaque calls him 
"One of the most colorful and exciting players of his era" and "a prolific 
hitter who thrived in pressure situations." Each Yankee so honored and 
still living was on hand for the dedication: Phil Rizzuto, Yogi Berra, 
Whitey Ford and Don Mattingly. Ron Guidry, a teammate of Jackson's for 
all five of his seasons with the Yankees, was there, and would be honored 
with a Monument Park plaque the next season. Out of respect to some of 
the players who Jackson admired while growing up, Jackson invited Willie 
Mays, Hank Aaron and Ernie Banks to attend the ceremony, and each did so. 
Like Jackson, each was a member of the Hall of Fame and had hit over 500 
career home runs. Each had also played in the Negro Leagues, as Jackson's 
father, Martinez Jackson, had. Jackson expanded his love of antique cars 
into a chain of auto dealerships in California, and used his contacts to 
become one of the foremost traders of sports memorabilia.[51] He has also 
been the public face of a group attempting to purchase a major league team, 
already having made unsuccessful attempts to buy the Athletics and the 
Angels.[52] His attempt to acquire the Angels along with Jimmy Nederlander 
(minority owner of the New York Yankees), Jackie Autry (widow of former 
Angels owner Gene Autry) and other luminaries was thwarted by Mexican American 
billionaire Arturo Moreno who outbid Jackson's group by nearly $50 million 
for the team in the winter of 2002.[53] In a July edition of Sports Illustrated, 
Jackson talked about several issues, and also was critical of the Baseball 
Writers' Association of America as he believes they have lowered their 
standards when voting for prospects in the Hall of Fame.[46] He has also 
been critical of players associated with performance-enhancing drugs (PEDs), 
including distant cousin Barry Bonds, stating "I believe that Hank Aaron 
is the home run king, not Barry Bonds, as great of a player Bonds was."[46] 
Of Alex Rodriguez, whom Jackson has worked alongside as special assistant 
to the Yankees, Jackson remarked, "Al's a very good friend. But I think 
there are real questions about his numbers. As much as I like him, what 
he admitted about his usage does cloud some of his numbers."[46] On July 
12, the Yankees released a statement from Jackson after the Sports Illustrated 
interview had been released. The press release included Jackson saying, 
"In trying to convey my feelings about a few issues that I am passionate 
about, I made the mistake of naming some specific players."[54] It had 
been reported [55] he had been told by the Yankees to steer clear from 
the team, although general manager Brian Cashman stated he had not been 
banned but only told to not join the club on a road trip to Boston and 
would later be free to interact with the club.[56] After the SI article 
became known and Jackson's status with the Yankees being talked about, 
Jackson confirmed in his statement "I continue to have a strong relationship 
with the club, and look forward to continuing my role with the team."[54] 
In 2007, ESPN aired a mini-series called The Bronx is Burning, about the 
1977 Yankees, with the conflicts and controversies around Jackson a central 
part of the storyline. Jackson is portrayed by Daniel Sunjata. In 2008, 
he threw out the first pitch at Yankees Opening Day, the last one at Yankee 
Stadium. He also threw out the first pitch at the first game at the new 
Yankee Stadium (an exhibition game). On October 9, 2009, Jackson threw 
the opening pitch for Game 2 of the ALDS between the New York Yankees and 
the Minnesota Twins. On October 18, 2010, the Ride of Fame honored Jackson 
with a double decker tour bus in New York City.[57] Italics denotes active
