Lorrin Andrews Thurston (July 31, 1858 – May 11, 1931) was a lawyer, politician, 
and businessman born and raised in the Kingdom of Hawaiʻi. The grandson 
of two of the first Christian missionaries to Hawaii, Thurston played a 
prominent role in the overthrow of the Hawaiian Kingdom that replaced Queen 
Liliʻuokalani with the Republic of Hawaii, dominated by American interests. 
He published the Pacific Commercial Advertiser (forerunner of the present-day 
Honolulu Star-Advertiser), and owned other enterprises. From 1906 to 1916 
he and friends lobbied with national politicians to create a National Park 
to preserve the Hawaiian Volcanoes. He was born on July 31, 1858 in Honolulu, 
Hawaii.[1] His father was Asa Goodale Thurston and mother Sarah Andrews.[2] 
On his father's side he was grandson of Asa and Lucy Goodale Thurston, 
who were in the first company of American Christian Missionaries to the 
Hawaiian Islands in 1820.[3] On his mother's side, he was also the grandson 
of another early missionary, Lorrin Andrews. His father was speaker of 
the house of representatives of the Kingdom of Hawaii but died when Lorrin 
was only a year and a half old in December 1859. He then moved to Maui 
with his mother.[2] He was fluent in the Hawaiian language and gave himself 
the Hawaiian nickname Kakina.[4] In 1872, he attended Punahou School, then 
known as Oahu College, where he played baseball with the sons of Alexander 
Cartwright (who invented the modern game). He was expelled shortly before 
graduation.[5] After working as a translator for a law firm and clerk at 
the Wailuku Sugar Company, he attended law school at Columbia University. 
He returned to Honolulu in 1881 and became partners in a law firm with 
William Owen Smith.[4] He married Margaret Clarissa Shipman (daughter of 
missionary William Cornelius Shipman (1824–1861) from Hilo, Hawaii and 
brother of businessman William Herbert Shipman) in February 1884. They 
had a son Robert Shipman Thurston on February 1, 1888. Margaret died in 
childbirth on May 5, 1891 (as did the infant).[5] On April 5, 1894, Lorrin 
Thurston married Harriet Potter of Saint Joseph, Michigan. They had a daughter 
Margaret Charter (the mother of Thurston Twigg-Smith) in 1895, and a son 
Lorrin Potter Thurston in 1900.[6] Lorrin Andrews Thurston died on May 
11, 1931. In 1919, Robert Thurston married Evelyn M. Scott, and Margaret 
Carter married William Twigg-Smith. Lorrin Thurston was influential in 
both the political arena and the business world of Hawaii. He followed 
his father and became a member of the legislature of the Hawaiian Kingdom 
in 1886. Thurston inherited the conservative thinking of the missionaries, 
which put him at odds with Hawaiian royalty as well as immigrants such 
as Greek hotelier George Lycurgus who enjoyed lifestyles filled with gambling 
and liquor.[7] The Missionary Party would change its name to the Reform 
Party of the Hawaiian Kingdom in 1887, as it grew to include business owners. 
In July 1887 Thurston authored what is called the "Bayonet Constitution" 
because it was imposed under threat by the Honolulu Rifle Company militia. 
It stripped the monarch King Kalākaua of all executive power. Thurston 
became the powerful Interior Minister, with Englishman William Lowthian 
Green as minister of finance, as the old cabinet of Walter M. Gibson was 
ousted.[8] Voting rights and membership of the legislature were based on 
property ownership, resulting in effective control by wealthy Americans 
and Europeans. He served in the cabinet until June 17, 1890 when he was 
replaced by Charles N. Spencer.[9] Queen Liliʻuokalani became monarch in 
1891 and tried to recover power with a new constitution. In 1892 he led 
the Annexation Club, later adopting the more dramatic title Committee of 
Safety, which planned for making Hawaii a territory of the United States. 
In 1893 the Committee of Safety was supported by the U.S. Military in an 
overthrow of the Hawaiian Kingdom, and the resulting Provisional Government 
of Hawaii was controlled by Thurston's committee. Thurston headed the commission 
sent to Washington, DC to negotiate with Benjamin Harrison for American 
annexation. Liliʻuokalani and Crown Princess Victoria Kaʻiulani also traveled 
to Washington and made it clear the new government did not have the support 
of the majority of the Hawaiian population. As news spread of the force 
used, the proposed treaty met opposition and was not ratified. A century 
later in the Apology Resolution of 1993, the U.S. Congress apologized for 
the involvement of the United States Marine Corps in the overthrow, and 
the controversy continues to modern times. In March 1893 Grover Cleveland 
became President, and disavowed the treaty. Thurston helped draft another 
constitution, and the Republic of Hawaiʻi was declared on July 4, 1894. 
He appointed Sanford B. Dole to the office of President of the Republic. 
A series of attempted revolts called the Wilcox rebellions were defeated 
during this period. In 1897 William McKinley became President and Thurston's 
commission again lobbied for annexation. The Spanish American War in April 
1898 increased American interest in the Pacific, due to battles in the 
Philippines.[10] By July 1898 the annexation formed the Territory of Hawaii 
and Thurston retired from political office to run his business affairs. 
In 1898 he purchased the Pacific Commercial Advertiser newspaper (forerunner 
of the present-day Honolulu Advertiser).[11] As principal owner and publisher 
after 1900, he promoted the sugar and pineapple industries. He headed the 
Hawaiian Promotion Committee (which evolved into the Hawaii Visitors & 
Convention Bureau), but his conservative values objected to the hula which 
he called "suggestive" and "indecent".[5] His fortunes rose considerably 
as a result of the 1898 annexation by the United States, since it removed 
all duties from shipments to the largest market. Thurston is credited with 
promoting the development of Hawaiʻi's sugarcane plantations and railroads 
and bringing the first electric street cars to Honolulu. Following World 
War I he called for government restrictions on Japanese-language schools, 
legislation that was ruled unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court. 
Thurston put out a special edition to support the fight to ban billboards 
in Hawaiʻi. He worked with Wallace Rider Farrington and Alexander Hume 
Ford to hold a world conference of newspaper editors.[11] He was also a 
volcano enthusiast, starting in his childhood exploring Haleakalā on Maui. 
He would act as an informal tour guide for visitors to the summit, and 
used oral history to estimate the time of its last eruption.[1] In 1891, 
he bought and expanded the Volcano House hotel at the rim of the active 
Kīlauea volcano on the island of Hawaiʻi.[12] Thurston commissioned a cyclorama 
of Kīlauea which he displayed in his travels to the mainland, including 
the Chicago World's Columbian Exposition of 1893 and the California Midwinter 
International Exposition of 1894 in San Francisco.[13] Thurston eventually 
made peace with George Lycurgus, who had been an insurgent against Thurston's 
government, and sold him the Volcano House in 1902. He also became friends 
with early volcanologist Dr. Thomas Jaggar in 1909 and raised money to 
fund the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory in 1912. He used his newspaper to 
promote the national park idea and convinced the territorial legislature 
to fund a group of congressmen to visit Haleakalā and Kīlauea in 1907. 
The trip included a dinner cooked over active lava vents. He hosted a visit 
by the Secretary of the Interior James Rudolph Garfield in 1908, and another 
congressional visit in 1909. He convinced Governor Walter F. Frear to introduce 
a resolution supporting the idea, and formed a survey team to propose exact 
boundaries. His newspaper printed endorsements of the park by President 
Theodore Roosevelt (a classmate at Columbia), conservationist John Muir, 
and powerful Senator Henry Cabot Lodge.[1] In 1913 he explored a lava tube 
in Hawaiʻi Volcanoes National Park that is named after him.[14] The park 
was finally formed in 1916. He added a preface and published a second edition 
of his grandmother's book on early missionary life in May 1921.[15] His 
memoirs were published in a limited edition (along with those of Sanford 
Dole) after his death in 1931 by his newspaper.[16] The newspaper business 
was run by his son Lorrin Potter Thurston, whose policy of using the term 
"Jap" during World War II pleased the military, but not local readers of 
Japanese descent. After the war readership declined, until its hostile 
take-over in 1962 by Lorrin's grandson Thurston Twigg-Smith who changed 
to a more moderate editorial line. In 1992 it was sold to Gannett Company 
as the next generation of the family had no interest in running the paper.[11] 
Twigg-Smith wrote a book about the overthrow and the role of his grandfather 
in 1998, and criticizing the modern Hawaiian Sovereignty movement.[17] 
In 1966, a chapel at Punahou School designed by Vladimir Ossipoff was named 
after Robert Shipman Thurston, Jr. of the class of 1941 who disappeared 
in World War II.[18] Thurston's legacy is preserved throughout the islands. 
On Oahu, the Thurston name serves as a marker in many places, including 
a street named after Thurston in the Punchbowl neighborhood and the Thurston 
Memorial Chapel on the Punahou Campus.[19] Others include Thurston Lava 
Tube at the Hawaii Volcanoes National Park on the Big Island. In the 2009
