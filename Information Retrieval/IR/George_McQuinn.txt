George Hartley McQuinn (May 29, 1910 – December 24, 1978) was an American 
former professional baseball player who played in Major League Baseball 
(MLB) as a first baseman for four teams, from 1936 through 1948. He was 
an All-Star for six seasons. He threw and batted left-handed. McQuinn was 
born in Arlington, Virginia and attended Washington-Lee High School. During 
his 12-year MLB playing career, McQuinn played for the Cincinnati Reds 
(1936), St. Louis Browns (1938–45), Philadelphia Athletics (1946) and New 
York Yankees (1947–48). He was selected for the American League All-Star 
team six times (MLB cancelled the 1945 All-Star Game and no All-Stars were 
named that season). In 1938, McQuinn had a .324 career-high batting average 
with 12 home runs, 42 doubles, 100 runs and 82 runs batted in (RBIs). In 
1939, his batting average was .316 with 101 runs scored, 94 RBIs, 37 doubles, 
13 triples and 20 home runs. The following year he had 39 doubles, 10 triples 
and 16 home runs. In 1944, his opening-game home run gave the Browns their 
first victory and was their only home run in a World Series game. In 1947, 
at the age of 36, McQuinn hit .304 with 13 home runs and 80 RBIs, and was 
nominated for the MVP Award. He retired at the end of the 1948 season. 
McQuinn had a career batting average of .276, and a total of 135 home runs 
and 794 RBIs in 1550 games. After retiring, he was a manager for the Quebec 
Braves in the farm system of the Boston Braves/Milwaukee Braves, and scouted 
for the Washington Senators and Montreal Expos. He was inducted into the 
Arlington Sports Hall of Fame in 1958 and the Virginia Sports Hall of Fame
