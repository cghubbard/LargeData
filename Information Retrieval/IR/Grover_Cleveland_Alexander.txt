Grover Cleveland Alexander (February 26, 1887 – November 4, 1950), nicknamed 
"Old Pete", was an American Major League Baseball pitcher. He played from 
1911 through 1930 for the Philadelphia Phillies, Chicago Cubs, and St. 
Louis Cardinals. He was elected into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1938.[1] 
He was portrayed by future President of the United States Ronald Reagan 
in a 1952 biographical film, The Winning Team. Alexander was born in Elba, 
Nebraska,[2] in the first term of President Grover Cleveland and was one 
of thirteen children. He played semi-professional baseball in his youth, 
signing his first professional contract at age 20 in 1907 for $50 per month. 
In 1909 he played for the Galesburg Boosters in the Class D Illinois–Missouri 
League and went 15-8 that year. His career was almost ended when he was 
struck by a thrown ball while baserunning.[2] Although this ended his 1909 
season, he recovered by 1910 to become a star pitcher again, finishing 
with a 29-11 record for the Syracuse Stars in the Class B New York State 
League, before being sold to the Philadelphia Phillies for $750.[3] Alexander 
made his Philadelphia debut during the pre-season 1911 City Series, pitching 
five innings of no-hit, no-run baseball against the Athletics. He made 
his official Major League debut on April 15.[4] He was joined on the Phillies 
that year by catcher Bill Killefer, who went on to become Alexander's favorite 
receiver, catching 250 of his games.[5][6] In his rookie year, Alexander 
led the league with 28 wins (a modern-day rookie record), 31 complete games, 
367 innings pitched, and seven shutouts, while finishing second in strikeouts 
and fourth in ERA.[2] From 1912 to 1921, Alexander led the league in ERA 
five times (1915–17, 1919, and 1920), wins five times (1914–17, 1920), 
innings six times (1912, 1914–17, 1920), strikeouts six times (1912, 1914–1917, 
1920), complete games five times (1914–1917, 1920), and shutouts five times 
(1915, 1916 [a single-season record 16], 1917, 1919, 1921).[2] He won pitching's 
Triple Crown in 1915, 1916, and 1920, and is sometimes[2] credited with 
a fourth in 1917. In 1915, he was instrumental in leading the Phillies 
to their first pennant,[2] and he pitched a record four one-hitters. After 
the 1917 season, the Phillies sold Alexander to the Cubs, ostensibly fearful 
that he would be lost to the army in World War I, but as Phillies owner 
William Baker admitted later, "I needed the money". Alexander was drafted 
and one month before shipping out, he married Amy Marie Arrants on May 
31 in a courthouse ceremony in Manhattan, Kansas (the couple divorced in 
1929, remarried in 1931, and divorced again in 1941).[7][8] Alexander spent 
most of the 1918 season in France as a sergeant with the 342nd Field Artillery. 
While he was serving in France, he was exposed to German mustard gas and 
a shell exploded near him, causing partial hearing loss and triggering 
the onset of epilepsy. Following his return from the war, Alexander suffered 
from shell shock and was plagued with epileptic seizures, which only exacerbated 
the problems he already was experiencing with alcohol. Always a drinker, 
Alexander hit the bottle particularly hard as a result of the physical 
and emotional injuries he sustained in the war – injuries that plagued 
him for the rest of his life. People often misinterpreted his seizure-related 
problems as drunkenness. In spite of all this, Alexander gave Chicago several 
successful years and won another pitching triple crown in 1920. Tiring 
of his increasing drunkenness and insubordination that was often directly 
related to his epilepsy, the Cubs sold him to the Cardinals in the middle 
of the 1926 season for the waiver price.[2] Then-Cubs manager, Joe McCarthy 
stated the reason for the sale was, "The Cubs finished last last year and 
if they finish last again, I'd rather it be without [Alexander]." The Cardinals 
won the National League pennant that year and met the New York Yankees 
in the World Series, where Alexander pitched complete game victories in 
Games 2 and 6. According to teammate Bob O'Farrell in The Glory of Their 
Times, after the game six victory, Alexander got drunk that night and was 
still feeling the effects when he was sent out to pitch the next day in 
Game 7.[9] Alexander came to the game in the seventh inning after starter 
Jesse Haines developed a blister, with the Cardinals ahead 3–2, the bases 
loaded and two out. Facing Yankee slugger Tony Lazzeri, Alexander struck 
him out and then held the Yankees scoreless for two more innings to preserve 
the win and give St. Louis the championship. He had one last 20-win season 
for the Cardinals in 1927, but his continued drinking finally did him in. 
He left major league baseball after a brief return to the Phillies in 1930, 
and pitched for the House of David until 1940.[10] Alexander attended game 
three of the 1950 World Series at Yankee Stadium where he saw the Phillies 
lose to the Yankees.[11] He died less than a month later, on November 4 
in St. Paul, Nebraska, at the age of 63.[12] Alexander's 90 shutouts are 
a National League record and his 373 wins are tied with Christy Mathewson 
for first in the National League record book. He is also third all time 
in wins, tenth in innings pitched (5190), second in shutouts, and eighth 
in hits allowed (4868). At the time of Alexander's final victory in August 
1929 the news media reported that he had broken Mathewson's career victories 
record of 372. In the 1940s Mathewson was discovered to have qualified 
for an additional victory (May 21, 1912) and his total was officially upped 
to 373 and into a tie with Alexander. Alexander posted a lifetime winning 
percentage of .642. Alexander has the most career wins of any pitcher who 
never threw a no-hitter. In 1915 he won his first World Series game (the 
opening game of that series), for the Philadelphia Phillies. It would be 
65 years before the Phillies won another World Series game. In 1999 he 
ranked number 12 on The Sporting News list of the 100 Greatest Baseball 
Players,[13] and was a nominee for the Major League Baseball All-Century 
Team. Alexander was elected to Baseball's Hall of Fame in 1938, the third 
year of the Hall. Alexander was the only player elected that year.[14] 
During the late 1930s and early 1940s, Alexander continued to play baseball, 
touring as a player-coach for the Grover Cleveland Alexander's House of 
David Team.[10] The team's tour was managed by J. L. Wilkinson and often 
played against the Kansas City Monarchs. Alexander played with and against 
many of the Negro League stars of the day, including Satchel Paige,[10] 
John Donaldson, Newt Joseph,[10] Chet Brewer, and Andy Cooper. Newspapers 
often mentioned Alexander's full name when writing about him, in addition 
to just "Grover". He was also sometimes called "Alec", and on occasions 
when he succeeded in grand fashion (as with the 1926 World Series), they 
would call him "Alexander the Great". So dominant was he during the 1920s 
that many players and writers of his era referred to him as "the best pitcher 
to ever put on a pair of shoes".[15] The origin of the nickname "Old Pete" 
is something of a mystery. It is uncertain how frequently Alexander was 
publicly called by that nickname during his playing days. On his 1940 Playball 
baseball card he was referred to as "Ol' Pete." In The World Series and 
Highlights of Baseball, by Lamont Buchanan, published in 1951, the year 
after Alexander died, on pp. 106–107 the author refers to "Pete Alexander" 
and "Ol' Pete" in a matter-of-fact way, suggesting the nickname was well 
known. When he won his 373rd game on August 10, 1929, one newspaper had 
called him "old Pete", indicating that the nickname was in public circulation.[16] 
His nickname among family friends in Nebraska was "Dode." [17] "Grover 
Cleveland Alexander wasn't drunk out there on the mound, the way people 
thought. He was an epileptic. Old Pete would fall down with a seizure between 
innings, then go back and pitch another shutout." -Ty Cobb[18] Alexander 
was the subject of the 1952 biographical film The Winning Team, in which 
he was played by Ronald Reagan. Baseball commentator Bill James called 
the film "an awful movie, a Reader's Digest movie, reducing the events 
of Alexander's life to a cliché." Nevertheless, the film, which also starred 
Doris Day as Mrs. Alexander, was loved by many of those who saw it.[citation 
needed] The block-letter "P" from the 1915 season uniforms was retired 
by the Phillies in 2001 to honor Alexander's Phillies career. Alexander 
is mentioned in the Leave It to Beaver third-season episode "Ward's Baseball" 
in which Ward has a baseball with several autographs and Alexander's is 
one of them. Alexander is the first player mentioned in the poem Line-Up 
for Yesterday by Ogden Nash: A is for Alex The great Alexander; More Goose
