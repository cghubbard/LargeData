In baseball, an inside-the-park home run is a play where a batter hits 
a home run without hitting the ball out of the field of play. It is also 
known as an "in-the-park home run" or "in the park homer". To score an 
inside-the-park home run, the player must touch all four bases (in the 
order of first, second and third, ending at home plate) before a fielder 
on the opposing team tags him out. In Major League Baseball, if the defensive 
team commits an error during the play, it is not scored as a home run, 
but rather advancing on an error.[1] Statistically, an inside-the-park 
home run counts as a regular home run in the player's season and career 
totals. The vast majority of home runs occur when the batter hits the ball 
beyond the outfield fence on the fly; this is purely a feat of hitting 
with power, along with a fortuitous flight angle of the ball. The inside-the-park 
home run is of a very different character; it is primarily a feat of fast 
baserunning, though strong hitting is also typically involved. In the early 
days of Major League Baseball, with outfields more spacious and less uniform 
from ballpark to ballpark, inside-the-park home runs were common. However, 
in the modern era, with outfields less spacious, the feat has become increasingly 
rare, happening only a handful of times each season. Today an inside-the-park 
home run is typically accomplished by a fast baserunner hitting the ball 
in such a way that the ball bounces far away from the opposing team's fielders. 
In many such cases (such as Alcides Escobar's inside-the-park homer in 
the 2015 World Series), the outfielder misjudges the ball or otherwise 
plays it badly, but not so badly that an error is charged.[2][3] Of the 
154,483 home runs hit between 1951 and 2000, 975 (about 1 in every 158) 
were inside-the-park. The percentage has dwindled since the increase in
