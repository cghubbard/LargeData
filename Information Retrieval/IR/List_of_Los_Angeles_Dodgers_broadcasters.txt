Red Barber was the Dodgers original broadcaster, calling Brooklyn Dodgers 
games on the radio (and later TV) from 1939-1953. Vin Scully has called 
Dodgers games since 1950.[1] His longtime partners were Jerry Doggett (1956–1987) 
and Ross Porter (1977–2004).[1] In 1976, he was selected by Dodgers fans 
as the Most Memorable Personality (on the field or off) in the team's history. 
He is also a recipient of the Baseball Hall of Fame's Ford C. Frick Award 
for broadcasters (inducted in 1982). He currently is in his 67th year with 
the team. Unlike the modern style in which multiple sportscasters have 
an on-air conversation (usually with one functioning as play-by-play announcer 
and the other(s) as color commentator), Scully, Doggett and Porter generally 
called games solo, trading with each other inning-by-inning. In the 1980s 
and early 1990s, Scully would call the radio broadcast except for the 3rd 
and 7th inning; allowing the other Dodger commentators to broadcast an 
inning. In the later 90s, Scully would call the first three innings and 
the last three on television and the middle three on the radio, switching 
off with his partners. When Doggett retired after the 1987 season, he was 
replaced by Hall-of-Fame Dodgers pitcher Don Drysdale, who previously broadcast 
games for the California Angels.[1] Drysdale died in his hotel room following 
a heart attack before a game in 1993, resulting in a very difficult broadcast 
for Scully and Porter, who were told of the death but could not mention 
it on-air until Drysdale's family had been notified and the official announcement 
of the death made.[2] He was replaced by former Dodgers outfielder Rick 
Monday.[1] Porter's tenure was terminated somewhat controversially after 
the 2004 season, after which the current format of play-by-play announcers 
and color commentators was installed, led by newcomer Charley Steiner and 
Monday.[1] Scully, however, continues to announce solo. Scully calls roughly 
80 games per season (all home games and select road games in Southern California)[3] 
for both radio and television. Scully is simulcast for the first three 
innings of each of his appearances, then announces the remaining innings 
only for the TV audience. If Scully is calling the game, Charley Steiner 
takes over play-by-play on radio beginning with the fourth inning, with 
Rick Monday as color commentator.[3] If Scully is not calling the game, 
an alternate team of broadcasters (Steiner and Steve Lyons from 2005-2008), 
Lyons and Eric Collins from 2009-2013 and Steiner and Orel Hershiser starting 
in 2014) call the entire game on television while Steiner and Monday do 
the same on radio. Starting in 2014, Nomar Garciaparra joined Steiner and 
Hershiser to form a three-man television crew; for those games, Kevin Kennedy 
works with Monday on radio. In 2016, Joe Davis joined the broadcast team 
to call approximately 50 road games on television. On October 2, 2016 Scully 
will call his final broadcast as a Dodger Broadcaster in San Francisco. 
It'll officially mark the end of an era. In the event the Dodgers are in 
post-season play, Scully calls the first three and last three innings of 
the radio broadcast alone; with Charley Steiner and Rick Monday handling 
the middle innings. The Dodgers also broadcast on radio in Spanish, and 
the play-by-play is handled by another Ford C. Frick Award winner, Jaime 
Jarrín. Jarrin has been with the Dodgers since 1959. The color analyst 
for some games is former Dodger pitcher Fernando Valenzuela, for whom Jarrin 
once translated post-game interviews. The Spanish-language flagship is 
KTNQ. The Dodgers also broadcast games in Korean, with all games broadcast 
in Korean on a second audio program on television, with selected games 
broadcast on KMPC Radio Korea. Richard Choi does play-by-play with Chong 
Ho Yim the color commentator. The pre-game show on the radio is hosted 
by Tim Cates and the post-game show features David Vassegh and Tony Gwynn, 
Jr.. From 2006-2013, the over-the-air games were aired on KCAL-TV after 
the two parties signed a multi-year, multimillion-dollar deal in 2005, 
and they aired 50 games per season. The previous over-the-air television 
homes for the Dodgers in Los Angeles were KCOP from 2002–2005; KTLA from 
1993–2001; and KTTV from 1958–1992. In their New York days, WOR-TV carried 
Dodgers games from 1950 until their move following the 1957 season. The 
cable television home of the Dodgers was Fox Sports Net Prime Ticket (previously 
known as Fox Sports Net West 2) from 1997-2013. Starting in the late 1970s 
through the early 1990s, the Dodgers put a small number of their home games 
on a subscription/pay-per-view service appropriately carried Dodgervision. 
During that timeframe, in addition to the road telecasts from KTTV, selected 
home games were also televised on the ONTV subscription service, the now-defunct 
Z Channel/SportsChannel Los Angeles network, and then again, on a pay-per-view 
basis until a majority of Dodgers games debuted on the then-new Fox Sports 
Net West 2 in 1997, just around the same time FSN West 2's parent company, 
News Corporation (also owner of KTTV) bought the team from the O'Malley 
family. In relation to News Corp's purchase of the Dodgers, there was speculation 
that the Dodgers over-the-air telecasts would return to KTTV, but they 
were still under contract to KTLA. KTLA's contract with the Dodgers ended 
in 2001, and the over-the-air telecasts then moved to KTTV's now-sister 
station, KCOP, with the production handled by FSN West 2. On radio, the 
Dodgers have broadcast on KLAC (570 AM) since 2012. In October 2011 the 
team signed a three-year deal with KLAC parent company Clear Channel Communications. 
KABC (790 AM) was the Dodgers' flagship station from 1973 through 1997 
and from 2008 through 2011. The games had aired on KFWB (980 AM) from 2002 
through 2007. Other station to carry the Dodgers included KXTA (1150 AM; 
now KEIB), which was a sports-talk station, from 1998 through 2001. KFI 
(640 AM) was the radio flagship from 1961 to 1972. And previous to that, 
KMPC (710 AM, now KSPN) was the original flagship radio station in Los 
Angeles of the vast Dodgers Radio Network, which is carried on 16 stations 
in five states (California, Nevada, New Mexico, Hawaii, Florida, plus the 
U.S. Virgin Islands). Their Spanish radio network was led by KHJ which 
took over in 2008 from longtime home KWKW (1330 AM), with Jarrin, Pepe 
Yñiguez, and former Dodger great Fernando Valenzuela on the call, and was 
carried on six stations in California, Nevada, and Arizona. In 2011 Spanish-language 
Dodger broadcasts returned to KTNQ, the station that carried the games 
from 1979 to 1986. Scully normally does all nine innings (plus extra innings 
if necessary) on locally televised games, with the first three innings 
being simulcast on radio, while Steiner and Monday take over in the final 
innings on radio. However, Scully's current schedule calls for him to work 
only the home and road games within the National League Western division, 
except Colorado, and any West Coast interleague contests within the American 
League West, as he decided in recent years to cut back on his schedule. 
Fox Sports West's broadcast deal with the team expired at the end of the 
2013 MLB season. On June 20, 2011, MLB Commissioner Bud Selig rejected 
a proposed contract extension between the Dodgers and Fox, stating "Critically, 
the transaction is structured to facilitate the further diversion of Dodgers 
assets for the personal needs of Mr. McCourt. Given the magnitude of the 
transaction, such a diversion of assets would have the effect of mortgaging 
the future of the franchise to the long-term detriment of the club and 
its fans." [4] Both Fox Sports West and the Dodgers were involved in separate 
lawsuits over the team's broadcast rights as well as the sale of the club.[5][6] 
On January 10, 2012, Fox and the Dodgers reached a settlement in court, 
clearing the way for the sale of the team.[7] Fox's exclusive negotiating 
period with the Dodgers expired on November 30, 2012: both sides were in 
discussions over a TV deal worth $6 billion over 25 years. The team was 
also in talks to move to the newly formed Time Warner Cable SportsNet, 
or to form a team-owned regional sports network with Dick Clark Productions 
(which was also recently acquired by the Dodgers' parent company, Guggenheim 
Partners).[8] In 2014 the Dodgers began a new exclusive television deal 
with Time Warner Cable and began airing games on the team-controlled cable 
channel, SportsNet LA. This meant the end of over-the-air broadcast of
