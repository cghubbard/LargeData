In New Zealand, baseball is considered a minority sport, trailing in popularity 
far behind sports such as rugby union and cricket. Albert Spalding's team 
of All-Stars and the Chicago Club in 1888 is the first known baseball game 
played in New Zealand and perhaps in the Southern Hemisphere. During that 
tour, many New Zealand cricket players had small matches between the two 
touring sides. Since that time, various local competitions have existed, 
but it wasn't until 1989 that the New Zealand Baseball Association was 
formed, consisting of teams in the Auckland area. Ed Mason and Mike Reilly 
invited perspective players to register their interest. They then formed 
the New Zealand Baseball Association, with Ed Mason being President and 
Mike Rielly taking on the Vice President position. City Blues was the first 
Club under this umbrella and every year in commemoration of this,there 
is a "Ed Mason Classic" played. It would be 14 more years before baseball 
would venture out of Auckland with the creation of the Canterbury Baseball 
Club in 2003. 2006 saw the Northland Baseball Club and the Manawatu Baseball 
Club form. New Zealand sends Little League teams to compete in the Asia 
Pacific region and also fields AA, AAA and senior national teams. The senior 
national team plays at the Australian Provincial Championships every year. 
Only three players from New Zealand have played baseball professionally, 
including Scott Campbell, who played for the AAA affiliate of the Toronto 
Blue Jays, the Las Vegas 51s, after being drafted in the 2006 Major League 
Baseball Draft. Travis Wilson played in the minor league system for eight 
years with the Atlanta Braves and Cincinnati Reds, but AAA was the highest 
level he made. Daniel Lamb-Hunt is also of New Zealand heritage and signed 
with the Atlanta Braves in 2005. Canadian Scott Richmond, is also of Kiwi
