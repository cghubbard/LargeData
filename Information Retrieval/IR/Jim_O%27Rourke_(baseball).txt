As Player As Manager James Henry O'Rourke (September 1, 1850 – January 
8, 1919), nicknamed "Orator Jim", was an American professional baseball 
player in the National Association and Major League Baseball who played 
primarily as a left fielder. For the period 1876–1892, he ranks behind 
only Cap Anson in career major league games played (1644), hits (2146), 
at-bats (6884), doubles (392) and total bases (2936), and behind only Harry 
Stovey in runs scored (1370). (Stovey was a younger player. Anson played 
five seasons and O'Rourke four prior to 1876.) O'Rourke was born in East 
Bridgeport, Connecticut, and worked on his family's farm while playing 
youth league and semi-pro baseball. He began his professional career as 
a member of the Middletown Mansfields in 1872, joining the one-year-old 
National Association team as a catcher. The Mansfields were not a top-tier 
team, and folded in August, but O'Rourke had impressed other teams sufficiently 
enough to be offered a contract with the Boston Red Stockings, with whom 
he played until 1878. On April 22, 1876, O'Rourke had the first base hit 
in National League history. He graduated from Yale Law School in 1887 with 
an LL.B.,[1] practicing law in Bridgeport between early playing stints, 
and earning the nickname "Orator Jim" because of his verbosity on the field, 
his intellect, and his law degree—uncommon in a game regarded as a rough 
immigrant sport at the time.[2] After leaving the major leagues following 
the 1893 season he continued to play in the minor leagues until he was 
over 50 years old. As an executive of the Bridgeport team in the Connecticut 
League, in 1895 O'Rourke hired the first African American minor league 
baseball player in history.[3] In 1904 he made a final appearance with 
the New York Giants under manager and friend John McGraw, becoming at age 
54 the oldest player ever to appear in the National League, and the oldest 
player to hit safely in a major league game.[4][5][6] O'Rourke is one of 
only 29 players in baseball history to appear in Major League games in 
four decades. In 1912 returned to the field to catch a complete minor league 
game at the age of 60.[7][8] O'Rourke died of pneumonia at age 68 in Bridgeport, 
Connecticut. He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1945 as one 
of the earliest inductees from the 19th century. His older brother John 
O'Rourke and his son James "Queenie" O'Rourke also played in the majors. 
One legend concerning O'Rourke is that he was asked to drop the "O'" from 
his last name when he signed a contract with Boston and its Protestant 
backers. The son of Irish immigrants and the husband of a woman born in 
Ireland, O'Rourke refused, saying "I would rather die than give up my father's 
name. A million dollars would not tempt me."[9] Another legend about O'Rourke 
is that his signing by the Mansfields in 1872 was conditioned on the team 
finding someone to take over O'Rourke's chores on his parents' farm. "O'Rourke 
has made a brilliant record for himself as an outfielder, being an excellent 
judge of a ball, a swift runner, and making the most difficult running 
catches with the utmost ease and certainty. As a thrower, too, he stands 
pre-eminent, being credited with a throw of 365 feet, the next to the longest
