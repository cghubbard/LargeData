In 1961 the Twins finished the season with a record of 70–90, good for 
seventh in the American League, which had expanded from 8 to 10 teams during 
the 1960–61 offseason. It was the franchise's first season in Minnesota 
after 60 seasons in Washington, D.C. The Twins played their home games 
at Metropolitan Stadium. After 60 seasons in Washington, the Senators franchise 
moved to the Minneapolis–Saint Paul area – or, more precisely, Bloomington, 
Minnesota – in 1961. In honor of the cities' nickname, "The Twin Cities", 
the franchise changed the team's name to the Twins. As one of the conditions 
to allow the team to move, there would be a new Senators franchise in Washington 
in 1961, an expansion team that joined the league along with the Los Angeles 
Angels. The Twins won their first-ever game, when Pedro Ramos shut out 
the New York Yankees in Yankee Stadium on April 11. In beating the defending 
American League champs 6–0, Ramos out-dueled New York ace Whitey Ford, 
allowing just three hits and a walk. Ramos drove in two with a single himself. 
Bob Allison hit the first home run in Minnesota big-league history with 
a solo shot off Ford in the seventh inning, and Reno Bertoia followed with 
another homer, a two-run blast, an inning later off Ralph Terry.[1] On 
April 21, the Twins lost their home opener to the expansion team that replaced 
them in the nation's capital, the second edition of the Senators, 5–3, 
before 24,606 at Metropolitan Stadium.[2] The move to Minnesota immediately 
paid dividends at the turnstiles, where they drew 1,256,723 fans, the third 
highest total in the American League. The previous year in Washington, 
the Senators drew just 743,404 fans, worst in the league.[3] However, the 
team's record went in the other direction, as they dropped from 73–81 and 
fifth place in 1960 to 70–90 and seventh place under the new 162-game AL 
schedule. In early June, after a losing streak that reached eleven games, 
Twins owner Calvin Griffith directed manager Cookie Lavagetto to take a 
week-long sabbatical. Two weeks after his return, Lavagetto was fired by 
Griffith. Cookie had been managing the club since the 1957 season. He was 
replaced by his first base coach Sam Mele.[4] In a home Fourth of July 
double-header against Chicago, the Twins' Julio Bécquer hit a pinch hit 
grand slam home run that was the first of its kind in major league history—each 
run was credited to a different Chicago pitcher (Billy Pierce, Russ Kemmerer, 
Frank Baumann and Warren Hacker). In the second game, Twins slugger Harmon 
Killebrew hit an inside-the-park home run—the only one he would hit in 
his 573-homer career. Two Twins made the All-Star Game: first baseman Harmon 
Killebrew (both games) and pitcher Camilo Pascual (second game). On August 
20, pitchers Jack Kralick and Al Schroll each hit a home run against the 
Los Angeles Angels—the sixth and final pitching duo to do so in the same 
game. On September 27, Schroll took a no-hitter into the ninth inning before 
giving up four runs on two walks and two hits.[5] Pedro Ramos was the first 
pitcher to lead the American League in losses for four years in a row.[6] 
Both Harmon Killebrew and Bob Allison topped 100 in RBI, walks and strikeouts. 
Harmon Killebrew led the team with 46 home runs, 122 runs batted in, and 
94 runs scored. Camilo Pascual led the Twins with 15 wins and a 3.46 ERA. 
Catcher Earl Battey won his second Gold Glove Award.[7] [1] [2] [3] [4]
