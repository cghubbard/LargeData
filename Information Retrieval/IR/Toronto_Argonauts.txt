The Toronto Argonauts are a professional Canadian football team competing 
in the East Division of the Canadian Football League (CFL). Based in Toronto, 
Ontario, the team was founded in 1873, and is the oldest existing professional 
sports team in North America still using its original name.[3] The team's 
origins date back to a modified version of rugby football that emerged 
in North America in the latter half of the nineteenth century. The Argonauts 
played their home games at Rogers Centre from 1989 until 2016 when the 
team moved to BMO Field, the fifth stadium site to host the team. The current 
team is coached by Scott Milanovich and led at quarterback by Ricky Ray. 
The Argonauts have won the Grey Cup a record 16 times and have appeared 
in the final 22 times. Most recently they defeated the Calgary Stampeders 
35–22 at home in the 100th Grey Cup in 2012. The Argonauts hold the best 
winning percentage in the championship game (72.7%)[4] and have the longest 
active winning streak in games in which they have appeared, at five. The 
Argonauts have faced every current western CFL team at least once in the 
Grey Cup, while their most celebrated divisional rivalry has been with 
the Hamilton Tiger-Cats. The team was owned by the Argonaut Rowing Club 
for its first 83 years, and has been owned by a series of business interests 
since 1956. The Argonauts were a fixture on the Toronto sports scene for 
decades, with attendance peaking in the 1970s. In May 2015 it was announced 
that a consortium of Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment's Larry Tanenbaum 
(via the Kilmer Group) and Bell Canada would acquire the team. The sale 
included a scheduled move to MLSE run BMO Field for the 2016 season, which 
has long been proposed given attendance under-utilization at Rogers Centre 
and plans to install natural grass at the domed stadium, rendering it unfit 
for football.[2] Given the length of franchise history, dozens of players, 
coaches, and management have been honoured in some form over the years. 
The team recognizes a select group of players with retired numbers: early 
greats Joe Krol and Dick Shatto, stalwart offensive lineman Danny Nykoluk, 
and Michael "Pinball" Clemons who has been the most recent face of the 
team. Since the team's foundation in 1873, the "Argonauts" name has been 
in continuous use, a record in North American professional sports.[3] The 
Chicago Cubs (1870) and the Atlanta Braves (1871) franchises of Major League 
Baseball are older, but both teams have changed their name more than once, 
and the Braves have also changed cities. The Argonauts also claim to be 
the oldest professional football team in North America.[5] The claim is 
debatable, as the Hamilton Tigers date to 1869; they merged with the Hamilton 
Wildcats in 1950 to form the Hamilton Tiger-Cats.[6] The name "Argonauts" 
is derived from Greek mythology: according to legend, Jason and the Argonauts 
were a group of heroes who set out to find the Golden Fleece aboard the 
ship Argo sometime before the Trojan War. Given its nautical theme, the 
name Argonaut was adopted by a group of amateur rowers in Toronto in 1872. 
The Argonaut Rowing Club, which still exists today, went on to found the 
football club with the same name a year later. Given their roots in a rowing 
squad, the team is often referred to as the "boatmen" and less often the 
"scullers".[7] In the 19th century, the most renowned rowing teams in the 
world were from the University of Oxford and the University of Cambridge 
in England. The Toronto rowers, many of whom had associations with the 
English schools, adopted uniforms incorporating the light blue of Cambridge 
and the dark blue of Oxford.[8] In turn, the footballers adopted the colours 
and the phrase "double blue" would become synonymous with the team.[note 
1] Blue has become the traditional colour of top-level teams in Toronto 
(e.g. the Toronto Maple Leafs and Toronto Blue Jays). The team's other 
official colour is white. Its current helmet design features an Oxford 
blue background, with an Oxford blue and Cambridge blue round shield inscribed 
with a white, capital letter A. For most of the team's history, the logo 
featured some form of a boat, often incorporating a football.[9] "On Sunday 
afternoon a game of foot ball, Rugby rules, was played on the University 
ground, between the Argonauts, of Toronto, and the Hamilton club. After 
a most exciting contest, one goal was secured at five o'clock by the Toronto 
men, the ball being kicked through the Hamilton flags by Buchanan." The 
first recorded game of what would become known as Canadian football was 
played in Toronto on November 9, 1861, featuring University of Toronto 
students. The game at the time was a modified version of English rugby 
and it gained popularity throughout the 1860s. Rugby itself was still an 
infant game having evolved out of association football (soccer) in the 
1830s.[11] Seeking a way to keep fit after summer, the Argonaut Rowing 
Club (ARC) formed their own rugby-football squad on October 4, 1873. The 
Argonauts Football Club would play their first game against Hamilton on 
October 18 of that year (a victory), beginning a storied rivalry.[note 
2] H.T. Glazebrook served as their first captain and head coach. Establishment 
of the football team was formalized by the ARC on September 17, 1874, with 
a subscription fee of one dollar charged per player.[14][15] The football 
team played a handful of challenge matches—one team inviting another to 
play—as an amateur squad against university and city teams every year throughout 
the 1870s, with one dormant year in 1879, likely due to injuries.[15] In 
1883 the Toronto Football Club, other city teams from Ontario and university 
squads from Toronto, Queens University and Royal Military College formed 
the Ontario Rugby Football Union (ORFU); it was the first rugby football 
organization with a league and playoff structure in North America.[16] 
The Toronto Football Club were league victors in the first year.[17] Starting 
in 1884 a "Dominion Championship"—a precursor to the Grey Cup—was held, 
pitting the victors of the country's two organized leagues, the ORFU and 
Quebec Rugby Football Union, against each other; it was organized nationally 
by the Canadian Rugby Union (CRU) from 1892 onwards. In the first true 
national championship, the Montreal Football Club defeated the Toronto 
Football Club on November 5, 1884 by a score of 30–0. Argonauts would lose 
the Dominion Title in 1901 to Ottawa College.[18] The Ottawa team and the 
Hamilton Tigers were frequent opponents in this era. Over the thirty years 
from 1880 onwards, rule changes were incrementally introduced into the 
game, including the adoption of the line of scrimmage, scoring that began 
to resemble the modern version, and the down and yardage structure. Popular 
personalities of the era included player-coach Joe Wright Sr., one of the 
best all around Canadian athletes at the turn of the century.[19] One major 
outstanding issue within the CRU at the time was the role of professional 
versus amateur players; this dispute caused the Argonauts to withdraw from 
the league in 1903 and eventually led to the establishment of a new league, 
The Big Four or Interprovincial Rugby Football League.[17][18] Alongside 
the professionalism dispute, there was serious disagreement over the adoption 
of the Burnside rules, with Ontario, Quebec, and the intercollegiate league 
often not in alignment.[20] Amongst other critical innovations, the Burnside 
rules reduced the number of men per side to 12 and introduced the ten yards 
in three downs structure that is central to the modern game.[21] Seeking 
looser rules regarding the employment of professional players, Toronto 
and other cities split from the ORFU and formed the Interprovincial Rugby 
Football Union (IRFU) in 1907. These clubs were the vaunted "Big Four"—Toronto, 
Hamilton, Ottawa, and Montreal—that formed the precursor to Eastern Division 
of the Canadian Football League.[17] The IRFU continued under the larger 
auspices of the Canadian Rugby Union. Beginning in 1909, the CRU champion 
was awarded the Grey Cup, with the Big Four competing against university 
squads and eventually teams from Western Canada. The Argonauts first competed 
for the Cup in 1911, losing 14 to 7 to the University of Toronto in front 
of a then record 13,687 spectators at the newly opened Varsity Stadium. 
The team would claim their first championship in 1914, exacting revenge 
on U of T with a 14 to 2 victory. Their star runner and kicker in their 
first championship year was Jack O'Conner, who scored a league record 44 
points.[22] After play was halted during World War I, the Argos again achieved 
success in the early 1920s on the back of one Canada's greatest ever sportsmen. 
Lionel Conacher, the "Big Train," led the team to two perfect 6–0 seasons 
in 1921 and 1922. In the first season he accounted for 85 of his team's 
167 points, and 15 of the points in the Grey Cup game, a 23–0 drubbing 
of the Edmonton Eskimos. It was the first east-west Grey Cup championship 
in Canadian history.[23] The 1921 Grey Cup victory was their last until 
1933, at which point the Argonauts became the dominant team of an increasingly 
nationwide sport. They put together a number of Grey Cup dynasties in the 
1930s and 1940s, winning eight of twenty Grey Cups between 1933 and 1952. 
The Winnipeg Blue Bombers were most often on the receiving end of Argo 
Grey Cup victories in this era.[24] From 1933 to 1941 Lew Hayman coached 
the team with a still unparalleled winning ratio of 45–15–2. Their first 
back-to-back Grey Cups came in 1937 and 1938. This was also the era of 
the famed Stukus brothers—Annis, Bill, and Frank—who proved a potent all-purpose 
trio in the Argonauts' championship years.[25] Joe "King" Krol and Royal 
Copeland, the so-called Gold Dust Twins, were the best-known players of 
the 1940s. In an era where players still played multiple positions, they 
were a threat in every capacity: running, passing, catching, kicking, and 
playing defence. Often connecting with each other for points, they led 
the Argos to a Grey Cup threepeat between 1945 and 1947.[27] 1949 and 1950 
marked a watershed in Argonauts history as the team began large scale importation 
of American players for the first time.[28][29] The team also broke a cultural 
barrier in 1950 with the signing of their first black player: Ulysses "Crazy 
Legs" Curtis would play five strong years with the team.[30] Frank Clair 
was brought in as coach in 1950 and left his mark on the revamped roster; 
he led the team to Grey Cup wins in 1950 and 1952.[31][32] The first of 
these was a 13–0 victory over Winnipeg in the notorious Mud Bowl. A November 
snow storm followed by mild conditions turned Varsity Stadium into a bog 
and the play was a shambles; one Winnipeg player is reported to have almost 
drowned in the muck.[33] At some time during this period, the phrase "Argo 
Bounce" came to refer to the Argonauts' propensity to receive a lucky bounce 
of the football. The phrase may date to the Grey Cups of the 1930s, all 
of which featured improbable bounces and fumbles favouring the Argos; the 
phrase was popularized in print by Annis Stukus in the 1940s. It is still 
in use today, with a number of fortunate on-field happenings attributed 
to the "bounce".[34] The three decades after the 1952 Grey Cup victory 
have been called the Argonauts' Dark Ages.[35] The team went thirty-one 
years between championship victories and nineteen without even making an 
appearance in the final. Part of the reason was a salary cap introduced 
in 1953 that cost them many talented players. For the first time in decades, 
they began ranking at the bottom of the Eastern Division.[35] The management 
style under new owner John Bassett has also been blamed: young talent was 
traded or allowed to leave and the team could not form a nucleus of championship 
players; coaches came and went rapidly.[36] Two notable events occurred 
off-field at the end of the 1950s: in 1958 the Argonauts became a founding 
member of the Canadian Football League and a year later found a new home 
at Exhibition Stadium.[note 3] The Argonauts did have some standout players 
in the 1950s and 1960s. The stalwart of the era was Dick Shatto, an Ohioan 
who played twelve seasons from 1954 to 1965. Listed as a running back, 
Shatto was a dual threat to run and receive and continues to hold the team 
regular season records for touchdowns (91) and total yards gained (6,958).[37] 
Living in Toronto year round, Shatto set down deep roots in the city and 
would eventually serve as the Argonauts general manager.[38] Another American, 
Tobin Rote, set numerous passing marks in three years at quarterback from 
1960 to 1962. Known for his good living off the field, Rote still holds 
the Argos single game passing record with 524 yards against Montreal on 
August 19, 1960.[37][39] A pillar on the offensive line was Danny Nykoluk 
at tackle who appeared in an incredible 17 seasons from 1954 to 1971, including 
one stretch of 12 years where he didn't miss a single game.[40] Despite 
these veterans, the era was marked by losing seasons and high attrition 
on the roster. By the 1960s, the annual (and often desperate) mid-season 
addition of American imports had become known as the "Argo airlift"; American 
imports often wouldn't last a game before being cut.[41][42] Eventually, 
the team became competitive again under head coach Leo Cahill in the late 
1960s. They scored a coup over the National Football League (NFL) with 
the signing of a young Joe Theismann (and other American stars) in 1971. 
The team also saw an attendance bounce, consistently selling out Exhibition 
Stadium.[43] The Boatmen's best chance to end their Grey Cup drought came 
that year, when they faced the Calgary Stampeders in the 59th Grey Cup, 
the first to be played on artificial turf. In a defensive struggle at Vancouver's 
soggy Empire Stadium, a now infamous late fumble by Leon "X-Ray" McQuay 
and a possession changing kick out of bounds by Harry Abofs sealed a 14–11 
Stampeder victory.[44] The 1970s were tumultuous for the team, with numerous 
hirings and firings of head coaches and consistent losing records. There 
were stellar players over this era, including all-stars on defence such 
as Jim Stillwagon, Jim Corrigall, and Granville "Granny" Liggins, but the 
team could not return to winning form.[45] High-profile moves such as hiring 
Canadian football icon Russ Jackson as head coach in 1975 or signing running 
back superstar Anthony Davis the next year turned into busts.[46] Ironically, 
the Argos reached historic attendance highs in this losing decade—regular 
season average per game attendance reached 47,356 in 1976.[47] The enlargement 
of Exhibition Stadium over 1975 and 1976 in anticipation of the Blue Jays 
expansion baseball team allowed for these massive crowds.[48] The Argos 
reached an all-time low in 1981 when they finished 2–14; this despite having 
such talented players as quarterback Condredge Holloway, running back Cedric 
Minter, and receiver Terry Greer.[49] The team began the year 0–10 and 
there was talk of a "perfect" losing season. The team had been inept so 
long by this point (29 seasons without a Grey Cup win) that the notion 
of an "Argo Bounce" had become inverted; now "it was the unluckiest bounce 
in the world, the one that usually arose from the Argos' uncanny ability 
to lose critical games in the dying minutes by committing an improbable 
blunder."[50] However, with the 1982 season came the hiring of Bob O'Billovich 
as head coach and Mouse Davis as offensive co-ordinator. Davis implemented 
the run and shoot offense,[51] and the Argos enjoyed a turnaround, going 
9–6–1 that year; Condredge Holloway was the CFL's most outstanding player. 
The team ultimately fell short in their quest for a Grey Cup, losing 32–16 
to the mighty Edmonton Eskimos in the final in front of a disappointed 
crowd at Exhibition Stadium.[52] The 1983 season finally brought the championship 
home. The Argos finished 12–4 and Terry Greer set a CFL record with 2,003 
receiving yards.[53] Joe Barnes and Condredge Holloway were a potent duo 
at quarterback. The Double Blue returned to the Grey Cup, this time facing 
the BC Lions at BC Place Stadium in Vancouver. Despite the hostile crowd, 
Toronto defeated BC 18–17 to win their first Grey Cup since 1952. The Argos 
were generally competitive for the remainder of the 1980s, thanks in large 
part to talented players such as Gill "The Thrill" Fenerty and Darrell 
K. Smith,[54] but a return to the glory of 1983 proved elusive. The 1989 
season saw the Argonauts move into the SkyDome, a multi-purpose downtown 
stadium with a retractable roof. It marked the beginning of an eventful 
few years. In 1990, one of the most beloved figures in Toronto sporting 
history emerged on the team: Michael "Pinball" Clemons set a CFL record 
for all purpose yards with 3,300 in his first full year, a record he would 
break in 1997 with 3,840.[55] In 1991 Hollywood prestige arrived in the 
form of a new ownership trio. Bruce McNall, owner of the NHL's Los Angeles 
Kings, bought the team. One of his players, hockey great Wayne Gretzky, 
became a minority owner, as did Canadian-born comedian John Candy. The 
group stunned the league with the signing of Raghib "Rocket" Ismail for 
an unheard of $18.2 million over four years.[56] Ismail immediately impressed, 
particularly on kickoff returns, and was named player of the game in the 
1991 Grey Cup, which the Argos won 36–21 over the Calgary Stampeders. Clemons 
and quarterback Matt Dunigan (who played the final with a broken collarbone) 
were the other critical pieces to the championship.[24] However, the Argos 
slumped to 6–12 only a year later, beginning a slide that only accelerated 
when Dunigan and Ismail left after the season. The 1992 season was the 
first of four consecutive losing seasons; while they made the playoffs 
in 1994, they were promptly eliminated by the Baltimore Stallions in the 
division semifinals.[15] Trouble also struck off the field: McNall was 
convicted of conspiracy and fraud at the end of 1993,[57] while Candy died 
prematurely the next year. Attendance also began to slide in the mid-1990s, 
raising questions over the team's viability that persist to this day. The 
per game average was just above 16,000 in 1994 and 1995, much less than 
half the team's 1970s peak.[47] Championship material did eventually reemerge 
in 1996. Doug Flutie, one of the greatest quarterbacks in CFL history, 
was signed for the season and surrounded with key personnel. The team included 
linebacker Mike O'Shea, veteran wide receiver Paul Masotti, and running 
back Robert Drummond.[58] Derrell "Mookie" Mitchell was added at receiver 
in 1997. The Boatmen took the Grey Cup in both 1996 and 1997. Flutie would 
set team records for single season passing yards with more than 5,500 in 
each year and for touchdowns thrown with 47 in 1997 (one less than his 
CFL record of 48) before crossing the border to join the Buffalo Bills 
the next year.[37] Massoti retired in 1999 as the team's all time pass 
reception yardage leader.[58] Clemons ended his own successful career in 
2000 before returning to coach until 2007. The years after their back-to-back 
championships saw a return to mediocrity for the Argos. Ticket sales remained 
flat, and there were changes in ownership. Gimmicks to attract fans were 
greeted with criticism.[59] The Argos seemingly bottomed out in July 2003 
when the CFL stripped control over the team from owner Sherwood Schwarz. 
The team had amassed debts of over $20 million, including $17.4 owed to 
Schwarz himself.[60] New ownership under David Cynamon and Howard Sokolowski 
brought immediate dividends with another Grey Cup win in 2004. Veteran 
Damon Allen led the team to a team to 27–19 victory over the B.C. Lions, 
with Jon Avery a critical running threat. Allen would continue with the 
team until 2007, and retired with professional football's all-time leading 
passing yardage (72,381).[55] The Argonauts saw winning seasons from 2005 
to 2007 before bottoming out the next two years. They finished 2009 with 
just three wins. Critical players over this half decade included receiver 
Arland Bruce III, defensive star Byron Parker, and all-star punter Noel 
Prefontaine.[15] The team generated some controversy in 2006 when they 
lured running back Ricky Williams from the NFL. Williams had repeatedly 
violated NFL drug policies and was under suspension for the year; he played 
just one season with the Argos.[61] In 2010 the team again saw an ownership 
change, with construction magnate David Braley, who also owns the Lions, 
taking control.[62] After breaking even in 2010 and going 6–12 in 2011, 
the Argonauts again acquired a championship nucleus in 2012. Ricky Ray 
was brilliant at quarterback while Chad Owens emerged as arguably the league's 
best special teams player. Owens broke Michael Clemons CFL record for all 
purpose yards and won the CFL Most Outstanding Player award that year.[63] 
The 2012 Grey Cup was played in Toronto and the team took their first championship 
victory in the city since 1952, a 35–22 win over Calgary.[24] The Toronto 
Argonauts currently lead the Canadian Football League in total wins and 
in winning percentage in the Grey Cup.[4] Early success in the final can 
partly be attributed to the weakness of western teams: between 1921 and 
1952 the Argonauts won in nine straight appearances, including six straight 
against the Winnipeg Blue Bombers. The team's success is not merely an 
historical aberration, however: they have won six of their nine appearances 
since the formation of the CFL, including their last five straight. For 
the entire Grey Cup era there has been some form of playoffs leading up 
to the Grey Cup game; the 22 Argonauts teams who have won a spot in the 
final would, in modern terms, be called "Eastern Division Champions". It 
is important to remember, however, that the route to the Grey Cup, participating 
teams, and playoff format have changed repeatedly over time. As for the 
regular season, the CFL records 14 Argonauts teams at the top of the eastern 
divisional table since its formation in 1958.[65] Earlier data for the 
Interprovincial Rugby Football Union provides another 9 years from 1907 
to 1957 in which the Argos were the best of the "Big Four," for a total 
of 23 divisional wins.[66][67] The only pre-1958 year in which the Argos 
won the IRFU but failed to make a Grey Cup appearance was 1922, when they 
lost in semi-final to Queen's University.[68] Going back to an even earlier 
era, the Argonauts won the Ontario Rugby Football Union championship three 
times between 1883 and 1906, including the league's first two seasons, 
1883 and 1884. Their last victory as ORFU members came in 1901. Given their 
losses in the Dominion Championship in 1884 and 1901, the Argonauts would 
not earn the title "national champion" until their first Grey Cup win in 
1914.[18] The Toronto Argonauts' first home was Rosedale Field at Mount 
Pleasant Road and MacLennan Avenue near the city centre. The team suggests 
its capacity was 10,000 total with 4,000 seated,[69] though O'Leary and 
Parrish list smaller numbers, noting that a $32,000 renovation in 1883 
allowed for a capacity of 2,000.[19] The field has historic significance 
as the site of the first Grey Cup game in 1909; the CFL lists the game's 
attendance as 3,807.[24] The field still exists as part of Rosedale Park, 
although there are no grandstands. Sources again differ on when the team 
permanently moved to Varsity Stadium on the grounds of the University of 
Toronto. The team gives dates of 1874–1897 and 1908–1915 at Rosedale, while 
other sources suggest the team had moved to Varsity by 1911.[note 4] Varsity 
would become indelibly linked with the Argonauts and the early years of 
Canadian football; it was the home field of the great Argo dynasties of 
the 1930s and 1940s. For most of the Argos time at the stadium, its capacity 
was about 16,000, but this jumped above 20,000 with a renovation in 1950. 
Although it has not hosted a professional game since 1958, it still holds 
the record for hosting the most Grey Cups with 30.[70] Another home beckoned 
in 1959 with the renovation of the new Exhibition Stadium to accommodate 
Canadian football. Often remembered ruefully by Torontonians for its exposure 
to weather and poor sightlines, the stadium was nevertheless the site of 
the Argos' greatest attendance in the late 1960s and 1970s. Particularly 
brutal conditions at the 70th Grey Cup in 1982 paved the way for the construction 
of a domed stadium in Toronto.[71] SkyDome (Rogers Centre since 2004) has 
provided the Argonauts a marquee venue since 1989, but also been criticized 
for its football sightlines and atmosphere. Even crowds of about 30,000 
can look sparse in a stadium that seats up to 50,000 people. The domed 
environment does, at least, remove the elements and is an advantage to 
passers and comfortable for fans. Two critical opportunities to find a 
new home were missed in 2004 and 2005: plans for a revamped Varsity Stadium 
to accommodate CFL-sized crowds were thwarted by community opposition in 
2004, and the Argonauts withdrew from an alternate plan at York University 
the following year.[72][73] It was announced in 2013 that the Rogers Centre's 
artificial turf would be replaced by natural grass within five years to 
better facilitate Toronto Blue Jays baseball. This will require the stadium's 
movable stands to be permanently locked into position for baseball, making 
it impossible to host CFL games.[74][75][76] The stadium issue generated 
significant press and raised concerns over the team's long-term viability 
given that the Argonauts losses have been estimated anywhere from $2 to 
$6 million annually.[77][78] While various stadium rumours swirled over 
the course of David Braley's tenure (including building a new facility) 
it became increasingly clear that a move to a renovated BMO Field was the 
only viable option.[79][80] The BMO Field move became finalized on May 
20, 2015, concurrent with the announcement of the team's sale to a consortium 
of MLSE shareholders Larry Tanenbaum and Bell Canada. The team will move 
following the completion of stadium renovations for the 2016 season.[2] 
The $120 million renovation plan had originally been announced in March 
2014. The upgrades raise the stadium's seating capacity from 21,566 seats 
to 30,000 for soccer, with 25,000 seats in CFL configuration, and will 
be temporarily expandable with additional endzone seating to 40,000 for 
big events[81] such as a Grey Cup.[82] The agreement requires MLSE to reach 
a "long-term use (i.e. 20 years)" lease with the Argos for usage of the 
stadium.[81][83][84] The inclusion of the CFL configuration had partly 
been at the insistence of the City of Toronto, which owns BMO Field, and 
had been planned in the original stadium agreement.[83][84][85] Following 
the demolition and reconstruction of the 5,000 seat Varsity Stadium at 
the University of Toronto, the Argos returned to the stadium, hosting preseason 
games from 2013 to 2015.[86][87][88] The team also acquired a much-needed 
training facility in July 2014 when it was announced that MLSE had partnered 
with the Argonauts to expand KIA Training Ground, Toronto FC's new state-of-the-art 
academy and training facility.[89] For more than eight decades, the Toronto 
Argonauts Football Club was the sole property of its namesake rowing club. 
By the 1950s, the team's complex management structure made the arrangement 
increasingly awkward. Facing overdraft and with wealthy suitors knocking, 
the Argonaut rowers finally sold the team to a consortium led by John Bassett, 
Eric Cradock, and Charlie Burns in 1957. Each held about 20% share in the 
company, with the balance made up by small investors who had some affinity 
with the club; the initial agreement called for a long-term debenture of 
$400,000 to be set up that would sustain the rowing club in the absence 
of its football income.[94] Bassett was the operating head of the franchise 
and is often given sole credit for the initial purchase of the Argos, but 
Cradock was also instrumental in spearheading the drive. He would sell 
his share to Len Lumbers just two years into his tenure in part because 
of Bassett's controlling nature.[95] Bassett arranged a complete buyout 
of the other shareholders for $2.31 million in 1971 through his holdings 
in Baton Broadcasting.[96][97] The Bassett years of the late-50s to early-70s 
were marked by mediocrity on the field but consistent success at the turnstiles. 
An issue that has become a perennial concern in the city also emerged at 
this time: the possibility of a National Football League team in Toronto. 
Various machinations were entertained by Bassett including moving the Argos 
to the NFL, bringing an American expansion team to the city (e.g. the Toronto 
Northmen of the WFL), or expanding the CFL itself in the opposite direction. 
Other team owners steadfastly opposed Bassett's moves and almost rescinded 
his franchise in 1974; angered, he sold the team for $3.3 million to hotel 
magnate William R. Hodgson in the same year.[98][99] Hodgsen sold to Carling 
O'Keefe in 1979, who had been minority owners since 1976. The brewing company's 
total investment in the team was $5.8 million.[100] At the time it was 
rapidly ramping up its sports sponsorship (it also owned the Quebec Nordiques 
before they moved from the World Hockey Association to the NHL) and would 
become a huge benefactor to the CFL itself, inking television rights deals 
that would reach $11 million annually by 1984. Reports at the time suggest 
the league became spoiled by the partnership and that when the money dried 
up in 1987, the transition was difficult.[101] For the Argos, the Carling 
O'Keefe years were marked by their first modern-era Grey Cup in 1983.[102] 
The year's following the Carling O'Keefe era were marked by increasingly 
short ownership stints. Canadian businessman Harry Ornest bought the team 
off Carling O'Keefe for $5 million at the end of 1988[103] and then sold 
to the trio of McNall (60%), Candy (20%), and Gretzky (20%) for the same 
amount in 1991.[56][104] Of the three, Candy is best remembered for his 
emotional investment in the team and a team player award continues in his 
honour.[105][106] Given McNall's indictment and Candy's early death, the 
era was tumultuous and the last in which the club regularly made front 
page headlines. The now money-losing team was sold to the Labatt Brewing 
Company through its TSN unit in 1994 for $4.5 million.[107] At the time, 
Labatt also owned the Toronto Blue Jays. In 1995, Labatt was acquired by 
Interbrew;[108] The Interbrew years saw two championships but also the 
worst Argo attendance of the modern era.[47] Interbrew soon lost interest 
in sports ownership and the team was sold again at the end of 1999 to New 
York businessman Sherwood Schwarz. After the debacles of the Schwarz era 
and brief control of the team by the CFL (see above) the Argos were rescued 
by David Cynamon and Howard Sokolowski in 2004. There was optimism surrounding 
the duo's arrival and attendance figures improved in their six years heading 
the organization. It was also appreciated that the two were Torontonians 
after a quarter-century of foreign and/or corporate ownership.[109] But 
by 2010 losses were great enough that the team was again put on the block 
and eventually sold to David Braley. There was some controversy surrounding 
Braley's takeover. He is simultaneously owner of the BC Lions, raising 
questions of competitive integrity. It was also revealed that Braley had 
bankrolled half of Cynamon and Sokolowski's initial $2 million buy-in of 
the Argos in 2004, and covered half their subsequent losses, in exchange 
for half of the 2007 Grey Cup profits.[110][111] By 2014 Maple Leaf Sports 
and Entertainment and its chairman and minority owner Larry Tanenbaum had 
emerged as serious suitors for the team.[112][113][114] On May 20, 2015, 
it was announced that an agreement had been reached for Argonauts to be 
sold to Tanenbaum's Kilmer Sports and Bell Canada, who both own a stake 
in MLSE with Rogers Communications. Financial details were not disclosed. 
Despite its shared stake in MLSE, Rogers was not interested in having an 
ownership share in the Argonauts because it does not have any media relationships 
with the CFL (unlike Bell, whose TSN division holds the broadcast rights 
to the league).[2][115][116] Argonauts Holdings Limited Partnership, a 
holding company which Bell and Kilmer each own 50% of, formally acquired 
the franchise on December 31, 2015.[93] Below the ownership level, the 
two most senior positions within the Toronto Argonauts organization are 
its president and general manager.[90] The GM role was titled as "managing 
director" from 1957 to 1971, while the president role is now included in 
the title of CEO. The longest serving executive in the organization is 
Lew Hayman, who had a five decade career beginning in the 1930s as coach 
and administrator. A Jewish-American, Hayman served with both the Argos 
and Montreal Alouettes and has been called "the architect of Canadian football."[117] 
He was the team's first president and managing director at the insistence 
of Eric Cradock in 1957,[118] and would continue in the former role until 
1981. Ralph Sazio took over from Hayman and is another hall of fame builder.[119] 
After relative stability at the senior executive level for three decades, 
there has been significant turnover in the positions since the 1990s. The 
team had eight general managers in eight years, for example, between 1996 
and 2003. The current GM is Jim Barker, who was appointed at the end of 
2010.[120] Chris Rudge, former head of the Canadian Olympic Committee, 
took over as president and CEO from the beginning of 2012 to the end of 
2015,[121] when Michael Copeland took over.[122] 55 men have served as 
Toronto Argonauts head coach. The current coach, Scott Milanovich, was 
appointed in 2011.[123] He has succeeded in reviving a stalled offence 
and led the team to a Grey Cup victory in 2012. The longest total tenure 
at head coach belongs to Bob O'Billovich, who led the team for eleven years 
over three stints in the 1980s and early 90s. Other notable coaching careers 
include those of Joe Wright, Sr. at the end of the nineteenth century, 
Ted Morris and Frank Clair in the post-war years, Leo Cahill in the late 
60s and early 70s, and Pinball Clemons after the turn of the millennium. 
Since 1961, the Canadian Football League has awarded the Annis Stukus Trophy 
annually to the league's outstanding coach. (Alongside his playing career, 
Stukus achieved fame as a coach, promoter, and newspaper columnist.)[124] 
Argonauts coaches have been honoured seven times: Cahill (1971), O'Billovich 
(1981 & 1987), Adam Rita (1991), Don Matthews (1997), Jim Barker (2010), 
and Milanovich (2012).[125] During the season, active roster sizes in the 
CFL are 46 and game day rosters number 42, at least 20 of whom must be 
Canadian in accordance with the league's "national player" rule (formerly 
called the "non-import" rule prior to 2014). Training camp rosters are 
allowed to swell to 68.[126] The current team is led at quarterback by 
Ricky Ray, who had three statistically brilliant seasons between 2012 and 
2014, earning eastern Most Outstanding Player nominations in the latter 
two years. Ray has battled injuries in each of his 5 seasons as an Argonaut, 
and has not played an entire 18 game season since his last season in Edmonton. 
Following the departure of Trevor Harris to the Ottawa RedBlacks in early 
2016 the backup QB situation was a bit of a revolving door; with Logan 
Kilgore, Dan LeFevour, Cody Fajardo and the recently acquired Drew Willy[127] 
all taking snaps under center. The receiving core remained largely unchanged 
from the previous season with Tori Gurley, Kevin Elliott and Vidal Hazelton 
(The Big Three) returning after posting productive seasons in 2015, also 
returning to the receiving core were Dionte Spencer, and Kenny Shaw. On 
October 3, 2016 the team announced they had released WR Gurley, Elliott 
and Hazelton, along with Phil Bates.[128] The move was considered a shock 
by most, but post-game comments by Coach Milanovic in Montreal on October 
2, 2016 following a loss to the Als revealed the move which was about to 
take place was about more than just on-field issues. "We've got some good 
football players here that I'm not sure are real committed to what we need 
to have take place, and it's little things; being late, not showing up 
prepared, screwing around and that's where we're at right now, it's not 
going to stay that way." Running Back Brandon Whitaker was leaned on heavily 
and was having a productive season. As of week 16 he was second in the 
league in rushing yards with 833, trailing league leader Jerome Messam 
by only 36 yards, and adding 434 yards on 61 receptions. On the defensive 
side of the ball, following last season's departure of star defensive linemen 
Cleyon Laing and Tristan Okpalaugo to the NFL's Miami Dolphins and Arizona 
Cardinals respectively, the Argos were able to secure the services of Justin 
Hickman and Bryan Hall from the Hamilton Tiger-Cats, as well as trade OL 
Matt Sewell and QB Mitchell Gale to the Saskatchewan Roughriders for DE 
Shawn Lemon and a conditional 2018 draft pick.[129] Lemon seemed to fit 
into Defensive Coordinator Rich Stubler's system well, and as of week 16 
currently leads the league in QB sacks with 12, just one shy of his career 
best 13 posted with the Stampeders in 2014. Running backs Receivers Defensive

coverage is carred on TSN Radio 1050 or on CFRB 1010 when there is a scheduling 
conflict and another sport is being carried on TSN Radio. With few teams, 
but a long history, it is inevitable that intense rivalries have developed 
in Canadian football. Far and away the greatest Toronto Argonauts rivalry 
has been with the Hamilton Tiger-Cats and its precursor teams. Fittingly, 
the Argonauts first game was against a club from Hamilton,[14] while the 
raucous Eastern Final of 2013—featuring a Tiger-Cat win over the Argos 
in front of 35,000 at the Rogers Centre—proved the rivalry is alive and 
well.[130] The two teams meet in Hamilton every year in the Labour Day 
Classic, a league wide tradition since the late 1940s in which the game's 
greatest rivalries are showcased. To the east, the Argonauts have also 
faced off against teams from Montreal and Ottawa since their earliest days. 
In recent years, the Montreal Alouettes have consistently fielded strong 
teams and often run up against the Argos in the playoffs; the teams have 
faced off eleven times in the Eastern Final, with Montreal taking six.[131] 
In 2014, The Argonauts reignited their historic rivalry with an Ottawa 
Football Team as the team came back as the Ottawa REDBLACKS (Other rivalries 
with Ottawa consisted of rivalries with the Ottawa Renegades and the Ottawa 
Rough Riders). In 5 games against the current Ottawa franchise; the Argos 
maintain a winning record of 4-1-0. The Argonauts won their last meeting 
with the Redblacks by a final score of 38-35 in front of a crowd of 15,001 
people at TD Place in Ottawa on October 6th, 2015. At the Grey Cup level, 
the Argonauts have faced an assortment of teams in recent decades rather 
than any one team regularly. The Edmonton Eskimos, for years a dominant 
team in the league, became a rival. The two teams' five Grey Cup match-ups 
include an epic 38–36 Toronto loss in 1987 and most recently, the Snow 
Bowl victory in 1996 led by the arm of Doug Flutie.[24] In the pre-CFL 
days, the Argos had a Grey Cup rivalry with the Winnipeg Blue Bombers and 
a cross-town rivalry with the University of Toronto in the first years 
of the Grey Cup championship, including the Argonauts' first win in 1914. 
The highest distinction the Toronto Argonauts can accord a player is to 
retire their number; just four players have received the honour. Starting 
in 1996, the team began another category of distinction with its list of 
"All-Time Argos." Twenty-two players have been rewarded so far and a banner 
in their honour hangs at Rogers Centre.[133] Players and management personnel 
may be separately inducted into the Canadian Football Hall of Fame.[134] 
A total of 56 people who have been part of the team are in the Hall. The 
All-Time Argos list does not extend back to before the Second War era while 
the Hall of Fame does. Thus, for instance, Lionel Conacher is in the Hall 
but not listed as an All-Time Argo. Finally, players may be honoured on 
an annual basis through the CFL awards. The most prestigious of these is 
the Most Outstanding Player Award, awarded since 1953. Six Argonauts have 
been recipients: Chad Owens (2012), Damon Allen (2005), Doug Flutie (1996 
& 1997), Pinball Clemons (1990), Conredge Holloway, and Bill Symons (1968). 
Jason is the mascot for the Toronto Argonauts. In 2003 Jason replaced Scully 
as the team's mascot.[136] Footnotes Citations In Article Further Reading
