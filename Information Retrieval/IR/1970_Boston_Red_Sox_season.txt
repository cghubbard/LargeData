The 1970 Boston Red Sox season involved the Red Sox finishing third in 
the American League East with a record of 87 wins and 75 losses. The 1970s 
began with a new manager for the Red Sox. After the firing of Dick Williams 
near the end of the 1969 season, general manager Dick O'Connell reached 
down into the farm system again for a replacement and came up with Eddie 
Kasko, who had managed the Red Sox AAA farm team at Louisville to a second-place 
finish in 1969. Eddie had been an infielder for the St. Louis Cardinals, 
Cincinnati Reds, Houston Astros and Boston Red Sox for 10 years (and eventually 
became the scouting director for Boston). Eddie took over a team in transition 
in 1970. Its leading pitcher was Ray Culp, with 17 wins. Jim Lonborg, the 
superstar of 1967, still was not back in form and went 4-1. Carl Yastrzemski 
led the team and the American League, with a .329 average, and Tony Conigliaro 
appeared to have recovered from the horrible beaning of 1967, hitting .266, 
with 36 home runs and 116 RBIs. Reggie Smith hit .303, and George Scott 
had a banner year at .296, with 16 homers and 63 RBIs. Unfortunately the 
Red Sox finished 21 games back of the rampaging Baltimore Orioles, who 
won 108 games and then went on to defeat the Cincinnati Reds in the 1970 
World Series, 4 games to 1. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11]
