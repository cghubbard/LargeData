Oakville is a suburban town in Southern Ontario, Canada. Located in Halton 
Region, on Lake Ontario, it is part of the Greater Toronto Area. As of 
the 2011 census the population was 182,520.[2] In 1793, Dundas Street was 
surveyed for a military road. In 1805, the Legislative Assembly of Upper 
Canada bought the lands between Etobicoke and Hamilton from the Mississaugas 
aboriginal people, except for the land at the mouths of Twelve Mile Creek 
(Bronte Creek), Sixteen Mile Creek, and along the Credit River. In 1807, 
British immigrants settled the area surrounding Dundas Street as well as 
on the shore of Lake Ontario. In 1820, the Crown bought the area surrounding 
the waterways. The area around the creeks, 960 acres (3.9Â km2), ceded to 
the Crown by the Mississaugas,[3] was auctioned off to William Chisholm 
in 1827. He left the development of the area to his son, Robert Kerr Chisholm 
and his brother-in-law, Merrick Thomas. Chisholm also formed shipbuilding 
business in Oakville Navy Street and Sixteen Mile Creek (Halton Region) 
and lasted until 1842, but shipbuilding in Oakville lasted into the late 
20th Century.[4][5] Oakville's first industries included shipbuilding, 
timber shipment, and wheat farming. In the 1850s, there was an economic 
recession and the foundry, the most important industry in town, was closed. 
Basket-making became a major industry in the town, and the Grand Trunk 
Railway was built through it. The town eventually became industrialized 
with the opening of Cities Service Canada (later BP Canada, and now Petro 
Canada) and Shell Canada oil refineries (both now closed), the Procor factory 
(no longer manufacturing), and, most importantly, the Ford Motor Company's 
Canadian headquarters and plant, all close to the Canadian National Railway 
and the Queen Elizabeth Way highway between Toronto and Fort Erie (Buffalo). 
In 1962 the town of Oakville merged with its neighbouring villages (Bronte, 
Palermo, Sheridan, and the remainder of Trafalgar Township) to become the 
new Town of Oakville, reaching northwards to Steeles Avenue in Milton. 
In 1973, the restructuring of Halton County into Halton Region brought 
the northern border southwards to just north of the future Highway 407. 
Oakville's Planning Department divides the town into communities. These 
divisions have little to do with politics and are based on traditional 
neighbourhoods.[6] According to the 2011 Canadian Census, Oakville had 
182,520 residents. This represents a 10.2% increase since the 2006 Census.[2] 
According to the 2006 census, Oakville had a younger population than Canada 
as a whole. Minors (youth under 19 years of age) totalled 28.1 percent 
of the population compared to pensioners who number 11.7 percent. This 
compares with the Canadian average of 24.4 percent (minors) and 13.7 percent 
(pensioners).[20] As of 2006, 81.2% of the population was white. Other 
groups include South Asian: 6.0%, Chinese: 3.2%, black: 2.1%, and mixed

stated their religion as Christian, almost evenly split between Roman Catholics 
and Protestants. Non-Christian religions include Islam: 2.0%, Hinduism: 
1.3%, Sikhism: 1.1%, and Judaism: 0.7%. 14% indicated no religion. The
