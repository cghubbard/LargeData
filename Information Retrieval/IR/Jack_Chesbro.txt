John Dwight Chesbro (June 5, 1874 – November 6, 1931) was a Major League 
Baseball (MLB) pitcher. Nicknamed "Happy Jack", Chesbro played for the 
Pittsburgh Pirates (1899–1902), the New York Highlanders (1903–1909), and 
the Boston Red Sox (1909). Chesbro finished his career with a win-loss 
record of 198-132, an earned run average of 2.68, and 1,265 strikeouts. 
His 41 wins during the 1904 season remains an American League record.[1] 
Though some pitchers have won more games in some seasons prior to 1901,[2][3] 
historians demarcating 1901 as the beginning of 'modern-era' major league 
baseball refer to and credit Jack Chesbro and his 1904 win-total as the 
modern era major league record and its holder. Some view Chesbro's 41 wins 
in a season as an unbreakable record.[4] Chesbro's 1904 pitching totals 
of 51 games started and 48 complete games also fall into the same historical 
category as his 1904 wins total, as they are all-time American League single-season 
records.[5][6] These 1904 single-season totals for games started and complete 
games, as the wins total, are also the most recorded by a pitcher in either 
the American or National League, since the beginning of the twentieth century[7][8][9][10] 
and the co-existence of the American and National Leagues as major leagues. 
If one demarcates 1901 as the beginning of major league baseball's modern 
era, Jack Chesbro holds the modern era major league historical single-season 
records for wins by a pitcher (41), games started by a pitcher (51), and 
complete games pitched (48). Chesbro was elected to the National Baseball 
Hall of Fame in 1946 by the Veterans Committee, though he had received 
little consideration from the Baseball Writers' Association of America 
(BBWAA). Some baseball historians consider the 1946 election a mistake, 
and believe that Chesbro was elected solely on the basis of his 1904 season. 
He was born John D. Chesbro on June 5, 1874 in Houghtonville, a village 
in North Adams, Massachusetts.[11] He was the fourth of five children of 
Chad Brown Chesebrough, a shoemaker, and Martha Jane Fralensburgh.[12][13] 
In 1892, Chesbro began playing for a sandlot ball team in Houghtonville.[14] 
He worked in 1894 as an attendant at the Middletown State Homeopathic Hospital 
in Middletown, New York in order to play for the Asylums, the team representing 
the mental hospital. There, an inmate gave Chesbro the nickname "Happy 
Jack", due to his pleasant demeanor.[15] Chesbro began his professional 
career in minor league baseball in 1895. That year, he pitched for the 
Albany Senators of the New York State League until they folded, at which 
point he joined the Johnstown Buckskins. When the league disbanded during 
the season, he joined the Springfield Maroons of the Eastern League.[12] 
In 1896, Chesbro pitched for the Roanoke Magicians of the Virginia League, 
until it disbanded. He pitched the remainder of the 1896 season in Cooperstown, 
New York for the Cooperstown Athletics. There, the local newspaper shortened 
his last name to "Chesbro" so that it would fit in the box score.[16] Chesbro 
pitched for the Richmond Bluebirds of the Atlantic League from 1897 through 
1899. After the 1898 season, he was drafted by Ned Hanlon of the Baltimore 
Orioles. However, Hanlon took a job with the Brooklyn Superbas and the 
Orioles were nearly contracted, resulting in Chesbro not signing with Baltimore, 
as Hanlon allowed the option to lapse.[12][17] He returned to Richmond 
for the 1899 season. Chesbro was sold by Richmond to the Pittsburgh Pirates 
on July 7, 1899 for $1,500 ($42,738 in current dollar terms). He made his 
Major League Baseball (MLB) debut with the Pirates on July 12, 1899. He 
recorded a 6–9 win–loss record for the 1899 Pirates. After the season, 
on December 8, 1899, Chesbro was traded with George Fox, Art Madison, John 
O'Brien, and $25,000 ($712,300 in current dollar terms) to the Louisville 
Colonels for Honus Wagner, Fred Clarke, Bert Cunningham, Mike Kelley, Tacks 
Latimer, Tommy Leach, Tom Messitt, Deacon Phillippe, Claude Ritchey, Rube 
Waddell, Jack Wadsworth, and Chief Zimmer.[18] The Louisville club dissolved 
that offseason, and Chesbro, Fox, Madison and O'Brien were assigned to 
Pittsburgh in March as the National League (NL) reduced from 12 to eight 
teams.[12] After going 15–13 for the 1900 Pirates, Chesbro won 21 games 
for the 1901 Pirates, while leading the NL with six shutouts.[19] He went 
28–6 with a 2.17 earned run average (ERA) for the 1902 Pirates, leading 
the NL in wins and shutouts.[20] The Pirates won the National League pennant 
in 1901 and 1902. At the end of the 1902 season, the upstart American League 
(AL) began to entice NL stars to join their league by offering competitive 
salaries. Chesbro agreed to sign with a new AL franchise, the New York 
Highlanders (presently known as the New York Yankees), for the 1903 season, 
for a $1,000 bonus ($27,396 in current dollar terms) to join the AL.[21] 
The news broke when Jesse Tannehill, who also agreed to join the Highlanders, 
told Pirates owner Barney Dreyfuss about the planned defection while under 
the influence of pain medication.[22] When he refused to participate in 
a postseason series, Dreyfuss released Chesbro from the Pirates.[22] Chesbro 
pitched the Highlanders' first game. He finished the 1903 season with a 
21–15 record. Chesbro began throwing a spitball in the 1904 season,[23][24] 
which he learned from Elmer Stricklett, the inventor of the spitball.[25] 
Chesbro also began working on a "slow ball".[12][26] That year, he started 
51 games and finished 48 while posting a 1.82 ERA, striking out 239 batters, 
and recording 41 wins and 48 complete games over 454 2⁄3 innings pitched, 
setting MLB records for wins, complete games, and innings pitched in a 
season.[4][12] That year, no other pitcher in the league won more than 
26.[27] Chesbro won 14 straight games from May 14 through July 4,[28] a 
New York franchise record that stood until Roger Clemens broke it in 2001.[29] 
His 239 strikeouts remained a team record until Ron Guidry struck out 248 
in 1978.[30] On the last day of the season, in a game against the Boston 
Americans (now known as the Boston Red Sox), he threw a wild pitch in the 
top of the ninth inning, allowing the winning run to score from third base 
and causing the Highlanders to lose the pennant to Boston.[15] The ruling 
on this play was controversial. Even after Chesbro's death in 1931, his 
widow, with the support of former Highlanders manager Clark Griffith, continued 
to claim that the pitch was a passed ball, and blamed the winning run on 
catcher Red Kleinow.[31] Before the 1905 season, Chesbro announced that 
he had created a pitch he called the "jump ball".[32] He struggled in the 
1905 season, registering a 19-15 record.[12] During the 1905 season, Chesbro 
was involved in the first squeeze play in baseball. At third base, Chesbro 
mistakenly thought he had received a steal sign from manager Clark Griffith, 
while Willie Keeler bunted for a hit. As Chesbro scored, Griffith made 
a note of the play and taught it in spring training the following season.[33] 
Many baseball observers expected Chesbro to return to form in 1906.[34] 
That season, Chesbro registered a 23–17 record while leading the AL in 
earned runs allowed.[35] He was removed from his starts sixteen times, 
the most in the AL.[36] Chesbro announced he would work on keeping his 
weight down prior to the 1907 season,[37] but announced his intentions 
to retire in February 1907.[38] In March 1907, he announced he would return, 
but not at a pay cut.[39] He signed a new contract two weeks into the 1907 
season,[40] in which he went 10–10.[12] After the 1907 season, Chesbro 
announced that he was giving up the experimental spitball, intending to 
return to the "old style of pitching" in 1908.[41] He finished the 1908 
season with a 14–20 record.[12] Prior to the 1909 season, Chesbro was assigned 
to the Indianapolis Indians of the American Association, a minor league 
affiliate of the Highlanders.[42] However, Chesbro threatened to retire 
if transferred there, and did not report to the Highlanders at first.[12] 
Chesbro made nine appearances for the Highlanders in 1909, before he was 
waived and claimed by the Boston Red Sox in September 1909.[12] Chesbro 
pitched one game for the Red Sox, the season finale against the Yankees.[43] 
The Red Sox returned Chesbro to the Highlanders prior to the 1910 season, 
but he was placed on the ineligible list after he refused to report to 
the minor leagues.[12] Chesbro returned to Massachusetts during the 1910 
Major League Baseball season, where he worked on a farm in Conway, Massachusetts 
that he purchased a decade prior.[12] He pitched for a semi-professional 
baseball team in nearby Whitinsville, Massachusetts,[44] leading them to 
a championship.[12] Chesbro coached for Massachusetts Agricultural College 
(presently known as the University of Massachusetts Amherst) in 1911 and 
continued to pitch for semipro clubs in Massachusetts.[45] Chesbro met 
with Highlanders owner Frank J. Farrell and new manager Harry Wolverton 
in February 1912 about attempting a comeback. Wolverton agreed to give 
Chesbro a chance at pitching for the Highlanders.[46] However, before leaving 
for camp he reconsidered and released Chesbro.[12] Chesbro's request for 
reinstatement as a free agent was granted in March, while the Highlanders 
granted him his unconditional release.[47] Chesbro decided to travel to 
Hot Springs, Arkansas, where teams participated in spring training, in 
an attempt to find a team willing to give him a chance at a comeback.[12] 
He worked out with Brooklyn and Pittsburgh,[48] but both teams passed on 
him. Chesbro appeared in an old-timers game at Braves Field, sponsored 
by The Boston Post to benefit Boston Children's Hospital, on September 
11, 1922.[12] He served as a Washington Senators coach in 1924, which were 
managed by his former Highlanders manager, Clark Griffith.[49] However, 
he and Ben Egan were let go when the Senators hired Al Schacht on June 
1.[12] In 1927, he managed a minor league team in South Deerfield, Massachusetts, 
pitching for the team on occasion.[50] Chesbro was inducted into the National 
Baseball Hall of Fame in 1946 balloting by the Veterans Committee, which 
considers individuals who are eligible for the Hall of Fame, but no longer 
eligible to be elected by the Baseball Writers' Association of America 
(BBWAA). That year, the Veterans Committee elected eleven players: Chesbro, 
Jesse Burkett, Frank Chance, Johnny Evers, Clark Griffith, Tommy McCarthy, 
Joe McGinnity, Eddie Plank, Joe Tinker, Rube Waddell, and Ed Walsh.[51] 
During years where Chesbro was eligible on the BBWAA ballot, Chesbro received 
zero votes in the 1936 balloting, one vote in the 1937 balloting, two votes 
in the 1938 balloting, and six votes in the 1939 balloting, zero votes 
in the 1942 balloting, and zero votes in the 1945 balloting.[52] Chesbro's 
1904 record for games won in a season (41 wins) has stood for over a century—one 
of the oldest major records in baseball, or in any other sport. Under current 
playing practices, his record is unbreakable.[4][11] Chesbro started 51 
games that season (plus 4 relief appearances) and pitched 48 complete games, 
for a record of 41–12. Today, it is uncommon for a pitcher to start even 
35 games in a season and complete games are a rarity. The only other 40-win 
season since 1900 was 40 by Ed Walsh in 1908, and only three other pitchers 
in the modern era have won as many as 35--Christy Mathewson (37 in 1908), 
Walter Johnson (36 in 1913) and Joe McGinnity (35 in 1904). Since the pitcher's 
mound was lowered to its current height of 10 inches in 1969, no pitcher 
has won more than 27 games in a season. Tinker considered Chesbro one of 
the six toughest pitchers he faced in MLB.[53] Dan Holmes, who runs the 
Hall of Fame's website, called Chesbro "one of the best pitchers in the 
game at that time."[54] However, Chesbro's induction is considered dubious, 
as his overall career was overshadowed by his 1904 season.[55] Baseball 
historian Bill James considers Chesbro to be undeserving of induction to 
the Hall of Fame.[56] In particular, James compared Chesbro's statistics 
to those of former Pittsburgh Pirate teammates Deacon Phillippe (189–109, 
2.59), Sam Leever (194–100, 2.47), and Jesse Tannehill (197–117, 2.80), 
none of whom are in the Hall of Fame. In his book The Politics of Glory, 
James charged that the induction of undeserving players created a "second 
tier" in the Hall of Fame.[56] James claimed that Chesbro was inducted 
into the Hall of Fame solely on the basis of his 1904 season, even though 
other pitchers who did not make the Hall of Fame have similar career statistics.[12] 
Chesbro married Mabel Suttleworth of Conway, Massachusetts, in 1896. After 
his retirement, Chesbro farmed and raised poultry in Conway, where he died 
on November 6, 1931 of a myocardial infarction;[15] he was buried at Howland
