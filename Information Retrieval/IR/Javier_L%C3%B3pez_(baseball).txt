Javier Alfonso López (born July 11, 1977) is a Puerto Rican-born professional 
baseball pitcher who is a free agent. He is 6 feet 5 inches (1.96 m) tall 
and weighs 220 pounds (100 kg). López has pitched in [Major League Baseball]] 
(MLB) for the Colorado Rockies (2003–2005), Arizona Diamondbacks (2005), 
Boston Red Sox (2006–09), Pittsburgh Pirates (2010) and San Francisco Giants 
(2010–2016). He is a left-handed specialist known for his sidearm delivery. 
He also bats left-handed. López attended the University of Virginia, earning 
a degree in psychology despite leaving early to begin his baseball career. 
He was selected by the Arizona Diamondbacks in the fourth round of the 
1998 Major League Baseball (MLB) Draft. He began his career as a starting 
pitcher but struggled and converted into a sidearm (or submarine) reliever 
while still in the Diamondbacks' organization. Before the 2003 season, 
he was selected by the Boston Red Sox in the Rule 5 draft, but he was traded 
to the Colorado Rockies during spring training. He spent all of 2003 on 
Colorado's roster, nearly tying the franchise record for most consecutive 
batters retired and finishing third among major league rookies in games 
pitched. He struggled the next two seasons, getting claimed off waivers 
and later sent to the minors by Arizona in 2005. In 2006, he signed with 
the Chicago White Sox but failed to make the team and spent the first part 
of the season in the minors before getting traded to Boston during the 
year. López served four stints with Boston in 2006. In 2007, he had three 
different stints but appeared in 61 games, posting a 3.10 earned run average 
(ERA). He posted a 15.43 ERA in the playoffs but won his first World Series 
ring as the Red Sox defeated Colorado in four games. In 2008, he spent 
the entire season on a major league roster for the first time since 2003. 
He posted a 9.26 ERA in his first 14 games of 2009 before getting sent 
to the minors for the rest of the season. In 2010, he signed with the Pittsburgh 
Pirates but was traded to the San Francisco Giants during the season. He 
had his lowest ERA that year (2.34) and won another World Series as the 
Giants defeated the Texas Rangers to win their first World Series since 
1954. In 2011, López was one of two major league relief pitchers to throw 
at least 50 innings without giving up a home run. He won his third World 
Series in 2012 as the Giants defeated the Detroit Tigers in four games. 
In 2013, López posted a career-best 1.83 ERA. He won his fourth World Series 
in 2014 as the Giants defeated the Kansas City Royals in seven games. As 
of 2014, he is the only active player to have played on 4 or more World 
Series championship teams. Although he was born in Puerto Rico, López grew 
up in Fairfax, Virginia.[1] He and his wife, Renee, attended Robinson Secondary 
School in Fairfax, Virginia.[2] Growing up, his dream was to be an FBI 
agent like his father.[3] López went to college at the University of Virginia 
(UVA) and played for the Virginia Cavaliers baseball team. Through August 
2011, he was one of 29 former UVA players to have made it to the major 
leagues, along with among others Mark Reynolds, and Ryan Zimmerman.[4] 
While playing at UVA, he went 12–9 with a 6.30 earned run average (ERA). 
As a hitter, he had a batting average of .319, 15 home runs, and 71 runs 
batted in (RBI).[5] However, while still at UVA, he discovered that pitching 
was most likely to get him to the major leagues. Despite leaving college 
after only three years to play professional baseball, López continued working 
on his degree in psychology, which he earned in 2002 to fulfill a promise 
to his father-in-law. He also said, "I had done three years at a great 
university. I figured I should finish."[2] After three seasons at UVA, 
López was drafted by the Arizona Diamondbacks in the fourth round of the 
1998 Major League Baseball (MLB) Draft. He began his minor league career 
as a starting pitcher for the South Bend Silver Hawks of the A Midwest 
League. In 16 games (19 starts), he had a 2–4 record, a 6.55 ERA, 31 strikeouts, 
and 30 walks in 44 innings pitched. He remained at South Bend in 1999, 
posting a 4–6 record, a 6.00 ERA, and 70 strikeouts over 99 innings pitched 
in 20 starts.[6] In 2000, López was promoted to the High Desert Mavericks 
of the A-Advanced California League. In 30 games (21 starts), he had a 
4–8 record, a 5.22 ERA, 98 strikeouts, and two saves in 136 1⁄3 innings.[6] 
In 2001, deciding that he would not be able to reach the major leagues 
as a starter, López converted to a submariner and moved to the bullpen. 
He said, "I don't know if that was desperation as much as it was admitting 
failure."[3] He began the season with Arizona's A-Advanced affiliate, which 
was now the Lancaster JetHawks. In 17 games, he had a 1–3 record, a 2.62 
ERA, 18 strikeouts, and one save in 24 innings pitched. He was promoted 
to the El Paso Diablos of the AA Texas League that season, where he had 
a 1–0 record, a 7.42 ERA, 21 strikeouts, and 40 innings pitched in 22 games 
(one start, his last professionally). In 2002, he played in 61 games for 
El Paso as a reliever, allowing only a .204 opponent batting average. That 
year, he went 2–2 with a 2.72 ERA, 47 strikeouts, and six saves in 46 1⁄3 
innings.[6] In December 2002, the Boston Red Sox selected López in the 
Rule 5 draft, intending for him to compete for a role as a left-handed 
specialist in the Red Sox' bullpen.[7] However, on March 18 he was traded 
to the Colorado Rockies for a player to be named later (Ryan Cameron).[8][9] 
López made the roster and made his MLB debut for the Rockies on Opening 
Day in 2003, pitching a scoreless inning in a 10–4 loss to the Houston 
Astros.[10] He got his first major league strikeout in his next game on 
April 5, punching out Tony Womack in a 4–3 victory over the Diamondbacks.[11] 
On April 10, he got his first win, pitching 2⁄3 scoreless innings in a 
7–6 victory over the St. Louis Cardinals.[12] He posted an 0.72 ERA, which 
led all NL relievers, in his first 30 games through June 8, posting an 
18 2⁄3 innings scoreless streak at the end of that run.[5] However, his 
ERA jumped up to 3.16 on June 12, when he allowed seven runs in 2⁄3 of 
an inning in a 15–3 loss to the Minnesota Twins.[13] From July 31 through 
August 16, López almost tied a franchise record by retiring 18 straight 
hitters over the span of 17 days, but he fell short of the record of 21 
set by Darren Holmes in 1996 when he intentionally walked Jason Phillips 
in a 13–4 loss to the New York Mets.[14] On August 12, he recorded his 
first career save by pitching a scoreless 11th inning in a 6–3 victory 
over the Montreal Expos.[15] He played in 72 games, the third-most among 
rookies in the major leagues, trailing only Óscar Villareal (86) and Brad 
Lidge (78). He had a 4–1 record, a 3.70 ERA, and 1 save.[5] López started 
off badly in 2004, going 0–2 with a 9.93 ERA in 46 games by mid-season. 
He was then sent down to the AAA Colorado Springs Sky Sox of the Pacific 
Coast League on July 18.[16] While in AAA, he went 0–1 and had a 4.00 ERA 
in eight games.[6] He was called back to the majors on August 10 to replace 
an injured Aaron Cook and played the rest of the season in Colorado.[17] 
He pitched better the rest of the season, allowing only two runs for a 
1.54 ERA in his final 18 games.[5][18] In 64 games, López had a 1–2 record, 
a 7.52 ERA, 20 strikeouts, and no saves in 40 2⁄3 innings.[5] López began 
2005 with the Rockies, but after allowing five runs in his first three 
games (for a 22.50 ERA), he was optioned to Colorado Springs on April 11.[19] 
Before he could appear in any games with Colorado Springs, López was claimed 
off waivers by the Arizona Diamondbacks on April 14. Due to major league 
rules, Arizona was unable to call him up until April 24.[6][20] He had 
another poor season, having a record of 1–1 and an 11.02 ERA, the highest 
in the majors among relievers who made at least 30 appearances.[5] On July 
5, López was designated for assignment to make room on the roster for Armando 
Almanza.[21] He cleared waivers and was sent down to the Tucson Sidewinders 
of the Pacific Coast League for the rest of the season. He went 0–1 with 
a 2.22 ERA.[6] On October 15, he was granted free agency.[22] López signed 
a minor league deal for the Chicago White Sox in 2006.[22] He competed 
with Boone Logan for the role of left-handed specialist, but Logan won 
the role, and López was sent to AAA to begin the season.[23] Playing for 
the Charlotte Knights of the International League, he went 2–1 with 12 
saves and an 0.55 ERA in 26 games.[6] On June 15, 2006, López was traded 
to the Boston Red Sox for David Riske.[24] He posted a 4.32 ERA in 14 appearances 
before getting sent to the Pawtucket Red Sox of the International League 
on July 17 because it was too "tough" for the Red Sox to carry a left-handed 
specialist at that point in the season, according to manager Terry Francona.[25] 
He was called up for two short stints from July 28 through August 1 and 
from August 20 through 22, appearing in one game each time.[5][26] On September 
4, he was recalled for the remainder of the season.[5] In 11 September 
outings, López allowed only one run.[26] He finished the year going 1–0 
with a 2.70 ERA in 27 games.[5] With Pawtucket, he had no record and a 
4.86 ERA in 13 games ( 16 2⁄3 innings).[6] López made the Red Sox' Opening 
Day roster in 2007, but after four scoreless outings he was optioned to 
Pawtucket on April 9 to make room for Mike Timlin, who had started the 
season on the disabled list.[27][28] He was recalled on May 11 when Devern 
Hansack was sent down.[29] On this stint, he posted a 3.18 ERA in 40 appearances 
before getting sent down on August 5 to make room for Curt Schilling, who 
was returning from the disabled list.[5][30] With the Red Sox about to 
face several tough left-handed hitters in late August, Jon Lester was sent 
down on August 23 to make room for López on the roster.[31] In 2007, López 
made 61 appearances, posting a 2–1 record with a 3.10 ERA in 40 2⁄3 innings.[5] 
Despite his three stints in the minors, his 61 appearances ranked second 
on the club to Hideki Okajima's 66.[32] He made 17 appearances for Pawtucket, 
going 2–1 with a 3.78 ERA.[6] López was a member of the playoff roster 
for the Red Sox, posting a 15.43 ERA but winning his first World Series 
as the Red Sox swept the Rockies in four games.[33][34][35] On 18 January 
2008, López agreed to a one-year contract with the Red Sox for $840,000, 
avoiding the arbitration process.[32] In 2008, López spent the full season 
on a major league roster for the first time since his rookie year.[5] On 
June 6, he threw a career-high three innings, allowing no runs in an 8–0 
loss to the Seattle Mariners.[5][36] In 70 games, López had a 2–0 record, 
a 2.43 ERA, and 38 strikeouts in 59 1⁄3 innings pitched. He had the fifth-lowest 
ERA among major league left-handed relievers and appeared in the fifth-most 
games of AL left-handers. He had the second-lowest ERA among Red Sox pitchers 
in 2008.[5] López made the playoffs for the second year in a row as the 
Red Sox won the AL Wild Card. He made one appearance in the AL Division 
Series (ALDS) against the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, taking the loss 
in Game 3 after giving up a game-winning, twelfth-inning single to Erick 
Aybar.[37] That was Boston's only loss of the series, as they defeated 
the Angels in four games.[38] He made two appearances in the AL Championship 
Series (ALCS) against the Tampa Bay Rays, allowing no runs as the Red Sox 
were defeated in seven games.[33][39] On April 30, 2009, López allowed 
five runs in 1⁄3 inning and played the remainder of the eighth inning in 
right field after Francona switched him with right fielder Jonathan Van 
Every.[40] This game, a 13–0 loss to the Rays, was the first time a Red 
Sox pitcher had played another position in a major league game since Tom 
Burgmeier played left field on August 3, 1980.[41] On May 10, López was 
designated for assignment to make room for pitcher Daniel Bard after he 
started the year 0–2 with a 9.26 ERA in 14 games.[42] Shortly thereafter, 
he was outrighted to the minors. He spent the rest of the season in Pawtucket, 
going 1–1 with a 3.18 ERA in 38 games.[6] On October 5, he was granted 
free agency.[22] López ended his Red Sox tenure with a string of 152 straight 
games without a save, the longest stretch for a Red Sox pitcher since Rheal 
Cormier had 160 in 1995 and from 1999–2000.[5] On December 18, 2009, López 
signed a one-year contract with the Pittsburgh Pirates where he replaced 
John Grabow, who was traded mid-2009, as the Pirates' left-handed specialist.[43][44] 
After posting a 10.80 ERA in his first two games, he posted a 2.43 ERA 
over his next 48 through July 31.[45] On July 31, 2010, López was traded 
to the San Francisco Giants for Joe Martinez and John Bowker.[46] He appeared 
in 27 games for the Giants, earning a 2–0 record with an ERA of 1.42. His 
combined record of 4–2 for the year with both Pittsburgh and San Francisco 
came in 77 appearances with an ERA of 2.34, both career records. Left-handed 
batters hit only .162 against López, lowest among all National League left-handers 
(minimum 85 at-bats).[5] He ended the season five days short of qualifying 
for free agency.[47] López reached the playoffs as the Giants won the NL 
West for the first time since 2003. He made two appearances in the NLDS 
against the Atlanta Braves to face Jason Heyward, whom he struck out both 
times.[5] The Giants won the series in four games.[48] Against the Philadelphia 
Phillies in the NLCS, he made five appearances, all scoreless except for 
Game 4, in which he allowed a run.[33] In the deciding Game 6, he pitched 
a scoreless seventh inning and was awarded with a win after Juan Uribe 
hit a game-winning home run against Ryan Madson in the eighth inning.[49] 
López made two appearances against the Texas Rangers in the 2010 World 
Series, striking out the two batters he faced. In Game 2, he struck out 
Josh Hamilton to end the top of the eighth inning with a runner on second 
and preserve a 2–0 lead, although the Giants went on to win 9–0.[2] He 
won his second World Series ring as the Giants defeated the Rangers in 
five games to win their first World Series since 1954.[50] Since joining 
the Giants in 2010, López has become one of the premier lefty specialists 
in the game.[51] On May 12, 2011, he recorded his first save since 2006 
in a 3–2 victory over the Diamondbacks. Following the game, he crossed 
his arms, imitating Giants' closer Brian Wilson's post-save gesture.[52] 
In 70 games in 2011, he had a 5–2 record, a 2.72 ERA, and 40 strikeouts 
in 50 innings pitched. He and Brad Ziegler were the only relief pitchers 
in the major leagues to toss at least 50 innings without allowing a home 
run. His .163 opponent batting average (OBA) against left-handers was the 
eighth-lowest in the NL.[5] After the 2011 season, the Giants re-signed 
López to a two-year, $8.5 million contract.[53] On July 6, 2012, López 
gave up his first home run since joining the Giants in 2010 when he allowed 
a 457-foot home run to Pedro Álvarez in a 6–5 victory over the Pirates.[54] 
That brought his ERA to 4.00, but he posted a 1.00 ERA over his last 32 
games. Following struggles by Santiago Casilla (who had replaced an injured 
Wilson as the Giants' closer), Giants' manager Bruce Bochy announced on 
August 7 that the Giants would be going to a "bullpen by committee" strategy, 
with López, Sergio Romo, and Jeremy Affeldt pitching the final two innings 
of close games, depending on which hitters they would be facing.[55] Romo 
and López received most of the save opportunities; Affeldt only had one 
save after that point.[56][57][58] López received six save opportunities 
after August 7 and converted each of them.[56] In 70 games, López had a 
3–0 record, a 2.50 ERA, and 28 strikeouts in 36 innings while converting 
seven out of nine save opportunities. He stranded 87.9% of inherited runners, 
the third-best mark in the NL.[5] López made five appearances in the NLDS 
and the NLCS, allowing no runs as the Giants won both of those series. 
He did not pitch in the World Series but won his third career World Series 
ring as the Giants swept the Detroit Tigers.[33][59] López recorded his 
only save of the 2013 season on September 19, pitching the final 2⁄3 of 
the ninth inning in a 2–1 victory over the Mets.[60] He made 69 appearances 
in 2013, going 4–2 with a career-best 1.83 ERA and striking out 37 in 39 1⁄3 
innings. He held left-handed hitters to a .156 OBA.[5] On November 20, 
2013, López was re-signed by the Giants to a three-year, $13 million contract.[61] 
López appeared in 65 games in 2014, recording a 3.11 ERA with 22 strikeouts 
and 19 walks. In the 2014 NLDS, NLCS, and World Series, he recorded 11 
outs over nine appearances, allowing 4 hits and a walk. Lopez won his fourth 
World Series ring as the Giants defeated the Kansas City Royals in seven 
games. In 2015, López matched his career high with 77 appearances, setting 
new career-bests with a 1.60 ERA and 0.890 WHIP. He struck out 26 batters 
in 39 1⁄3 innings pitched. López's main pitch is a two-seam fastball in 
the low 80s, and his secondary pitch is a slider in the high 70s. Against 
left-handed hitters he will sometimes mix in a curveball.[62] López's distinctive 
sidearm delivery makes him appealing as a left-handed specialist; through 
the 2013 season, lefties have hit only .209 against him, while righties 
have hit .297.[63] After López struggled to begin his professional career, 
throwing over the top, he decided he needed to change his style.[3] In 
the Diamondbacks' system in 2002, with the help of Mike Myers, he began 
throwing sidearm (or submarine), which Andy Baggarly called "a decision 
that changed his life."[64] López is married to Renée Richards, with whom 
he attended high school and college. The couple has two children: Kylan 
(March 19, 2010) and Christian (October 26, 2012).[2][5] Because López 
was in the 2012 World Series when Christian was born, he had to fly back 
home for the birth between Games 2 and 3. He and his family reside in Denver, 
Colorado.[65] López is a Christian. He says, "I do everything through faith,
