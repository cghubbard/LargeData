Yankees Universe is a charity that supports the Memorial Sloan-Kettering 
Cancer Center. Created by Mindy Franklin Levine, the wife of New York Yankees 
President Randy Levine, the program raises money for the New York Yankees 
Universe fund. Proceeds for the fund are generated by donations, special 
events, and the sale of Yankees Universe T-shirts, and this money is made 
available to the cancer center. According to the MSKCC web site, the proceeds 
"go directly to support pediatric cancer research and care, helping to 
contribute to advancements in the treatment of children with cancer." The 
shirts have become extremely popular with Yankee fans around the world 
and have raised significant funds for Sloan-Kettering. Since the inception 
in April 2006 the phrase has gained popularity and now frequently appears 
in the press- including the New York Post, May 2007: "Roger Clemens pitches 
well nobody will criticize him for coming and going in the Yankees' Universe". 
However, the phrase has been found in the popular press at least as early 
as 2001.[1] As a result, some fans now consider "Yankees Universe" the 
unofficial name of the Yankee fanbase, as the team has a nationwide following 
and often attracts large crowds of its own fans at other Major League ballparks,
