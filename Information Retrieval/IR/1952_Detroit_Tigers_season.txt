The 1952 Detroit Tigers had a record of 50–104 (.325) — the worst record 
in Tigers' history until the 2003 Tigers lost 119 games. Virgil Trucks 
became the third pitcher in major league history to throw two no-hitters 
in one season.[1] The 1952 Tigers winning percentage ranks as the second 
worst in the Tigers' history, as shown in this chart. The club was managed 
by Red Rolfe (April 15 through July 4), who compiled a win-loss record 
of 23–49 (.319), then by pitcher-manager Fred Hutchinson, who had a record 
of 27–55 (.329) from July 5 through closing day, September 28.[2] [1] [2]
