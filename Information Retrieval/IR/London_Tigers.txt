The London Tigers were a professional AA baseball team that played in the 
Eastern League from 1989 to 1993. They played at Labatt Memorial Park in 
London, Ontario, and were affiliated with the Detroit Tigers. After 47 
years without a pro team, professional baseball returned to London in 1989 
when the Glens Falls Tigers moved to the city and took on the name London 
Tigers. Sitting on the Tigers' Board of Directors were President Dan Ross, 
Vice President Mike Tucker, Vice-President and General Manager Bob Gilson, 
Vice-President and Assistant General Manager General Manager Bill Wilkinson 
and Vice-President Brian Costello. Sitting on the Tigers' Advisory Board 
were Brad Nelson, Bill MacDougall, London restaurant entrepreneur Mike 
Smith, Spencer Clark, Bruce Johnson and Tom Whealy. The inaugural season 
homeopener for the Tigers was on Friday, April 7, 1989, against the Albany, 
New York, Yankees. During the team's inaugural season, the club derived 
its offence from unusual sources—shortstop and catcher. Shortstop Travis 
Fryman led the EL with 30 doubles, while hitting .265/.297/.402 and catcher 
Phil Clark batted .298/.328/.427. Third baseman Scott Livingstone hit a 
team-high 14 HR but batted just .217. Paul Wenson went 2-3 with a 3.50 
ERA one year after leading the EL in ERA while Darren Hursey (8-13, 3.97) 
led the league in losses, hits allowed (183) and runs allowed (92). The 
Tigers went 63-76 and finished 6th of 8 teams. The London Tigers, managed 
by former New York Yankee star, Chris Chambliss drew 167,679 fans, more 
than they had their last two years in Glens Falls. Chambliss was named 
Manager of the Year in the 1990 Eastern League after London finished 76-63, 
just three games behind the Albany Yankees, while attendance was just 15 
fans off of the opening season's pace. All-Star first baseman Rico Brogna 
was named the #3 prospect in the circuit and led the league in homers (21), 
and tied for the lead in RBI (77) while hitting .262/.331/.447. Mike Wilkins 
(13-5, 2.42), Dave Haas (13-8, 2.99) and Rusty Meacham (15-9, 3.13) gave 
the club a nice trio of arms; Wilkins was 6th in the league in ERA, Haas 
9th and Meacham led in wins. In the post-season, London lost the first 
two games to the Canton–Akron Indians but then won three in a row at home. 
They then beat the New Britain Red Sox in three straight games to become 
the first Detroit Tigers farm club to win the Eastern League championship. 
Gene Roof managed the team to sixth place in 1991 with a 61-78 record as 
attendance slipped to 150,435. Brogna was again named one of the top prospects 
in the loop (4th) though he spent some of the year in the International 
League while he hit .273/.330/.457; for the second straight year he hit 
as many doubles as homers for London. Steve Pegues hit .301 and Lou Frazier 
stole 42 bases and drew 77 walks. John Doherty (3-3, 15 Sv, 2.22) was the 
top pitcher on the squad. Mark DeJohn managed London to a 67-70 record 
in 1992 as the team finished in fifth. Attendance dropped to 112,913, lowest 
in the EL. The club's top position players were all repeats at AA. All-Star 
1B Iván Cruz hit .273/.321/.407 in his second year with London; he drove 
in 104 to become the first EL player to top 100 since Mark Grace five years 
earlier. OF Frazier (in his 4th year at AA and third with London) hit .252/.376/.298 
and led the circuit in walks (95), steals (58) and times caught stealing 
(23). Greg Sparks (in his 5th season at AA) hit .232/.331/.482 and topped 
the league with 25 homers; he was named to the All-Star team at DH. 3B 
Rob Reimink (.296/.393/.381 in his second year with London) was 4th in 
the league in average and Tyrone Kingwood (in his second AA season) (.284/.333/.385, 
22 SB) also placed in the top 10 in average. In 1993 with Tom Runnells 
as manager, the Tigers again drew the fewest fans, with 103,840, when Runnells 
led the team to a 63-75, 6th-place finish. The team at least wasn't loaded 
with minor-league veterans—21-year-old OF Danny Bautista hit .285/.336/.382 
and stole 28 bases; 23-year-old OF Rudy Pemberton posted a .276/.311/.435 
line with 15 homers; 23-year-old 2B Shannon Penn (.260/.335/.310) led the 
league with 53 stolen bases and 22-year-old OF Bobby Higginson batted .308/.362/.464 
after a call-up from the Lakeland Tigers. Felipe Lira went 10-4 with a 
3.38 ERA, the third-best ERA in the league, and was the last London Tiger 
to make the EL All-Star team. José Lima went 8-13 with a 4.07 ERA. After 
the 1993 campaign, the Tigers, frustrated with sinking attendance, moved 
the team to Trenton, New Jersey where they became the Trenton Thunder. 
After one year in Trenton, the Thunder switched affiliation from Detroit
