The 1984 San Diego Padres season was the 16th season in franchise history. 
San Diego won the National League (NL) championship and advanced to the 
World Series, which they lost to the Detroit Tigers four games to one. 
The Padres were led by manager Dick Williams and third-year player Tony 
Gwynn, who won the NL batting title and finished third in voting for the 
NL Most Valuable Player Award. In their first 15 seasons, the Padres had 
an overall won–lost record of 995–1372 for a .420 winning percentage,[1] 
and finished with a winning record just once.[2] They had never finished 
higher than fourth in the NL West division, and eight times they had finished 
in last place.[2] However, they were coming off consecutive 81–81 seasons 
in Williams' two years as San Diego's manager.[3] They won the NL West 
in 1984 with a 92–70 record, and set a then-franchise record in attendance, 
drawing nearly two million fans (1,985,895).[4] They defeated the Chicago 
Cubs in the National League Championship Series (NLCS), three games to 
two, becoming the first NL team to win the pennant after being down 2–0. 
Steve Garvey was named the NLCS Most Valuable Player. After spending $6 
million to acquire free-agent first baseman Steve Garvey in 1983, the Padres 
signed free-agent reliever Goose Gossage to a five-year contract for $6.25 
million in January 1984.[12][13] The deal made Gossage the highest-salaried 
pitcher in baseball at the time.[13] Manager Dick Williams, who had asked 
General Manager Jack McKeon to obtain a strikeout-type reliever, declared 
that the acquisition made San Diego a playoff contender.[14] Eight days 
after signing Gossage, Padres owner Ray Kroc died at the age of 81.[15] 
The season was dedicated in his memory with the team wearing his initials, 
"RAK" on their jersey's left sleeve during the entire season.[3][16] Ownership 
of the team passed to his wife, Joan Kroc.[15] In February, All-Star catcher 
Terry Kennedy underwent arthroscopic surgery on his left knee after being 
bothered by continuous inflammation since the middle of 1983.[17] During 
spring training, Alan Wiggins was named the team's new second baseman over 
incumbent Juan Bonilla, who was subsequently waived.[10] In a gamble to 
generate offense, Wiggins had been moved from the outfield to make room 
in left field for Carmelo Martínez, who was moved from first base after 
being acquired in the offseason from the Chicago Cubs.[18] The Padres were 
hoping to bolster their starting outfield, which produced just 23 homers 
in 1983.[19] The rookie Martinez and center fielder Kevin McReynolds, whose 
140 at-bats during the prior season disqualified him from being considered 
a rookie in 1984, were hyped by the media as the M&M Boys, alluding to 
the Yankees' 1960s power-hitting duo of Mickey Mantle and Roger Maris.[16][20] 
The two Padre outfielders along with Garvey, Nettles, and Kennedy supplied 
San Diego with five regulars who had the potential to hit at least 20 home 
runs. Third-year right fielder Tony Gwynn entered the season with a .302 
lifetime batting average, the highest on the club.[16] Gwynn, McReynolds, 
and Martinez formed the youngest outfield in the majors.[21] Shortstop 
Garry Templeton was relieved of pain from a left knee that had bother him 
for years, and was expected to anchor the infield, especially with Wiggins 
moving to second base.[22] Templeton was also projected to bat leadoff 
for the Padres,[22] but he was dropped to No. 8 in the order after he took 
a spike to his right knee toward the end of spring training.[23] Three 
days before the season opener, 39-year-old third baseman Graig Nettles, 
a San Diego native, approved a trade from the New York Yankees to the Padres.[15][21][24] 
A left-handed batter who had hit 333 career home runs, he was open to platooning 
with incumbent Luis Salazar, although Nettles was expected to get the majority 
of playing time given the larger number of right-handed starting pitchers 
in the majors.[25] Heading into the season, Williams' biggest concern was 
their pitching.[26] The starters largely relied on finesse and off-speed 
pitches, and none of them had ever won more than 16 games.[1][26] The Padres 
won their first four games of the season, and were 9–2 before leaving on 
their first road trip.[15] They were 18–11 before losing seven in a row, 
their longest losing streak of the season. The streak was snapped on May 
17, when Wiggins tied an NL record with five stolen bases, and the club 
swiped a team record of seven in a 5–4 home win over Montreal.[27] They 
were tied for first in the West at the end of May, and were 2 1⁄2 games 
up by the end of June.[15] After moving back into first place on June 9, 
they did not relinquish the lead the rest of the season.[27] San Diego 
played at a steady pace, never falling below .500, while their longest 
winning streak was only six.[28] San Diego clinched the division on September 
20, when they beat San Francisco 5–4 behind a three-run homer by pitcher 
Tim Lollar, and Houston lost to Los Angeles 6–2 three hours later.[29] 
The Padres finished the season with a 92–70 record, winning the NL West 
division by 12 games.[30] It was just the second winning season in the 
franchise's history.[31] The future Hall-of-Famer Gwynn batted .351 to 
capture the first of his eight NL batting titles, while also gathering 
213 hits to shatter the Padres record of 194 established by Gene Richards 
in 1980.[30] Eric Show (15–9, 3.40 ERA) was the only starting pitcher with 
15 wins, though the four main starters all recorded at at least 11.[31][32] 
The acquisition of Gossage, who finished the season 10–6 with a 2.90 ERA 
and 25 saves, was a strong factor in San Diego's 34–24 record in one-run 
games.[15][32] The team relied on small ball and moving runners over.[31] 
With the exception of Gwynn, who finished third in balloting for the NL 
Most Valuable Player Award, no Padre enjoyed an outstanding season individually.[30][33] 
Nettles and McReynolds tied for the team lead in home runs with 20, and 
only two others exceeded 10.[31] Garvey led the club with 86 RBIs, the 
only Padre with more than 75.[2] Coming off his thumb injury from 1983, 
he hit only eight home runs, but had 175 hits and did not commit an error.[34] 
Wiggins' move to second base proved successful, as he exhibited excellent 
range with his quickness in spite of his 32 fielding errors.[35][36] Offensively 
as the leadoff hitter, he batted .258 and drew 75 walks for an on-base 
percentage of .342, while setting club records by stealing 70 bases and 
scoring 106 runs.[15][31][35] Benefitting from the higher number of fastballs 
opposing pitchers threw in response to Wiggins' speed,[37] Gwynn batted 
above .400 when his speedy teammate was on base.[15] According to Williams, 
Wiggins "was absolutely the most valuable player in the National League 
in 1984."[38] No longer a .300 hitter like in his earlier days with St. 
Louis, Templeton enjoyed his most successful season since 1981. Hitting 
eighth in the lineup, he did not receive many pitches to hit. He batted 
.258 with 24 extra-base hits and six game-winning RBI, and was praised 
by Williams for his defense.[39] Both Templeton and Gwynn were honored 
by The Sporting News with Silver Slugger Awards, and Martinez (.249, 13 
HR) was named to the Topps All-Star Rookie Team.[40] Martinez however, 
hit only three homers in the second half, and just one after July 18, after 
hitting 10 in the first half. Troubled by his knees, Kennedy slumped to 
.240 while his RBIs fell to 57 from 98 a year earlier. Nettles hit .222, 
which was 29 points below his career average, and most of his homers came 
in two hot streaks.[34] In addition to Show, the starting rotation included 
fellow 28-year-old Mark Thurmond (14–8, 2.97), as well as veterans Ed Whitson 
(14–8, 3.24) and Lollar (11–13, 3.91). Andy Hawkins (8–9, 4.68) and Dave 
Dravecky (9–8, 2.93) split time as the fifth starter. In the bullpen, Gossage 
and Craig Lefferts (2.13 ERA and 10 saves) each appeared in 62 games and 
logged over 100 innings apiece. Unlike modern closers, Gossage often entered 
games in the seventh or eighth innings, with Lefferts filling in as the 
stopper when Gossage needed a game off after working successive long stints. 
Dravecky also recorded eight saves.[31] At age 33, Gossage experienced 
a decline in his fastball, and did not record a save after August 25.[34] 
Williams led the team with a tough, no-nonsense approach.[32] He cited 
the advantage of having the experience of veterans Garvey, Nettles, and 
Gossage on the team.[41] Prior to joining the Padres, Garvey and Nettles 
had advanced to the World Series four times, while Gossage had participated 
in two.[42] Throughout the season, they stressed the value of consistency 
and an even temperament to youngsters like Gwynn, McReynolds, and Martinez, 
who were among the 11 players on the team with less than four years of 
major league experience.[28][43] Gossage and Nettles, in particular, would 
stay after games and talk baseball and have a beer with the youngsters.[28] 
Additionally, Templeton befriended Wiggins, helping his transition from 
the outfield to second base.[39] The Padres' regular season is most remembered 
for an August 12 Sunday afternoon game at Atlanta Fulton County Stadium 
against the Atlanta Braves. The Braves were expected to be contenders for 
the division title, but were a disappointing 9 1/2 games out of first at 
gametime. The start of the game was delayed 2 hours by rain. Braves starting 
pitcher Pascual Pérez hit Alan Wiggins with the very first pitch of the 
game, which seemed to put the Padres into retaliatory mode. The Braves 
went up 2-0 in the bottom of the first on a Claudell Washington homer. 
When Perez came to bat in the bottom of the 2nd, Padres starter Ed Whitson 
threw at him as he squared to bunt. Perez responded by wielding his bat 
and starting toward Whitson, but home plate umpire Steve Rippley restrained 
him as both benches began to clear. Rippley issued a warning to both teams 
without any fighting ensuing. The Braves scored another run in the inning 
to go up 3–0. In the bottom of the fourth, Whitson threw three straight 
inside fastballs at Perez, and Rippley ejected both Whitson and manager 
Dick Williams. Greg Booker replaced Whitson and gave up two more runs before 
facing Perez in the bottom of the sixth. Then, Booker also threw at Perez 
and Rippley proceeded to throw both him and acting manager Ozzie Virgil 
out of the game. In the top of the seventh, Graig Nettles hit a solo homer 
off Perez, which would incite later activity. In the bottom of the eighth, 
Craig Lefferts threw at Perez and Rippley ejected both him and second acting 
manager Jack Krol, leaving only Harry Dunlop to manage the rest of the 
way. This time, both the Braves' and Padres' dugouts cleared and the brawl 
was on. First base umpire John McSherry and Padres first baseman Steve 
Garvey attempted to head off the onslaught, but both were caught in the 
middle as both teams exchanged punches. The brawl went on for 10 minutes 
before reserve infielder Champ Summers stormed toward the Braves' dugout 
at Perez, who had retreated to the dugout. Bob Horner met Summers at the 
front of the dugout and he and the Braves' Rick Camp wrestled him to the 
ground along with a fan who leaped on top of Summers from the stands. Another 
fan doused Summers with a drink. On the side, the Padres' Bobby Brown and 
the Braves' Gerald Perry engaged in a fight of their own. Summers, Brown, 
Camp, and Perry were all ejected. Finally, in the top of the ninth, Braves' 
reliever Donnie Moore intentionally plunked Nettles when he came to bat, 
sparking yet another fight. Rick Mahler and Steve Bedrosian intervened 
for the Braves and were ejected, while Goose Gossage joined in and was 
also ejected. Moore and Braves manager Joe Torre also joined the ranks 
of the ejected.[44] Once order was finally restored, Gene Garber pitched 
the remainder of the game for the Braves with Joe Pignatano acting for 
Torre. The Padres scored two in the ninth, but no more as the Braves won 
5–3.[45] Shortly after the final out, another fan threw a beer at the Padres' 
Kurt Bevacqua, causing Bevacqua to go into the stands after him. He was 
restrained by security guards. Infielders Coaches Note: Pos = position;

faced the NL East champion Chicago Cubs, who were making their first post-season 
appearance since 1945 and featured NL Most Valuable Player Ryne Sandberg 
and Cy Young Award winner Rick Sutcliffe. The Cubs would win the first 
two games at Wrigley Field, but the Padres swept the final three games 
at then-Jack Murphy Stadium (the highlight arguably being Steve Garvey's 
dramatic, game-winning home run off of Lee Smith in Game 4) to win the 
1984 National League pennant.[49] They became the first National League 
team to win a playoff series after being down 2–0.[15] Garvey finished 
the series batting .400 with seven RBIs,[50][51] and was named the NLCS 
Most Valuable Player for the second time in his career.[52] After returning 
from Chicago on a delayed flight, the team boarded buses from the airport, 
and was boosted by the surprising 2,000 fans waiting to greet them at the 
Jack Murphy Stadium parking lot at about 9:45 P.M.[21][27][28] Gossage, 
a former New York Yankee, said the San Diego crowd at Game 3 was "the loudest 
crowd I've ever heard anywhere."[53] Gwynn agreed as well.[54] Jack Murphy 
Stadium played "Cub-Busters", a parody of the theme song from the 1984 
movie Ghostbusters.[53][54] Cub-Busters T-shirts inspired from the movie 
were popular attire for Padres fans.[55][56] San Diego won the series, 
3–2. In the 1984 World Series, the Padres faced the powerful Detroit Tigers, 
who steamrolled through the regular season with 104 victories (and had 
started out with a 35-5 record, the best ever through the first 40 games). 
The Tigers were managed by Sparky Anderson and featured shortstop and native 
San Diegan Alan Trammell and outfielder Kirk Gibson, along with Lance Parrish 
and DH Darrell Evans. The pitching staff was bolstered by ace Jack Morris 
(19-11, 3.60 ERA), Dan Petry (18-8), Milt Wilcox (17-8), and closer Willie 
Hernández (9-3, 1.92 ERA with 32 saves).[62] Jack Morris would win games 
1 and 4 and the Tigers would go on to win the Series 4-games-to-1.[63] 
San Diego's starting pitchers crumbled in the postseason with a combined 
ERA of 9.09, including 13.94 against Detroit, surpassing the Cubs mark 
of 9.50 in 1932 as the worst in the then-82-year history of the World Series.[21][64] 
Show, Thurmond, Lollar, and Whitson combined to throw only 10 2⁄3 innings 
versus the Tigers while surrendering 25 hits, eight walks, and 16 earned 
runs.[65] Only once did a starter pitch at least five innings.[64] Whitson 
(NLCS Game 3) was the only starter to earn a win in the playoffs.[34] Out 
of the bullpen, Lefferts was excellent in the postseason with 10 scoreless 
innings in six appearances, while Hawkins and Dravecky pitched well in 
the playoffs as well.[64] After a disappointing season for 37-year-old 
journeyman Kurt Bevacqua, he hit .412 in the World Series as the Padres 
designated hitter, hitting the game-winning home run in Game 2 as well 
as an eighth-inning homer in the finale, which had cut San Diego's deficit 
to 5–4.[21][64] Playing in place of the injured McReynolds, Bobby Brown 
had the team's only two RBIs by Padres outfielders against the Tigers, 
but he batted just 1-for-15.[34] Reporter Barry Bloom of MLB.com wrote 
in 2011 that "the postseason in ’84 is still the most exciting week of 
Major League Baseball ever played in San Diego."[66] Gossage, who is mostly 
remembered as a Yankee, called it "special being a part of turning on a 
city for the first time, going to the World Series for the first time".[32]
