Antonio Francisco Bastardo Rafael [1] is a Dominican professional baseball 
relief pitcher for the Pittsburgh Pirates of Major League Baseball (MLB). 
He previously played for the Philadelphia Phillies and New York Mets. Bastardo 
was signed by the Philadelphia Phillies in 2007 and assigned to the Lakewood 
BlueClaws of the "Low A" South Atlantic League. In Lakewood, Bastardo went 
9–0, with a 1.87 earned run average in 15 games, all of which he started. 
He had 98 strikeouts and 42 walks in 91.2 innings of work. At the end of 
the 2007 season, Bastardo was promoted to the Clearwater Threshers of the 
"High A" Florida State League. For the Threshers in 2007, Bastardo appeared 
in one game, in which he gave up four earned runs but struck out twelve 
in five innings.[2][3] Bastardo began the 2008 season in Clearwater, where 
he went 2–0 with a 1.17 earned run average and struck out 47 batters in 
his 30.2 innings of work. He was then called up to the Reading Phillies 
of the Double-A Eastern League. In Reading, Bastardo went 2–5 with a 3.76 
earned run average in 14 starts. He pitched 67 innings, striking out 62, 
walking 37, and allowing 56 hits. Before the 2009 season, Bastardo was 
converted from a starting pitcher to a relief pitcher, but was converted 
right back to a starter after only a handful of outings.[4] Phillies pitching 
coach Rich Dubee said that Bastardo had a chance to be in the major leagues 
at some point in 2009.[5] He was also invited to the Phillies' training 
camp as a non-roster invitee but was sent to minor league camp on March 
16, 2009.[6] After he was sent down, Bastardo joined the Lehigh Valley 
IronPigs for the rest of spring training[7] before being sent down to the 
Reading Phillies.[8] Baseball America ranked him as the 11th-best prospect 
in the Phillies organization in 2009.[9] After posting a 2–2 record, 1.82 
ERA in nine games, Bastardo was called up to the Lehigh Valley IronPigs. 
On May 30, 2009, the Phillies announced that Bastardo would make his major 
league debut in a start at San Diego on Tuesday, June 2.[10][11] After 
Brett Myers tore his labrum and placed on the 15-day disabled list, the 
Philadelphia Phillies called up Bastardo on June 2, 2009.[12][13] He won 
in his first start against the Padres, allowing only one earned run during 
his six innings pitched.[14][15] After his Phillies' debut, Bastardo recorded 
a 2–3 record with a 6.75 ERA and 19 strikeouts. On June 25, during a start 
against the Tampa Bay Rays he suffered a shoulder injury[16] that forced 
him to go on the disabled list.[17][18][19] He returned to the Phillies 
roster for the postseason, where he made a relief appearance in the second 
game of the National League Division Series against the Colorado Rockies, 
striking out Jason Giambi with two outs and the bases loaded.[20] For the 
2010 season, Bastardo was converted into a full-time relief pitcher. He 
was placed on the 15-day disabled list on June 17, 2010.[21] For the season, 
he recorded 2 wins and no losses, and an ERA of 4.34. On April 24, Bastardo 
earned his first save in the major leagues when he relieved Roy Halladay 
after 8 2⁄3 innings, inducing one San Diego Padres batter to pop out and 
completing the game. Bastardo was chosen as interim closer for the Phillies 
when Ryan Madson went on the disabled list. Bastardo once pitched a 17-inning 
scoreless streak, lowering his ERA to 0.78 in the process. He would finish 
the season with a 6-1 record and a 2.64 ERA. On November 14, 2011, it was 
announced that Bastardo had agreed to let Jonathan Papelbon wear Bastardo's 
former number 58.[22] Bastardo would end up wearing number 37. In 2012, 
Bastardo posted a win-loss record of 2-5 and an ERA of 4.33. Following 
the season, Bastardo changed his number again, this time to 59, so relief 
pitcher Mike Adams could wear his number 37. On August 5, 2013, Bastardo 
was suspended 50 games by Major League Baseball as part of the Biogenesis 
baseball scandal. At the time of his suspension, which kept him out for 
the remainder of the season, he was 3–2 with an ERA of 2.32.[23] Coming 
off part of a season during which he was one of the Phillies most "reliable" 
relief pitchers, Bastardo sought to stabilize the bullpen in 2014 for the 
Phillies.[24] He recorded an ERA of 3.94 in 67 games. On December 10, 2014, 
the Phillies traded Bastardo to the Pittsburgh Pirates in exchange for 
Joely Rodríguez.[25] Bastardo appeared in 66 games for the Pirates in 2015, 
recording a win-loss record of 4–1, one save, and an ERA of 2.91. On January 
22, 2016, Bastardo signed a 2-year, $12 million contract with the New York 
Mets.[26] In 41 games with the Mets, Bastardo recorded an ERA of 4.74. 
On August 1, 2016, the Mets traded Bastardo back to the Pirates for Jon
