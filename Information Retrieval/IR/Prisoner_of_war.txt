A prisoner of war (POW, PoW, PW, P/W, WP, PsW, enemy prisoner of war (EPW) 
or "missing-captured"[1]) is a person, whether combatant or non-combatant, 
who is held in custody by a belligerent power during or immediately after 
an armed conflict. The earliest recorded usage of the phrase "prisoner 
of war" dates to 1660. Belligerents hold prisoners of war in custody for 
a range of legitimate and illegitimate reasons, such as isolating them 
from enemy combatants still in the field (releasing and repatriating them 
in an orderly manner after hostilities), demonstrating military victory, 
punishing them, prosecuting them for war crimes, exploiting them for their 
labor, recruiting or even conscripting them as their own combatants, collecting 
military and political intelligence from them, or indoctrinating them in 
new political or religious beliefs.[2] For most of human history, depending 
on the culture of the victors, enemy combatants on the losing side in a 
battle who had surrendered and been taken as a prisoner of war could expect 
to be either slaughtered or enslaved.[3] The first Roman gladiators were 
prisoners of war and were named according to their ethnic roots such as 
Samnite, Thracian, and the Gaul (Gallus).[4] Homer's Iliad describes Greek 
and Trojan soldiers offering rewards of wealth to opposing forces who have 
defeated them on the battlefield in exchange for mercy, but their offers 
are not always accepted; see Lycaon for example. Typically, little distinction 
was made between enemy combatants and enemy civilians, although women and 
children were more likely to be spared. Sometimes, the purpose of a battle, 
if not a war, was to capture women, a practice known as raptio; the Rape 
of the Sabines was a large mass abduction by the founders of Rome. Typically 
women had no rights, and were held legally as chattel.[citation needed] 
In the fourth century AD, Bishop Acacius of Amida, touched by the plight 
of Persian prisoners captured in a recent war with the Roman Empire, who 
were held in his town under appalling conditions and destined for a life 
of slavery, took the initiative of ransoming them, by selling his church's 
precious gold and silver vessels, and letting them return to their country. 
For this he was eventually canonized.[5] During Childeric's siege and blockade 
of Paris in 464, the nun Geneviève (later canonised as the city's Patron 
Saint) pleaded with the Frankish King for the welfare of prisoners of war 
and met with a favourable response. Later, Clovis I liberated captives 
after Genevieve urged him to do so.[6] Many French prisoners of war were 
killed during the Battle of Agincourt in 1415.[7] This was done in retaliation 
for the French killing of the boys and other non-combatants handling the 
baggage and equipment of the army, and because the French were attacking 
again and Henry was afraid that they would break through and free the prisoners 
to fight again. In the later Middle Ages, a number of religious wars aimed 
to not only defeat but eliminate their enemies. In Christian Europe, the 
extermination of heretics was considered desirable. Examples include the 
13th century Albigensian Crusade and the Northern Crusades.[8] When asked 
by a Crusader how to distinguish between the Catholics and Cathars once 
they'd taken the city of Béziers, the Papal Legate Arnaud Amalric famously 
replied, "Kill them all, God will know His own".[9] Likewise, the inhabitants 
of conquered cities were frequently massacred during the Crusades against 
the Muslims in the 11th and 12th centuries. Noblemen could hope to be ransomed; 
their families would have to send to their captors large sums of wealth 
commensurate with the social status of the captive. In feudal Japan there 
was no custom of ransoming prisoners of war, who were for the most part 
summarily executed.[10] The expanding Mongol Empire was famous for distinguishing 
between cities or towns that surrendered - where the population were spared 
but required to support the conquering Mongol army - and those that resisted, 
where their city was ransacked and destroyed, and all the population killed. 
In Termez, on the Oxus: "all the people, both men and women, were driven 
out onto the plain, and divided in accordance with their usual custom, 
then they were all slain".[11] The Aztecs were constantly at war with neighbouring 
tribes and groups, with the goal of this constant warfare being to collect 
live prisoners for sacrifice.[12] For the re-consecration of Great Pyramid 
of Tenochtitlan in 1487, "between 10,000 and 80,400 persons" were sacrificed.[13] 
[14] During the early Muslim conquests, Muslims routinely captured large 
number of prisoners. Aside from those who converted, most were ransomed 
or enslaved.[15][16] Christians who were captured during the Crusades, 
were usually either killed or sold into slavery if they could not pay a 
ransom.[17] During his lifetime, Muhammad made it the responsibility of 
the Islamic government to provide food and clothing, on a reasonable basis, 
to captives, regardless of their religion; however if the prisoners were 
in the custody of a person, then the responsibility was on the individual.[18] 
The freeing of prisoners was highly recommended as a charitable act. However, 
there are many cases of Muslim conquerors executing large numbers of civilians 
and prisoners. One of the most notable massacre was after the siege of 
Ani in 1065 where the Seljuk Turks had massacred over 50,000 of its inhabitants. 
There were also many numerous massacres during the Muslim conquest of India 
in which Hindu prisoners were routinely slaughtered by the Muslims. The 
1648 Peace of Westphalia, which ended the Thirty Years' War, established 
the rule that prisoners of war should be released without ransom at the 
end of hostilities and that they should be allowed to return to their homelands.[19] 
There also evolved the right of parole, French for "discourse", in which 
a captured officer surrendered his sword and gave his word as a gentleman 
in exchange for privileges. If he swore not to escape, he could gain better 
accommodations and the freedom of the prison. If he swore to cease hostilities 
against the nation who held him captive, he could be repatriated or exchanged 
but could not serve against his former captors in a military capacity. 
Early historical narratives of captured colonial Europeans, including perspectives 
of literate women captured by the indigenous peoples of North America, 
exist in some number. The writings of Mary Rowlandson, captured in the 
brutal fighting of King Philip's War, are an example. Such narratives enjoyed 
some popularity, spawning a genre of the captivity narrative, and had lasting 
influence on the body of early American literature, most notably through 
the legacy of James Fenimore Cooper's Last of the Mohicans. Some Native 
Americans continued to capture Europeans and use them both as laborers 
and bargaining chips into the 19th century; see for example John R. Jewitt, 
an Englishman who wrote a memoir about his years as a captive of the Nootka 
people on the Pacific northwest coast from 1802–1805. The earliest known 
purposely built prisoner-of-war camp was established at Norman Cross, England 
in 1797 to house the increasing number of prisoners from the French Revolutionary 
Wars and the Napoleonic Wars.[citation needed] The average prison population 
was about 5,500 men. The lowest number recorded was 3,300 in October 1804 
and 6,272 on 10 April 1810 was the highest number of prisoners recorded 
in any official document. Norman Cross was intended to be a model depot 
providing the most humane treatment of prisoners of war. The British government 
went to great lengths to provide food of a quality at least equal to that 
available to locals. The senior officer from each quadrangle was permitted 
to inspect the food as it was delivered to the prison to ensure it was 
of sufficient quality. Despite the generous supply and quality of food, 
some prisoners died of starvation after gambling away their rations. Most 
of the men held in the prison were low-ranking soldiers and sailors, including 
midshipmen and junior officers, with a small number of privateers. About 
100 senior officers and some civilians "of good social standing", mainly 
passengers on captured ships and the wives of some officers, were given 
parole d'honneur outside the prison, mainly in Peterborough although some 
further afield in Northampton, Plymouth, Melrose and Abergavenny. They 
were afforded the courtesy of their rank within English society. The extensive 
period of conflict during the American Revolutionary War and Napoleonic 
Wars (1793–1815), followed by the Anglo-American War of 1812, led to the 
emergence of a cartel system for the exchange of prisoners, even while 
the belligerents were at war. A cartel was usually arranged by the respective 
armed service for the exchange of like-ranked personnel. The aim was to 
achieve a reduction in the number of prisoners held, while at the same 
time alleviating shortages of skilled personnel in the home country. At 
the start of the civil war a system of paroles operated. Captives agreed 
not to fight until they were officially exchanged. Meanwhile, they were 
held in camps run by their own army where they were paid but not allowed 
to perform any military duties.[20] The system of exchanges collapsed in 
1863 when the Confederacy refused to exchange black prisoners. In the late 
summer of 1864, a year after the Dix-Hill Cartel was suspended; Confederate 
officials approached Union General Benjamin Butler, Union Commissioner 
of Exchange, about resuming the cartel and including the black prisoners. 
Butler contacted Grant for guidance on the issue, and Grant responded to 
Butler on August 18, 1864 with his now famous statement. He rejected the 
offer, stating in essence, that the Union could afford to leave their men 
in captivity, the Confederacy could not.[21] After that about 56,000 of 
the 409,000 POWs died in prisons during the American Civil War, accounting 
for nearly 10% of the conflict's fatalities.[22] Of the 45,000 Union prisoners 
of war confined in Camp Sumter, located near Andersonville, Georgia, 13,000 
(28%) died.[23] At Camp Douglas in Chicago, Illinois, 10% of its Confederate 
prisoners died during one cold winter month; and Elmira Prison in New York 
state, with a death rate of 25% (2,963), very nearly equalled that of Andersonville.[24] 
During the 19th century, there were increased efforts to improve the treatment 
and processing of prisoners. As a result of these emerging conventions, 
a number of international conferences were held, starting with the Brussels 
Conference of 1874, with nations agreeing that it was necessary to prevent 
inhumane treatment of prisoners and the use of weapons causing unnecessary 
harm. Although no agreements were immediately ratified by the participating 
nations, work was continued that resulted in new conventions being adopted 
and becoming recognized as international law that specified that prisoners 
of war be treated humanely and diplomatically. Chapter II of the Annex 
to the 1907 Hague Convention IV – The Laws and Customs of War on Land covered 
the treatment of prisoners of war in detail. These provisions were further 
expanded in the 1929 Geneva Convention on the Prisoners of War and were 
largely revised in the Third Geneva Convention in 1949. Article 4 of the 
Third Geneva Convention protects captured military personnel, some guerrilla 
fighters, and certain civilians. It applies from the moment a prisoner 
is captured until he or she is released or repatriated. One of the main 
provisions of the convention makes it illegal to torture prisoners and 
states that a prisoner can only be required to give their name, date of 
birth, rank and service number (if applicable). The ICRC has a special 
role to play, with regards to international humanitarian law, in restoring 
and maintaining family contact in times of war, in particular concerning 
the right of prisoners of war and internees to send and receive letters 
and cards (Geneva Convention (GC) III, art.71 and GC IV, art.107). However, 
nations vary in their dedication to following these laws, and historically 
the treatment of POWs has varied greatly. During World War II, Imperial 
Japan and Nazi Germany (towards Soviet POWs and Western Allied commandos) 
were notorious for atrocities against prisoners of war. The German military 
used the Soviet Union's refusal to sign the Geneva Convention as a reason 
for not providing the necessities of life to Soviet POWs; and the Soviets 
similarly killed Axis prisoners or used them as slave labor. The Germans 
also routinely executed Western Allied commandos captured behind German 
lines per the Commando Order. North Korean and North and South Vietnamese 
forces[25] routinely killed or mistreated prisoners taken during those 
conflicts. To be entitled to prisoner-of-war status, captured persons must 
be lawful combatants entitled to combatant's privilege—which gives them 
immunity from punishment for crimes constituting lawful acts of war such 
as killing enemy combatants. To qualify under the Third Geneva Convention, 
a combatant must be part of a chain of command, wear a "fixed distinctive 
marking, visible from a distance", bear arms openly, and have conducted 
military operations according to the laws and customs of war. (The Convention 
recognizes a few other groups as well, such as "[i]nhabitants of a non-occupied 
territory, who on the approach of the enemy spontaneously take up arms 
to resist the invading forces, without having had time to form themselves 
into regular armed units".) Thus, uniforms and/or badges are important 
in determining prisoner-of-war status; and francs-tireurs, terrorists, 
saboteurs, mercenaries, and spies do not qualify because they do not always 
follow the laws and customs of war and therefore they fall under the category 
of unlawful combatants. In practice, these criteria are rarely interpreted 
strictly. Guerrillas, for example, usually do not wear a uniform or carry 
arms openly, but captured guerrillas are often granted POW status. The 
criteria are applied primarily to international armed conflicts; in civil 
wars, insurgents are often treated as traitors or criminals by government 
forces, and are sometimes executed. However, in the American Civil War, 
both sides treated captured troops as POWs, presumably out of reciprocity, 
although the Union regarded Confederate personnel as separatist rebels. 
However, guerrillas and other irregular combatants generally cannot expect 
to receive benefits from both civilian and military status simultaneously. 
Under the Third Geneva Convention, prisoners of war (POW) must be: In addition, 
if wounded or sick on the battlefield, the prisoner will receive help from 
the International Committee of the Red Cross.[27] When a country is responsible 
for breaches of prisoner of war rights, those accountable will be punished 
accordingly. An example of this is the Nuremberg and Tokyo Trials. German 
and Japanese military commanders were prosecuted for preparing and initiating 
a war of aggression, murder, ill treatment, and deportation of individuals, 
and genocide during World War II.[28] Most were executed or sentenced to 
life in prison for their crimes. The United States Military Code of Conduct 
was promulgated in 1955 via Executive Order 10631 under President Dwight 
D. Eisenhower to serve as a moral code for United States service members 
who have been taken prisoner. It was created primarily in response to the 
breakdown of leadership and organization, specifically when U.S. forces 
were POWs during the Korean War. When a military member is taken prisoner, 
the Code of Conduct reminds them that the chain of command is still in 
effect (the highest ranking service member eligible for command, regardless 
of service branch, is in command), and requires them to support their leadership. 
The Code of Conduct also requires service members to resist giving information 
to the enemy (beyond identifying themselves, that is, "name, rank, serial 
number"), receiving special favors or parole, or otherwise providing their 
enemy captors aid and comfort. Since the Vietnam War, the official U.S. 
military term for enemy POWs is EPW (Enemy Prisoner of War). This name 
change was introduced in order to distinguish between enemy and U.S. captives.[29][30] 
In 2000, the U.S. military replaced the designation "Prisoner of War" for 
captured American personnel with "Missing-Captured". A January 2008 directive 
states that the reasoning behind this is since "Prisoner of War" is the 
international legal recognized status for such people there is no need 
for any individual country to follow suit. This change remains relatively 
unknown even among experts in the field and "Prisoner of War" remains widely 
used in the Pentagon which has a "POW/Missing Personnel Office" and awards 
the Prisoner of War Medal.[1][31] During World War I, about eight million 
men surrendered and were held in POW camps until the war ended. All nations 
pledged to follow the Hague rules on fair treatment of prisoners of war, 
and in general the POWs had a much higher survival rate than their peers 
who were not captured.[32] Individual surrenders were uncommon; usually 
a large unit surrendered all its men. At Tannenberg 92,000 Russians surrendered 
during the battle. When the besieged garrison of Kaunas surrendered in 
1915, 20,000 Russians became prisoners. Over half the Russian losses were 
prisoners as a proportion of those captured, wounded or killed. About 3.3 
million men became prisoners.[33] The German Empire held 2.5 million prisoners; 
Russia held 2.9 million, and Britain and France held about 720,000, mostly 
gained in the period just before the Armistice in 1918. The US held 48,000. 
The most dangerous moment for POW's was the act of surrender, when helpless 
soldiers were sometimes and mistakenly shot down. Once prisoners reached 
a POW camp conditions were better (and often much better than in World 
War II), thanks in part to the efforts of the International Red Cross and 
inspections by neutral nations. There was however much harsh treatment 
of POWs in Germany, as recorded by the American ambassador to Germany (prior 
to America's entry into the war), James W. Gerard, who published his findings 
in "My Four Years in Germany". Even worse conditions are reported in the 
book "Escape of a Princess Pat" by the Canadian George Pearson. It was 
particularly bad in Russia, where starvation was common for prisoners and 
civilians alike; a quarter of the over 2 million POWs held there died.[34] 
Nearly 375,000 of the 500,000 Austro-Hungarian prisoners of war taken by 
Russians perished in Siberia from smallpox and typhus.[35] In Germany food 
was short but only 5% died.[36] The Ottoman Empire often treated prisoners 
of war poorly. Some 11,800 British soldiers, most of them Indians, became 
prisoners after the five-month Siege of Kut, in Mesopotamia, in April 1916. 
Many were weak and starved when they surrendered and 4,250 died in captivity.[37] 
During the Sinai and Palestine campaign 217 Australian and unknown numbers 
of British, New Zealand and Indian soldiers were captured by Ottoman Empire 
forces. About 50% of the Australian prisoners were light horsemen including 
48 missing believed captured on 1 May 1918 in the Jordan Valley. Australian 
Flying Corps pilots and observers were captured in the Sinai Peninsula, 
Palestine and the Levant. One third of all Australian prisoners were captured 
on Gallipoli including the crew of the submarine AE2 which made a passage 
through the Dardanelles in 1915. Forced marches and crowded railway journeys 
preceded years in camps where disease, poor diet and inadequate medical 
facilities prevailed. About 25% of other ranks died, many from malnutrition, 
while only one officer died.[38][39] The most curious case came in Russia 
where the Czechoslovak Legion of Czechoslovak prisoners (from the Austro-Hungarian 
army): they were released in 1917, armed themselves, briefly culminating 
into a military and diplomatic force during the Russian Civil War. At the 
end of the war in 1918 there were believed to be 140,000 British prisoners 
of war in Germany, including 3,000[citation needed] internees held in neutral 
Switzerland. The first British prisoners were released and reached Calais 
on 15 November. Plans were made for them to be sent via Dunkirk to Dover 
and a large reception camp was established at Dover capable of housing 
40,000 men, which could later be used for demobilisation. On 13 December 
1918, the armistice was extended and the Allies reported that by 9 December 
264,000 prisoners had been repatriated. A very large number of these had 
been released en masse and sent across Allied lines without any food or 
shelter. This created difficulties for the receiving Allies and many released 
prisoners died from exhaustion. The released POWs were met by cavalry troops 
and sent back through the lines in lorries to reception centres where they 
were refitted with boots and clothing and dispatched to the ports in trains. 
Upon arrival at the receiving camp the POWs were registered and "boarded" 
before being dispatched to their own homes. All commissioned officers had 
to write a report on the circumstances of their capture and to ensure that 
they had done all they could to avoid capture. Each returning officer and 
man was given a message from King George V, written in his own hand and 
reproduced on a lithograph. It read as follows:[40] The Queen joins me 
in welcoming you on your release from the miseries & hardships, which you 
have endured with so much patience and courage. During these many months 
of trial, the early rescue of our gallant Officers & Men from the cruelties 
of their captivity has been uppermost in our thoughts. We are thankful 
that this longed for day has arrived, & that back in the old Country you 
will be able once more to enjoy the happiness of a home & to see good days 
among those who anxiously look for your return. George R.I. While the Allied 
prisoners were sent home at the end of the war, the same treatment was 
not granted to Central Powers prisoners of the Allies and Russia, many 
of which had to serve as forced labour, e.g. in France, until 1920. They 
were released after many approaches by the ICRC to the Allied Supreme Council.[41] 
Historian Niall Ferguson, in addition to figures from Keith Lowe, tabulated 
the total death rate for POWs in World War II as follows:[42][43] The Empire 
of Japan, which had signed but never ratified the 1929 Geneva Convention 
on Prisoners of War,[44] did not treat prisoners of war in accordance with 
international agreements, including provisions of the Hague Conventions, 
either during the Second Sino-Japanese War or during the Pacific War because 
the Japanese viewed surrender as dishonorable. Moreover, according to a 
directive ratified on 5 August 1937 by Hirohito, the constraints of the 
Hague Conventions were explicitly removed on Chinese prisoners.[45] Prisoners 
of war from China, the United States, Australia, Britain, Canada, India, 
the Netherlands, New Zealand, and the Philippines held by the Japanese 
armed forces were subject to murder, beatings, summary punishment, brutal 
treatment, forced labour, medical experimentation, starvation rations, 
poor medical treatment and cannibalism.[46] The most notorious use of forced 
labour was in the construction of the Burma–Thailand Death Railway. After 
20 March 1943, the Imperial Navy was under orders to execute all prisoners 
taken at sea.[47] According to the findings of the Tokyo Tribunal, the 
death rate of Western prisoners was 27.1%, seven times that of POWs under 
the Germans and Italians.[48] The death rate of Chinese was much higher. 
Thus, while 37,583 prisoners from the United Kingdom, Commonwealth, and 
Dominions, 28,500 from the Netherlands, and 14,473 from the United States 
were released after the surrender of Japan, the number for the Chinese 
was only 56.[49] Of the 27,465 United States Army and United States Army 
Air Forces POWs in the Pacific Theater, they had a 40.4% death rate.[50] 
The War Ministry in Tokyo issued an order at the end of the war to kill 
all surviving POWs.[51] No direct access to the POWs was provided to the 
International Red Cross. Escapes among Caucasian prisoners were almost 
impossible because of the difficulty of men of Caucasian descent hiding 
in Asiatic societies.[52] Allied POW camps and ship-transports were sometimes 
accidental targets of Allied attacks. The number of deaths which occurred 
when Japanese "hell ships"—unmarked transport ships in which POWs were 
transported in harsh conditions—were attacked by US Navy submarines was 
particularly high. Gavan Daws has calculated that "of all POWs who died 
in the Pacific War, one in three was killed on the water by friendly fire".[53] 
Daves states that 10,800 of the 50,000 POWs shipped by the Japanese were 
killed at sea[54] while Donald L. Miller states that "approximately 21,000 
Allied POWs died at sea, about 19,000 of them killed by friendly fire."[55] 
Life in the POW camps was recorded at great risk to themselves by artists 
such as Jack Bridger Chalker, Philip Meninsky, Ashley George Old, and Ronald 
Searle. Human hair was often used for brushes, plant juices and blood for 
paint, and toilet paper as the "canvas". Some of their works were used 
as evidence in the trials of Japanese war criminals. Research into the 
conditions of the camps has been conducted by The Liverpool School of Tropical 
Medicine.[56] Troops of the Suffolk Regiment surrendering to the Japanese,

in summer 1940, Germany seized two million French prisoners of war and 
sent them to camps in Germany. About one third were released on various 
terms. Of the remainder, the officers and non-commissioned officers were 
kept in camps and did not work. The privates were sent out to work. About 
half of them worked for German agriculture, where food supplies were adequate 
and controls were lenient. The others worked in factories or mines, where 
conditions were much harsher.[57] Germany and Italy generally treated prisoners 
from the British Commonwealth, France, the USA, and other western Allies 
in accordance with the Geneva Convention, which had been signed by these 
countries.[58] Consequently, western Allied officers were not usually made 
to work and some personnel of lower rank were usually compensated, or not 
required to work either. The main complaints of western Allied prisoners 
of war in German POW camps—especially during the last two years of the 
war—concerned shortages of food. Only a small proportion of western Allied 
POWs who were Jews—or whom the Nazis believed to be Jewish—were killed 
as part of the Holocaust or were subjected to other antisemitic policies.[dubious 
– discuss][citation needed] For example, Major Yitzhak Ben-Aharon, a Palestinian 
Jew who had enlisted in the British Army, and who was captured by the Germans 
in Greece in 1941, experienced four years of captivity under entirely normal 
conditions for POWs.[59] However, a small number of Allied personnel were 
sent to concentration camps, for a variety of reasons including being Jewish.[60] 
As the US historian Joseph Robert White put it: "An important exception 
... is the sub-camp for U.S. POWs at Berga an der Elster, officially called 
Arbeitskommando 625 [also known as Stalag IX-B]. Berga was the deadliest 
work detachment for American captives in Germany. 73 men who participated, 
or 21 percent of the detachment, perished in two months. 80 of the 350 
POWs were Jews."[citation needed] Another well-known example was a group 
of 168 Australian, British, Canadian, New Zealand and US aviators who were 
held for two months at Buchenwald concentration camp;[61] two of the POWs 
died at Buchenwald. Two possible reasons have been suggested for this incident: 
German authorities wanted to make an example of Terrorflieger ("terrorist 
aviators") and/or these aircrews were classified as spies, because they 
had been disguised as civilians or enemy soldiers when they were apprehended. 
Information on conditions in the stalags is contradictory depending on 
the source. Some American POWs claimed the Germans were victims of circumstance 
and did the best they could, while others accused their captors of brutalities 
and forced labor. In any case, the prison camps were miserable places where 
food rations were meager and conditions squalid. One American admitted 
"The only difference between the stalags and concentration camps was that 
we weren't gassed or shot in the former. I do not recall a single act of 
compassion or mercy on the part of the Germans." Typical meals consisted 
of a bread slice and watery potato soup, which however was still more substantial 
than what Soviet POWs or concentration camp inmates received. Another prisoner 
stated that "The German plan was to keep us alive, yet weakened enough 
that we wouldn't attempt escape."[62] As Soviet ground forces approached 
some POW camps in early 1945, German guards forced western Allied POWs 
to walk long distances towards central Germany, often in extreme winter 
weather conditions.[citation needed] It is estimated that, out of 257,000 
POWs, about 80,000 were subject to such marches and up to 3,500 of them 
died as a result.[citation needed] In September 1943, Italian officers 
and men were arrested and taken to German internment camps in Germany or 
Eastern Europe, where they were held for the duration of WW2. The International 
Red Cross could do nothing for them, as they were not regarded as POW's, 
but the prisoners held the status of "Military Internees". Treatment of 
the prisoners was generally poor. The author Giovannino Guareschi was among 
those interned and wrote about this time in his life. The book was translated 
and published as "My Secret Diary". He wrote about the hungers of semi-starvation, 
the casual murder of individual prisoners by guards and how when they were 
released (now in a German camp) they found a deserted German town, filled 
with foodstuffs that they (with other released prisoners) ate.[citation 
needed]. It is estimated that of the 1,070,000 Italians taken prisoner 
by the Germans, around 40,000 died in detention and more than 13,000 lost 
their lives during the transportation from the Greek islands to the mainland.[63] 
Germany did not apply the same standard of treatment to non-western prisoners, 
especially many Polish and Soviet POWs who suffered harsh conditions and 
died in large numbers while in captivity. Between 1941 and 1945, the Axis 
powers took about 5.7 million Soviet prisoners. About one million of them 
were released during the war, in that their status changed but they remained 
under German authority. A little over 500,000 either escaped or were liberated 
by the Red Army. Some 930,000 more were found alive in camps after the 
war. The remaining 3.3 million prisoners (57.5% of the total captured) 
died during their captivity.[65] Between the launching of Operation Barbarossa 
in the summer of 1941 and the following spring, 2.8 million of the 3.2 
million Soviet prisoners taken died while in German hands.[66] According 
to Russian military historian General Grigoriy Krivosheyev, 4.6 million 
Soviet prisoners were taken by the Axis powers, of which 1.8 million were 
found alive in camps after the war and 318,770 were released by the Axis 
during the war and were then drafted into the Soviet armed forces again.[67] 
By comparison, 8,348 Western Allied prisoners died in German camps during 
1939–45 (3.5% of the 232,000 total).[68] An official justification used 
by the Germans for this policy was that the Soviet Union had not signed 
the Geneva Convention. This was not legally justifiable, however, as under 
article 82 of the Geneva Convention, signatory countries had to give POWs 
of all signatory and non-signatory countries the rights assigned by the 
convention.[69] Shortly after the German invasion in 1941, an offer was 
made by the USSR for a reciprocal adherence to the Hague Conventions. This 
'note' was left unanswered by Third Reich officials.[70][71] In contrast, 
Tolstoy discusses that the German Government as well as the International 
Red Cross made several efforts to regulate reciprocal treatment of prisoners 
until early 1942, but received no answers from the Soviet side.[72] Further, 
the Soviets took a harsh position towards captured Soviet soldiers as they 
expected each soldier to fight to the death and automatically excluded 
any prisoner from the "Russian community".[73] Some Soviet POWs and forced 
labourers transported to Nazi Germany were, on their return to the USSR, 
treated as traitors and sent to gulag prison camps. According to some sources, 
the Soviets captured 3.5 million Axis servicemen (excluding Japanese) of 
which more than a million died.[74] One specific example is that of the 
German POWs after the Battle of Stalingrad, where the Soviets captured 
91,000 German troops in total (completely exhausted, starving and sick) 
of whom only 5,000 survived the captivity. German soldiers were kept as 
forced labour for many years after the war. The last German POWs like Erich 
Hartmann, the highest-scoring fighter ace in the history of aerial warfare, 
who had been declared guilty of war crimes but without due process, were 
not released by the Soviets until 1955, three years after Stalin died.[75] 
As a result of the Soviet invasion of Poland in 1939, hundreds of thousands 
of Polish soldiers became prisoners of war in the Soviet Union. Thousands 
of them were executed; over 20,000 Polish military personnel and civilians 
perished in the Katyn massacre.[76] Out of Anders' 80,000 evacuees from 
Soviet Union gathered in the United Kingdom only 310 volunteered to return 
to Poland in 1947.[77] Out of the 230,000 Polish prisoners of war taken 
by the Soviet army, only 82,000 survived.[78] With the Soviet invasion 
of Manchuria, in 1945, Japanese soldiers became prisoners in the Soviet 
Union, where they, just as other Axis POWs, had to work. There were stories 
during the Cold War to the effect that 23,000 Americans who had been held 
in German POW camps were seized by the Soviets and never repatriated. This 
myth had been perpetuated after the release of people like John H. Noble. 
Careful scholarly studies have demonstrated this is a myth based on a misinterpretation 
of a telegram that was talking about Soviet prisoners held in Italy.[79] 
During the war, the armies of Western Allied nations such as the US, UK, 
Canada, and Australia[80] were ordered to treat Axis prisoners strictly 
in accordance with the Geneva Convention.[81] Some breaches of the Convention 
took place, however. According to Stephen E. Ambrose, of the roughly 1,000 
US combat veterans that he had interviewed, only one admitted to shooting 
a prisoner, saying that he "felt remorse, but would do it again". However, 
one-third told him they had seen US troops kill German prisoners.[82] Towards 
the end of the war in Europe, as large numbers of Axis soldiers surrendered, 
the US created the designation of Disarmed Enemy Forces (DEF) so as not 
to treat prisoners as POWs. A lot of these soldiers were kept in open fields 
in makeshift camps in the Rhine valley (Rheinwiesenlager). Controversy 
has arisen about how Eisenhower managed these prisoners[83] (see Other 
Losses). After the surrender of Germany in May 1945, the POW status of 
the German prisoners was in many cases maintained, and they were for several 
years used as forced labour in countries such as the UK and France. Many 
died when forced to clear minefields in Norway, France etc.; "by September 
1945 it was estimated by the French authorities that two thousand prisoners 
were being maimed and killed each month in accidents"[84][85] In 1946, 
the UK had more than 400,000 German prisoners, many had been transferred 
from POW camps in the US and Canada. Many of these were for over three 
years after the German surrender used as forced labour, as a form of "reparations".[86][87] 
A public debate ensued in the UK, where words such as "forced labour", 
"slaves", "slave labour" were increasingly used in the media and in the 
House of Commons.[88] In 1947 the Ministry of Agriculture argued against 
repatriation of working German prisoners, since by then they made up 25 
percent of the land workforce, and they wanted to use them also in 1948.[88] 
The "London Cage", an MI19 prisoner of war facility in the UK used for 
interrogating prisoners before they were sent to prison camps during and 
immediately after World War II, was subject to allegations of torture.[89] 
After the German surrender, the International Red Cross was prohibited 
from providing aid such as food or visiting prisoner camps in Germany. 
However, after making approaches to the Allies in the autumn of 1945 it 
was allowed to investigate the camps in the British and French occupation 
zones of Germany, as well as to provide relief to the prisoners held there.[90] 
On 4 February 1946, the Red Cross was permitted to visit and assist prisoners 
also in the US occupation zone of Germany, although only with very small 
quantities of food. "During their visits, the delegates observed that German 
prisoners of war were often detained in appalling conditions. They drew 
the attention of the authorities to this fact, and gradually succeeded 
in getting some improvements made".[90] The Allies also shipped POWs between 
them, with for example 6,000 German officers transferred from Western Allied 
camps to the Sachsenhausen concentration camp that now was under Soviet 
Union administration.[91] The US also shipped 740,000 German POWs as forced 
labourers to France from where newspaper reports told of very bad treatment. 
Judge Robert H. Jackson, Chief US prosecutor in the Nuremberg trials, in 
October 1945 told US President Harry S. Truman that the Allies themselves: 
have done or are doing some of the very things we are prosecuting the Germans 
for. The French are so violating the Geneva Convention in the treatment 
of prisoners of war that our command is taking back prisoners sent to them. 
We are prosecuting plunder and our Allies are practicing it.[92][93] Hungarians 
became POWs of the Western Allies. Some of these were, like Germans, used 
as forced labour in France after the cessation of hostilities.[94] After 
the war the POWs were handed over to the Soviets, and after the POWs were 
transported to the USSR for forced labor. It is called even today in Hungary 
malenkij robot - little work. The last surviving member of these victims 
was András Toma, a Hungarian soldier who was taken prisoner by the Red 
Army in 1944, then discovered living in a Russian psychiatric hospital 
in 2000. He was probably the last prisoner of war from the Second World 
War to be repatriated.[1] The case was covered in 137 countries. As he 
knew no Russian and nobody at the hospital spoke Hungarian, he had apparently 
not had a single conversation in over 50 years, a situation of great interest 
in the fields of psychiatry and psycholinguistics. Although thousands of 
Japanese were taken prisoner, most fought until they were killed or committed 
suicide. Of the 22,000 Japanese soldiers present at the beginning of the 
Battle of Iwo Jima, over 20,000 were killed and only 216 were taken prisoner.[95] 
Of the 30,000 Japanese troops that defended Saipan, fewer than 1,000 remained 
alive at battle's end.[96] Japanese prisoners sent to camps fared well; 
however, some Japanese were killed when trying to surrender or were massacred[97] 
just after they had surrendered (see Allied war crimes during World War 
II in the Pacific). In some instances, Japanese prisoners were tortured 
by a variety of methods.[98] A method of torture used by the Chinese National 
Revolutionary Army (NRA) included suspending the prisoner by the neck in 
a wooden cage until they died.[98][99] In very rare cases, some were beheaded 
by sword, and a severed head was once used as a soccer ball by Chinese 
National Revolutionary Army (NRA) soldiers.[98][100] After the war, many 
Japanese were kept on as Japanese Surrendered Personnel until mid-1947 
and used as forced labour doing menial tasks, while 35,000 were kept on 
in arms within their wartime military organisation and under their own 
officers and used in combat alongside British troops seeking to suppress 
the independence movements in the Dutch East Indies and French Indochina. 
In 1943, Italy overthrew Mussolini and became a co-belligerent with the 
Allies. This did not mean any change in status for Italian POWs however, 
since due to the labour shortages in the UK and the USA, they were retained 
as POWs there.[101] On 11 February 1945, at the conclusion of the Yalta 
Conference, the United States and the United Kingdom signed a Repatriation 
Agreement with the USSR.[102] The interpretation of this Agreement resulted 
in the forcible repatriation of all Soviets (Operation Keelhaul) regardless 
of their wishes. The forced repatriation operations took place in 1945–1947.[103] 
The United States handed over 740,000 German prisoners to France, a signatory 
of the Geneva Convention. The Soviet Union had not signed the Geneva Convention. 
According to Edward Peterson, the U.S. chose to hand over several hundred 
thousand German prisoners to the Soviet Union in May 1945 as a "gesture 
of friendship".[104] U.S. forces also refused to accept the surrender of 
German troops attempting to surrender to them in Saxony and Bohemia, and 
handed them over to the Soviet Union instead.[105] It is also known that 
6000 of the German officers who were sent from camps in the West to the 
Soviets were subsequently imprisoned in the Sachsenhausen concentration 
camp, which at the time was one of the NKVD special camp.[106][107] During 
the Korean War, the North Koreans developed reputation for severely mistreating 
prisoners of war (see Crimes against POWs). Their POWs were housed in three 
camps, according to their potential usefulness to the North Korean army. 
Peace camps and reform camps were for POWs that were either sympathetic 
to the cause or who had valued skills that could be useful in the army 
and thus these enemy soldiers were indoctrinated and sometimes conscripted 
into the North Korean army. The regular prisoners of war were usually very 
poorly treated. POWs in peace camps were reportedly treated with more consideration.[108] 
In 1952, the 1952 Inter-Camp P.O.W. Olympics were held during 15 and 27 
November 1952, in Pyuktong, North Korea. The Chinese hoped to gain worldwide 
publicity and while some prisoners refused to participate some 500 P.O.W.s 
of eleven nationalities took part.[109] They were representative of all 
the prison camps in North Korea and competed in: football, baseball, softball, 
basketball, volleyball, track and field, soccer, gymnastics, and boxing.[109] 
For the P.O.W.s this was also an opportunity to meet with friends from 
other camps. The prisoners had their own photographers, announcers, even 
reporters, who after each day's competition published a newspaper, the 
"Olympic Roundup".[110] Of about 16,500 French soldiers who fought at the 
Battle of Dien Bien Phu in French Indochina, more than 3,000 were killed 
in battle, while almost all of the 11,721 men taken prisoner died in the 
hands of the Viet Minh on death marches to distant POW camps, and in those 
camps in the last three months of the war.[111] The Vietcong and North 
Vietnamese captured many United States service members as prisoners of 
war during the Vietnam War, who suffered from mistreatment and torture 
during the war. Some American prisoners were held in the prison called 
the Hanoi Hilton. Communist Vietnamese held in custody by South Vietnamese 
and American forces were also tortured and badly treated.[25] After the 
war, millions of South Vietnamese servicemen and government workers were 
sent to "re-education" camps where many perished. Like in previous conflicts, 
there has been speculation without evidence that there were a handful of 
American pilots captured by the North Koreans and the North Vietnamese 
who were transferred to the Soviet Union and were never repatriated.[112][113][114] 
Regardless of regulations determining treatment to prisoners, violations 
of their rights continue to be reported. Many cases of POW massacres have 
been reported in recent times, including October 13 massacre in Lebanon 
by Syrian forces and June 1990 massacre in Sri Lanka. In 1991, during the 
Persian Gulf War, American, British, Italian, and Kuwaiti POWs (mostly 
crew members of downed aircraft and special forces) were tortured by the 
Iraqi secret police. An American military doctor, Major Rhonda Cornum, 
a 37-year-old flight surgeon captured when her Blackhawk UH-60 was shot 
down, was also subjected to sexual abuse.[115] During the 1990s Yugoslav 
Wars, Serb paramilitary forces supported by JNA forces killed POWs at Vukovar 
and Škarbrnja while Bosnian Serb forces killed POWs at Srebrenica. In 2001, 
there were reports concerning two prisoners that India had taken during 
the Sino-Indian War, Yang Chen and Shih Liang. The two were imprisoned 
as spies for three years before being interned in a mental asylum in Ranchi, 
where they spent the next 38 years under a special prisoner status.[116] 
The last prisoners of Iran–Iraq War (1980–1988) were exchanged in 2003.[117] 
This is a list of nations with the highest number of POWs since the start 
of World War II, listed in descending order. These are also the highest 
numbers in any war since the Convention Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners 
of War entered into force on 19 June 1931. The USSR had not signed the 
Geneva convention.[118] [119] Movies & Television Songs Notes Bibliography
