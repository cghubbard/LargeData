The Takahashi Unions (高橋ユニオンズ, Takahashi Yunionzu?) were a Japanese team 
in Nippon Professional Baseball. A Pacific League expansion team in 1954, 
they were brought into the league to increase the number of teams to eight. 
The team was stocked with players from the other Pacific League teams, 
including aging pitcher Victor Starffin. In their three years of existence 
the team finished in the second division every season. The Unions played 
their games at Kawasaki Stadium in Kawasaki, Kanagawa. The Pacific League 
had seven teams since the Japan Baseball League split into the Central 
and the Pacific League, but having an odd number of teams was inconvenient 
for scheduling and playoffs. Therefore, in 1953 it was decided that any 
team which finished below a winning percentage of .350 would be disbanded. 
However, all the teams finished above the mark (Kintetsu had the worst 
record at .410) — therefore the league decided to admit an eighth team, 
the Unions. The Unions were owned by Ryutaro Takahashi, the former president 
of Dai-Nippon Beer and owner of the Eagles Baseball Club/Kurowashi Black 
Eagles from 1939 to 1941. Takahashi had originally wanted to name the Unions 
the "Takahashi Eagles" after himself and a beer that had been produced 
by Dai-Nippon. However, the teams's name ended up being chosen by a public 
vote.[citation needed] The team became the Tombo Unions after Tombow Pencil 
bought a share of the team in 1955, but reverted to its original name after 
Tombow withdrew before the following year. Starffin pitched for the team 
in 1954–1955, going a combined 15-34, but managing to notch his 300th career 
win with the team. The Unions, now in financial trouble, only lasted one 
more year before they merged with the Daiei Stars on February 26, 1957,
