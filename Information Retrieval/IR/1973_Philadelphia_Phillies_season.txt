The 1973 Philadelphia Phillies season was the 91st season in the history 
of the franchise. The team, managed by Danny Ozark, played their third 
season at Veterans Stadium and finished last in the National League East, 
11 1‚ÅÑ2 games behind the Mets. Steve Carlton, the highest paid pitcher in 
the game at $165,000, never recovered from a spring training illness and 
went 13-20. Pitchers Jim Lonborg and Ken Brett, both obtained in a trade 
with the Milwaukee Brewers, won 13 games each, as did Wayne Twitchell, 
whose 2.50 ERA was third in the league. Left fielder Greg Luzinski led 
the team with 29 home runs, 97 RBIs, and 76 runs, and hit .285. In his 
rookie season, Mike Schmidt hit just .196 and struck out 136 times in 367 
at-bats. Infielders Coaches Note: Pos = Position; G = Games played; AB
