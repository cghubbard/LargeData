in Major League Baseball who played with the New York Giants over parts 
of eight seasons spanning 1937–1944. Listed at 6' 5", 203 lb., Melton batted 
and threw left-handed. A native of Brevard, North Carolina, he had two 
different nicknames: Mickey Mouse and Mountain Music. Melton enjoyed his 
best year in his rookie season of 1937, when he had a record of 20-9 with 
a 2.61 earned run average and topped the National League with seven saves, 
helping the Giants won the NL pennant before losing to the New York Yankees

Pirates. The second time was not until April 23, 2013, when B. J. Upton
