WNYA is the MyNetworkTV-affiliated television station for the Capital District 
of New York State and Western New England. Licensed to Pittsfield, Massachusetts, 
it broadcasts a high definition digital signal on VHF channel 13 (or virtual 
channel 51.1 via PSIP) from a transmitter on the Helderberg Escarpment 
west of New Salem, New York (a hamlet of New Scotland). Owned by Hubbard 
Broadcasting, the station is sister to NBC affiliate WNYT and the two television 
outlets share studios on North Pearl Street, along NY 32/Wolfert Avenue, 
in Menands (with an Albany postal address). Syndicated programming on WNYA 
includes Family Feud, The Wendy Williams Show and among others. What today 
is WNYA can indirectly trace its history to WVUW, an un-built station on 
channel 51 in Pittsfield. WVUW was granted a construction permit in 1984,[1] 
but was deleted by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in 1990.[2] 
In October 1996, Pappas Telecasting applied for a new permit for this allocation;[3] 
however, in 2001, the FCC placed the channel up for auction.[4] In addition 
to Pappas, which by then planned to use the station as an Azteca Am√©rica 
affiliate, bidders included Hubbard Broadcasting, Equity Broadcasting, 
the Trinity Broadcasting Network, and Venture Technologies Group.[4] When 
the auction took place in February 2002, Venture Technologies ended up 
with the winning bid for $1.3 million.[5] The FCC granted the construction 
permit[6] and the WNYA call sign to Venture a year later.[7] To accommodate 
the new WNYA, WNYT moved its Adams translator, which had broadcast on channel 
51 since 1984,[8] to channel 38.[9] In February 2003, Venture Technologies 
signed a joint sales agreement (JSA) with Freedom Communications, then-owner 
of CBS affiliate WRGB (channel 6); this allowed WNYA to operate from WRGB's 
studios in Niskayuna. Soon afterward, WNYA secured an affiliation with 
UPN, replacing "WEDG-TV," a cable-only station operated as a partnership 
of WXXA-TV (channel 23) and Time Warner Cable.[10] On May 22, 2003, Venture 
purchased WVBX-LP (channel 39) in Easton from Vision 3 Broadcasting,[11] 
a station that a year earlier had been granted a construction permit to 
upgrade to class A service and move to channel 15 from a transmitter in 
the Helderberg Mountains in New Scotland, in effect moving WVBX to Albany.[12] 
Venture took channel 39 off-the-air that June,[13] built the channel 15 
facility, gave it the call letters WNYA-CA on June 30, 2003,[14] and announced 
that the station would serve as a WNYA repeater;[15] this created the unusual 
circumstance of a repeater station older than its parent station, as WVBX 
had signed on in 1997 as part of a network of low-power stations based 
at WVBG-LP (channel 25) in Albany,[16] which itself served as the Capital 
District's UPN affiliate from 1998 until the launch of "WEDG-TV" in 2000.[17][18] 
On September 1, 2003, WNYA launched using the branding "UPN Capital Region."[15] 
The main signal, WNYA, had an analog transmitter northwest of Pittsfield 
on Berry Mountain. It became the first full-powered, over-the-air UPN affiliate 
in the Capital District. In addition to UPN programming, WNYA occasionally 
carried CBS programming preempted by WRGB, including US Open telecasts 
that conflicted with WRGB's broadcast of the Jerry Lewis MDA Labor Day 
Telethon.[15] From its sign-on, WNYA took the cable channel position of 
"WEDG-TV" on Time Warner,[15] Charter, and independent Mid-Hudson Cablevision 
(in Greene County, New York). Adelphia would replace WSBK-TV with WNYA 
at the start of 2004, with DirecTV and Dish Network adding the station 
later that year. On January 24, 2006, The WB and UPN announced that they 
would end broadcasting and merge to form a new network, The CW; the new 
network immediately named WEWB-TV (channel 45, now WCWN) its Capital District 
affiliate after then-owner Tribune Broadcasting signed a ten-year affiliation 
deal with the new network on most of its WB stations.[19] On February 22, 
News Corporation announced that it would start up another new broadcast 
television network called MyNetworkTV; on March 9, it was announced that 
WNYA would join this network.[20] After having not branded with a channel 
number during its UPN affiliation, the station chose to call itself "My 
TV 4 Albany" after its channel position on Time Warner Cable systems. Ironically, 
nowhere in Berkshire County, Massachusetts is WNYA currently on channel 
4; in North Adams, that channel is the spot where Boston's CBS affiliate 
WBZ-TV is located. After MyNetworkTV's launch on September 5, 2006, WNYA 
aired the last two weeks of UPN programming from 1 to 3 in the morning 
from Tuesday to Saturday. A few months after the affiliation change, on 
December 5, 2006, Freedom Communications purchased WCWN from Tribune, in 
effect giving it control over three stations in the Capital District.[21] 
In February 2007, the joint sales agreement with WRGB was terminated,[22] 
and WNYA moved to a facility in Rotterdam that formerly housed WMHT-FM-TV.[23] 
In December 2007, WNYA reached an agreement to carry the New York Yankees' 
over-the-air television package, which had previously been carried on WXXA-TV.[24] 
The station hired Dan Murphy, a former WTEN (channel 10) sports anchor 
and WOFX (980 AM) host, to host a local pregame show for Yankee telecasts 
and other local sports broadcasts.[23] Yankee broadcasts remained on WNYA 
through the 2012 season, after which they migrated to WCWN and WRGB.[25] 
On April 18, 2008, WNYA launched its high definition channel on Time Warner 
Cable in Albany, even though it was not able to transmit digitally until 
2009. This coincided with the first Yankee baseball broadcast it had the 
rights to. WNYA switched to digital broadcasting as part of the transition 
on June 12, 2009. The Albany repeater, WNYA-CA, has a construction permit 
to perform a "flash-cut" to a low-power digital signal; due to its Class 
A status, it is not mandated to make the transition until 2015. Around 
April 20, 2011, WNYA launched its first digital subchannel in the form 
of Tribune Broadcasting's Antenna TV over Channel 51.2. The new subchannel 
also began to be simulcast on WNYA-CA in place of WNYA's main programming.[26] 
On February 25, 2013, Hubbard Broadcasting announced that it would purchase 
WNYA to form a duopoly with its local NBC affiliate WNYT, for $2.3 million, 
pending FCC approval. As the Capital Region does not have enough full-power 
stations to legally permit a duopoly, Hubbard sought a failed station waiver 
to acquire the station;[27][28] an avenue that rival CBS affiliate WRGB 
had used in purchasing CW affiliate WCWN in 2006.[29] Venture had put WNYA 
up for sale in 2009, but no other potential buyers came forward.[30] The 
sale did not include class-A station WNYA-CA, which remained with Venture 
Technologies.[31] Under a clause of the sale of WNYA that required WNYA-CA 
to use a new call sign that does not feature the letters "N" or "Y,"[28] 
that station became WEPT-CA on March 8, 2013.[14] On May 29, 2013, the 
FCC approved the sale of WNYA to Hubbard, with Venture retaining ownership 
of WEPT-CA.[32][33] The sale was consummated on July 15.[34] WEPT-CA dropped 
its simulcast of WNYA-DT2 and switched to AMGTV in September 2013, ending 
its association with WNYA.[35] The station's digital signal is multiplexed: 
WNYA shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 51, on June 12, 2009, 
the official date in which full-power television stations in the United 
States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. 
The station "flash-cut" its digital signal into operation VHF channel 13.[37] 
Through the use of PSIP, digital television receivers display the station's 
virtual channel as its former UHF analog channel 51. On April 17, 2006, 
WRGB began producing an hour-long 7 a.m. newscast on WNYA.[38] The newscast 
moved to WCWN shortly after Freedom's purchase of that station.[21] With 
Hubbard's acquisition of WNYA, the company indicated that it would eventually 
produce newscasts on the station with an increased emphasis on news from 
Berkshire County.[30] WNYT once operated a Berkshire County bureau in Pittsfield 
but closed it following the 2008 recession.[39] The newscast premiered 
September 16, 2013 with the title NewsChannel 13 Live at 10 on My 4 Albany.[40] 
The show airs weeknights for a half hour in a fast-paced format and includes 
a "Berkshire Moment" segment featuring western Massachusetts headlines 
powered by The Berkshire Eagle.[41] It competes with the firmly established 
sixty-minute broadcast seen every night on WXXA (produced by WTEN) and 
another thirty-minute news show on WCWN (a weeknight-only production by 
WRGB). WNYA is carried on the following cable and satellite systems within 
the Albany/Schenectady/Troy market: WNYA-DT2 (Antenna TV) is available
