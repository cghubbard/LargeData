Cory Nathanial Gearrin (born April 14, 1986), nicknamed "The Bull", is 
an American professional baseball pitcher for the San Francisco Giants 
of Major League Baseball (MLB). Prior to playing professionally, Gearrin 
attended Rhea County High School, Young Harris College, and Mercer University. 
In 2007, Gearrin's junior season at Mercer, he went 4–3 with a 2.44 ERA 
in 26 relief appearances. He had 13 saves and 65 strikeouts in 44 innings 
of work, allowing only 15 hits. Gearrin was then drafted by the Braves 
in the fourth round of the 2007 amateur draft. He began his professional 
career in 2007, going 1–1 with a 4.44 ERA in 18 relief appearances, striking 
out 37 batters in 26 1⁄3 innings of work for the Danville Braves. The following 
season, he went 6–3 with a 4.11 ERA in 36 relief appearances for the Rome 
Braves and Myrtle Beach Pelicans, striking out 72 batters in 46 innings 
pitched. In 2009, Gearrin played for the Pelicans and Mississippi Braves, 
going a combined 1–4 with a 2.30, saving 19 games. He pitched for the Gwinnett 
Braves in 2010, going 3–5 with a 3.36 ERA in 52 relief appearances.[1] 
On April 22, 2011, Gearrin was called up to Atlanta's major league team 
from AAA Gwinnett, a move that General Manager, Frank Wren, described as 
a "necessity." In the bottom of the ninth of a tied game against San Diego 
on April 25, 2011, Gearrin made his major league debut by retiring the 
side in order and getting a strikeout. Returning to the mound for the bottom 
of the tenth, Gearrin again retired the Padres in order while registering 
another strikeout. On May 1, 2011, Gearrin recorded his first blown save 
after giving up the tying run in the 7th inning to the St. Louis Cardinals, 
a game the Braves later came back to win. After being recalled to the Braves 
from Gwinnett once again on April 24, 2012, when Jair Jurrjens was sent 
down, Gearrin was sent back down 5 days later when Tim Hudson was activated 
from the DL having not appeared with the Braves.[2] During the 2013 season, 
Gearrin became a key part of the Braves bullpen due to many injuries to 
regular relief pitchers. Despite a good start to the season (a 1.46 ERA 
in April and a 2.13 ERA in May), Gearrin's ERA increased significantly 
in June (10.80 in six appearances). After allowing two earned runs during 
a relief appearance on July 3, Gearrin was optioned to Gwinnett for the 
first time in 2013 on July 5.[3] In 2014, Gearrin attended Spring Training 
with the Braves. He was likely to earn one of the open roster spots in 
the bullpen, but Gearrin left his last outing with discomfort in his right 
elbow. It was later revealed that Gearrin would need Tommy John Surgery 
and miss the 2014 season. He was released by the Braves on November 10, 
2014. Gearrin signed a minor league deal to join the San Francisco Giants 
in December 2014. He was called up to the Giants in September 2015 and 
appeared in seven games, pitching 3 2⁄3 innings. In 2016, Gearrin was named
