Kyle Ehren Snyder (born September 9, 1977) is a former Major League Baseball 
relief pitcher. Snyder played with the Kansas City Royals (2003, 2005-2006) 
and the Boston Red Sox (2006-2008). He is listed at 6-7 and 225 pounds, 
is a switch hitter, and throws right-handed. Snyder is currently the pitching 
coach of the Durham Bulls in the Rays organization. Kyle Snyder was born 
in Houston, Texas. He graduated from Riverview High School in Sarasota, 
Florida in 1996. While in high school he lettered in baseball, basketball, 
swimming and golf. He was drafted by the Tampa Bay Devil Rays in the 1996 
amateur draft but chose to attend North Carolina instead, where he played 
baseball for the Tar Heels. Snyder played three years for North Carolina, 
and also played for the Chatham Athletics of the Cape Cod Summer league 
where he was named the top prospect. In summer 1997, Snyder played in the 
Valley Baseball League for the Winchester Royals. In 1999, he was a first 
round MLB draft pick (7th pick overall) of the Kansas City Royals.[1] He 
played for Spokane Indians in 1999 and was named top prospect in the Northwest 
League by Baseball America. His career with the Royals was hampered by 
several injuries. He only pitched 2 games in 2000 and missed the entire 
2001 minor league season recovering from Tommy John surgery. Between 2003 
and 2005 he was on the disabled list four times including two stays on 
the 60-day disabled list, missing the entire 2004 season after having surgery 
to repair a torn labrum in his right shoulder. Despite his history with 
injuries, he was named the 7th-best prospect in the organization by Baseball 
America in 2003. Snyder started the 2006 season with the Royal's minor 
league affiliate, Omaha Royals, and was promoted to the majors on June 
8, 2006 to face the Texas Rangers. After giving up nine runs (five earned) 
and ten hits in a two inning start, he was designated for assignment.[2] 
In June 2006, he was claimed off waivers by the Boston Red Sox. He split 
the remainder of the season between Boston and the Pawtucket Red Sox. Snyder 
is perhaps best known in Boston for his 4 1‚ÅÑ3 inning relief effort for 
the Red Sox in a July 31, 2006 game against the Cleveland Indians. Entering 
the game with Boston trailing 8-6 in the 5th, he held the Indians scoreless 
before David Ortiz hit a walk-off 3-run homer in the bottom of the 9th, 
giving the Red Sox a stunning 9-8 victory. He allowed only 1 hit while 
walking none and striking out 6.[3] Snyder's first full season in the majors 
was in 2007, when he appeared in 46 games, one more than his previous three 
professional years combined. In January 2007 he signed a one-year contract 
with the Red Sox avoiding the arbitration process.[4] In April 2008, Snyder 
was designated for assignment to make room for Josh Beckett, who was returning 
from the 15-day disabled list.[5] Later in the month, he accepted an assignment 
to remain in the Red Sox organization with Triple-A Pawtucket. He was granted 
free agency after the 2008 season and signed a minor league contract with 
the New York Mets in January 2009. In 2012 the Tampa Bay Rays hired Kyle 
Snyder as pitching coach for the Short-Season A level Hudson Valley Renegades.[6] 
For the 2013 season, Snyder will be the pitching coach for the Bowling 
Green Hot Rods (A).[7] The Rays promoted him to the Durham Bulls for the
