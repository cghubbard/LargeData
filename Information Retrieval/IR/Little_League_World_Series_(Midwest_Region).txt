The Midwest Region is one of eight United States regions that currently 
send teams to the Little League World Series, the largest youth baseball 
competition in the world. The region's participation in the LLWS dates 
back to 1957, when it was known as the Central Region. However, when the 
LLWS was expanded in 2001 from eight teams (four U.S. teams and four "International" 
teams from the rest of the world) to 16 teams (eight U.S. and eight International), 
the Central Region was split into the Midwest and Great Lakes Regions.[1]
