The 1977 Minnesota Twins season was a season in American baseball. The 
team finished 84-77, fourth in the American League West. In a May 25 double-header 
at Boston's Fenway Park, outfielder Lyman Bostock tied a major league record 
with twelve putouts in the first game. His total of seventeen putouts over 
both games set a new American League record. On June 26, a crowd of 46,463 
turned up at Metropolitan Stadium to watch first baseman Rod Carew's pursuit 
of a .400 batting average. Carew didn't disappoint, going 4 for 5 with 
six RBI, raising his batting average seven points to .403. Lost in the 
commotion was right fielder Glenn Adams' own 4-for-5 performance, as he 
drove in a Twins-record eight runs. The Twins beat the Chicago White Sox 
19-12.[2] Rod Carew, outfielder Larry Hisle and catcher Butch Wynegar were 
named to the All-Star Game. Carew was the leading AL vote-getter, scoring 
405 of 422 possible votes in the national balloting by sports writers and 
broadcasters.[3] Carew was named American League Most Valuable Player. 
In winning his sixth AL batting title, Carew flirted with becoming the 
first batter since Ted Williams in 1941 to hit .400, finishing at .388. 
He also had 239 hits, scored a league-leading 128 runs, hit 14 home runs 
and collected 100 RBI. Other offensive stars were Larry Hisle, who hit 
28 HR and drove in a league-leading 119 runs, and Lyman Bostock, who hit 
.338 with 104 runs, 14 HR and 90 RBI. The Twins' ability to score runs 
was matched by their pitchers' ability to give up runs. Reliever Tom Johnson 
replaced Bill Campbell, racking up 16 relief wins along with 20 saves. 
Dave Goltz became a 20-game winner for the first time. 1,162,727 fans attended 
Twins games, the fourth lowest total in the American League. It was, however, 
the first time since 1970 that the Twins attracted more than one million 
fans. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] Infielders
