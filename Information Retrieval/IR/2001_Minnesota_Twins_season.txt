The 2001 Minnesota Twins marked the beginning of the Twins’ ascendancy 
in the American League Central Division. After finishing the 2000 season 
last in the division with a disappointing 69-93 record, the 2001 team rebounded 
to finish 85-77, good enough for second place in the division. The six-year 
run of winning seasons that followed is the longest such stretch in franchise 
history. In his last year as manager, Tom Kelly continued the development 
of a core of young players who would win their division the following year. 
Third baseman Corey Koskie hit 26 home runs and stole 27 bases, the only 
Twins player to steal at least 25 bases and hit 25 home runs in the same 
season. The team had consistent starters, many of whom performed well. 
First baseman Doug Mientkiewicz, who had a disappointing 1999 season and 
spent most of 2000 in the minors, had what seemed to be a breakout year, 
hitting .306 with 14 home runs and 74 RBI. Second baseman Luis Rivas appeared 
to be on the verge of breaking out as well, hitting .266 but stealing a 
team-leading 31 bases. Shortstop Cristian Guzmán built on his solid 2000 
season by batting .302, stealing 25 bases, and once again leading the major 
leagues in triples with 14. His numbers were solid enough to earn him his 
first and only all-star berth. Third baseman Corey Koskie had his best 
year, hitting .276, with 26 home runs and 103 RBI. Amazingly, he also stole 
27 bases. A. J. Pierzynski had a solid year for a catcher, batting .289 
with 7 home runs. The "Soul Patrol" outfield of Jacque Jones in left, Torii 
Hunter in center, and Matt Lawton in right continued to impress, although 
Lawton was traded midway through the season. The biggest offensive question 
mark was the designated hitter position, with David Ortiz spending much 
of the year injured—as was often the case during his Twins tenure. He started 
only 78 games as the DH, with Chad Allen starting 22 and Brian Buchanan 
19. Brad Radke, Eric Milton, and Joe Mays capably filled the first three 
spots in the starting rotation throughout the year, with Milton and Mays 
earning all-star berths for their efforts. The final two spots were question 
marks, with Kyle Lohse making 16 uninspired starts, and J. C. Romero eleven. 
(The team had still not figured out that Romero was better suited to the 
bullpen.) Because of the weak back end of the rotation, the team traded 
Lawton for pitcher Rick Reed midway through the year. Reed did not quite 
meet expectations, going 4-6 with a 5.19 ERA in twelve starts. The bullpen 
was in flux. LaTroy Hawkins struggled as the team's closer, leading to 
Eddie Guardado earning 12 saves. Guardado, Jack Cressend, Todd Jones, and 
Mark Redman had serviceable years, but Bob Wells, Héctor Carrasco, and 
Juan Rincón did not. Like most of Tom Kelly's teams, the defense was exceptional. 
It was anchored by Mientkiewicz, who earned a Gold Glove award for his 
efforts. Rivas and Guzman were an impressive double-play combination, while 
Koskie improved defensively. After a season of uncertainty behind the plate 
in 2000, Pierzynski solidified the catcher position, backed up by Tom Prince. 
The speedy "Soul Patrol" outfield of Jones, Hunter, and Lawton was fun 
to watch. Lawton's departure left a void that Brian Buchanan would attempt 
to fill. However, as the team fell out of contention, he would give way 
to the platoon of Bobby Kielty and Dustan Mohr, known by fans collectively 
as "Dusty Kielmohr." [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12]
