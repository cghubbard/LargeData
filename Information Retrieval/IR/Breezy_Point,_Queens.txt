-73.9262483 Breezy Point is a neighborhood in the New York City borough 
of Queens, located on the western end of the Rockaway peninsula, between 
Rockaway Inlet and Jamaica Bay on the landward side, and the Atlantic Ocean. 
The neighborhood is part of Queens Community District 14.[1] The community 
is run by the Breezy Point Cooperative, in which all residents pay the 
maintenance, security, and community-oriented costs involved with keeping 
the community private. The cooperative owns the entire 500-acre (2 km2) 
community; residents own their homes and hold shares in the cooperative.[2] 
Breezy Point and the Rockaways are less urbanized than most of the rest 
of New York City. Breezy Point Tip, to the west of the community, is part 
of Gateway National Recreation Area, which is run by the National Park 
Service. This isolated, 200-acre (0.81 km2) area includes an ocean-facing 
beach, a shoreline on Jamaica Bay, sand dunes, and marshland. It is a breeding 
spot for the piping plover, least tern, black skimmer, American oystercatcher 
and common tern.[3] Based on data from the 2010 United States Census, the 
population of the combined area of Breezy Point/Belle Harbor/Rockaway Park/Broad 
Channel was 28,018, an increase of 1,307 (4.9%) from the 26,711 counted 
in 2000. Covering an area of 2,033.88 acres (823.08 ha), the four neighborhoods 
had a population density of 13.8 inhabitants per acre (8,800/sq mi).[4] 
The racial makeup of the neighborhoods was 78.3% (21,946) White, 7.5% (2,095) 
African American, 0.1% (29) Native American, 2.1% (595) Asian, 0.0% (8) 
Pacific Islander, 0.2% (66) from other races, and 0.9% (259) from two or 
more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 10.8% (3,020) of the population.[5] 
However, according to the United States Census Bureau, the community's 
ZIP code (11697) is 98.2% white and has the nation's 2nd highest concentration 
of Irish-Americans, at 60.3% as of the United States Census, 2000 (Squantum, 
in Quincy, Massachusetts, is #1, at 65%).[6] The community's demographics 
are maintained as a result of a Cooperative rule that a person, prior to 
buying a house, must be recommended by three members of the Cooperative 
and approved by its Board of Directors.[2][7] Breezy Point functions mainly 
as a summer get-away for many residents of New York. Estimates put summer 
residency at 12,000, while year-round residency was 4337 in the most recent 
Census.[6] Due to its history of Irish-American population, Breezy Point 
has been called the "Irish Riviera." Since the mid-1990s, Italians and 
Jews have also moved into Breezy Point, making the concentration of Irish-Americans 
drop.[8] The community began as summer beach bungalows, in the "early 1900s", 
according to the New York Times.[8] Breezy Point was sold to the Atlantic 
Improvement State Corporation for $17 million in 1960. The residents of 
the community purchased half of the land for approximately $11 million 
and formed the Breezy Point Cooperative. Today, it consists of about 3,500 
homes.[9] The construction of apartment buildings commenced in the late 
1960s and was halted by City ordinance.[10] Breezy Point is patrolled by 
its own private security force that restricts access to owners, renters 
and their guests. It also features three of New York City's nine remaining 
volunteer fire departments.[11] On September 8, 2012, the community was 
struck by a tornado shortly before 11 a.m. that started as a waterspout 
over the Atlantic Ocean and came ashore at the Breezy Point Surf Club.[12] 
On October 29, 2012, Breezy Point was hit hard by Hurricane Sandy. Jamaica 
Bay and the Atlantic Ocean flooded the land between these bodies of water. 
Most Breezy Point homes were damaged or destroyed by high water. Residents 
lost everything in their basements, and hundreds of vehicles were ruined 
by the storm. One car caught fire when someone tried to start the vehicle. 
Residents put the fire out before help arrived.[13] At 10 pm, a six-alarm 
fire was reported at 173 Ocean Avenue. Local volunteer firefighters were 
trapped in place for several hours due to the flooding. Once the waters 
receded, the Rockaway Point Fire Department rescued more than 41 civilians. 
FDNY was delayed getting into Breezy due to the high flood levels. Roxbury 
FD extinguished fires by the promenade. Rockaway Point and Roxbury are 
located on the ocean side. Rockaway Point lost all of its rigs due to high 
water, and helped Roxbury with its lines. They found 130 homes burned to 
the ground.[14][15] Nearby, another 50 homes were damaged by the fire.[13] 
According to an official report in December, rising seawater caused the 
fire by contacting a house's electrical wires.[16] According to the United 
States Fish and Wildlife Service, beaches on the Breezy Point peninsula 
are home to one of the most diverse breeding shorebird areas in the Metropolitan 
area. Shorebirds that breed here include: The beaches in Breezy Point Tip 
are owned by the federal government and are federally and state-protected 
areas in which development is extremely limited. The beaches in Breezy 
Point are owned by the Breezy Point Cooperative as a consequence of litigation 
with the federal government in the 1980s. Breezy Point residents are zoned 
for schools in the New York City Department of Education. P.S. 114 Belle
