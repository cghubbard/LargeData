Jacob Edward "Jake" Peavy (born May 31, 1981) is an American professional 
baseball pitcher who is a free agent. He has played in Major League Baseball 
(MLB) for the San Diego Padres, Chicago White Sox, Boston Red Sox and San 
Francisco Giants. He bats and throws right-handed. Peavy stands 6'1" tall 
(1.85 m) and weighs 195 pounds (83 kg). While with the Padres, he won the 
2007 NL Cy Young Award after recording the Pitching Triple Crown that year. 
He was traded from the White Sox to the Red Sox in 2013 and helped them 
to a World Series title later that season. One year later, he was traded 
to the San Francisco Giants, where he also helped them win a World Series 
title later in the season. He became the first starting pitcher in Major 
League history to win two consecutive World Series with two different teams 
in two different leagues, including being traded by his former team at 
the trade deadline. Peavy wore the number 44 throughout his career. When 
he was traded to the San Francisco Giants, he took number 43, as 44 was 
retired in honor of Willie McCovey. After struggling in the middle of the 
2014 season, he changed to 22. Peavy was drafted by the San Diego Padres 
in the 15th round (472nd overall) of the 1999 Major League Baseball draft 
out of high school (St. Paul's Episcopal School). He was named the high 
school player of the year in the state of Alabama. Peavy declined an offer 
to pitch for Auburn University in order to accept the Padres' contract 
offer.[citation needed] Peavy pitched for the Arizona League Padres and 
the Idaho Falls Braves in 1999 and the Fort Wayne Wizards in 2000. In 2001, 
Peavy played with the Lake Elsinore Storm and the Mobile BayBears. He split 
the 2002 season between the BayBears and the San Diego Padres.[1] Peavy 
was called up from Double-A to make his major league debut on June 22, 
2002 against the New York Yankees at Qualcomm Stadium. He lost the game, 
allowing one run on 3 hits in 6 innings while striking out 4.[2] In total, 
Peavy had 6 wins and 7 losses with a 4.52 earned run average (ERA) and 
90 strikeouts. The Padres won just 66 games and were in the cellar of the 
NL West. In his sophomore season, Peavy started 32 games (194.2 IP), with 
a 4.11 earned run average, a 12–11 record, and 156 strikeouts. The Padres 
finished last in their division again at a 64–98 record.[citation needed] 
During his third year of major league experience in 2004, Peavy emerged 
as the Padres' ace starting pitcher and one of the best pitchers in baseball. 
He compiled a 15–6 record, struck out 173 in 166 innings, and led Major 
League Baseball with a 2.27 ERA. He became the youngest pitcher to win 
an ERA title since Dwight Gooden in 1985. On September 17, 2004, Peavy 
allowed Barry Bonds' 700th career home run.[3] On March 5, 2005 he signed 
a four-year 14.5 million contract and held a club option for 2009 extension 
with the Padres.[4] During the 2005 season, Peavy was selected for the 
National League All-Star team and ended the regular season leading the 
National League in strikeouts with 216 (in 203 innings). He was second 
in the majors to Minnesota's Johan Santana who had 238 strikeouts. In addition 
he finished the season with a 13–7 record, 2.88 ERA, a strikeout-to-walk 
ratio of over 4:1 and WHIP of 1.044.[citation needed] After the Padres 
won the National League West in 2005, Peavy was widely considered[who?] 
the key to upsetting the St. Louis Cardinals, whom they faced in the National 
League Division Series. Peavy gave up eight runs in the first game, and 
afterwards it was announced that he would miss the rest of the season with 
a broken rib, which he apparently suffered while celebrating the Padres 
clinching the NL West Championship.[5] Peavy was the captain of Team USA 
in the 2006 World Baseball Classic, held in San Diego. He started the opening 
game for the U.S., a 2–0 win over Mexico, giving up just one hit and no 
runs over three innings. He did not factor in the decision in the second 
round game against Japan, as he gave up three runs in five innings in a 
game that the U.S. won, 4–3.[citation needed] In 2006, Peavy got off to 
a rocky start, in part due to mechanical adjustments brought on by various 
off-season injuries. Although Peavy would go only 11–14 with a 4.09 ERA, 
he still managed to finish second in the National League in strikeouts 
with 215, one shy of both his 2005 league-leading total and of the 2006 
NL strikeout leader, Aaron Harang who logged 32 more innings than Peavy. 
In the playoffs, the Padres again faced the St. Louis Cardinals in the 
first round. As the game one starter, Peavy had a much stronger outing 
than his 2005 playoff game, but the Padres again lost to the Cardinals.[citation 
needed] On July 1, 2007, for the second time in his career, Peavy was named 
to the 2007 NL All-Star Team. On July 9, he was named as the starting pitcher 
for the NL. On August 2, Peavy struck out Arizona Diamondbacks outfielder 
Jeff DaVanon, for his 1000th career strikeout.[citation needed] Peavy won 
the pitching Triple Crown in 2007, leading the National League with 19 
wins, 240 strikeouts, and a 2.54 ERA. Since the divisional play era started 
in 1969, Peavy is only the eighth player to accomplish this feat.[6] On 
October 23, Peavy won the Players Choice Award for Outstanding NL Pitcher.[7] 
He added the NL Cy Young—as a unanimous choice—on November 15,[8] becoming 
just the 10th National League player in history to win the Cy Young Award 
in a unanimous vote (Sandy Koufax was unanimously selected three times).[9] 
The completion of the 2007 campaign represented Peavy's sixth year in the 
league. Over that six-year period Peavy collected two strikeout champion 
awards, two major league ERA titles, and a unanimous, triple-crown Cy Young 
Award.[citation needed] On December 12, 2007, he signed a 4 year extension, 
worth $52 million with the Padres. At the time the contract was the largest 
in Padres history. The contract includes a $22 million option for 2013.[10] 
On April 5, 2008, Peavy pitched a two-hit complete game over the Los Angeles 
Dodgers. The following day, still-images from FOX sports video feed from 
the game showed a dirty, brown substance on the index and middle fingers, 
along with his thumb. Manager Bud Black defended Peavy saying that "it 
was a mixture of dirt and rosin". In the two games immediately following 
the report, Peavy posted a 1–0 record with a 1.92 ERA. In May, he went 
on the DL with a sore throwing elbow. He returned on June 12 and pitched 
six shutout innings with four strikeouts. He ended 2008 with only a 10–11 
record, but had one of the lowest run support per start of any pitcher 
in the league, and finished the season with a 2.85 ERA.[citation needed] 
Peavy had been the subject of numerous trade rumors during the 2008 offseason,[11] 
amidst reports that the Padres were looking to reduce salaries and build 
on young players for the future. In November 2008, Peavy added the New 
York Yankees to the list of teams he would accept a trade to. The list 
included several teams from the NL including the Atlanta Braves, St. Louis 
Cardinals, the Chicago Cubs, the Los Angeles Dodgers, and the Houston Astros. 
Peavy preferred to be in the NL, so the Yankees would not be involved. 
The Astros and Cardinals decided they would not pursue Peavy after talking 
with GM Kevin Towers on what they would have to give up.[citation needed] 
In November 2008, the Padres were working with the Braves on a Peavy trade, 
in which Peavy would be traded to Atlanta for SS Yunel Escobar, OF Gorkys 
Hernández, P Blaine Boyer and one of P Charlie Morton or P Jo-Jo Reyes.[12] 
The Padres wanted the two top prospects in the organization as well, pitcher 
Tommy Hanson and outfielder Jordan Schafer, but after a few weeks, the 
Braves decided to move on to bring in a few free agents.[citation needed] 
In spring training, Peavy pitched 14 total innings with no runs allowed, 
10 strikeouts and no walks.[13] He rejected a trade to the Chicago White 
Sox, which included Aaron Poreda and Clayton Richard, saying that remaining 
in San Diego was best for him and his family.[14] On May 22, Peavy hurt 
his ankle rounding third base against the Chicago Cubs in a start where 
he earned the win with 6 scoreless innings and 10 strikeouts a day after 
rejecting a trade to the White Sox. On June 12, Peavy learned he had a 
strained tendon in the back of his ankle, suffered in the May 22 start. 
He was placed on the DL the same day. At the time of his injury, Peavy 
was 6–6 with 3.96 ERA and 92 strikeouts.[citation needed] On July 31, Peavy 
agreed to a trade to the Chicago White Sox in a last minute trade deadline 
day deal for Clayton Richard, Aaron Poreda, Adam Russell and Dexter Carter.[15] 
In his first start for the White Sox, Peavy pitched 5 innings, giving up 
3 runs (all earned), and striking out 5, getting the win against the Kansas 
City Royals. Peavy went 3–0 in his time with the White Sox compiling his 
year's record to 9–6. In his 2009 stint with the White Sox he shut out 
the Detroit Tigers on two occasions.[citation needed] In 2010, Peavy started 
2–5 with a 6.05 ERA. Peavy then won five consecutive starts with a 1.99 
ERA.[citation needed] On July 6, while pitching in the second inning against 
the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, Peavy injured his right arm and immediately 
walked off the field. He was diagnosed with a detached latissimus dorsi 
muscle in his back. He underwent surgery on July 14, 2010 at the Rush University 
Medical Center in Chicago and was knocked out for the remainder of the 
season.[16] Due to various injuries and fatigue, Peavy was limited to only 
pitching in 19 games in 2011. Peavy started 18 games and came out of the 
bullpen once for the first time ever in his MLB career. Peavy finished 
the season posting a win-loss record of 7–7 with an ERA of 4.92 and 95 
strikeouts.[17] Peavy was named the AL Pitcher of the Month for April 2012, 
pitching 3–1 with a 1.67 ERA and 33 strikeouts in 5 starts, all quality 
starts. Peavy threw 2 consecutive complete games and one shutout.[18] On 
July 8, 2012, Peavy was selected to the All-Star Game as a replacement 
for C. J. Wilson.[19] Peavy was awarded the 2012 American League Gold Glove 
Award, sharing the award with Tampa Bay's Jeremy Hellickson. It was the 
first Gold Glove award of his career.[20] On October 30, 2012, Peavy signed 
a two-year, $29 million extension with a vesting option for 2015, keeping 
him with the White Sox at least through the 2014 season.[21] On June 4, 
2013, Peavy came out of a game against the Seattle Mariners in the fourth 
inning with a left rib fracture he was placed on the disabled list. Prior 
to that he had registered a 4.30 ERA, 1.16 WHIP and 66/15 K/BB ratio in 
67 innings. He was activated from the DL and made his first start against 
the Atlanta Braves on July 20.[22] On July 30, 2013, Peavy was traded to 
the Boston Red Sox along with Brayan Villarreal in a three-team trade, 
in which José Iglesias went to the Detroit Tigers and Avisail García, J. 
B. Wendelken, Francellis Montas and Cleuluis Rondon went to the White Sox.[23] 
On August 3, Peavy had a winning debut as the Red Sox defeated the Arizona 
Diamondbacks 5–2.[24] On October 30, 2013, Peavy and his fellow Boston 
Red Sox teammates won the World Series, the first of Peavy's career.[25] 
After the victory parade, in which Red Sox players and coaches rode through 
the streets of Boston on duck boats, Peavy purchased the duck boat that 
carried he and teammate Jon Lester, to commemorate the season.[26] On July 
26, 2014, the Boston Red Sox traded Peavy to the San Francisco Giants along 
with cash considerations for pitching prospects Edwin Escobar and Heath 
Hembree. This trade reunited Peavy with manager Bruce Bochy.[27][28] Having 
worn number 44 throughout his career, Peavy wore jersey number 43, since 
number 44 is retired in honor of Giants' Hall of Famer Willie McCovey.[29] 
After losing his first three quality starts as a Giant, including a perfect 
game through 6 1⁄3 innings, Peavy switched his jersey number from 43 to 
22 for good luck; number 22 was his jersey number from Mobile, Alabama. 
On August 13, 2014, in a 7-1 home win over his former team the Chicago 
White Sox, Peavy recorded his first career win as a Giant after switching 
numbers.[30] On August 30, 2014, in a 3-1 home win against the Milwaukee 
Brewers, Peavy struck out Aramis Ramírez for his 2,000th career strikeout, 
three days after teammate Tim Hudson got his. He did not allow a hit until 
the eighth inning to Mark Reynolds.[31] He won the first game of the 2014 
NLDS against the Washington Nationals on October 3, 2014.[32] On October 
29, 2014, Peavy won his second consecutive World Series ring, despite losing 
both his starts, after the Giants defeated the Royals, 3-2, in Game 7. 
Peavy became the first starting pitcher in MLB history to win two consecutive 
World Series with two different teams in two different leagues.[citation 
needed] On December 19, Peavy agreed to a two-year deal worth $24 million 
to stay with the Giants.[33] Peavy's repertoire includes six pitches, although 
he mostly uses a four-seam fastball at 88-92 mph and a slider in the low 
80s. He also has a two-seam fastball, a curveball, a changeup, and a cutter. 
Peavy tends to throw the curve and change more against lefties, and he 
does not use his two-seamer or cutter often.[34] As of June 23, 2016, Peavy 
has the 12th lowest career WHIP of active Major Leaguer.[35] Peavy's two-seam 
fastball acts primarily as a sinker and induces many ground balls.[36] 
This can allow Peavy to induce many double plays when runners are on base. 
Peavy likes to run his fastballs in on lefties and make the pitch break 
back into the zone, similar to a power version of Greg Maddux's technique.[citation 
needed] The natural movement of Peavy's pitches creates a heavier ball 
which helps to limit the number of home runs Peavy gives up, as he allowed 
only 13 in over 220 innings in 2007.[37] MLB Records San Diego Padres Records 
Peavy married his childhood friend Katie Alford in 2000, when he was 19 
years old.[38] As of August 2013, Jake and Katie and their four sons live 
in his hometown of Semmes, Alabama in the off-season.[39] Peavy is legally 
blind without corrective lenses.[40] He is an outspoken Christian, and 
has been interviewed about his religion.[41] Peavy has a tattoo on his 
forearm with the word "Outsider" on it. In 2008, Peavy bought a 5,000-acre 
(2,000 ha) ranch in Wilcox County, Alabama called Southern Falls Plantation.[42] 
The property includes a bowling alley, saloon, hunting lodge, and replica 
of Fenway Park.[43][44] In 2013, Peavy bought a World War II duck boat 
formerly used by Boston Duck Tours for tourist purposes, and special events 
like the 2013 World Series Parade for the plantation. He hopes it will 
become a family heirloom.[45][46] During a World Series Game 6 pre-game 
press conference, Peavy's son let the media know that his dad would purchase 
the family a cable car for the ranch if the Giants won the 2014 World Series, 
which they did.[47] Once shipped to Alabama, it was planned to be converted 
into a bar.[48] Peavy is also a passionate fan of the Alabama Crimson Tide 
football program and was invited to be a guest for ESPN's College Gameday 
on the campus of Alabama in 2013.[49] In 2015, Peavy admitted to being 
a smokeless tobacco user since he was in fifth grade.[50] Peavy started 
playing guitar in 2002 when he and Tim Flannery were with the San Diego
