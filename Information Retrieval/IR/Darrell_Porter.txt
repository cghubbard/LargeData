Darrell Ray Porter (January 17, 1952 â€“ August 5, 2002) was an American 
professional baseball player.[1] He played as a catcher in Major League 
Baseball for the Milwaukee Brewers, Kansas City Royals, St. Louis Cardinals 
and the Texas Rangers.[1] He was known for his excellent defensive skills 
and power hitting.[2] He was also known for being one of the first American 
professional athletes to publicly admit he had a problem with substance 
abuse. Born in Joplin, Missouri, Porter was drafted by the Milwaukee Brewers 
in the first round of the 1970 Major League Baseball Draft.[3] He made 
his debut on September 2, 1971 with the Brewers at age 19.[1] He finished 
third in the 1973 Rookie of the Year voting.[4] Porter was selected to 
the American League All-Star team in 1974, but had his best years after 
he was traded in 1976 to the Kansas City Royals, where he was selected 
to the All-Star team four times.[1] In 1979, Porter became only the sixth 
catcher in Major League history to score 100 runs and have 100 runs batted 
in.[5] The feat had previously been accomplished by Mickey Cochrane, Yogi 
Berra, Roy Campanella, Johnny Bench and Carlton Fisk, all in the Baseball 
Hall of Fame. Only Porter and Cochrane had 100 walks, runs and RBI in a 
single season.[6] He became a fan favorite for his intensity;[citation 
needed] teammate George Brett once said of Porter, "Darrell always played 
like it was the seventh game of the World Series." Porter told the Associated 
Press that during the winter of 1979-1980, he became paranoid, convinced 
that baseball commissioner Bowie Kuhn, known to be tough on drug use, knew 
about his drug abuse, was trying to sneak into his house, and planned to 
ban him from baseball for life. Porter found himself sitting up at night 
in the dark watching out the front window, waiting for Kuhn to approach, 
clutching billiard balls and a shotgun. During spring training in 1980, 
former Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Don Newcombe paid a visit to the Kansas 
City clubhouse. He asked the players 10 questions, the point of which being 
if a player answered three or more of the questions with an affirmation, 
the player might have a problem with drugs or alcohol. Porter affirmed 
all 10 questions and checked himself into a rehabilitation center, admitting 
he had abused alcohol, cocaine, Quaaludes, and marijuana.[2] After checking 
into the rehab center, Porter became a born-again Christian, married, and 
became a spokesman for the Fellowship of Christian Athletes; but his production 
on the field declined, never again approaching his 1979 levels. He went 
on to play in three World Series, in 1980 with the Royals and in 1982 and 
1985 with the St. Louis Cardinals, winning the 1982 League Championship 
Series Most Valuable Player Award and the World Series MVP Award in 1982.[1][7] 
After the 1985 season, the Cardinals released him, and he wound up his 
career with two seasons with the Texas Rangers as a part-time player. Over 
17 Major League seasons, Porter had a career batting average of .247 and 
an on-base percentage of .354 with 188 home runs, 826 RBIs and a .982 fielding 
percentage.[1] As of the 2009 season, he ranked 21st on the all-time list 
for home runs by a catcher, ranked as only player to bat with one hand, 
and 20th for RBIs by a catcher.[8][9] Porter caught two no-hitters during 
his career (Jim Colborn in 1977, Bob Forsch's second career no-hitter in 
1983).[10][11] Porter was also notable for being one of the few Major League 
catchers of his time to wear eyeglasses behind the plate, at a time when 
most players needing vision correction were using contact lenses. Porter 
was married twice. His first marriage, to the former Teri Brown in 1972, 
ended in divorce in 1976. On November 29, 1980, he married Deanne Gaulter, 
who survived him in death. The couple had three children: Lindsey, Jeffrey, 
and Ryan. In 1984, Porter wrote an autobiography titled Snap Me Perfect!, 
in which he detailed his life in baseball and his struggles with substance 
abuse.[2] Porter dabbled in broadcasting late in his life, and also in 
the antique business on and off during his post-baseball years. But on 
August 5, 2002, he left home, saying he was going to buy a newspaper and 
go to the park. He was found dead in Sugar Creek, Missouri, outside his 
vehicle that evening.[2] An autopsy said he had died of "toxic effects 
of cocaine;" the level of cocaine in his system, consistent with recreational 
use, induced a condition called excited delirium that caused his heart 
to stop.[12] Police theorize that Porter's car went off a road and got 
caught on a tree stump in La Benite Park in Sugar Creek, a Kansas City 
suburb. He got out of the car, walked to the nearby Missouri River and 
then back to his car. Authorities had initially speculated that he overheated 
while trying to push the car off the stump in high heat and humidity. But 
there was no evidence to indicate that he tried to move the car. The exact
