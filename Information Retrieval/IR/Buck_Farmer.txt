Farmer was drafted by the Atlanta Braves in the 46th round of the 2009 
Major League Baseball Draft, but did not sign and elected to play college 
baseball at the Georgia Institute of Technology for the Georgia Tech Yellow 
Jackets.[1] Farmer began his collegiate career in 2010. During his freshman 
season, he posted a 5–1 record, and a 3.63 ERA in 19 appearances. He recorded 
his first career win on March 14, in four innings of relief against Wake 
Forest, holding the Deacons to no runs on just two hits. During his sophomore 
season, Farmer posted an 11–3 record, and a 2.82 ERA in 16 starts. He went

a team-high 106 2⁄3 innings, third in the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC). 
He posted a 3.54 ERA, and allowed just 100 hits with 37 walks and 115 strikeouts, 
third-most in the ACC. He was the ACC's only pitcher to pitch a complete-game 
shutout with his 1–0 win over Duke, earning him the ACC Pitcher of the 
Week and College Sports Madness National Pitcher of the Week.[2] After 
the season, he was drafted by the Milwaukee Brewers in the 15th round of 
the 2012 Major League Baseball Draft, but chose to return to Georgia Tech 
for his senior season.[3] During his senior season, Farmer posted 9–5 record 
in 17 starts, and a 2.78 ERA in 113 1⁄3 innings with 122 strikeouts. He 
ranked second in the ACC in strikeouts, and finished with a career best 
in ERA, innings pitched, and strikeouts.[4] He was a semifinalist for the 
ACC Pitcher of the Year.[5] Farmer was drafted by the Detroit Tigers in 
the fifth round of the 2013 Major League Baseball Draft and signed a minor 
league contract.[6][7] Farmer began the 2014 season with the Class A West 
Michigan Whitecaps, where he made 18 starts, before being promoted to the 
Double-A Erie SeaWolves, where he started two games. Between Class A and 
Double-A, Farmer is 11–5, with a 2.65 ERA, allowing 101 hits over 115 2⁄3 
innings with 127 strikeouts and 28 walks.[8] Farmer made his major league 
debut on August 13, 2014, in a game against the Pittsburgh Pirates.[9] 
In his debut, he pitched five innings, allowing four runs on six hits, 
while striking out four, and earning a no-decision.[10] He was optioned 
to the Triple-A Toledo Mud Hens following his debut.[11] The Tigers called 
up Farmer again on August 23, 2014 to start the first game of a doubleheader 
against the Minnesota Twins.[12] In his second major league start, Farmer 
pitched 1 1⁄3 innings, allowing seven runs on five hits, while walking 
two, and striking out three in a 12–4 loss.[13] In 2015, Farmer made a 
spot start for the Tigers on May 28, against the Los Angeles Angels of 
Anaheim, when he allowed seven runs on nine hits in five innings. He was 
recalled by the Tigers on June 24, 2015. In 12 starts with the Mud Hens, 
Farmer posted a 3.56 ERA with 59 strikeouts and 22 walks in 68 1⁄3 innings.[14] 
In 2016, Farmer made the Tigers opening day roster. On April 16, 2016, 
Farmer was optioned to the Toledo Mud Hens.[15] Farmer was recalled to 
the Tigers on May 22, after Drew VerHagen was optioned to Toledo that same 
day.[16] On September 21, 2016, Farmer made his first major league start 
of the year against the Minnesota Twins, however the game was suspended 
as a result of rain. [17] In addition to the one start, Farmer made 13 
relief appearances for the Tigers in 2016, posting a 4.60 ERA and 27 strikeouts 
in 29 1⁄3 innings pitched. Throughout his career, Farmer relied on three 
pitches: a 91–95 MPH four-seam fastball, a mid-80 MPH slider and a changeup.[18] 
In 2015, he added a two-seam fastball to his repertoire in order to generate 
more groundballs, a philosophy taught to him by his AAA pitching coach,
