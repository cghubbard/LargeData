The Montreal Expos had the best record in Major League Baseball (74-40), 
when the 1994–95 Major League Baseball strike ended the season and the 
team's postseason aspirations. Five Expos represented the National League 
at the 1994 Major League Baseball All-Star Game held in Pittsburgh. Moisés 
Alou had the game-winning hit for the National League. The Montreal Expos 
held spring training at Municipal Stadium in West Palm Beach, Florida. 
In 1994, the Expos team appeared to be reaching its potential. Led by rising 
young stars including Pedro Martínez, Larry Walker, Moisés Alou, Cliff 
Floyd, Mike Lansing and Jeff Fassero, Montreal was off to a 74-40 start, 
leading the National League Eastern Division. They had scored 585 runs 
(5.13 per game) and allowed 454 runs (3.98 per game) through 114 games 
by Friday, August 12.[4] Their 1994 pitching staff was very nearly as good 
as that of their division rivals, the Atlanta Braves, as the Expos finished 
the strike-shortened season with an MLB-best 3.56 ERA, an MLB-high 46 saves 
and just 288 walks, the fewest in the Majors.[5] Walker, with 86 RBIs, 
was well on his way to his first 100-RBI year; Ken Hill was on pace to 
win 23 games while Pedro Martínez was on pace to strike out more than 200 
batters. Moisés Alou was hitting .339 and on pace to collect more than 
200 hits for the first time in his career. Marquis Grissom was on pace 
to score 137 runs. Two other Expos, namely Alou and Walker, were also on 
pace to score more than 100 runs. The team was also drawing well at home: 
through 52 home games in 1994, 1,276,250 fans had attended Expos games, 
for an average of 24,543 per game. At that pace, the Expos would have had 
a good chance of drawing two million fans for the first time since 1983.[6] 
The season, however, was stopped due to the 1994 players' strike. The World 
Series, for which the Expos appeared to be destined, was never played and 
Montreal lost many of its players during the next season due to free agency 
and salary constraints and the team never recovered. The 1994 Montreal 
Expos team that could have been remains one of baseball's hot discussion 
points. The collapse of the Expos would eventually lead to the franchise's 
move to Washington, D.C., for the 2005 season to become the Washington 
Nationals. When baseball returned for an exhibition series in Olympic Stadium 
in March 2014, the team was honored during a pregame ceremony, along with 
a banner with the words On se souvient Édition 1994 (We remember the 1994 
season). Infielders Coaches Note: Pos = position; G = Games played; AB
