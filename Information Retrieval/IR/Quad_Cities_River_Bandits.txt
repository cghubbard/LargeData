Three-I League Western League Mississippi Valley League Three-I League 
Illinois–Iowa League Central Interstate League Northwestern League The 
Quad Cities River Bandits are a Class A minor league baseball team, affiliated 
with the Houston Astros, that plays in the Midwest League. Its home games 
are played at Modern Woodmen Park (formerly John O'Donnell Stadium) in 
Davenport, Iowa, one of the Quad Cities. The address is 209 S. Gaines Street. 
Tracing back to 1879, Quad City professional baseball has a rich history 
that includes teams in Davenport, Moline (Moline Plowboys) and Rock Island 
(Rock Island Islanders). The 1879 Davenport Brown Stockings played one 
season in the Northwestern League beginning a baseball history in the area. 
Davenport teams with catchy names (Onion Weeders, Pilgrims, Hawkeyes) played 
before the turn of the 20th century in a various leagues.[2] In 1901, play 
began in the Illinois–Indiana–Iowa League (Three-I) with teams Davenport 
and Rock Island as charter members. The Davenport team set the foundation 
of the franchise that exists today. The Making up the rest of the 1901 
Three-I League teams were: Terre Haute, Bloomington, Cedar Rapids, Rockford, 
Evansville and Decatur. The Davenport team continued to change their name 
frequently in the early years of their Three-I play: River Rats (1901–04), 
Riversides (1905), Knickerbockers (1906), Prodigals (1909–12) and Davenport 
Blue Sox (1913–1916). Davenport won their first Three-I Championship in 
1914. [2] With the Quad Cities area was able to support two teams in this 
era, Davenport and the Rock Island Islanders, a third Quad City team was 
added In July, 1914. Moline gained a franchise, that year when the Danville 
Speakers relocated to Moline and the Moline Plowboys were established. 
The Plowboys would win Three-I Championships in 1915, 1921 and 1937. The 
Moline Plowboys were Class D affiliates of the Detroit Tigers (1922), St 
Louis Browns (1931–32), Chicago Cubs (1937–40) and the Philadelphia A's 
(1947–48). From 1920-22 the Plowboys were managed by player-manager Earle 
Mack, son of Connie Mack. The Rock Island slanders were Class D affiliates 
of the St. Louis Browns (1932) and Cincinnati Reds (1933). In 1922, Rock 
Island left the Three-I to join the Mississippi Valley League (MVL), followed 
by Moline a year later. Unable to sustain their teams, Rock Island's final 
season of play was 1937 and Moline played their final season in 1948. The 
Moline franchise played home games at Browning Field and Rock Island played 
at Douglas Park.[2] In an exhibition on April 12, 1920 The Plowboys defeated 
the Chicago White Sox 7-1 in the first "major-league" game played at Browning.[2] 
Both Douglas Park and Browning Field are still in existence today. On May 
26, 1931, Davenport began play in the newly built Municipal Stadium, nicknamed 
the "Muny." On the Muny field, Rock Island and Davenport played each other 
in the championship series in 1932 and 1933. Rock Island won the '32 series 
and the title in six games.[2] Davenport rebounded to win the MVL title 
in 1933 (the final season of the MVL). The 1933 team was led by Ed Hall's 
151 RBI and Como Cotelle's .407 average.[2] The Davenport Blue Sox played 
in the Western League from 1934–1937 as a Class A affiliate of the Brooklyn 
Dodgers. The 1936 team continued the strong decade and claimed the Western 
League championship. The 1937 team was managed by player-manager John "Eagle 
Beak" Fitzpatrick. This is noteworthy as Fitzpatrick returned 25 years 
later to manage the Angels in 1962[2] [3] After a nine season baseball 
hiatus during World War II, baseball returned in 1946. The Davenport Cubs 
rejoined the Three-I League as the Class B affiliate of the Chicago Cubs. 
Led by future MLB players Roy Smalley and Rube Walker, the 1946 team started 
the new era by winning the regular season Three-I Title.[4][5] Keeping 
the moniker of the MLB franchise, from 1948 to 1949 The Davenport Pirates 
were an affiliate of the Pittsburgh Pirates. Future MLB stars Bob Purkey, 
Cy Young Winner Vern Law and slugger Frank Thomas were on the 1949 Pirates, 
who swept Evansville, 3-0, to win the Three-I championship. The 1949 season 
also saw Davenport draw 133,505 fans, a franchise record that would stand 
until 1981.[6] After the 1950 "Davenport Quads" operated as an independent, 
the 1951 and 1952 squads became the Davenport Tigers as the Class B affiliate 
of the Detroit Tigers. Harvey Kuenn starred for the 1952 team, hitting 
.340 and earning a late season call up to Detroit. Kuenn then won the 1953 
Major League Baseball Rookie of the Year Award.[7] Sadly, after going 54-69 
in 1952, the Detroit Tigers switched minor league cities, leaving Davenport 
without an affiliate and a team for four seasons. Then, in 1957, baseball 
returned to the Muny as the Davenport DavSox began Three-I league play 
as the Class B affiliate of the Chicago White Sox for two seasons.[8] When 
the Davenport DavSox moved to Lincoln, Nebraska after the 1958 season, 
Davenport was left without a team for the 1959 season. As a result, local 
businessman Hugo "Hooks" Kohn started a drive to bring a new team to Davenport. 
Kohn was a local baseball enthusiast and a leading pioneer/player of "Diamond 
Ball", a Davenport game that eventually led to today's softball.[9] With 
the Kohn heading the Quad City Baseball Fans Association, a team was secured 
for the 1960 season as a Milwaukee Braves affiliate. This move solidified 
Davenport as a true baseball town and the city has operated with a team 
every year since. The Quad City Baseball Fans Association would operate 
the Davenport franchise from 1960 through 1986.[10] The 1960 Davenport 
Braves became a member of the fledgling Midwest League (MWL), a partnership 
that has operated uninterrupted in the subsequent decades. The 1960 team 
joined Waterloo, Iowa; Keokuk, Iowa; Dubuque, Iowa; Clinton, Iowa; Kokomo, 
Indiana; Quincy, Illinois and Decatur, Illinois to form an 8-team league.[11] 
The Davenport franchise has been a member of the Midwest League ever since, 
as has Clinton. The creation of the Midwest League essentially ended the 
Three-I, which folded after the 1961 season. In its long history, the Three-I 
hosted teams in 31 cities.[12] In 1961 the franchise permanently dropped 
"Davenport" and became the "Quad City" Braves. In 1962, Quad Cities became 
a farm team of the expansion Los Angeles (later California) Angels. The 
affiliate change was forced when Cedar Rapids (also a Braves affiliate) 
was one of six Three-I teams that joined the Midwest League in 1962 after 
the Three-I dissolution. Thus began a lengthy affiliation with the Angels.[13] 
The Quad City Angels of 1963 and 1964 were managed by Chuck Tanner in his 
first managerial position. (Tanner would later lead the Pittsburgh Pirates 
to the World Series Championship in 1979.) The 1964 Angels were the first 
MWL team to draw more than 100,000 fans in a season. The franchise had 
other on field successes in the 1960s and 1970s: Fred Koenig managed the 
Angels to the 1968 MWL title; Mike Stubbins led the 1971 squad to another 
and Jim Napier led the Quad Cities Cubs title run in 1979.[14] Except for 
a six-year affiliation with the Chicago Cubs (1979–84), the Angels affiliation 
ran from 1962 through the 1992 season. Quad Cities was then affiliate of 
the Houston Astros (1993-1998) and the Minnesota Twins (1999-2004). MLB 
Batting title winner Joe Mauer was a River Bandit during the Twins affiliation. 
In 2005 the Bandits became the Class A affiliate of the St. Louis Cardinals, 
before partnering again with Houston for the 2013 season.[15] During the 
2013 season, Quad Cities became the first team in Minor League history 
to have two back-to-back first overall draft picks on their roster when 
the Astros drafted Carlos Correa for 2012 and Mark Appel for 2013.[16] 
The franchise had been called "Davenport" until changing to "Quad City" 
in 1962. The modern franchise used the nickname of its major-league affiliate 
through the 1991 season. In 1992, the team created its own nickname for 
the first time in a "name the team' contest. Subsequently, the team was 
the Quad City River Bandits from 1992 through the 2003. On October 20, 
2003, the team was renamed the Swing of the Quad Cities; the nickname, 
like the previous one, was the winning entry in another "name the team" 
contest. However, On December 13, 2007, the team announced it would return 
to the "Quad Cities River Bandits" after voters in a contest (sponsored 
by the franchise's new owners, Dave Heller and Bob Herrfeldt of Main Street 
Baseball) chose the River Bandits name over "The Swing" and four other 
finalists: "Channel Cats", "The Current", "River Eagles", and "Talons."[17] 
The renaming of the Bandits has proven to be one of sports’ most successful 
rebranding campaigns – merchandise sales after the 2008 rebranding increased 
more than 400% (and were up an additional 34% in 2009), sponsorships jumped 
more than 64% in the first season, and CNBC named the team's logo one of 
the top eight in minor league baseball. After success in securing a Midwest 
League Franchise for Davenport beginning with the 1960 season, the non-profit 
Quad City Baseball Fans Association continued to operate the franchise 
from 1960 to 1986. In 1986 Chicago businessman Harry H. Semrow purchased 
the team from the association for $350,000, but Semrow was forced to sell 
after the 1987 season due to poor health. Richard Holtzman, another Chicago 
businessman who owned as many as five minor league teams, purchased the 
franchise from Semrow and remained as owner from 1987 until 1998. In 1998, 
Holtzman sold the team to Seventh Inning Stretch, a company owned by Kevin 
Krause, a businessman out of Mason City, Iowa, and son of Kum & Go co-founder 
William Krause. On December 28, 2006, Krause agreed to sell the team to 
Florida-based Main Street Baseball for an undisclosed price; the sale was 
completed on November 29, 2007.[18][19] Under Main Street Baseball's ownership, 
led by Dave Heller and Bob Herrfeldt, the River Bandits sparked a stunning 
resurgence of baseball in the Quad Cities, winning league championships 
in 2011 and 2013, setting new attendance records and capturing numerous 
awards for their innovative promotions.[20] Since Heller and Herrfeldt 
took over the Bandits, sponsorship sales, suite sales, ticket sales, and 
concession sales have all seen annual increases. The team's average attendance 
in its first year under Main Street rose by more than 56%, the largest 
such increase in baseball, and has climbed to nearly 3,700 fans per game. 
The Bandits have also led one of sports' most successful rebranding campaigns 
– merchandise sales after the 2008 rebranding increased more than 400% 
(and were up an additional 34% in 2009!), sponsorships jumped more than 
64% in the first season, and CNBC named the team's logo one of the top 
eight in minor league baseball. Main Street Baseball has also been a trail-blazer, 
having hired the Midwest League's only female general manager (Stefanie 
Brown) then hiring the only African-American GM in minor league baseball. 
The River Bandits have also consistently had more women in leadership positions 
than most any team in baseball. The River Bandits have also consistently 
had more women in leadership positions than most any team in baseball, 
and are the only minor league club to have won back-to-back Diversity Economic 
Impact Engagement (DEIE) Scholarships from major league baseball since 
MLB started awarding them in 2012. The River Bandits have been voted Best 
Family Entertainment by the Quad-City Times for each of the past five years 
and were recently voted by the River Cities Reader as "The Best Place for 
An Inexpensive Date that Doesn't Look Like It." The team won the prestigious 
"Golden Bobblehead" award in 2013 for best charitable promotion in Minor 
League Baseball for its innovative "Photo Jersey Auction" to benefit Autism 
Awareness. It also won a "Veeckie Award" from ESPN in 2009 for best minor 
league promotion ("Tattoo Night") and the "Promotion of the Year" Award 
from Ballpark Digest the same year for the team's "Mega-Candy Drop", as 
well as a Gold Award from the U.S. Army for its community service. The 
team has also won repeated awards for Heller's creative TV and radio ads, 
which have repeatedly been recognized as among the best in the industry.[20] 
Davenport teams of 1909–1916 played at a park located near 3rd and Telegraph 
Road.[4][21] Then, the Davenport Blue Sox of 1929 and 1930 played home 
games at the Mississippi Valley Fairgrounds, which had no lighting. To 
sustain a baseball franchise, the city of Davenport realized a new lighted 
stadium was needed, with a location near downtown. A stadium had been proposed 
by the Davenport Levee Commission and once approved, has provided a venue 
to anchor baseball in Davenport for the generations to follow. Unveiled 
on May 26, 1931 in Davenport's LeClaire Park, on the banks of the Mississippi 
River, the facility was constructed entirely with local labor for a construction 
cost $165,000, opening with a capacity of 4,000 fans in 1931. It was a 
modern marvel, opening complete with light towers (first night game was 
June 4, 1931) and a grandstand facing the Mississippi River. The 1931 Municipal 
Stadium was fondly nicknamed "The Muny."[4][21] In 1971, Municipal Stadium 
was renamed John O'Donnell Stadium in honor of the longtime sports editor 
of the Quad-City Times. The ballpark has shown its beauty and staying power, 
hosting Midwest League All-Star Games eight times: 1964, 1968, 1975, 1980, 
1982, 1990, 2006 and 2011. Many events have been held at the Stadium through 
the years. Some of historical note: Numerous high school and college football 
events were regularly played in the stadium. St. Ambrose University and 
Davenport Assumption High School used the venue for home football games 
for a number of years. The first football game in the Muny was hosted by 
St. Ambrose College in September, 1931. The old bleachers along left field/3rd 
base line had a football press box for a number of years. The last football 
game played at O'Donnell was in 1986, and demolition of the football stands 
began in 1987.[4][21] The team's home attendance record of 260,471 was 
set in 1994.[25] Sitting on the banks of the river, the stadium has survived 
many floods, including major Mississippi River floods of 1965, 1969, 1993 
and 2001, all of which breached the facility. Pictures of the flooded stadium 
are plentiful in the news media. The Great Flood of 1993 was especially 
damaging to the facility. Designed to combat the recurring and costly toll 
of flooding, a huge project was undertaken in 2004 to completely modernize 
and protect the facility. The project was a joint effort of The River Bandits 
and the City of Davenport . The result was a massive redesign of the field 
and grounds at Modern Woodmen Park. The entire structure and field of the 
original 1931 stadium were redone. Only the exterior façade of the old 
stadium remained, with concessions, concourses, level loge boxes, and seating 
areas being reconstructed. The improvements essentially created a new ballpark 
within the shell of the old park. Other 2004 renovations included a raised 
playing field; a slight shift of the playing field to better face the river; 
removal of the drive behind the outfield fence; the addition of a berm 
in the outfield and the addition of exterior brick/metal columns, put in 
place for decoration and also to hold portable flood walls to be inserted 
outside the stadium. The new protections secured and protected the facility 
during other major Mississippi River floods in 2008, 2011 and 2013. Before 
the 2004 renovations, flooding created financial and logistical problems, 
as the team was regularly forced to move "home" games to local facilities 
or other MWL venues (mostly Clinton, Iowa). The team played also several 
games at North Scott High School and Brady Street Stadium in 1993 and several 
games at Moline's Black Hawk College during the 2001 flood.[21] The new 
park has incorporated modern and creative features. Including a corn field 
beside left-field, from which the players are introduced.[21] The team 
also unveiled a $347,000 HD video board shortly before the Bandits hosted 
the 2011 Midwest League All-Star Game.[26] The renamed and remodeled Modern 
Woodmen Park was selected the Midwest Leagues best ballpark by Baseball 
America and earned a five-star rating from BallparkDigest.com.[27] In 2004, 
Author Tim Rask released a book titled Baseball at Davenport's John O'Donnell 
Stadium.[13] In 2007, stadium renaming rights went to Rock Island-based-Modern 
Woodmen of America for a reported $4.5 million.[21][27] Since then, Modern 
Woodmen Park has earned more accolades than any minor league ballpark in 
the country. It was voted "the best minor league ballpark in America" by 
the readers of USA Today and 10Best.com and the Midwest League's best ballpark 
by Baseball America. It also earned a 5-star rating from BallparkDigest.com, 
was named one of the two most beautiful ballparks in minor league baseball 
by USA Today, one of the top 10 in the nation by Parade Magazine, and was 
selected "the #2 Coolest Minor League Ballpark in America" by Complex Magazine.[28] 
Under Main Street Baseball's leadership, the River Bandits have added many 
fun new features to the ballpark, including a new outfield bar, a new picnic 
area, five concourse-level "loge boxes", an 80-foot long high-definition 
ribbon-board, a huge new 20' x 36' tall HD videoboard, a new playground, 
birthday room, additional office and storage space, a new concessions stand 
and more than a dozen new portable food carts, a Hall of Fame autographed 
jersey display, an unmatched collection of bobbleheads from across the 
country and a sponsored corn field from which the players are introduced 
at the game's outset.[20] In 2011, the Bandits unveiled their new Budweiser 
Champions Club, a 2500 s.f. glass-enclosed multi-purpose banquet hall with 
glass garage doors that open and close depending on the weather. That room 
has helped increase wedding business by more than 500%, and is regularly 
sold out during the Christmas season. It was voted by BallparkDigest.com 
as "the best ballpark renovation under $1 million."[29] In 2014, added 
a 110-foot tall Ferris Wheel to the landscape of the stadium, with the 
Ferris Wheel located behind the left-field wall. Also, a 30-foot tall Drop-N-Twist, 
a mechanized gyroscope and an old-fashioned carousel to go along with a 
dual 300-foot long zip line, six bounce houses and a 25-foot tall rock 
climbing wall are in play! Also added in 2014 were three new themed areas, 
including a 1,500 s.f. deck featuring a firepit to keep fans warm during 
April and May, 51 new swivel-chair seats adjacent to the field, and 18 
new extra-wide seats adjacent to the visitor's dugout, as well as four 
new padded seats set aside for veterans and active-duty military. In 2015, 
the franchise continued to improve the ballpark with a 10,000 s.f. expansion 
of the third-base concourse.[20] There have been numerous no-hitters by 
franchise pitchers since the team began play in the Midwest League:[30]
