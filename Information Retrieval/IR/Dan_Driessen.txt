Daniel Driessen (born July 29, 1951 in Hilton Head Island, South Carolina) 
is a former Major League Baseball infielder who played for five teams in 
his 15-year big-league career. He is best known as a member of the Cincinnati 
Reds "Big Red Machine" of the 1970s. Driessen was one of eight children, 
all raised by their mother, who was a maid, after his father died when 
Dan was six years old.[1][2] He attended Michael C. Riley High School (which 
did not have a baseball team) until his senior year. He then went to Hardeeville 
High School in Hardeeville, South Carolina, which also did not have a team, 
but he made a name for himself as a catcher with the town team, the Hardeeville 
Boll Weevils. His coach, Hal Young, wrote to Major League teams touting 
Driessen, and the Atlanta Braves and Reds showed interest. The Braves passed 
on him, but the Reds offered him a contract.[3] Driessen was signed by 
the Reds as an amateur free agent in 1969.[4] He made his major-league 
debut at age 21 on June 9, 1973 in an 8-4 Reds win over the Chicago Cubs 
at Wrigley Field. Starting at third base and batting sixth, he had one 
hit and one walk in five at-bats. His first career hit was a ninth-inning 
double off Jack Aker.[5] He had a productive rookie season, hitting .301 
with four home runs and 47 runs batted in. Driessen received the nickname 
"The Cobra" during his rookie season because of the quick, lethal way his 
bat struck.[6] He became Cincinnati's starting third baseman in 1974, but 
was soon replaced at that position by Pete Rose. In 1976, Driessen became 
the National League's first-ever designated hitter in a World Series. Although 
he went 0-4 in the series opener against the New York Yankees, overall 
he made the most of his opportunity by hitting .357 with five hits (including 
two doubles and a home run) and two walks in 16 plate appearances as the 
Reds swept the series for their second consecutive World Series crown.[7] 
He was part of the Reds' 1975 World Series-winning team, going hitless 
in two at-bats in the Reds' seven-game win over the Boston Red Sox.[8] 
He was the Reds' starting first baseman from 1977–1981 after the trade 
of Tony Pérez. His most productive year was in 1977 as he hit .300 with 
17 home runs and a career-high 91 runs batted in along with a career-high 
31 stolen bases. Driessen led all National League first basemen in fielding 
three times. He also led the NL in walks with 93 in 1980. He was traded 
in the middle of the 1984 season to the Montreal Expos. He saw significant 
playing time that season as well as in 1985 for the Expos and then, following 
another mid-season trade, to the San Francisco Giants. In 1986, his playing 
time fell significantly as, for the third consecutive season, he played 
for two teams, the Giants, who released him on May 1, and the Houston Astros, 
who signed him on June 2. He was released after the season and signed with 
the St. Louis Cardinals on June 9, 1987. Filling in at first base for the 
1987 National League champion Cardinals, in his third World Series he hit 
.231 in 14 plate appearances as the Cardinals fell in seven games to the 
Minnesota Twins. It was Driessen's final major-league season.[9] Driessen 
married his wife, Bonnie, in 1976 and they raised three daughters. In the 
early 1990s the family moved from Cincinnati to Hilton Head, where Driessen 
owns and operates Driessen Excavating Services and helps coach the Hilton 
Head High School baseball team.[10] He was inducted into the Cincinnati 
Reds Baseball Hall of Fame on June 23, 2012.[11] He is the uncle of former
