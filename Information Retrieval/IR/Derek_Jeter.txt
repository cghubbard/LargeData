Derek Sanderson Jeter (/ˈdʒiːtər/ JEE-tər) (born June 26, 1974) is an American 
former professional baseball shortstop who played 20 seasons in Major League 
Baseball (MLB) for the New York Yankees. A five-time World Series champion, 
Jeter is regarded as a central figure of the Yankees' success of the late 
1990s and early 2000s for his hitting, baserunning, fielding, and leadership. 
He is the Yankees' all-time career leader in hits (3,465), doubles (544), 
games played (2,747), stolen bases (358), times on base (4,716), plate 
appearances (12,602) and at bats (11,195).[1] His accolades include 14 
All-Star selections, five Gold Glove Awards, five Silver Slugger Awards, 
two Hank Aaron Awards, and a Roberto Clemente Award. Jeter became the 28th 
player to reach 3,000 hits and finished his career sixth all-time in career 
hits and the all-time MLB leader in hits by a shortstop. The Yankees drafted 
Jeter out of high school in 1992, and he debuted in the major leagues in 
1995. The following year, he became the Yankees' starting shortstop, won 
the Rookie of the Year Award, and helped the team win the 1996 World Series. 
Jeter continued to contribute during the team's championship seasons of 
1998–2000; he finished third in voting for the American League (AL) Most 
Valuable Player (MVP) Award in 1998, recorded multiple career-high numbers 
in 1999, and won both the All-Star Game MVP and World Series MVP Awards 
in 2000. He consistently placed among the AL leaders in hits and runs scored 
for most of his career, and served as the Yankees' team captain from 2003 
until his retirement in 2014. Throughout his career, Jeter contributed 
reliably to the Yankees' franchise successes. He holds many postseason 
records, and has a .321 batting average in the World Series. Jeter has 
earned the nicknames of "Captain Clutch" and "Mr. November" due to his 
outstanding play in the postseason. Jeter is one of the most heavily marketed 
athletes of his generation and is involved in several product endorsements. 
His personal life and relationships with celebrities have drawn the attention 
of the media throughout his career. Teammates and opponents alike regard 
Jeter as a consummate professional and one of the best players of his generation.[2] 
Jeter was born in Pequannock Township, New Jersey, on June 26, 1974. His 
mother, Dorothy (née Connors), an accountant, is of Irish, as well as some 
German and English, ancestry. His father, Sanderson Charles Jeter, Ph.D., 
a substance abuse counselor, is African-American.[3][4][5] They met while 
serving in the United States Army in Germany.[6] His father played baseball 
at Fisk University in Tennessee as a shortstop.[7] When Jeter was a child, 
his parents made him sign a contract every year that defined acceptable 
and unacceptable forms of behavior.[8] Dorothy instilled a positive attitude 
in her son, insisting that he not use the word "can't".[9] It was a baseball 
family, and Jeter's younger sister Sharlee (born c. 1979) was a softball 
star in high school.[6] The Jeters lived in New Jersey until Derek was 
4 years old, at which point they moved to Kalamazoo, Michigan.[10] Jeter 
and Sharlee lived in Kalamazoo with their parents during the school year 
and spent their summers with their grandparents in New Jersey. Attending 
New York Yankees games with his grandparents, Jeter became a passionate 
fan of the team.[7][10] Watching Yankees player Dave Winfield inspired 
him to pursue a career in baseball.[11] Jeter attended Kalamazoo Central 
High School, where he ran cross country in the fall, played basketball 
in the winter and baseball in the spring.[12] Jeter posted high batting 
averages for the school's baseball team; he batted .557 in his sophomore 
year and .508 as a junior.[10] In his senior year, he batted .508 and compiled 
23 runs batted in (RBI), 21 walks, four home runs, a .637 on-base percentage 
(OBP), a .831 slugging percentage (SLG), 12 stolen bases (in 12 attempts), 
and only one strikeout.[10] Jeter received several honors after his senior 
season. These included an All-State honorable mention, distinguishing him 
as one of the best high school baseball players in Michigan, the Kalamazoo 
Area B'nai B'rith Award for Scholar Athlete, the 1992 High School Player 
of the Year Award from the American Baseball Coaches Association, the 1992 
Gatorade High School Player of the Year award, and USA Today's High School 
Player of the Year.[10][13] Kalamazoo Central High School inducted Jeter 
into its Athletic Hall of Fame in 2003[14] and renamed its baseball field 
in his honor in 2011.[15] Jeter's baseball talents drew the attention of 
the University of Michigan, which offered him a baseball scholarship to 
attend and play college baseball for the Michigan Wolverines baseball team.[16] 
As a scout for the Houston Astros, Hal Newhouser evaluated Jeter extensively 
before the 1992 MLB draft. The Astros held the first overall pick in the 
draft, and Newhouser, convinced that Jeter would anchor a winning team, 
lobbied team management to select him.[16] The Astros feared that Jeter 
would insist on a salary bonus of at least $1 million to forgo his college 
scholarship for a professional contract,[16] so they passed on him, instead 
choosing Cal State Fullerton outfielder Phil Nevin, who signed with Houston 
for $700,000.[16] Newhouser felt so strongly about Jeter's potential that 
he quit his job with the Astros in protest after they ignored his drafting 
advice.[17] The Yankees, who selected sixth, also rated Jeter highly.[18] 
Yankees scout Dick Groch, assigned to scout in the Midwest, watched Jeter 
participate in an all-star camp held at Western Michigan University.[19] 
Though Yankees officials were concerned that Jeter would attend college 
instead of signing a professional contract, Groch convinced them to select 
him, saying, "the only place Derek Jeter's going is to Cooperstown".[20] 
The second through fifth picks were Paul Shuey, B. J. Wallace (who never 
played in the majors), Jeffrey Hammonds, and Chad Mottola (125 career MLB 
at-bats and over 5,000 at-bats at AAA); those five would combine for two 
All-Star Game appearances (Nevin and Hammonds).[21] The Yankees drafted 
Jeter, who chose to turn pro, signing for $800,000.[22] Jeter played four 
seasons in minor league baseball, then known as the National Association 
of Professional Baseball Leagues (NAPBL). Jeter began the 1992 season with 
the Gulf Coast Yankees of the Rookie-level Gulf Coast League, based in 
Tampa, Florida. In his first professional game, Jeter failed to get a hit 
in seven at-bats, going 0-for-7, while striking out five times.[23] Jeter 
continued to struggle during the rest of the season, batting .202 in 47 
games.[16][23] Manager Gary Denbo benched Jeter in the season's final game 
to ensure his average would not drop below .200, known in baseball as the 
Mendoza Line.[24] Frustrated by his lack of success and homesick, Jeter 
accrued $400-per-month phone bills from daily calls to his parents.[22][23] 
The Yankees promoted Jeter to the Greensboro Hornets of the Class A South 
Atlantic League (SAL) to give him more at-bats.[23] He batted .247 in his 
first 11 games with Greensboro, and struggled defensively, making nine 
errors in 48 chances.[23] Weighing 156 pounds (71 kg), Jeter had a scrawny 
appearance that did not match his reputation as the Yankees' future leader.[22] 
Jorge Posada and Andy Pettitte, who played for the Hornets that season, 
at first questioned the hype surrounding Jeter, but recognized his talent 
and poise.[23] Jeter focused the next offseason on his fielding.[16][24] 
Baseball America rated Jeter among the top 100 prospects in baseball before 
the 1993 season, ranking him 44th.[25] Returning to the Hornets in 1993, 
his first full season of professional baseball, Jeter hit .295 with five 
home runs, 71 RBI and 18 stolen bases; SAL managers voted him the "Most 
Outstanding Major League Prospect" in the league.[26] He finished second 
in the SAL in triples (11), third in hits (152), and eleventh in batting 
average, and was named to the postseason All-Star team.[13] Jeter committed 
56 errors, a SAL record.[24] Despite this, he was voted the SAL's Best 
Defensive Shortstop, Most Exciting Player, and Best Infield Arm by Baseball 
America.[13][27] Coming off his strong 1993 season, Baseball America rated 
Jeter as the 16th-best prospect in baseball.[25] Jeter played for the Tampa 
Yankees of the Class A-Advanced Florida State League (FSL), the Albany-Colonie 
Yankees of the Class AA Eastern League, and the Columbus Clippers of the 
Class AAA International League during the 1994 season,[28] combining to 
hit .344 with five home runs, 68 RBI, and steal 50 bases across the three 
levels. He was honored with the Minor League Player of the Year Award by 
Baseball America, The Sporting News, USA Today, and Topps/NAPBL.[13][16] 
He was also named the most valuable player of the FSL.[13] Considered the 
fourth-best prospect in baseball by Baseball America heading into the 1995 
season,[25] the Yankees projected Jeter as their starting shortstop. He 
suffered mild inflammation in his right shoulder in the Arizona Fall League 
after the conclusion of the 1994 regular season. As a precaution, the Yankees 
signed Tony Fernández to a two-year contract. With Fernández the starting 
shortstop, the Yankees assigned Jeter to Class AAA.[29] During the 1994–95 
Major League Baseball strike, Gene Michael, the Yankees' general manager, 
offered Jeter the opportunity to work out for the MLB team with replacement 
players in spring training before the 1995 season. Jeter denied receiving 
the offer, and did not cross the picket line.[29] Early in the 1995 season, 
Fernández and infielder Pat Kelly were injured. Consequently, Jeter made 
his MLB debut on May 29, 1995.[30] Jeter was assigned uniform number 2, 
which had been worn by Mike Gallego from 1992 to 1994, one of only two 
single-digit numbers available at the time.[31] Batting ninth, he went 
hitless in five at bats, striking out once.[32] The following day, he recorded 
his first two major league hits and scored his first two career runs.[33] 
Jeter batted .250[34] and committed two errors in 13 games before being 
demoted to Class AAA Columbus; Fernández replaced Jeter at shortstop.[35] 
The Yankees advanced to the postseason in 1995. Jeter traveled with the 
team during the 1995 American League Division Series (ALDS), though he 
was not on the active roster. The Yankees lost to the Seattle Mariners.[36] 
After Fernández batted a disappointing .245 and appeared in only 108 games 
due to injuries in 1995, newly hired Yankees manager Joe Torre asserted 
that Jeter would be the starting shortstop for the 1996 season,[37][38] 
indicating that he hoped Jeter could bat .250 and be dependable defensively.[39] 
Yankees owner George Steinbrenner, often skeptical of younger players, 
was not convinced. Clyde King, a close Steinbrenner advisor, observed Jeter 
for two days in spring training in 1996, and came away with the impression 
that Jeter was not yet ready.[40] To provide depth to the team at the shortstop 
position after an injury to Fernández, Steinbrenner approved a trade that 
would have sent pitcher Mariano Rivera to the Mariners for shortstop Félix 
Fermín, but Michael, by then the vice president of scouting, and assistant 
general manager Brian Cashman convinced Steinbrenner to give Jeter an opportunity.[41] 
Rated the sixth-best prospect in baseball by Baseball America heading into 
the 1996 season,[25] Jeter started on Opening Day, the first Yankee rookie 
to start as shortstop for the team since Tom Tresh in 1962.[10][a] He hit 
his first MLB home run that day.[39] With his speed and ability to execute 
the hit and run, Jeter served as a complement to leadoff hitter Tim Raines 
while batting in the ninth spot in the batting order.[43] Jeter had a successful 
rookie season, exceeding Torre's expectations, as he hit for a .314 batting 
average, with 10 home runs, 104 runs scored, and 78 RBI.[39] Receiving 
all 28 first-place votes in the AL Rookie of the Year balloting, Jeter 
was the fifth unanimous choice for the award in its 50-year history.[39][b] 
The Yankees reached the 1996 postseason, and Torre batted Jeter in the 
leadoff spot in the lineup due to his strong performance.[44] During Game 
1 of the 1996 American League Championship Series (ALCS), the Yankees trailed 
the Baltimore Orioles 4–3 in the 8th inning when Jeter hit a fly ball to 
right field that was ruled a home run by the umpires after twelve-year-old 
fan Jeffrey Maier reached over the wall to catch the ball. Though the ball 
would have remained in play if not for Maier, and could have been caught 
by Tony Tarasco, the home run stood as called, tying the game. It marked 
the first home run of Jeter's postseason career. The Yankees won the game 
and defeated the Orioles in five games.[45] Overall, Jeter batted .361 
in the 1996 postseason, helping to lead the Yankees offensively with Bernie 
Williams, as Wade Boggs, Paul O'Neill, and Tino Martinez struggled.[39] 
The Yankees defeated the Atlanta Braves in the 1996 World Series to win 
their first championship since the 1978 World Series.[46] Following his 
Rookie of the Year campaign, Jeter headlined a group considered the "new 
crop" of shortstops, along with Alex Rodriguez and Nomar Garciaparra, as 
the careers of older shortstops such as Cal Ripken, Jr., Barry Larkin, 
Ozzie Smith and Alan Trammell were concluding.[47] Rodriguez, the first 
overall selection in the 1993 MLB draft, first contacted Jeter about his 
experiences as a high-first round pick. The two became friends to the extent 
that The New York Times journalist Jack Curry commented "[r]arely have 
two higher-profile opponents been as close". Rodriguez described Jeter 
as being "like my brother", even though they were on-field adversaries.[48] 
Before the 1997 season, Jeter and the Yankees agreed on a $540,000 contract 
with performance bonuses.[49] Becoming the Yankees' leadoff batter,[50] 
Jeter batted .291, with 10 home runs, 70 RBI, 116 runs, and 190 hits.[51] 
Though he hit two home runs during the 1997 American League Division Series, 
the Yankees lost to the Cleveland Indians, three games to two.[52] Jeter 
earned $750,000 for the 1998 season.[53] That year, Jeter was selected 
for his first All-Star Game. In the regular season, he batted .324 with 
a league-leading 127 runs, 19 home runs, and 84 RBI,[51] for a team that 
won 114 games during the regular season and is widely considered to be 
one of the greatest of all time.[54][55] In the playoffs, Jeter hit only 
.176 in the 1998 ALDS and ALCS, but batted .353 in the World Series, as 
the Yankees defeated the San Diego Padres in four games.[56] At season's 
end, Jeter finished third in voting for the AL Most Valuable Player (MVP) 
Award.[57] Eligible for salary arbitration for the first time before the 
1999 season, the arbitrator awarded Jeter a $5 million salary.[58] Jeter 
led the AL in hits that season with 219, while finishing second in the 
league in batting average (.349) and runs scored (134), appearing in his 
second All-Star game that year.[51] His season totals in batting average, 
runs, hits, runs batted in, doubles (37), triples (9), home runs (24), 
SLG (.552), and OBP (.438) are all personal bests.[51] Jeter, who for part 
of the year hit third in the batting order, also drove in 102 runs, becoming 
only the second Yankee shortstop to do so, following Lyn Lary's 107 RBI 
in 1931.[51] In the postseason, Jeter batted .455 in the ALDS, .350 in 
the ALCS, and .353 in the World Series,[51] as the Yankees defeated the 
Braves to win another championship, Jeter's third.[59] During the 1999–2000 
offseason, the Yankees negotiated with Jeter, tentatively agreeing to a 
seven-year, $118.5 million contract.[60] Steinbrenner did not want to set 
a record for the largest contract, and delayed a response while Juan González 
and the Detroit Tigers negotiated on a reported eight-year, $143 million 
contract extension. When that agreement fell through, so did Jeter's tentative 
deal. To avoid arbitration, Jeter and the Yankees agreed to a one-year 
deal worth $10 million.[60][61] Jeter batted a team-best .339 in the 2000 
regular season and added 15 home runs, 73 RBI, 119 runs scored, and 22 stolen 
bases.[51][60] In the 2000 MLB All-Star Game, he recorded three hits, including 
a two-run single that gave his team the lead and victory. The performance 
earned him the All-Star Game MVP Award, the first time a Yankee won the 
award.[62] During the postseason, he batted only .211 in the Division Series 
but rebounded to hit .318 in the Championship Series against the Seattle 
Mariners, and .409 in the World Series against the New York Mets.[51] Jeter 
added two home runs, a triple, and two doubles in the World Series, including 
a leadoff home run on the first pitch of Game 4 and a triple later in the 
third inning.[63] His home run in Game 5 tied the game and extended his 
World Series hitting streak to 14 games.[64] The Yankees defeated the Mets 
in five games for their third consecutive title and fourth in Jeter's first 
five full seasons.[60][65] Jeter won the World Series MVP Award, becoming 
the only player to win the All-Star Game MVP and World Series MVP Awards 
in the same season.[66] With one year remaining until he would become eligible 
for free agency, Jeter signed a ten-year, $189 million contract before 
the 2001 season to remain with the Yankees.[60] Alex Rodriguez had signed 
a ten-year, $252 million contract with the Texas Rangers earlier in the 
offseason, setting the market for Jeter's negotiations. Jeter became the 
second-highest-paid athlete across all team sports and auto racing, trailing 
only Rodriguez. The $18.9 million average annual value of Jeter's contract 
was the third-highest in baseball, behind only Rodriguez ($25.2 million) 
and Manny Ramirez ($20 million).[60] In 2001, Jeter posted another strong 
season, batting .311 with 21 home runs, 74 RBI, 110 runs scored, and 27 stolen 
bases, making his fourth All-Star appearance.[51] Jeter made a notable 
defensive assist in Game 3 of the 2001 American League Division Series 
against the Oakland Athletics. With Jeremy Giambi on first base, Oakland 
right fielder Terrence Long hit a double off Yankees pitcher Mike Mussina 
into the right-field corner. As Giambi rounded third base and headed for 
home plate, Yankees right fielder Shane Spencer retrieved the ball and 
made a wild throw that missed cut-off man Tino Martinez and dribbled down 
the first-base line. Jeter ran from shortstop to grab the ball and flipped 
it backhanded to catcher Jorge Posada, rather than throwing it overhand.[67] 
Posada tagged Giambi out on the leg just before he crossed home plate, 
preserving the Yankees' one-run lead. Facing elimination, the Yankees eventually 
won the game, as well as the series. The play, known as "The Flip",[10] 
was later voted seventh in Baseball Weekly's 10 Most Amazing Plays of all 
time,[67] and won the 2002 Best Play ESPY Award.[68] As a result of the 
September 11 attacks, the start of the playoffs was delayed and the season's 
end was extended past the usual October timeframe. The Yankees advanced 
to the 2001 World Series to face the Arizona Diamondbacks. Game 4 marked 
the first time that any non-exhibition MLB game had been played in the 
month of November.[10] In extra innings, Jeter hit a game-winning home 
run off of Byung-Hyun Kim. The words "Mr. November" flashed on the scoreboard, 
alluding to former Yankee Reggie Jackson's nickname, "Mr. October".[10] 
Despite the home run, Jeter slumped at the plate; he denied injuries were 
a factor, though a fall into a photographer's box trying to catch a foul 
ball may have aggravated an earlier hamstring injury.[69] Jeter batted 
.148 in the World Series, as the Yankees lost in seven games.[70] Jeter 
batted .297, with 18 home runs, 75 RBI, 124 runs scored, 191 hits, and 
a career-best 32 stolen bases during the 2002 regular season. He led the 
majors in stolen base percentage (91.4%), getting caught only three times. 
He made his fifth All-Star appearance.[51] In the 2002 postseason, the 
Anaheim Angels defeated the Yankees in the ALDS on their way to winning 
the World Series.[71] On Opening Day of the 2003 season, Jeter dislocated 
his left shoulder when he collided with Toronto Blue Jays catcher Ken Huckaby 
at third base.[72] He was placed on the disabled list for six weeks and 
missed 36 games; he had never played fewer than 148 games in the prior 
seven full seasons.[73] Jeter returned to bat .324, finishing third in 
batting average to Bill Mueller, who batted .326. Ramirez finished second.[74][75] 
Steinbrenner named Jeter the captain of the Yankees on June 3, 2003, following 
eight seasons without a captain after Don Mattingly retired in 1995.[76] 
That postseason, Jeter batted .314 with two home runs, five RBI and 10 
runs scored across 17 playoff games,[75] including three hits in Game 3 
of the 2003 World Series against the Florida Marlins – the only three hits 
Josh Beckett allowed during the game.[77] Jeter committed a crucial error 
in a Game 6 loss, and the Marlins won the series in six games.[75] The 
Yankees acquired Rodriguez from the Texas Rangers during the 2003–04 offseason. 
Rodriguez had won two Gold Glove Awards at shortstop[78] and was considered 
the best shortstop in baseball.[48] Jeter—who had no Gold Gloves at the 
time—remained the team's starting shortstop while Rodriguez moved to third 
base.[78] Rodriguez's fielding range allowed Jeter to cede ground to his 
right to Rodriguez and cheat to his left: fielding balls hit to his left 
is a weakness identified by scouts.[79] The 2004 season began with Jeter 
mired in a slump, at one point getting only one hit in a span of 36 at-bats; 
through April, he batted .168. His batting average improved to .277 by 
the All-Star break in July.[80] Jeter made the All-Star team and finished 
the season with a .292 average; 23 home runs, the second-most of his career; 
78 RBI; 111 runs scored; and a career-best 44 doubles, which broke the 
Yankee single-season record for doubles by a shortstop, besting Tony Kubek's 
38 in 1961.[51][81] He batted .316 with a team-leading four RBI as the 
Yankees defeated the Minnesota Twins in the 2004 ALDS.[82] Jeter struggled 
in the 2004 ALCS, batting .200 with one extra base hit, as the Yankees 
lost the series to the Red Sox in seven games, despite winning the first 
three games.[83] In the 12th inning of a tied game on July 1, 2004, against 
their rivals, the Boston Red Sox, Trot Nixon hit a pop fly down the left 
field line. Jeter ran from his position at shortstop and made an over-the-shoulder 
catch. He launched himself over the third-base side railing and two rows 
of seats, receiving a lacerated chin and bruised face. The Yankees went 
on to win the game in the bottom of the 13th inning.[84] This was voted 
the Play of the Year in the This Year in Baseball Awards competition, as 
voted on by fans at MLB.com.[85] Following the 2004 season, Jeter was presented 
with his first Gold Glove Award; his diving catch on July 1 was cited as 
a reason for the award.[86] Though Jeter was fourth among shortstops in 
fielding percentage and errors, two traditional fielding statistics, critics 
pointed to his lower ratings in the more advanced sabermetric statistics, 
such as range factor and ultimate zone rating (UZR).[87] Jeter was second 
in the AL in runs scored (122) in the 2005 season,[88] and was third in 
the league in both at bats (654) and hits (202). Though his critics continued 
to see Jeter as a liability defensively, he won his second consecutive 
Gold Glove in 2005. Orlando Cabrera of the Angels had a higher fielding 
percentage and committed fewer errors, but voters noted that Jeter had 
more assists.[89] Though Jeter batted .333 during the 2005 ALDS, the Yankees 
lost to the Angels.[90] For the 2006 season, the Yankees signed Johnny 
Damon to play center field and lead off, moving Jeter to the second position 
in the batting lineup.[91] During the 2006 season, Jeter recorded his 2,000th 
career hit, becoming the eighth Yankee to reach the milestone.[92] Jeter 
finished the season second in the AL in both batting average (.343) and 
runs scored (118), third in hits (214), and fourth in OBP (.417), earning 
his seventh All-Star selection.[51][93][94] Jeter batted .500 with one 
home run in the 2006 ALDS, including a perfect 5-for-5 performance in Game 
1, making him the sixth player to record five hits in one postseason game.[95] 
The Yankees lost to the Detroit Tigers, three games to one.[90] Many expected 
Jeter would win the AL MVP Award for 2006.[96] In a close vote, Jeter finished 
second in the voting to Justin Morneau of the Twins.[97][c] It was his 
sixth top-10 finish in the MVP balloting in 11 full seasons through 2006.[51] 
Though he lost the MVP Award, he won the Hank Aaron Award, given for superior 
offensive performance.[93] He also won his third consecutive Gold Glove 
Award.[98] Though the Yankees continued to struggle with postseason failures, 
Jeter remained a consistent contributor.[99] During the 2007 season, Jeter 
was third in the AL with 203 hits, his third consecutive season and sixth 
overall, with at least 200 hits. He also finished ninth in batting average 
(.322).[100] He was selected for his eighth All-Star appearance.[51] In 
the field, he was involved in turning a career-high 104 double plays.[51] 
He struggled during the 2007 ALDS, batting 3-for-17 (.176) with one RBI, 
as the Indians defeated the Yankees.[90] Jeter hit his 400th career double 
on June 27, 2008,[101] and his 200th home run on July 12.[102] Jeter's 
slugging percentage (SLG) dropped to .410 in the 2008 season, his lowest 
mark since 1997.[51] His offense took an upward turn after May as he hit 
.322 with a .824 OPS after June 1.[51] Jeter was elected to his ninth All-Star 
game as the starting shortstop.[103] He finished the season with a .300 
batting average.[51] Jeter tied Lou Gehrig's record for hits at Yankee 
Stadium (1,269) with a home run off Tampa Bay Rays pitcher David Price 
on September 14, 2008.[104] On September 16, he broke the record against 
Chicago White Sox pitcher Gavin Floyd.[105] The Yankees were eliminated 
from postseason contention,[106] the only full season in Jeter's career 
where he did not compete in the playoffs. Following the final game in Yankee 
Stadium history, Jeter made a speech at the request of the Yankees, thanking 
the Yankees fans for their support—a moment later voted by fans as the 
Moment of the Year in MLB.com's This Year in Baseball Awards:[107] From 
all of us up here, it's a huge honor to put this uniform on every day and 
come out here and play. Every member of this organization, past and present, 
has been calling this place home for 85 years. There's a lot of tradition, 
a lot of history and a lot of memories. The great thing about memories 
is you're able to pass them along from generation to generation. Although 
things are going to change next year and we're going to move across the 
street, there are a few things with the New York Yankees that never change. 
That's pride, tradition and most of all, we have the greatest fans in the 
world. We're relying on you to take the memories from this stadium and 
add them to the new memories we make at the new Yankee Stadium and continue 
to pass them on from generation to generation. We just want to take this 
moment to salute you, the greatest fans in the world.[108] For the 2009 
season, Yankees manager Joe Girardi switched Jeter and Damon in the batting 
order, with Damon moving to second and Jeter to the leadoff role.[109] 
Jeter batted .334, third-best in the AL, with a .406 OBP, 18 home runs, 
30 stolen bases in 35 attempts, 107 runs scored, and 212 hits (second in 
MLB).[51] Defensively, Jeter committed a career-low eight errors, and his 
.986 fielding percentage was his career best.[110] The addition of Gold 
Glove-winning first baseman Mark Teixeira allowed second baseman Robinson 
Canó to shift his focus to his right, helping Jeter.[111] During the season, 
the Sporting News named Jeter eighth on their list of the 50 greatest current 
players in baseball.[112] Jeter achieved two career hit milestones in the 
second half of the 2009 season. On August 16, 2009, against the Seattle 
Mariners, Jeter doubled down the right-field line for his 2,675th hit as 
a shortstop, breaking Luis Aparicio's previous major league record.[113] 
Then, Jeter became the all-time hits leader as a member of the Yankees 
(2,722), passing Lou Gehrig on September 11, 2009. The hit was a single 
off Baltimore Orioles pitcher Chris Tillman in the third inning.[114] In 
the 2009 postseason, Jeter batted .355, including .407 in the 2009 World 
Series,[51] as he won his fifth World Series championship. He was named 
Sportsman of the Year for 2009 by Sports Illustrated,[115] and won the 
Roberto Clemente Award, Hank Aaron Award,[116] and his fourth Gold Glove 
Award.[110] Jeter also finished third in the AL MVP voting, behind Minnesota's 
Joe Mauer and Yankee teammate Mark Teixeira.[117] It was also the fifth 
championship for Pettitte, Posada, and Rivera, who along with Jeter were 
referred to as the "Core Four".[118] In 2010, Jeter, along with Posada 
and Rivera, became the first trio of teammates in any of the four major 
league sports in North America (MLB, NFL, NBA, or NHL) to play in at least 
16 consecutive seasons on the same team as teammates.[119] The 2010 season 
was statistically Jeter's worst in many respects.[120][121] The Yankee 
captain batted .270 with a .340 OBP and .370 SLG, all career lows,[121] 
as he hit more ground balls than usual.[122] Despite this, Jeter was elected 
to start at shortstop in the All-Star Game.[123] He rebounded to bat .342 
in his last 79 at-bats after making adjustments to his swing with the help 
of Kevin Long, the Yankees hitting coach, who had successfully helped Nick 
Swisher and Curtis Granderson make adjustments that improved their production. 
With Long, Jeter changed the way he strode with his left leg.[120][124] 
Following the season, Jeter won his fifth Gold Glove award.[125] Jeter 
committed six errors during the season, his lowest total in 15 full seasons.[126] 
"He might go down, when it's all over, as the all-time Yankee." After the 
2010 season, Jeter became a free agent for the first time in his career. 
At age 36, Jeter appeared to be in decline; Joe Sheehan of Baseball Prospectus 
suggested that Jeter, once a "good, not great" shortstop, had declined 
to become "below average" defensively,[121] to the extent that he would 
likely need to change positions; Cashman later acknowledged that Jeter 
might need to shift to the outfield.[127] Though Jeter stated that he wanted 
to remain with the Yankees, negotiations became tense. Jeter's agent, Casey 
Close, stated that he was "baffled" by the Yankees' approach to the negotiations, 
and Cashman, now the team's general manager, responded publicly that Jeter 
should test the open market to ascertain his value, which angered Jeter.[128] 
According to reports, Jeter initially sought a four-year contract worth 
between $23 million and $25 million per season.[129] He reached an agreement 
with the Yankees on a three-year contract for $51 million with an option 
for a fourth year.[128] He spent the offseason working with Long on adjustments 
to his swing.[130][131] The adjustments left Jeter frustrated, as he batted 
.242 in the first month of the 2011 season.[132] As he struggled, it appeared 
that the 2011 season was the continuation of Jeter's decline.[133][134] 
Jeter broke Rickey Henderson's franchise record for stolen bases when he 
stole his 327th base against the Mariners on May 28, 2011.[135] He suffered 
a calf injury on June 13 that required his fifth stint on the 15-day disabled 
list, and his first since 2003.[136][137] At that point, he was batting 
.260 for the 2011 season with a .649 OPS.[138] Rehabilitating from his 
injury in Tampa, Jeter worked on his swing with Denbo, his former minor 
league manager.[139][140] With Denbo, Jeter returned to the mechanics he 
used in his minor league days.[131] Following his activation from the disabled 
list, he hit .326 with an .806 OPS in his last 64 games of the season.[138] 
Jeter finished the year with a .297 batting average, 6 home runs, 61 runs 
batted in, 84 runs, and 16 stolen bases.[51] He credited the turnaround 
to his work with Denbo;[139] Long acknowledged that his attempt to adjust 
Jeter's swing did not work.[131] On July 9, 2011, Jeter recorded his 3,000th 
career hit, a home run off of David Price of the Tampa Bay Rays. Jeter 
finished the day with five hits in five at-bats, the second player to have 
five hits on the day he achieved his 3,000th hit (the first was Craig Biggio).[141] 
He also became the second player to hit a home run for his 3,000th hit, 
Wade Boggs having done so in 1999. The last of Jeter's five hits proved 
to be the game-winning hit. He is the only member of the 3,000 hit club 
to record all of his hits with the New York Yankees, and the only player 
to join the club as a Yankee.[142] Jeter became the second player to reach 
3,000 career hits while still a regular shortstop (the first was Honus 
Wagner).[143][144][d] Only Ty Cobb, Hank Aaron, and Robin Yount were younger 
than Jeter on the day of their 3,000th hit.[143] MLB and HBO produced Deter 
Jeter 3K, a documentary that profiled his path to 3,000 hits and originally 
aired on July 28, 2011.[147] Fatigued from the stress of chasing 3,000 
career hits and wanting to rest his calf, Jeter opted not to attend the 
2011 MLB All-Star Game.[148][149] Jeter and Posada played their 1,660th 
game together on July 14, 2011, breaking the previous franchise record 
of 1,659 by Gehrig and Tony Lazzeri.[150] Jeter played his 2,402nd game 
with the Yankees on August 29, 2011, breaking Mickey Mantle's record for 
most games played as a Yankee.[151] He finished the 2011 season with 162 
hits, his 16th consecutive season with 150 hits, which tied him with Pete 
Rose for the second-most consecutive 150-hit seasons, one behind Hank Aaron 
for the MLB record.[152] Jeter was honored with the Lou Gehrig Memorial 
Award, given in recognition of charitable endeavors.[153] Despite continuing 
concerns about his age, the beginning of the 2012 season saw Jeter on a 
hot streak: he batted .411 through April 23.[122] Rodriguez commented that 
Jeter is playing as he did in 1999, while Girardi said Jeter looks like 
he is 25 years old.[154] In the 2012 MLB All-Star Game, Jeter recorded 
his eleventh All-Star hit, passing Mantle for the most All-Star Game hits 
in Yankees history.[155] Jeter went 1-for-2 in the game, moving into fourth 
all-time with a .458 average among players with a minimum of 12 plate appearances 
in the All-Star Game.[156] Jeter finished the 2012 season with the most 
hits in MLB (216).[157] Against the Tampa Bay Rays on September 14 of that 
year, he moved into the Top 10 on the all-time hit list, surpassing Willie 
Mays by beating out an infield single for his 3,284th career hit.[158] 
After hitting .364 in the 2012 ALDS, Jeter fractured his left ankle during 
Game 1 of the 2012 ALCS against the Detroit Tigers reaching for a ground 
ball, an injury which ended his season.[159] Jeter had received a cortisone 
shot to treat a bone bruise in his left foot in September, which could 
have contributed to the break. Jeter had surgery on his broken left ankle 
on October 20, with an expected recovery time of four to five months.[160] 
While rehabilitating, Jeter suffered a small crack in the area of his previous 
ankle fracture. As a result, Jeter began the 2013 season on the disabled 
list.[161][162] The Yankees activated Jeter on July 11,[163] but after 
playing in one game, Jeter returned to the disabled list with a quadriceps 
strain.[164] He returned to the Yankees lineup on July 28, hitting a home 
run on the first pitch off of Matt Moore of Tampa Bay.[165] Jeter was again 
placed on the 15-day disabled list on August 5 due to a Grade 1 calf strain, 
and after a brief return to the lineup, he was placed on the 15-day disabled 
list for a third time on September 11 due to problems with his ankle, ending 
his season.[166] On September 14, 2013 Jeter was transferred to the 60-day 
disabled list.[167] Jeter batted .190 in only 17 games played during the 
2013 season.[168] Jeter re-signed with the Yankees on a one-year, $12 million 
contract for the 2014 season.[169] Jeter announced on his Facebook page 
on February 12, 2014, that the 2014 season would be his last.[170] During 
his final season, each opposing team honored Jeter with a gift during his 
final visit to their city, which has included donations to Jeter's charity, 
the Turn 2 Foundation.[171] On July 10, Jeter recorded his 1,000th career 
multi-hit game, becoming the fourth player to do so.[172] He was elected 
to start at shortstop in the 2014 All-Star Game, and batted leadoff for 
the AL.[173] Jeter went 2 for 2, scored one run and received two standing 
ovations in the four innings he played at the 2014 All-Star Game.[174] 
As a result, Jeter's .481 career All-Star batting average (13 for 27) ranked 
him fifth all-time (among players with at least 10 at-bats). At 40, Jeter 
also became the oldest player to have two or more hits in an All-Star Game.[175] 
In July, Jeter broke Omar Vizquel's MLB career record of 2,609 games started 
at shortstop, and Gehrig's franchise career record of 534 doubles.[176] 
On July 17, Derek scored the 1,900th run of his career becoming the 10th 
player in MLB history to do so.[177] Jeter passed Carl Yastrzemski for 
seventh place on MLB's all-time career hit list on July 28[178] and on 
August 11 he passed Honus Wagner climbing to sixth on the all-time hits 
list.[179] The Yankees honored Jeter with a pregame tribute on September 
7.[180][181] Beginning with that day's game, the Yankees wore a patch on 
their hats and uniforms honoring Jeter for the remainder of the season.[182][183] 
In the final week of Jeter's career, MLB Commissioner Bud Selig honored 
him as the 15th recipient of the Commissioner's Historic Achievement Award 
for being "one of the most accomplished shortstops of all-time".[184] During 
Jeter's final series at Yankee Stadium, Louisville Slugger announced they 
would retire their "P72" model baseball bat, the bat Jeter uses, though 
it will be sold under the name "DJ2", in Jeter's honor.[185] The average 
ticket price for Jeter's final home game, on September 25, reached $830 
on the secondary market.[186] In his final game at Yankee Stadium, Jeter 
hit a walk-off single against Orioles pitcher Evan Meek to win the game, 
6–5.[187] Jeter decided to play exclusively as the designated hitter in 
the final series of his career, at Fenway Park in Boston, so that his final 
memories of playing shortstop would be at Yankee Stadium.[188] The Red 
Sox honored Jeter with a pregame ceremony including Red Sox retired stars 
Carl Yastrzemski, Jim Rice, Fred Lynn, Luis Tiant and Rico Petrocelli, 
the Boston Bruins' Bobby Orr, New England Patriots receiver Troy Brown 
and the Boston Celtics' Paul Pierce, while many Boston fans at Fenway Park 
loudly cheered for Jeter and gave him a standing ovation.[189] In his final 
at-bat, he hit an RBI infield single against Clay Buchholz, before being 
substituted for pinch runner Brian McCann;[190] he received an ovation 
from the Red Sox fans as he exited the field.[191] Jeter started at shortstop 
for the United States national baseball team in the 2006 World Baseball 
Classic. He hit 9-for-20 (.450) and scored five runs in six games. Only 
teammate Ken Griffey, Jr. (.524) and Cuba's Yoandy Garlobo (.480) had a 
higher batting average with a minimum of 20 at-bats.[192] Jeter's play 
earned him recognition as the shortstop selection on the All-Tournament 
Team.[193] In the 2009 World Baseball Classic, Jeter again started at shortstop. 
He was named captain of the United States team by manager Davey Johnson,[194] 
and he batted 8-for-29 (.276) in eight games.[195] Jeter and the United 
States team faced the Yankees at Steinbrenner Field in an exhibition game, 
the only time Jeter played against the Yankees.[196] Jeter is considered 
to be one of the most consistent baseball players of all time.[197] He 
played fewer than 145 games a season only three times in his career: when 
he dislocated his left shoulder on Opening Day 2003 (119 games), when he 
injured his calf in 2011 (131 games), and in 2013 when he struggled with 
a myriad of injuries (17 games).[51] For his career, he averaged 204 hits, 
113 runs scored and 21 stolen bases per 162 games.[51] He is currently 
6th on the all-time hits list in Major League Baseball history.[198] Highly 
competitive, Jeter once said, "If you're going to play at all, you're out 
to win. Baseball, board games, playing Jeopardy!, I hate to lose."[199] 
Seen as one of the best players of his generation,[200] sportswriters believe 
that Jeter will be inducted on the 1st ballot into the Baseball Hall of 
Fame following his retirement, and could be a unanimous selection.[201][202] 
"Derek Jeter has always been above the fray. As someone who's wallowed 
in it, 'foot-in-mouthed' it hundreds of times, said dumb things and backed 
up dumber ones, it's refreshing. He's shown up, played, and turned in a 
first-ballot Hall of Fame career in the hardest environment in sports to 
do any/all of the above." An aggressive hitter, Jeter swings at most pitches 
in the strike zone, and many near it.[16] Though right-handed hitters often 
pull the ball into left field, Jeter's signature inside-out swing, dubbed 
the "Jeterian Swing",[204] results in most of his hits going to center 
and right field. Similarly, most of his home runs have been hit to right 
field than to center or to left, as his swing takes advantage of Yankee 
Stadium's close right-field fences.[205] Jeter is also known for his professionalism. 
In an age where professional athletes often find themselves in personal 
scandals, Jeter has mostly avoided major controversy in a high-profile 
career in New York City while maintaining a strong work ethic.[8][202][206][207] 
Due to his style of play, opponents and teammates hold Jeter in high esteem.[203][206] 
A clubhouse leader, Jeter defuses confrontations between teammates.[206] 
Jeter is noted for his postseason performances, and has earned the titles 
of "Captain Clutch", and "Mr. November" due to his outstanding postseason 
play.[208][209][210][211] He has a career .309 postseason batting average, 
and a .321 batting average in the World Series. Except for 2008, 2013 and 
2014, the Yankees have been to the postseason every year since Jeter joined 
the team. Jeter holds MLB postseason records for games played (158), plate 
appearances (734), at-bats (650), hits (200), singles (143), doubles (32), 
triples (5), runs scored (111), total bases (302) and strikeouts (135). 
Jeter is also third in home runs (20), fourth in runs batted in (61), fifth 
in base on balls (66) and sixth in stolen bases (18).[212] Jeter has won 
five Gold Glove Awards, trailing only Vizquel, Ozzie Smith, Luis Aparicio, 
Dave Concepción, and Mark Belanger for most by a shortstop.[213] He is 
credited with positioning himself well and for a quick release when he 
throws the ball.[214] One of his signature defensive plays is the "jump-throw", 
by which he leaps and throws to first base while moving towards third base.[215] 
Despite this, Jeter's defense has been the subject of criticism from a 
number of sabermetricians, including Rob Neyer and the publication Baseball 
Prospectus.[216][217][218] The 2006 book The Fielding Bible by John Dewan 
contains an essay by Bill James in which he concludes that Jeter "was probably 
the most ineffective defensive player in the major leagues, at any position" 
over his entire career.[219] A 2008 study by researchers at the University 
of Pennsylvania found that, from 2002 through 2005, Jeter was the worst 
defensive shortstop in MLB.[220] Two sites that rely on advanced defensive 
statistics, FanGraphs.com and FieldingBible.com, rated Jeter below middle-of-the-pack 
status in 2010, despite his receiving his fifth Gold Glove Award that season.[221][222] 
Jeter committed 18 errors in 2007, his highest total since finishing with 
24 in 2000.[223] After the season, Cashman and his staff saw Jeter's defense 
as an area that needed to be addressed.[224] At the Yankees' request, Jeter 
embarked on a rigorous training program to combat the effects of age, by 
focusing on lateral movement and first-step quickness.[225] Jeter's ultimate 
zone rating (UZR) improved from worst in the AL for shortstops in 2007 
to close to league average in 2008.[224] When asked to respond to criticism 
of his defense, Jeter replied: "I play in New York, man. Criticism is part 
of the game, you take criticism as a challenge."[223] Jeter further asserted 
that many defensive factors cannot be quantified.[126] The controversy 
over Jeter's fielding has become a flash point for the debate over whether 
the analyses of statistics or subjective observation is the better method 
to assess a player's defensive ability, and for criticism of the Gold Glove 
Award.[226] Jeter maintains homes in Marlboro Township, New Jersey; Greenwood 
Lake, New York;[227] and the Davis Islands neighborhood of Tampa, Florida.[228] 
He previously owned a penthouse apartment in Manhattan's Trump World Tower.[229] 
Regarding his official residence, Jeter settled a tax dispute with the 
New York State Department of Taxation and Finance in 2008.[230] New York 
State alleged that Jeter should have paid state income tax from 2001 to 
2003, as Jeter resided in the Manhattan apartment he bought in 2001; Jeter 
claimed to have established his residence in Tampa, Florida, in 1994 and 
that he was still a resident of Florida at the time. Florida has no state 
income tax.[231][232] Jeter's personal life has been a frequent topic in 
gossip columns and celebrity magazines since his rookie year in 1996. He 
had a well-publicized relationship with singer Mariah Carey from 1997 to 
1998.[10][233] Jeter also had a relationship with model Vida Guerra. Jeter 
has also dated former Miss Universe Lara Dutta,[10][234] singer Joy Enriquez,[235] 
television personality Vanessa Minnillo,[233] and the actresses Jordana 
Brewster,[10][236] Jessica Biel,[237][238] Minka Kelly,[239][240][241] 
and model Hannah Davis.[242] In December 2002, Yankees owner George Steinbrenner 
criticized Jeter for staying out until 3 a.m. at a birthday party during 
the 2002 season, saying that his star shortstop "wasn't totally focused" 
and that "it didn't sit well" with him.[243] The two mocked the incident 
in a May 2003 VISA commercial,[71] similar to the manner in which Steinbrenner 
and former Yankees manager Billy Martin made light of their feud in a Miller 
Lite commercial during the 1970s.[244] Jeter and Davis became engaged in 
2015. She bought Jeter an Italian Mastiff named Kane for Christmas in 2014. 
Jeter never had pets as a child, and attributed his fear of dogs to the 
movie Cujo.[245][246] In July 2016, Jeter and Davis were married.[247] 
During his injury-shortened 2013 season, Jeter arranged a partnership with 
Simon & Schuster to form an imprint called Jeter Publishing. He called 
it "the blueprint for postcareer". It will begin publishing nonfiction 
books for adults, children's picture books, elementary grade fiction, and 
books for children who are learning to read, and could lead to film and 
television productions.[248] On October 1, 2014, Jeter's new website, ThePlayersTribune.com, 
appeared online;[249] it was billed as "a new media platform that will 
present the unfiltered voice of professional athletes, bringing fans closer 
to the games they love than ever before".[250] It was reported by the Tampa 
Bay Business Journal in March 2015 that Jeter had partnered with Concessions 
Tampa to bid for a space within the Tampa International Airport, and plans 
to open a restaurant named after his website.[251][252] Jeter also serves 
as a brand development officer for Luvo Inc.,[253] and has investment interests 
in multi-channel video network company, Whistle Sports Network.[254][255] 
He explored purchasing the Buffalo Bills football team in 2014.[256] Jeter 
created the Turn 2 Foundation, a charitable organization, in 1996. It was 
established to help children and teenagers avoid drug and alcohol addiction, 
and to reward those who show high academic achievement.[257] In 2012, Jeter 
received an honorary doctorate from Siena College honoring him for his 
foundation's work.[258] Jeter also serves as an ambassador for Weplay, 
a website designed to encourage children to get involved in sports.[259] 
Jeter has appeared in national ad campaigns for Nike, Gatorade,[260] Fleet 
Bank, Ford, VISA,[261] Discover Card,[262] Florsheim,[263] Gillette, Skippy,[264] 
and XM Satellite Radio.[265][266][267][268] He endorses a cologne named 
Driven, designed in collaboration with and distributed by Avon.[269] Jeter 
has his own Jumpman shoe.[270] To commemorate Jeter's final year, the Jordan 
brand made a tribute commercial titled "#RE2PECT", which had many baseball 
players (such as Jon Lester) and celebrities, even rival Boston Red Sox 
fans tip their caps.[271] In 2006, Jeter was the second-highest paid endorser 
in baseball, behind Ichiro Suzuki, who received endorsement deals in Japan.[272] 
He was ranked as the most marketable player in baseball according to the 
2003, 2005, and 2010 Sports Business Surveys.[273][274] A 2011 list by 
the marketing firm Nielsen ranked Jeter as the most marketable player in 
baseball, accounting for personal attributes such as sincerity, approachability, 
experience, and influence.[275] Jeter has appeared on television as a guest 
actor in the sitcom Seinfeld in the episode titled, "The Abstinence" and 
Saturday Night Live, a late-night live television sketch comedy and variety 
show, in episode 7 during season 27.[276] He had cameo appearances in the 
comedy films Anger Management and The Other Guys.[277] Jeter was the subject 
of a 2005 segment on the TV news magazine 60 Minutes[8] and a 2014 episode 
of Finding Your Roots, a Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) public television 
series.[278] Jeter also appears as a character in the Broadway play Bronx 
Bombers.[279] Jeter made an appearance alongside Peyton Manning to celebrate 
Saturday Night Live's 40th Anniversary in February 2015.[280] Video games 
have featured Jeter on their cover, including 2K Sports' MLB 2K5, MLB 2K6, 
and MLB 2K7,[281][282] Acclaim Entertainment's All-Star Baseball series 
of video games,[283] and Gameloft's wireless phone baseball game, Derek 
Jeter Pro Baseball 2008.[284] A wax figure immortalizes Jeter at the Madame 
Tussauds Wax Museum in New York,[285] and a sculpture at the Louisville 
Slugger Museum & Factory in Louisville, Kentucky.[286] In 2015, Jeter was 
inducted into the New Jersey Hall of Fame.[296] Italics denotes active
