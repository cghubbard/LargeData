Matthew Aloysius "Matches" Kilroy (June 21, 1866 – March 2, 1940) was an 
American left-handed pitcher in Major League Baseball. In 1886, he had 
513 strikeouts, which remains the MLB single-season record. Kilroy was 
born in Philadelphia in 1866. He was one of 13 children of Mary Ann and 
Patrick Kilroy.[1] He started his professional baseball career with the 
Southern League's Augusta Browns in 1885. That season, he pitched 447 innings 
and had a win–loss record of 29–22 with a 0.97 earned run average and 363 
strikeouts.[2] Kilroy starred as an MLB rookie during the 1886 season for 
the last-place Baltimore Orioles. He started 68 games, completing 66 of 
them while throwing 583 innings.[3] Although he had a disappointing record 
of 29 wins and 34 losses, he set a mark that was unequalled in major league 
pitching. Kilroy struck out 513 batters that season, the most ever in a 
single season and far ahead of second-place Charles "Old Hoss" Radbourn's 
total of 441 in 1884.[4] However, in that season there were many differences 
in game play from the modern rules, such as a base on balls being awarded 
after six balls rather than the modern four, and the pitcher being located 
50 feet from home plate rather than the modern 60 feet 6 inches; it was 
also the last season in which batters could request either a high pitch 
or a low pitch. Because of these numerous subsequent rule changes, pitching 
records from that era are not officially compared to those of the modern 
era, which is variously regarded as beginning in 1893 (when the modern 
pitching distance was established) or 1900. On August 20, Kilroy and Cyclone 
Miller of the Philadelphia Quakers hurled opposing one-hitters, the first 
time this ever occurred, though it has since been duplicated four times. 
Baltimore won that game 1–0 on first-inning errors‚ but didn't get a hit 
until the ninth.[4] During this remarkable rookie season, he hurled 5 shutouts, 
3 one-hitters, and 4 two-hitters, but on October 6 he pitched the only 
9-inning no-hitter of his career. He pitched his gem against the Pittsburgh 
Alleghenys, a 6–0 victory.[4] Kilroy followed the success of his rookie 
season with another productive year in 1887. Baltimore began to score more 
runs, finishing in a respectable third place; in addition, Kilroy lowered 
his earned run average from 3.37 to 3.07, resulting in an outstanding win–loss 
record of 46 and 19. During his sophomore year he started 69 games, completing 
66 while throwing 589 1⁄3 innings with 6 shutouts. He led the league in 
wins and shutouts. He had this success even though his strikeout total 
dropped dramatically to 217.[3] Kilroy pitched and won both games of a 
doubleheader twice during the 1887 season, once on July 26 and the other 
on October 1.[4] His 46 wins is still the most ever by a left-handed pitcher 
in a season.[1] On September 2, he umpired his only game.[5] After opening 
his career with two outstanding seasons, he pitched fewer innings and had 
less success in 1888. Baltimore finished in fifth place, and Kilroy had 
a 17–21 record in only 40 games. He did complete 35 of those starts and 
recorded 2 shutouts.[3] Earlier, before the season started and after signing 
his contract with the team, he married Fanny Denny, although he did spend 
the honeymoon training with the Orioles.[4] The 1889 season was Kilroy's 
comeback season and his last productive season as a pitcher. He completed 
55 of his 56 starts, while also pitching in 3 relief appearances, the first 
of his career. He had a 29–25 record and 5 shutouts in 480 2⁄3 innings.[3] 
On July 29 of that season, he pitched his second no-hitter, this time a 
7-inning affair against the St. Louis Browns that ended in 0–0 tie. It 
was Kilroy's own baserunning error that negated the only run scored, when 
he missed third base in the 3rd inning and was called out.[4] That season 
was his last for Baltimore, as he jumped to the new Players' League for 
the 1890 season. He had a disappointing season, winning only 9 games against 
15 losses in 217 2⁄3 innings. He only completed 18 of 27 starts for the 
Boston Reds, and only struck out 48. After the Players' League folded, 
he traveled around, playing for three teams during the next four seasons, 
never pitching more than 45 1⁄3 innings. After the 1894 season he disappeared 
from the majors until returning in 1898, when he played his final season 
with the Chicago Orphans. He finished his career with 141 wins and 133 
losses in 303 games pitched.[3] After his baseball career ended, Kilroy 
lived in Philadelphia and owned a saloon. He and his wife had seven children.[1] 
Kilroy died at the age of 73;[6] he was buried at the Holy Sepulchre Cemetery
