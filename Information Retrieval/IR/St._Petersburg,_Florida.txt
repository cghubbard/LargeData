St. Petersburg is a city in Pinellas County, Florida, United States. As 
of the 2015 census estimate, the population was 257,083,[2] making it the 
fifth-most populous city in Florida and the largest in the state that is 
not a county seat (the city of Clearwater is the seat of Pinellas County).[6] 
St. Petersburg is the second-largest city in the Tampa Bay Area, after 
Tampa. Together with Clearwater, these cities comprise the Tampa–St. Petersburg–Clearwater 
Metropolitan Statistical Area, the second-largest in Florida with a population 
of around 2.8 million.[7] St. Petersburg is located on a peninsula between 
Tampa Bay and the Gulf of Mexico, and is connected to mainland Florida 
to the north.[8] St. Petersburg was founded in 1888 by John C. Williams, 
who purchased the land, and by Peter Demens, who brought the railroad industry 
into the area.[9][10] As a part of a coin toss bet, the winner, Peter Demens, 
named the land after Saint Petersburg, Russia, while Williams opted to 
name the first hotel built which was named the Detroit Hotel, both named 
after their home towns respectively.[11] St. Petersburg was incorporated 
as a town on February 29, 1892 and re-incorporated as a city on June 6, 
1903.[9][12] The city is often referred to by locals as St. Pete. Neighboring 
St. Pete Beach formally shortened its name in 1994 after a vote by its 
residents. St. Petersburg is governed by a mayor and city council.[13] 
With an average of some 361 days of sunshine each year, and a Guinness 
World Record for logging the most consecutive days of sunshine (768 days),[14][15] 
it is nicknamed "The Sunshine City".[14] Due to its good weather and low 
cost of living, the city has long been a popular retirement destination, 
although in recent years the population has moved in a much more youthful 
direction.[16] American Style magazine ranked St. Petersburg its top mid-size 
city in 2011, citing its "vibrant" arts scene.[17] The city was co-founded 
by John C. Williams, formerly of Detroit, who purchased the land in 1875, 
and by Peter Demens who was instrumental in bringing the terminus of a 
railroad there in 1888.[9] The first major newspaper to debut in Tampa 
Bay was the St. Petersburg Times which established in 1884.[18] St. Petersburg 
was incorporated as a town on February 29, 1892, when it had a population 
of only some 300 people.[12][19] A local legend says that John C. Williams 
and Peter Demens flipped a coin to see who would have the honor of naming 
the city.[11][20] When Demens won the coin toss the city was named after 
Saint Petersburg, Russia, where Peter Demens had spent half of his youth,[21] 
while John C. Williams named the first hotel after his birthplace, Detroit 
(a hotel built by Demens).[9][22] The Detroit Hotel still exists downtown, 
but has been turned into a condominium.[23] The oldest running hotels are 
the historic Pier Hotel, built in 1921, formally Hotel Cordova and The 
Heritage Hotel (now named Hotel Indigo), built in 1926.[24] Philadelphia 
publisher F. A. Davis turned on St. Petersburg's first electrical service 
in 1897 and its first trolley service in 1904.[25] The city's first major 
industry was born in 1899 when Henry W. Hibbs (1862–1942), a native of 
Newport, North Carolina, established his wholesale fish business at the 
end of the railroad pier, which extended out to the shipping channel. Within 
a year, Hibbs Fish Company was shipping more than 1,000 pounds (450 kg) 
of fish each day.[26] St. Petersburg was incorporated into a city in June 
1903.[9] With this transition, the development of the downtown waterfront 
had dredging of a deeper shipping channel from 1906 to 1908 which opened 
St. Petersburg to larger shipping. Further dredging improved the port facilities 
through the 1910s.[27] By then the city's population had quadrupled to 
a population of 4,127 citizens.[28] In 1914, the Tampa Bay area was one 
of the first Floridian cities that fell in love with baseball tracing its 
roots from Tampa and St. Petersburg. The former mayor of St. Petersburg, 
Al Lang, had invited the St. Louis Browns to move their spring training 
into the city.[29] Taking place in the same year, the airplane service 
across Tampa Bay from St. Petersburg to Tampa and back was initiated, generally 
considered the first scheduled commercial airline flight. The company name 
was the St. Petersburg-Tampa Airboat Line, and the pilot was Tony Jannus, 
flying a Benoist XIV flying boat.[30] The Tony Jannus Award is presented 
annually for outstanding achievement in the airline industry.[31] Jannus 
Live, a local music/entertainment venue on Central Avenue in downtown, 
is also named after him.[32] Soon after, St. Petersburg's first library 
opened on December 1, 1915 which still operates till this day as the Mirror 
Lake Library.[9][33] The 1920s in St. Petersburg was big due to its major 
growth brought by tourists. Tourists came from all over by automobile, 
yacht, and railroad. Travel time from across the bay was cut due to the 
Gandy Bridge's opening in 1924, helping St. Petersburg increase in tourist 
numbers and helped grow it into the largest city in Pinellas County. The 
city also adopted the Mediterranean-style architecture brought by Snell 
Isles founder Perry Snell.[9] An attraction that brought on a great number 
of tourists and citizens was the Million Dollar Pier which was built in 
1926.[34] Tourists declined by the late 1920s and early 1930s due to the 
Great Depression. Shortly after near the end of the Great Depression, the 
city recovered due to the help of the Public Works Administration with 
a $10 million investment plan which helped build the St. Petersburg City 
Hall.[9] By the 1940s the city received a large population growth due to 
World War II. St. Petersburg was a training ground area for the U.S. Coast 
Guard who had a training base and used the city's Bayboro Harbor,[26] and 
for the Army Air Force who was selected by the War Department to use the 
city as their technical service training station.[35] With both stations 
occupying the city, more than 100,000 troops occupied all hotels in St. 
Petersburg.[36] After the war, most troops who were stationed in St. Petersburg 
returned as residents or tourists.[9] In the 1950s, St. Petersburg experienced 
another population increase with residents. The development of transportation 
was important with the increase of tourists, more automobiles were used 
in the city and subsequently the public street cars were removed.[9] In 
1954 the original Sunshine Skyway Bridge opened its first span to link 
St. Petersburg with Manatee County. A year later in 1955, Highway 19 opened 
in the city creating a large influx of traffic. By the end of the 1950s, 
tourists and retirees increased in the area.[37][38] The development of 
major transportation continued into the 1960s with the completion of the 
Howard Frankland Bridge in 1960, creating another connection between St. 
Petersburg and Tampa.[38] St. Petersburg also received its first stadium 
named the Bayfront Center which hosted the first professional hockey league 
in Tampa Bay.[39][40] A new municipal marina and the Museum of Fine Arts 
were also built downtown.[9] St. Petersburg is home to one of the world's 
largest reclaimed water systems that was built in the 1970s which flows 
37 million gallons of water per day to provide for customers located throughout 
the city.[41][42] Development of the first major league baseball team to 
be located in the Tampa Bay area began in St. Petersburg throughout the 
1970s. The city tried to encourage numerous teams through the United States 
to make St. Petersburg their new tenant.[9] With the need of a major league 
baseball team, designs for a ballpark were first presented in 1983 and 
construction for a permanent dome stadium began in 1986.[43] The stadium 
opened in 1990 as the Florida Suncoast Dome, later named the Thunderdome 
in 1993. After many attempts to attract tenants to the new stadium, Major 
League Baseball gave St. Petersburg a franchise in 1995. In 1996, the dome 
was renamed a third time to Tropicana Field after naming rights were established 
with Tropicana Dole Beverages.[44] The Tampa Bay Devil Rays was then established 
in 1998 after the stadium's renovation and the new team played their first 
game on March 31, 1998, giving the Tampa Bay area their first professional 
baseball team.[45] The city population continued to multiply during the 
20th century, booming in the 1940s and 1950s and through the 1970s as the 
town became a popular retirement destination for Americans from midwestern 
cities, reaching 238,647 in the 1980 census. By that time, however, the 
population had leveled off, and has grown by only 10,000 since then. In 
the decade from 2000 to 2010, the population of the city dropped by approximately 
4000 residents, while in the same period the population of Florida increased 
by over two and a half million residents.[46] According to the United States 
Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 137.6 square miles (356.4 km2). 
61.7 square miles (159.9 km2) of it is land, and 75.9 square miles (196.5 km2) 
of it (55.13%) is water.[47] St. Petersburg is bordered by three bodies 
of water, the Old Tampa Bay, Middle Tampa Bay, and Lower Tampa Bay, all 
of which form the Tampa Bay.[48][49] Downtown St. Petersburg is the Central 
Business District, containing high rises for office use, most notably the 
tallest building in the city, One Progress Plaza. The Tampa Bay Times newspaper 
is headquartered in the downtown area.[50][51] The Poynter Institute, which 
owns the paper, is located on 3rd Street South.[52] The Mahaffey Theater 
complex, the Morean Arts Center, dozens of other art galleries, Haslam's 
Bookstore, The Coliseum, Palladium Theatre, and Jannus Live are among the 
galleries and cultural venues featured downtown.[53] Several prominent 
museums are located in the perimeter. Many of them have received notable 
accolades, including the Chihuly Collection presented by the Morean Arts 
Center, the Museum of Fine Arts, the Salvador Dalí Museum, the Florida 
International Museum, the St. Petersburg Museum of History, and the Florida 
Holocaust Museum.[53] The city hosts many outdoor festivals throughout 
the year.[54] St. Petersburg's downtown has been rated among the best in 
the South. The area's beaches are a 10-mile (16 km) drive from downtown. 
Jutting a half mile into the bay was the St. Petersburg Pier, a major tourist 
attraction that offered various activities. "The Lens" design which was 
chosen by the International Design Competition Jury and accepted by City 
Council later had its contract terminated by a citywide election during 
the summer of 2013.[55][56] Following this, the "Pier Park" was chosen 
out of the 16 new design teams that submitted work in late 2014 and in 
2015 the Pier Park was set for construction in early 2017.[34] Downtown 
also contains the University of South Florida St. Petersburg and a downtown 
branch of St. Petersburg College.[57][58] The downtown perimeter includes 
several parks, most of which are waterfront or lakefront. Straub Park is 
nearly a half mile long, boasts a waterfront location, and is home of the 
St. Petersburg Museum of Fine Arts.[59] The Vinoy Park Hotel has a bayfront 
location, a spot on the National Register of Historic Places,[60] and an 
AAA Four-Diamond rating.[61] It fronts Vinoy Park, which holds music festivals, 
including the Warped Tour. Nearby is the historic Tramor Cafeteria building, 
now part of the Tampa Bay Times. The city is connected via the Looper Trolley.[62] 
Most of the dining and nightlife can be found downtown on or near Central 
Avenue or Beach Drive along the waterfront. Venues include Jannus Live 
and the State Theatre. The active nightlife scene is credited to recent 
demographic and regulatory changes.[63][64] In 2010, the city council voted 
to extend bar hours until 3 A.M., identical to cross-bay "rival" Tampa.[65][66] 
Tropicana Field, home of Major League Baseball's Tampa Bay Rays, is located 
in the western part of downtown. Until 2008, the team played its spring 
training games at nearby Progress Energy Park. This setup was unique, making 
St. Petersburg the first city that played host to its baseball team during 
spring training as well as the regular season since the 1919 Philadelphia 
Athletics.[67] At the end of 2007, there was a debate over a new stadium 
to be built on the downtown waterfront at the current Progress Energy Park 
site. Tropicana Field would be demolished and replaced with prime residential 
and retail space. Completion of the stadium was planned for 2012; however, 
the proposal has been tabled indefinitely while a community-based organization 
investigates all alternatives for new stadium construction.[68][69][70] 
The Wikimedia Foundation had been located in downtown St. Petersburg since 
its founding by Jimmy Wales in 2003. The Wikimedia Foundation was later 
on incorporated into the city in 2005.[71] On September 25, 2007, the Foundation 
announced its move in late 2007 from St. Petersburg to the San Francisco 
Bay Area.[72][73] St. Petersburg has the third-largest dedicated public 
waterfront park system in North America,[74] with a waterfront park system 
that stretches 7 miles (11 km) and is used year round for public events, 
festivals and other activities.[citation needed] In the early 20th century, 
citizens and city leaders engaged in a long and boisterous debate over 
the future of the young city's waterfront space, with one side advocating 
for commercial, port and industrial development and the other side advocating 
for a long-term commitment to parks and public access to the waterfront. 
The public access and park contingent won the debate when, on Christmas 
Eve 1909, the city announced the acquisition of the waterfront land that 
is encompassed by the waterfront park system.[75] The city is also becoming 
one of the largest destinations in Florida for kiteboarding with locations 
such as Fort De Soto Park, Pass-a-Grille, and Ten-Cent.[76] The St. Petersburg 
Shuffleboard Club was established in 1924 and gained attention as the "World's 
Largest Shuffleboard Club" with 110 courts and over 5,000 members in the 
1950s and 1960s.[77] St. Petersburg is home to more than 100 neighborhoods,[78] 
with most of the historic districts are located near the waterfront.[79] 
In the eastern center of the city is Downtown St. Petersburg, which includes 
the cities residential and commercial skyscrapers, art galleries, museums, 
and parks.[80] The downtown area is home the central business district 
to many start-up companies, corporation branches, banks, law firms, and 
restaurants.[citation needed] Apart from downtown's business and cultural 
aesthetics, the area resides a branch of St. Petersburg College and the 
University of South Florida St. Petersburg.[80] Finally, the downtown district 
is home to two professional sports teams, the Tampa Bay Rays who reside 
west of downtown at Tropicana Field, and the Tampa Bay Rowdies who are 
located downtown at Al Lang Stadium.[80] North of Downtown St. Petersburg 
lies Historic Old Northeast and Snell Isle, both are a place of residence 
to Mediterranean style historic and waterfront homes, parks, and recreational 
areas.[81][82] Old Northeast is also home to a shopping district, city 
landmarks, beaches, and small shops as well as small residential high rises.[81] 
Snell Isle however was founded by C. Perry Snell who bought up the land 
to develop upscale properties in the 1900s, and helped create some of St. 
Petersburg's resorts such as the Vinoy Park Hotel and the St. Petersburg 
Woman's Club;[83] both of which are listed on the U.S. National Register 
of Historic Places.[84] The western side of St. Petersburg includes the 
Grand Central District and Historic Kenwood. The Grand Central District 
houses the cities cafes, art galleries, restaurants, and bars all owing 
to the Renaissance style architecture.[85][86] Whilst in Historic Kenwood 
is filled with art studios and galleries similarly to the Grand Central 
District.[87] Southward to St. Petersburg is Historic Roser Park, which 
houses Mediterranean style housing, parks, and museums.[88] The neighborhood 
is divided by Booker Creek which flows into Bayboro Harbor.[89][90] St. 
Petersburg has a humid subtropical climate (Koppen Cfa), closely bordering 
a tropical savanna climate, with a definite rainy season from June through 
September. St. Petersburg, like the rest of the Tampa Bay area, is occasionally 
affected by tropical storms and hurricanes. However, the last time a hurricane 
directly struck the city was in 1946. Many portions of St. Petersburg, 
especially along the bay and in south St. Petersburg, have tropical micro-climates. 
Royal palms and coconut palms, as well as other tropical plants, grow to 
maturity. For the winter of 2014–15, the lowest recorded temperature at 
the St. Petersburg Downtown Airport was 40 degrees Fahrenheit (four degrees 
Celsius), which the city recorded on February 20.[91] During the summer 
of 2015, the highest temperature recorded in the city was 95 degrees Fahrenheit 
(35 degrees Celsius), occurring on both June 16 and July 20.[91] St. Petersburg 
has not recorded any freezing temperatures in the five-year period dating 
back to November 2010, which is the oldest data available from the local 
National Weather Service office page.[92] According to a 2010 census, the 
city contained 244,769 people, making St. Petersburg the largest city in

the top 6 violent crime cities in Florida.[99] It is the 58th ranking city 
in the United States when it comes to violent crime.[100] It is less safe 
than 95% of cities in Florida.[101] Evidence of the social unrest and the 
schism within the city, particularly between South St. Petersburg and the 
rest of the city came with the St. Petersburg, Florida riots of 1996.[102] 
A notable murder in the city of an officer was the murder of Police Officer 
David Crawford by then-teenager Nicholas Lindsey.[103] According to the 
City of St. Petersburg, Florida's 2014 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report, 
the largest employers in the city are:[104] One of the first of many major

Explorations), Museum of Fine Arts, and will soon host the Museum of the 
American Arts and Crafts Movement (expected to open in 2017),[132] The 
St. Petersburg Museum of History (which has a full-size replica of the 
Benoist XIV seaplane and is located near the approximate spot by the St. 
Petersburg Pier where the first scheduled commercial flight departed),[133] 
a Holocaust Museum, and the Salvador Dalí Museum, which houses the largest 
collection of Dalí's works outside of Europe, including a number of famous 
and large-scale paintings such as The Discovery of America by Christopher 
Columbus.[134] The Chihuly Collection, located at 400 Beach Drive, houses 
some of the magnificent glass sculptures of Dale Chihuly.[135] There are 
also various other smaller art galleries and entertainment venues, especially 
in the downtown area, which has seen a boom in development since the mid-1990s; 
these include the Mahaffey Theater complex, American Stage (an equity regional 
theater), The Coliseum, and Palladium Theatre, and the Midtown Royal Theater, 
The Arts Center, and the Florida Craftsmen Gallery.[136][137] The St. Petersburg 
Pier was a popular tourist attraction, which is now closed since May 2013.[138] 
The Bounty, a replica of HMS Bounty that was used in the 1962 Technicolor 
remake of Mutiny on the Bounty, starring Marlon Brando, was permanently 
docked near the Pier for many years until the ship was sold to Ted Turner 
in 1986.[139] The Bounty, however, sometimes visited St. Petersburg for 
the winter in the following years before its sinking in 2012.[140] In 2010, 
the St. Petersburg City Council voted to demolish and rebuild the pier,[141] 
which is set to open in 2018.[142] The city had a Madame Tussaud Wax Museum 
between 1963 and 1989.[143] Downtown is the location of the Sundial shopping 
complex which opened in May 2014.[144] It contains an IMAX Muvico 20-screen 
movie theater, as well as many chain restaurants and retail shops, catering 
to more of a middle and upper class audience. The Sundial St. Pete has 
nightlife destination, although it is less well attended than the block 
surrounding Jannus Live, just south of Sundial St. Pete. Central Avenue, 
from the Yacht Club west to 8th Street, is also both more vibrant and "organic" 
the Sundial St. Pete with the exception of a couple underdeveloped blocks. 
Restaurants serving ethnic and domestic culinary specialties can be found 
throughout the downtown area. Every Saturday morning, from October to May, 
the downtown area hosts a farmers' market in the parking area of Al Lang 
Stadium (formerly Progress Energy Park). Local vendors sell the fruits 
of their labors (whether edible or decorative) alongside artists of all
