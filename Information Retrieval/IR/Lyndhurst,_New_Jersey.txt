Lyndhurst is a township in Bergen County, New Jersey, United States. As 
of the 2010 United States Census, the township's population was 20,554,[9][10][11] 
reflecting an increase of 1,171 (+6.0%) from the 19,383 counted in the 
2000 Census, which had in turn increased by 1,121 (+6.1%) from the 18,262 
counted in the 1990 Census.[20] Lyndhurst was originally formed as Union 
Township on February 19, 1852, from portions of Harrison Township. While 
it was still Union Township, portions of territory were taken to form Rutherford 
(as of September 21, 1881), Boiling Springs Township (April 17, 1889; now 
known as East Rutherford) and North Arlington (March 11, 1896). On May 
15, 1917, the area was reincorporated by an act of the New Jersey Legislature 
as the Township of Lyndhurst, based on the results of a referendum held 
one week earlier.[21] The township is named for Lord Lyndhurst.[22] On 
January 11, 1917, a fire started in Building 30 of the Canadian Car and 
Foundry Company, in what is now Lyndhurst, in a plant that was producing 
munitions for sale to the United Kingdom and the Russian Empire during 
World War I. After a spill of flammable liquid started a fire in a building 
where shells were cleaned, about 500,000, three-inch (76 mm) explosive 
shells were discharged in about four hours, destroying the entire facility.[23] 
It was said to have been a spectacle more magnificent than the explosion 
at Black Tom in Jersey City, New Jersey. Tessie McNamara, who operated 
the company switchboard, was credited with saving 1,400 lives, contacting 
each of the buildings and shouting the warning, "Get out or go up!" Thanks 
to her dedication, no one was killed in the fire.[24] The Lyndhurst Historical 
Society has created a vest pocket park dedicated to the memory of McNamara.[25] 
The park is located on Clay Avenue, between Valley Brook Avenue and Wall 
Street West. The brick stack can be seen from this park. According to the 
United States Census Bureau, the township had a total area of 4.894 square 
miles (12.676 km2), including 4.558 square miles (11.806 km2) of land and 
0.336 square miles (0.870 km2) of water (6.86%).[2][3] Unincorporated communities, 
localities and place names located partially or completely within the township 
include Kingsland and South Rutherford.[26] The township borders North 
Arlington and Rutherford in Bergen County; Belleville and Nutley in Essex 
County; Kearny and Secaucus in Hudson County; and Clifton in Passaic County.[27] 
The Passaic River, crossed by the Avondale Bridge and the Lyndhurst Draw, 
creates the municipal and county border at the west. The eastern portion 
of the municipality is part of the uninhabited wetlands in the New Jersey 
Meadowlands. At the 2010 United States Census, there were 20,554 people,
