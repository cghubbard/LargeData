As player As manager Osamu Higashio (東尾 修, Higashio Osamu?, born May 18, 
1950 in Kibi, Wakayama, Japan) is a former Japanese baseball player who 
played in the Japanese professional leagues from 1969–1988. He also was 
manager of the Seibu Lions from 1995–2001. Higashio was a star in the Koshien 
high school baseball tournament, advancing to the semi-finals in the spring 
of 1968. He was drafted in the first round by the Nishitetsu Lions (the 
current Saitama Seibu Lions) later that year. He lost confidence in his 
pitching ability after seeing the high level of pitching in the Pacific 
League, and requested the team to convert him to a position player. The 
team accepted his request, but quickly withdrew it when the Black Mist 
Scandal erupted in the 1969 off-season. The ace of the Lions pitching staff, 
Masaaki Ikenaga, was banished from the professional leagues because of 
the scandal, and Higashio was forced into pitching a full year in the Lions 
starting rotation. His inexperience left him with a torrid 5.15 ERA in 
40 games that year. Higashio made improvements in the following years, 
but still led the league in losses from 1971–1972. He pitched over 300 
innings in 1972, but led the league in losses, hits given up, home runs 
given up, and runs given up. He also allowed over 100 walks in each of 
his seasons from 1971–1973. The Lions team was sold by the Nishi-Nippon 
Railroad in 1973, becoming the Taiheiyo Club Lions, and was sold again 
to become the Crown Lighter Lions in 1978. It was during this turbulent 
period that Higashio emerged as the ace of the Lions pitching staff. He 
marked a 2.38 ERA in 1975, and led the league with 23 wins (but also in 
losses). He won 23 games again in 1978, pitching over 300 innings for the 
third time in his career. The Lions finally obtained financial stability 
in 1979, becoming the Seibu Lions, and won the Japanese championship series 
in 1982 and 1983. Higashio marked the lowest ERA in the league (2.92), 
and led the league in wins to receive the MVP award in 1983. The Lions 
won the league championship four years in a row from 1985–1988 (including 
three more Japanese championship series wins), and Higashio won his second 
MVP award in 1987. He announced his retirement in 1988, and is remembered 
as one of the leading Japanese pitchers in the 1980s. Higashio worked as 
a sports commentator for various television networks before returning to 
the Lions in 1995 as manager. Higashio drafted several top players, and 
recruited Darrin Jackson and Orestes Destrade from the major leagues, but 
ended up in 3rd place in his first two seasons as manager. The emergence 
of several young players, including Kazuo Matsui, put the Lions over the 
top in Higashio's third year, and the team won consecutive league championships 
in 1997 and 1998 (the Lions lost the Japanese championship series both 
years). Pitchers Shinji Mori, Daisuke Matsuzaka, Fumiya Nishiguchi and 
Denney Tomori also emerged during Higashio's tenure as manager. The Lions 
placed in 2nd in 1999 and 2000, and fell to 3rd place in 2001, and Higashio 
resigned from his post at the end of 2001. He has currently returned to 
his role as a sports commentator. In September, 2006, he became the head 
of the Tokyo Apache Japanese professional basketball team. Higashio often 
pitched towards the inside of the plate to intimidate opposing batters 
during his professional career, and he holds the Japanese career record 
for hit batsmen (165). He was not afraid to throw pitches close to the 
batter, and showed little remorse after hitting batters. In 1986, he received 
a beating on the mound by Kintetsu Buffaloes player Richard Davis, after 
hitting Davis with a pitch (Higashio continued pitching after the incident, 
marking the win). Many fans sympathized with Davis, and demanded that Higashio 
be penalized as well for hitting so many batters. Managers of rival teams 
accused Higashio of purposely hitting batters, since Higashio possessed 
excellent control, and there was no way he could accidentally hit batters 
so often. Higashio has maintained that he never threw a pitch with the
