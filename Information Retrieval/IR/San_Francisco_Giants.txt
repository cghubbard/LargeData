The San Francisco Giants are an American professional baseball franchise 
based in San Francisco, California. Founded in 1883 as the New York Gothams, 
and renaming three years later to the New York Giants, the team eventually 
moved to San Francisco in 1958. The Giants compete in Major League Baseball 
(MLB) as a member club of the National League (NL) West division. As one 
of the longest-established and most successful professional baseball teams, 
the franchise has won the most games of any team in the history of American 
baseball.[6] The team was the first major league team based in New York 
City, most memorably playing at the legendary Polo Grounds. They have won 
23 NL pennants and have played in 20 World Series competitions – both NL 
records. The Giants' eight World Series championships rank second in the 
National League and are tied for fourth overall (New York Yankees are first 
with 27, then the St. Louis Cardinals (the National League record-holders) 
with 11, the Oakland Athletics with 9, and the Boston Red Sox also with 
8). The Giants have played in the World Series 20 times – 14 times in New 
York, six in San Francisco – but boycotted the event in 1904. Playing as 
the New York Giants, they won 14 pennants and five World Series championships 
behind managers such as John McGraw and Bill Terry and players like Christy 
Mathewson, Carl Hubbell, Mel Ott, Bobby Thomson, and Willie Mays. The Giants' 
franchise has the most Hall of Fame players in all of professional baseball.[7] 
The Giants' rivalry with the Dodgers is one of the longest-standing and 
biggest rivalries in American sports.[8][9] The teams began their rivalry 
as the New York Giants and Brooklyn Dodgers, respectively, before both 
franchises moved west for the 1958 season. The Giants have won six pennants 
and three World Series championships since arriving in San Francisco. Those 
three championships have come in 2010, 2012, and most recently in 2014, 
having defeated the Kansas City Royals four games to three during the 2014 
World Series.[10][11] The Giants began as the second baseball club founded 
by millionaire tobacconist John B. Day and veteran amateur baseball player 
Jim Mutrie. The Gothams, as the Giants were originally known, entered the 
National League in 1883, while their other club, the Metropolitans played 
in the American Association. Nearly half of the original Gotham players 
were members of the disbanded Troy Trojans, whose place in the National 
League the Gothams inherited. While the Metropolitans were initially the 
more successful club, Day and Mutrie began moving star players to the Gothams, 
and in 1888 the team won its first National League pennant, as well as 
a victory over the St. Louis Browns in a pre-modern-era World Series. They 
repeated as champions the next year with a pennant and Championship victory 
over the Brooklyn "Bridegrooms". It is said that after one particularly 
satisfying victory over the Philadelphia Phillies, Mutrie, who was also 
the team's manager, strode into the dressing room and exclaimed, "My big 
fellows! My giants!"[12] From then on, the club was known as the Giants. 
The Giants' original home stadium, the Polo Grounds, dates from this early 
era. It was originally located north of Central Park adjacent to 5th and 
6th Avenues and 110th and 112th Streets, in Harlem in upper Manhattan. 
After their eviction from that first incarnation of the Polo Grounds after 
the 1888 season, they moved further uptown to various fields they also 
named the Polo Grounds located between 155th and 159th Streets in Harlem 
and Washington Heights, playing in the Washington Heights Polo Grounds 
until the end of the 1957 season, when they moved to San Francisco. The 
Giants were a powerhouse in the late 1880s, winning their first two National 
League Pennants and World Championships in 1888 and 1889. But nearly all 
of the Giants' stars jumped to the upstart Players' League, whose New York 
franchise was also named the Giants, in 1890. The new team even built a 
stadium next door to the Polo Grounds. With a decimated roster, the National 
League Giants finished a distant sixth. Attendance took a nosedive, and 
the financial strain affected Day's tobacco business as well. The Players' 
League dissolved after the season, and Day sold a minority interest in 
his NL Giants to the defunct PL Giants' principal backer, Edward Talcott. 
As a condition of the sale, Day had to fire Mutrie as manager. Although 
the Giants rebounded to third in 1891, Day was forced to sell a controlling 
interest to Talcott at the end of the season. Four years later, Talcott 
sold the Giants to Andrew Freedman, a real estate developer with ties to 
the Tammany Hall political machine running New York City. Freedman was 
one of the most detested owners in baseball history, getting into heated 
disputes with other owners, writers, and his own players, most famously 
with star pitcher Amos Rusie, author of the first Giants no-hitter. When 
Freedman offered Rusie only $2,500 to play in 1896, the disgruntled hurler 
sat out the entire season. Attendance fell off throughout the league without 
Rusie, prompting the other owners to chip in $50,000 to get him to return 
for 1897. Freedman hired former owner Day as manager for part of 1899. 
In 1902, after a series of disastrous moves that left the Giants 53½ games 
behind, Freedman signed John McGraw as player-manager, convincing him to 
jump in mid-season from the Baltimore Orioles of the fledgling American 
League and bring with him several of his teammates. McGraw went on to manage 
the Giants for three decades until 1932, one of the longest and most successful 
tenures in professional sports. Hiring "Mr. McGraw", as his players referred 
to him, was one of Freedman's last significant moves as owner of the Giants, 
since after the 1902 season he was forced to sell his interest in the club 
to John T. Brush. McGraw went on to manage the Giants to nine National 
League pennants (in 1904-05, 1911–13, 1917, and 1921-24) and three World 
Series championships (in 1905 and 1921–22), with a tenth pennant and fourth 
world championship as owner in 1933 under his handpicked player-manager 
successor, Bill Terry. The Giants already had their share of stars in the 
1880s and 1890s, such as "Smiling" Mickey Welch, Roger Connor, Tim Keefe, 
Jim O'Rourke, and John Montgomery Ward, the player-lawyer who formed the 
renegade Players' League in 1890 to protest unfair player contracts. McGraw, 
in his three decades managing the Giants, cultivated a new crop of baseball 
heroes with names like Christy Mathewson, "Iron Man" Joe McGinnity, Jim 
Thorpe, Red Ames, Casey Stengel, Art Nehf, Edd Roush, Rogers Hornsby, Bill 
Terry, and Mel Ott. The Giants under McGraw famously snubbed their first 
modern World Series chance in 1904, refusing the invitation to play the 
reigning world champion Boston Americans, by then known as the "Red Sox", 
because McGraw considered the new American League as little more than a 
minor league and disliked its president, Ban Johnson. He also resented 
his Giants' new intra-city rival New York Highlanders, who lost the pennant 
to Boston on the last day of the season, and stuck by his refusal to play 
whoever won the 1904 AL pennant. Of note, McGraw had managed the franchise 
in their first two seasons, 1901 and 1902, when they were the Baltimore 
Orioles. The ensuing criticism resulted in Brush's taking the lead to formalize 
the rules and format of the World Series. The Giants won the 1905 World 
Series over Connie Mack's Philadelphia Athletics, with Christy Mathewson 
nearly winning the series single-handedly with a still-standing record 
three complete-game shutouts and 27 consecutive scoreless innings in that 
one World Series, a feat unlikely ever to be duplicated. The Giants then 
had several frustrating years. In 1908, they finished in a tie with the 
Chicago Cubs due to a late-season tie game with the Cubs resulting from 
the Fred Merkle baserunning "boner". Harry Pulliam]], the National League 
President, had ordered the game replayed if the teams otherwise ended the 
season in a tie, and after disgruntled Giants fans had set fire to the 
Polo Grounds stands the morning of the game, the Giants lost to the Cubs, 
who went on to win their second consecutive World Series. That post-season 
game was further darkened by a story that someone on the Giants had attempted 
to bribe umpire Bill Klem. This could have been a disastrous scandal for 
baseball, but because Klem was honest and the Giants lost the duel between 
Christy Mathewson and Mordecai "Three-Fingered" Brown 4-2, it faded over 
time. The Giants experienced a mixture of success and hard luck in the 
early 1910s, losing three straight World Series in 1911–13 to the A's, 
Red Sox and A's again. Two seasons later, both the Giants and the A's, 
decimated by the short-lived Federal League signings of many of their stars, 
finished in eighth [last] place. After losing the 1917 Series to the Chicago 
White Sox (the last Chisox Series win until 2005), the Giants played in 
four straight World Series in the early 1920s, winning the first two over 
their Polo Grounds tenants, the Yankees who won the first two of their 
many pennants and were led by young slugger Babe Ruth, then losing to the 
Yankees in 1923 after Yankee Stadium had opened that May. They also lost 
in 1924, when the Washington Senators won their only World Series in D.C. 
McGraw handed over the team to Bill Terry after the 1932 season, and Terry 
played for and managed the Giants for ten years, winning three pennants, 
defeating the Senators in the 1933 World Series but swept by the Yankees 
in consecutive fall classics, 1936 and 1937. Aside from Terry himself, 
the other stars of the era were slugger Mel Ott and southpaw hurler Carl 
Hubbell. Known as "King Carl" and "The Meal Ticket", Hubbell gained fame 
in the first two innings of the 1934 All-Star Game, coincidentally played 
at the Polo Grounds, by striking out five future AL Hall of Famers in a 
row: Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Jimmie Foxx, Al Simmons, and Joe Cronin. Ott 
succeeded Terry as manager in 1942, but the war years proved to be difficult 
for the Giants. Midway during the 1948 season Leo Durocher left as Dodgers 
skipper to manage the Giants, not without controversy. Not only was such 
a midseason managerial switch unprecedented, but Durocher had been accused 
of gambling in 1947 and subsequently suspended for that whole season by 
Commissioner Happy Chandler. Durocher's ensuing eight full seasons managing 
the Giants proved some of the most memorable for their fans, particularly 
because of the arrival of five-tool superstar Willie Mays, their two pennants 
in 1951 and 1954, their unexpected sweep of the powerful (111-43) Cleveland 
Indians in the 1954 World Series, and arguably the two most famous plays 
in Giants history. The "Shot Heard 'Round the World", or Bobby Thomson's 
come-from-behind ninth-inning walk-off home run that won the National League 
pennant for the Giants over their bitter rivals, the Brooklyn Dodgers, 
in the deciding game of a three-game playoff series ending one of baseball's 
most memorable pennant races. The Giants had been 13 1/2 games behind the 
league-leading Dodgers in August, but under Durocher's guidance and with 
a 16-game winning streak, got hot and caught the Dodgers to tie for the 
lead on the next-to-last day of the season. In Game 1 of the 1954 World 
Series at the Polo Grounds against the Cleveland Indians Willie Mays made 
"The Catch", a dramatic over-the-shoulder catch of a fly ball by Vic Wertz 
after sprinting with his back to the plate on a dead run to deepest center 
field. At the time the game was tied 2–2 in the eighth inning with runners 
on first and second and nobody out. Mays caught the ball 450 ft (140 m) 
from the plate, spun around and threw the ball to the infield keeping the 
lead runner, Larry Doby, from scoring. Although Doby took third after the 
catch, he was stranded there and the Giants won 5-2 on Dusty Rhodes' tenth-inning 
pinch-hit walk-off home run, bringing in 2 other runners. The underdog 
Giants went on to sweep the series in four straight games despite the Indians' 
American League 111-43 regular season. The 1954 World Series title was 
their last appearance in the World Series as the New York Giants, with 
the team moving to San Francisco to start the 1958 season. In addition 
to Bobby Thomson and Willie Mays, other memorable New York Giants of the 
1950s include Hall of Fame manager Leo Durocher, coach Herman Franks, Hall 
of Fame outfielder Monte Irvin, outfielder and runner-up for the 1954 National 
League batting championship that was won by Willie Mays, Don Mueller, Hall 
of Fame knuckleball relief pitcher Hoyt Wilhelm, starting pitchers Larry 
Jansen, Sal Maglie, Jim Hearn, Marv Grissom, Dave Koslo, Don Liddle, Max 
Lanier, Rubén Gómez and Johnny Antonelli, catcher Wes Westrum, catchers 
Ray Katt and Sal Yvars, shortstop Alvin Dark, third baseman Hank Thompson, 
first baseman Whitey Lockman, second basemen Davey Williams and Eddie Stanky, 
outfielder-pitcher Clint Hartung and utility men Bill Rigney, Daryl Spencer, 
Bobby Hofman and 1954 Series hero Dusty Rhodes, among others. In the late 
1950s and after the move to San Francisco two Hall of Fame first basemen, 
Orlando Cepeda and Willie McCovey, joined the team. The Giants' final three 
years in New York City were unmemorable. They reached third place the year 
after the World Series win in 1954 after which attendance fell off precipitously. 
While seeking a new stadium to replace the crumbling Polo Grounds the owners 
began to contemplate a move from New York, initially considering Metropolitan 
Stadium in Bloomington, Minnesota, which was home to their top farm team, 
the Minneapolis Millers. Under the rules of the time the Giants' ownership 
of the Millers gave them priority rights to a major league team in the 
area. The Washington Senators wound up there as the Minnesota Twins in 
1961. At that time the Giants were approached by San Francisco mayor George 
Christopher. Despite objections from shareholders such as Joan Whitney 
Payson, majority owner Horace Stoneham entered into negotiations with San 
Francisco officials around the same time the Dodgers' owner Walter O'Malley 
was courting the city of Los Angeles. O'Malley had been told that the Dodgers 
could not move to Los Angeles unless a second team moved to California.[citation 
needed] He pushed Stoneham toward relocation, and so in the summer of 1957 
both the New York Giants and Brooklyn Dodgers announced their moves to 
California, ending the three-team golden age of baseball in New York City. 
New York remained a one-team town with the New York Yankees until 1962, 
when Payson founded the New York Mets and brought National League baseball 
back to the city. Owners Payson and M. Donald Grant, who became the Mets' 
chairman, had been the only Giants board members to vote against the Giants' 
move to California. The "NY" script on the Giants' caps and the orange 
trim on their uniforms, along with the blue background used by the Dodgers, 
was adopted by the Mets, honoring their New York National League forebears 
with a blend of Giants orange and Dodgers blue.[13] As with the New York 
years, the Giants' fortune in San Francisco has been mixed. Though recently 
the club has enjoyed sustained success there have also been prolonged stretches 
of mediocrity along with two instances when the club's ownership threatened 
to move the team away from San Francisco. Giants Hat/Helmet Logo 1958–82

Giants Logo 2000–present When the Giants moved to San Francisco, they played 
in Seals Stadium for their first two seasons. The stadium, located at 16th 
& Bryant Streets across from Stempel's Bakery, had been the home of the 
Pacific Coast League San Francisco Seals in their last years the AAA minor 
league affiliate of the Boston Red Sox, 1931–1957. In 1958, first-baseman 
Orlando Cepeda won Rookie of the Year honors. In 1959, Willie McCovey won 
the same award. In 1960, the Giants moved to Candlestick Park, nicknamed 
"The 'Stick", a stadium built on Candlestick Point in San Francisco's southeast 
corner overlooking San Francisco Bay. The new stadium quickly became known 
for its strong, swirling winds, cold temperatures and thick evening fog 
that made for a formidable experience for brave fans and players, as well 
as its built-in radiant heating system which did not work. Candlestick's 
reputation was sealed in the ninth inning of the first 1961 All-Star Game 
(two All-Star Games per season were played from 1959 to 1962) when after 
a day of calm conditions the winds picked up and a strong gust caused Giants 
relief pitcher Stu Miller to slip off the pitching rubber during his delivery, 
resulting in a balk, and a baseball legend that Miller was "blown off the 
mound". Despite the event, the National League won the game. In 1962 after 
another memorable pennant chase with the Dodgers which resulted in a second 
three-game playoff series with the Dodgers, which the Giants again won 
by coming from behind with four runs in the ninth inning of Game 3, the 
Giants brought a World Series to San Francisco only to lose it four games 
to three to the New York Yankees. The seventh game went to the bottom of 
the ninth inning, with the Yankees ahead 1–0. With Matty Alou on first 
base and two out, Willie Mays sliced a double down the right field line. 
Right fielder Roger Maris quickly got to the ball and rifled a throw to 
the infield preventing Alou from scoring the tying run and keeping him 
at third base. With Mays on second, well known for his speed, any base 
hit by the next batter Willie McCovey would likely have won the series 
for the Giants. McCovey hit a line drive right at second baseman Bobby 
Richardson who caught it after taking one step, bringing the game and series 
to a sudden end. Earlier in the inning, a failed sacrifice bunt by Felipe 
Alou with nobody out had ultimately kept his brother Matty—who couldn't 
advance to second—from scoring on Mays' two-out double. Finally, Richardson 
was not originally well-positioned to catch the drive until he moved three 
steps to his left in reaction to a McCovey's foul smash on the preceding 
pitch. Giants fan (and resident of nearby Santa Rosa) Charles Schulz made 
a reference to the real world in one of his Peanuts comic strips soon afterward. 
In the first three panels of his 12/22/62 strip, Charlie Brown and Linus 
are sitting on a porch step, looking glum. In the last panel, Charlie Brown 
cried to the heavens, "Why couldn't McCovey have hit the ball just three 
feet higher?" Some weeks later, the same scene reappeared in the strip 
with Charlie Brown exclaiming, "Or why couldn't McCovey have hit the ball 
just TWO feet higher?" Although the Giants did not play in another World 
Series until 1989, the teams of the 1960s continued to be pennant contenders 
thanks to several future Hall-of-Famers. These included Gaylord Perry, 
who pitched a no-hitter with the Giants in 1968; Juan Marichal, a pitcher 
with a memorable high-kicking delivery; McCovey, who won the National League 
MVP award in 1969, and Mays, who hit his 600th career home run in 1969. 
A Giants highlight came in 1963 when Jesús Alou joined the team, and along 
with Felipe and Matty, for one late inning of one game, formed the first 
all-brother outfield in major league history. In 1967, pitcher Mike McCormick 
became the first Giants Cy Young Award winner. The Giants' next appearance 
in the postseason came in 1971. After winning their division, they were 
defeated in the League Championship Series by the Pittsburgh Pirates and 
Roberto Clemente, who then went on to beat the Baltimore Orioles in the 
World Series four games to three. In 1972, the field at Candlestick Park 
was converted from grass to Astroturf. During this decade, the Giants gave 
up many players who became successful elsewhere, including Garry Maddox, 
George Foster, Dave Kingman and Gaylord Perry. Two Giants became Rookies 
of the Year – outfielder Gary Matthews Sr. in 1973 and no-hit pitcher John 
Montefusco in 1975. In 1976 Bob Lurie bought the team, saving it from being 
moved to Toronto.[14] Toronto was awarded an expansion team called the 
Blue Jays, but San Francisco baseball fans' worries about losing their 
beloved Giants had not completely gone away just yet. The rest of the 1970s 
was a generally disappointing time for the Giants, as they finished no 
higher than third place in any season. This was in 1978, thanks to young 
star slugger Jack Clark, veteran slugging first baseman Willie McCovey, 
star hitter second baseman Bill Madlock who was acquired from the Chicago 
Cubs, shortstops Johnnie LeMaster and Roger Metzger, and slugging third 
baseman Darrell Evans. Veteran pitchers Vida Blue, John Montefusco, Ed 
Halicki and Bob Knepper rounded out the starting rotation with Vida Blue 
leading the way with eighteen victories. The most memorable moment of that 
1978 season occurred on May 28, 1978. With the Giants trailing 3-1 in the 
sixth inning, pinch hitter Mike Ivie, acquired from the San Diego Padres 
during the offseason for Derrel Thomas, hit a towering grand slam off of 
Dodgers pitching ace Don Sutton before Candlestick Park's highest paid 
attendance of 58,545. They led the National League West for most of the 
season until slugger Dusty Baker, rookie pitcher Bob Welch and the rest 
of the Dodgers got hot late, winning the West and then beating the Philadelphia 
Phillies in the National League Championship Series for the pennant. The 
field at Candlestick was converted back to natural grass for the 1979 season. 
In 1981, the Giants became the first National League team to hire a black 
manager, Frank Robinson, although he lasted less than four years and was 
generally unsuccessful. The Giants finished a game over .500 in the strike-shortened 
1981 season. The next season, the Giants acquired veterans Joe Morgan and 
Reggie Smith, got hot late and ended up in a three-team pennant race with 
the Dodgers and Braves. The day after the Dodgers eliminated them, Morgan 
hit a homer against the Dodgers on the last day of the season, giving the 
NL West to Atlanta. In 1984, the Giants hosted the All-Star Game for the 
second and last time at Candlestick Park, which the NL won as it did at 
Candlestick in 1961 when Stu Miller was blown off the mound by a gust of 
wind.[15] In 1985, owner Bob Lurie threatened to move the team out of the 
city of San Francisco to another location in the San Francisco Bay Area. 
Locations under consideration were Redwood City, San Jose, and Milpitas.[16] 
The 1985 Giants lost 100 games, the most in franchise history, under unsuccessful 
rookie manager Jim Davenport, and Lurie responded by hiring Al Rosen as 
general manager and Roger Craig as field manager. Rosen began in 1986 by 
bringing up promising rookies such as Will Clark and Robby Thompson, which 
inspired the promotional radio jingle "Ya gotta watch these Giants! You 
gotta like these kids!!" and followed up in 1987 with canny trades for 
stars like Kevin Mitchell, Dave Dravecky, Candy Maldonado, and Rick Reuschel. 
Craig, renowned as the "Humm Baby" because he often said it, managed the 
Giants from late 1985 to 1992. In his first five full seasons with the 
Giants, the team had winning records. The Giants won 83 games in 1986 and 
won the National League Western Division title in 1987, losing the 1987 
National League Championship Series to the St. Louis Cardinals in seven 
games. The one bright spot in that defeat was their slugging outfielder 
Jeffrey Leonard, who was named the Most Valuable Player for the series 
in a losing effort. In Leonard's own faltering words, the prize money ($50,000) 
meant nothing to him, but only the win that eluded him and his team. He 
would have given anything to be going up north to play the Minnesota Twins, 
and his former teammate outfielder Dan Gladden, traded to the Twins at 
the start of the season, in the 1987 World Series. Although the team used 
fifteen different starting pitchers in the regular season, the 1989 Giants 
won the National League pennant. They were led by 1989 National League 
All-Star Game starting pitcher Rick Reuschel, closer and 1989 National 
League ERA leader Scott Garrelts, 1989 National League Most Valuable Player 
Kevin Mitchell, and Will Clark. The Giants beat the Chicago Cubs in the 
National League Championship Series, four games to one. In Game 1, first 
baseman Will Clark hit a grand slam off Greg Maddux in the fourth inning 
after reading Maddux's lips telling his catcher which pitch he was going 
to throw. In Game 5, Clark, who was the Most Valuable Player in the series 
for batting .650 with eight RBIs, came through in the clutch with a bases-loaded, 
two-out single off hard-throwing lefty closer Mitch Williams to break a 
1–1 tie in the bottom of the eighth inning. With two outs in the top of 
the 9th inning, Giants closer Steve Bedrosian gave up three straight singles 
and a run before getting the dangerous Ryne Sandberg on a harmless first-pitch 
groundout straight to Robby Thompson at second, who threw easily to Clark 
for the final out, stranding the tying run at second, as longtime Giants 
radio voice Hank Greenwald proclaimed, "27 years of waiting have come to 
an end. The Giants have won the pennant!" After dispatching the Cubs four 
games to one, the Giants faced the Oakland Athletics in the unforgettable 
"Bay Bridge Series", best remembered by the October 17, 1989 Loma Prieta 
earthquake which struck at 5:04 p.m. just before the scheduled Game 3 at 
Candlestick Park. After a ten-day delay, Oakland finished its sweep of 
the Giants, winning Games 3 & 4 at San Francisco. The Giants never led 
in any of the games, and never even managed to send the tying run to the 
plate against A's closer Dennis Eckersley in their last at-bat of Game 
4. The Giants and A's had played three World Series before when John McGraw's 
Giants were in New York and Connie Mack's A's were in Philadelphia, the 
Giants winning in 1905 on Christy Mathewson's record three complete-game 
shutouts and the A's in 1911 & 1913 behind Home Run Baker and Eddie Collins. 
In the wake of that disappointing 1989 World Series sweep, a local ballot 
initiative to fund a new stadium in San Francisco failed, threatening the 
franchise's future in the city. After the 1992 season, owner Bob Lurie, 
who had previously saved the franchise from moving to Toronto in 1976, 
put the team up for sale. A group of investors from St. Petersburg led 
by Vince Naimoli reached an agreement to purchase the team and move them 
to the Tampa Bay area, but the National League owners voted against the 
acquisition.[17] Wally Haas, the owner of the Oakland Athletics at the 
time, agreed to grant the Giants exclusive rights to the South Bay so the 
Giants could explore all potential local sites for a new stadium and at 
least help to keep the team in the Bay Area. The team was instead sold 
to an ownership group including managing general partner Peter Magowan, 
former CEO of supermarket chain Safeway, and Harmon and Sue Burns. In addition 
to the anticipated move to downtown San Francisco, the Giants' ownership 
also made a major personnel move to solidify fan support. Before even hiring 
a new general manager or officially being approved as the new managing 
general partner, Magowan signed superstar slugger free agent Barry Bonds 
away from the Pittsburgh Pirates, a move which was initially blocked by 
Major League Baseball until terms were negotiated to protect Lurie and 
Bonds in case the sale failed.[citation needed] The Barry Bonds era began 
auspiciously as Bonds put up the numbers for the third MVP of his career: 
46 home runs, 129 runs, 123 runs batted in, .336 batting average, .458 
on-base percentage, .677 slugging percentage, 1.135 on base plus slugging. 
All exceeded his numbers from previous years.[18] Matt Williams excelled 
as well (38 home runs, 110 runs batted in, .294 batting average), with 
veterans Robby Thompson and Will Clark, the latter in his last season with 
the Giants, providing additional offensive support. John Burkett and Bill 
Swift won more than twenty games apiece, and closer Rod Beck was dominant 
with 48 saves and a 2.16 ERA.[19] All this led the Giants to a 103–59 record 
in Dusty Baker's first year as manager, which earned him the Manager of 
the Year award. But despite the Giants' great record, the Atlanta Braves 
— fueled by solid seasons from David Justice, Ron Gant, Deion Sanders and 
their key midseason acquisition of Fred McGriff from the San Diego Padres 
— came back from a ten-game deficit to pass the Giants win the NL West 
by a single game.[20] The Braves also had two 20+-game winners, Tom Glavine 
and Cy Young Award-winning Greg Maddux. Desperately needing a win against 
the Dodgers in the final game of the year to force a one-game playoff with 
the Braves in San Francisco, the controversial choice of rookie pitcher 
Salomón Torres proved disastrous for the Giants as he gave up three runs 
in the first four innings of a 12–1 rout. The only other rested Giants 
starter, Scott Sanderson, was not chosen because he was considered a fly-ball 
pitcher and the Dodgers were a fly-ball-hitting team. After the major leagues' 
establishment of the three-division playoff format with a fourth wild card 
entry after the 1993 season, New York Times sports columnist Dave Anderson 
captured the feeling of many baseball purists regarding the thrilling – 
and for Giants fans, heartbreaking – winner-take-all outcome of the last 
two-division National League West when he characterized the 1993 National 
League regular season as "the last pure pennant race." The 1994 to 1996 
seasons were not good for the Giants, punctuated by the strike that canceled 
the rest of the 1994 baseball season and the World Series. The strike denied 
Matt Williams a chance to beat Roger Maris's single season home run record: 
He had 43 home runs in the Giants' first 115, and was thus on pace for 
60 when the strike hit with 47 games left to play. But the rest of the 
team wasn't as good as their two sluggers, with no other player having 
even 10 home runs or even 40 RBI that late into the season although they 
were still in contention, not far from the division lead, when the strike 
ended play in mid-August.[21] When Commissioner Bud Selig refused to budge 
in negotiations with the owners, a radio sports talk-show host quipped, 
"Hitler, Mussolini and Tojo couldn't cancel the World Series [in World 
War II], but Selig did!"[citation needed] The Giants finished a dismal 
last in both 1995 and 1996, crippled by key injuries and slumps. 1995 had 
a strange feeling about it, with many fans not coming back after the strike-shortened 
1994 season, something that kept attendances notably lower until the McGwire-Sosa 
record-breaking home run chase of 1998. Bonds continued as the Giants' 
driving force, posting fantastic numbers, with the highest WAR among position 
players in the National League (33 HR, 104 RBI, 109 R and 120 BB in 144 
games). Matt Williams and Glenallen Hill were the only other Giants with 
at least 20 home runs, and the rest of the team had mediocre offensive 
numbers. The pitching staff was poor, with Mark Leiter leading the way 
with ten wins, going 10–12 with a 3.82 earned run average. Closer Rod Beck 
had 33 saves but nine blown saves and a 4.45 earned run average.[22] 1996 
was highlighted by Bonds' joining the 40–40 club as only the second member, 
after the A's José Canseco in 1988, with 42 home runs and 40 stolen bases, 
along with 129 runs batted in, 151 walks, and a .308 batting average. Rookie 
Bill Mueller also provided hope for the future of the club with a .330 
average, with 66 hits in 200 at bats over 55 games. The pitching was scarcely 
better than in 1995. Only Mark Gardner had more than 10 wins, going 12–7 
with a 4.42 earned run average, and Rod Beck had 35 saves and a 3.34 ERA 
but nine losses and the rest of the bullpen was woeful.[23] The low point 
came in late June when the Giants, after surging to three games over .500 
and second place in the National League West, lost 10 straight games en 
route to a 68–94 record. Their long-time radio voice, Hank Greenwald, retired 
after the season. After three consecutive losing seasons, the Giants named 
Brian Sabean as their new general manager for 1997, replacing Bob Quinn. 
Sabean may have been acting as GM even before the announcement, and was 
rumored to have engineered the deal to get southpaw starter Kirk Rueter 
from the Montreal Expos. His tenure began with controversy. In his first 
official trade, he shocked Giants fans by trading Matt Williams to Cleveland 
for what newspapers referred to as a 'bunch of spare parts', with a negative 
reaction great enough for him to explain publicly, "I didn't get to this 
point by being an idiot... I'm sitting here telling you there is a plan." 
Sabean was proven right: The Giants acquired for Williams — slugging second 
baseman Jeff Kent, shortstop José Vizcaíno and bullpen setup man Julián 
Tavárez, along with Joe Roa and the $1 million in cash that enabled them 
to sign center fielder and leadoff hitter Darryl Hamilton — and a subsequent 
trade with Anaheim for clutch-hitting, slick-fielding first baseman J.T. 
Snow – turned out to be major contributors, leading the Giants to their 
first National League West title of the decade in 1997. Snow, Kent, and 
Bonds each had over 100 runs batted in, and pitcher Shawn Estes' 19 wins 
against only 5 losses led the team. Rod Beck had his usual fine season 
with 37 saves.[24] 1997 also saw the introduction of interleague play to 
major league baseball, with the division-winning Giants going 10-6 against 
the four American League West teams: Seattle Mariners, Texas Rangers, Anaheim 
Angels and Oakland A's.[25] On June 12 the Giants beat the Rangers 4-3 
in the first regular season interleague game in major league history. But 
the wild-card Florida Marlins ended the Giants' season with a 3–0 sweep 
in the first round of the playoffs. In 1998, the Giants were fueled by 
good seasons from sluggers Jeff Kent and Barry Bonds, both with 30+ HR 
and 100+ RBI, and from starters Kirk Rueter (16–9 W-L record, 4.36 ERA), 
Mark Gardner (13–6, 4.33) and newly acquired Orel Hershiser (11–10, 4.41).[26] 
New closer Robb Nen had 40 saves. A hot September stretch tied them for 
the NL wild card, but they lost a one-game playoff at Chicago's Wrigley 
Field. 1999 saw the Giants finish second in the NL West with an 86–76 record. 
Barry Bonds's production dropped as he hit .262, his lowest average in 
a decade. He did, however, hit 34 home runs even though he missed more 
than a third of the season due to injury, and other team regulars put up 
very good supporting numbers including Snow, Kent, shortstop Rich Aurilia 
and outfielder Ellis Burks, all with 20+ HR and 80+ RBI. Marvin Benard 
also had a career year in center field with 16 home runs, 64 RBIs and a 
career- and team-high 27 stolen bases. The pitching staff was paced by 
Russ Ortiz (18–9, 3.81) and Kirk Rueter (15–10, 5.41).[27] With the knowledge 
that their days in Candlestick Park were numbered, the 1999 season ended 
with a series of promotions and tributes. After the final game of the season, 
a loss to the Dodgers, home plate was ceremoniously removed and taken by 
CHP helicopter to the new grounds where the downtown stadium was being 
built. (Candlestick Park remained the home of the San Francisco 49ers football 
team through the 2013 season.) In 2000, after 40 years, the Giants bade 
farewell to Candlestick Park and, as long advocated, moved into a privately 
financed downtown stadium (AT&T Park, originally Pacific or "Pac" Bell 
Park and later renamed SBC Park) on that part of the shoreline of China 
Basin known to Giants fans as McCovey Cove, at the corner of 3rd and King 
Streets (with an official address of 24 Willie Mays Plaza in honor of the 
longtime Giants superstar), ushering in a new era for the Giants and their 
fans. The Giants routinely sell out their new nearly 43,000-seat state-of-the-art 
stadium built for the 21st century, whereas paltry paid attendances of 
less than 10,000 were not uncommon in Candlestick despite its nearly 60,000 
seating capacity, although by the 1999 season the Giants did manage to 
draw about 25,000 fans per game. The team in its striking new location 
annually vies for highest MLB season attendance in contrast to often having 
had the lowest attendance in the NL (or close to it) previously. Still 
quite breezy in summer compared to other MLB parks, AT&T Park has been 
a consensus success despite its reputation as a "pitcher's park" stingy 
for power hitters. Its state-of-the-art design minimizes wind-chill, it 
is well served by mass transit and has spectacular views of the bay and 
the city skyline, traits all lacking at Candlestick especially after it 
was redesigned in the early 1970s to accommodate the NFL 49ers. AT&T Park 
is the centerpiece of a renaissance in San Francisco's South Beach and 
Mission Bay neighborhoods, known for what has been called sustainable design.[28] 
Despite inaugural game festivities at the new ballpark, the Dodgers spoiled 
the 2000 season opener with an unexpected three-HR outburst by little-known, 
light-hitting shortstop Kevin Elster. But the Giants rebounded after losing 
their first six games in their new home with a solid effort all season 
long, culminating with not only the NL West Division title but the best 
record in the major leagues. Kent paced the attack with clutch hits (33 
HR, 125 RBI) en route to being elected MVP over runner-up Bonds with 49 
HR & 106 RBI. The pitching staff was not great but certainly decent, five 
starters earning at least ten wins: Liván Hernández (17–11, 3.75), Russ 
Ortíz (14–12, 5.01), Kirk Rueter (11–9, 3.96), Shawn Estes (15–6, 4.26) 
and Mark Gardner (11–7, 4.05). Closer Robb Nen was nearly perfect, with 
41 saves and a minute 1.50 ERA.[29] The Giants lost the 2000 division series 
to the New York Mets three games to one after a solid win in Game 1 on 
the postseason clutch pitching of Liván Hernández. But the Mets won the 
next three games despite decent starts by Estes, Ortíz and Mark Gardner. 
Game 2 in particular ended tumultuously but disappointingly. Down 4–1 in 
the ninth, Snow smacked a three-run home run to tie the game; but the Mets 
won in the tenth with a run off Félix Rodríguez, Bonds making the last 
out, stranding two runners, on a controversial called third strike.[30] 
In 2001, the Giants were eliminated from playoff contention on the next-to-last 
day of the season. Slugging shortstop Rich Aurilia put up stellar numbers 
(37 HR, 97 RBI, .324 BA) in support of Bonds, who once again gave fans 
something to cheer about with his single-season record 73 home runs, surpassing 
Mark McGwire's 70 in 1998. The pitching staff was good but not great, with 
Russ Ortíz (17–9, 3.29) leading a staff that also had Liván Hernández (13–15, 
5.24) and Kirk Rueter (14–12, 4.42). Shawn Estes and Mark Gardner had subpar 
years, but a notable late-season acquisition from the Pirates was superstar 
starter Jason Schmidt (7–1, 3.39). Robb Nen continued as a dominant closer 
(45 saves, 3.01 ERA).[31] In 2002, the Giants finished second in the NL 
West behind the Arizona Diamondbacks, bolstered by another MVP season for 
Bonds (46 HR, 110 RBI, .370 BA, a then-record 198 walks and a .582 OBP) 
and Kent (37 HR, 108 RBI and .313 BA).[32] Additional roster support was 
provided by decent seasons from veteran catcher Benito Santiago and Aurilia, 
aided by new acquisitions third baseman David Bell, slugging outfielder 
Reggie Sanders and fleet-footed outfielder Tsuyoshi Shinjo, (generally 
known by last name only), who spent only one season with the Giants before 
returning to Japan. The pitching staff again proved solid, with five starters 
winning 12 or more including Jason Schmidt in his first full season in 
San Francisco. Closer Robb Nen had 43 saves and a 2.20 ERA, and setup men 
Felix Rodríguez and Tim Worrell were solid out of the bullpen. The Giants 
made the playoffs as the NL wild card in the last weekend of the season. 
They began by defeating the Atlanta Braves in the NLDS three games to two, 
with Ortíz winning Games 1 and 5 in Atlanta. With the tying runs on base 
in the bottom of the 9th inning, Snow ending the deciding game with a spectacular 
double play ending in a rundown between first and second.[33] In the NLCS, 
they defeated the St. Louis Cardinals four games to one with wins by Rueter, 
Schmidt and two by Worrell in relief.[34] Santiago, particularly for his 
late clutch game-turning and -winning home run in Game 4, was elected MVP 
of the NLCS. The Giants then faced the American League champion Anaheim 
Angels (now known as the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim) in the World Series, 
marking the first World Series between two wild-card teams. The Giants 
split the first two (one-run) games in Anaheim, were beaten 10-4 by the 
visiting Angels in Game 3, then won Games 4 & 5 in Pac Bell Park, 4-3 and 
16-4. The Series shifted back to Anaheim for Game 6. With the Giants leading 
the Series three-games-to-two and leading 5-0 with one out in the bottom 
of the 7th inning, manager Dusty Baker removed starter Russ Ortíz after 
he gave up two straight singles and handed him what Baker hoped would be 
the "game ball" as he walked off the mound. Moments later, after fouling 
off numerous fastballs, the Angels' Scott Spiezio hit a three-run home 
run off reliever Félix Rodríguez. The Giants' closer Robb Nen, pitching 
"on fumes and guts" with an injured right shoulder, gave up an eighth-inning 
two-run double to Troy Glaus, who was the Most Valuable Player for the 
series, and the Angels won the game 6–5 and capture the momentum in the 
Series. The following night, Anaheim cruised to a 4–1 victory behind an 
early three-run double by Garret Anderson off Hernández to claim the Series. 
After 2002, the Giants went through many personnel changes. Baker's managerial 
contract was not renewed after ten seasons. Closer Nen's damaged shoulder 
ended his career, forcing him into early retirement; and Kent, moving on 
to the Houston Astros in his native Texas, was not re-signed. He had aroused 
front-office ire earlier in the season with an off-field injury when he 
fell off the roof of his vehicle while shining it, and by getting into 
a public scrap with Bonds in the dugout in the middle of a game. Position 
players David Bell, Reggie Sanders, Tsuyoshi Shinjo and Kenny Lofton, as 
well as pitchers Liván Hernández, Russ Ortiz and southpaw reliever Aaron 
Fultz (winner of 2002 World Series Game 4), all went to other teams in 
2003 as well. In the 2003 season the Giants, under new manager Felipe Alou, 
won 100 games for the seventh time in franchise history and the third time 
in San Francisco, winning their division for the third time in seven seasons 
and spending every day of the season in first place, the ninth team to 
accomplish that feat in baseball history. Their offense was paced by yet 
another MVP season from Bonds (45 HR, 90 RBI, .341 BA, 148 BB and an OBP 
of .529). Decent offensive support was provided by Rich Aurilia, Marquis 
Grissom, José Cruz Jr., Edgardo Alfonzo, Benito Santiago, Pedro Felíz and 
Andrés Galarrága. The pitching staff was led by Jason Schmidt (17–5, 2.34 
ERA) and Kirk Rueter (10–5, 4.53), but dropped off after that, no other 
starter earning ten wins.[35] Once again in the playoffs, and just like 
in 1997, the Giants faced the eventual-world-champion Florida Marlins in 
the NLDS. Schmidt won Game 1 in San Francisco with a low-scoring complete 
game outdueling Josh Beckett; but the Marlins won the next three games, 
and the series three games to one, as the Giants bullpen faltered after 
Game 2 starter Sidney Ponson imploded, blowing a big early Giants lead. 
As usually reliable outfielder Fred Snodgrass blew the deciding game of 
the 1912 World Series on the road with the Giants one run ahead going into 
the last of the tenth with a notorious "muff" of a fly ball by the leadoff 
hitter ending with the home team Boston Red Sox scoring two runs for a 
come-from-behind walk-off win, exactly the same scenario happened in the 
last of the tenth in Florida in Game 3 of the 2003 NLDS with a muff of 
another easy leadoff fly ball by otherwise slick-fielding José Cruz, Jr, 
ending with Iván Rodríguez's two-out, two-run, come-from-behind bases-loaded 
walk-off win for the Marlins off closer Tim Worrell.[36] In 2004, Bonds 
broke his own records with 232 walks and a .609 OBP en route to his 7th 
and last NL MVP award (45 HR, 101 RBI, .362 BA). The team also had a solid 
but not stellar supporting cast including Marquís Grissom (22, 90, .279) 
and Pedro Felíz (22, 84, .276), along with decent hitting by Ray Durham, 
Edgárdo Alfónzo, Michael Tucker and AJ Pierzynski. Jason Schmidt was the 
star of the staff (18–7, 3.20 ERA, 251 SO), but the team was constantly 
looking for a new closer (Matt Herges and Dustin Hermanson sharing the 
role during the season).[37] After sitting out most of the first half of 
the season with an injury, Snow led the league in hitting after the All-Star 
Break. The Giants' 2005 season was the least successful of the decade in 
their new stadium. Bonds missed almost the entire season with a knee injury, 
erratic closer Armando Benítez was injured for four months, and ace Jason 
Schmidt struggled after numerous injuries. But management took advantage 
of the off-year to give playing time to numerous young players, including 
pitchers Noah Lowry, Brad Hennessey, Kevin Correia, Scott Munter, Matt 
Cain and Jeremy Accardo, as well as first baseman Lance Niekro and outfielders 
Jason Ellison and Todd Linden. The acquisition of veteran outfield contact 
hitter Randy Winn from the Seattle Mariners was invaluable in the stretch 
run. On May 25, the Giants held a celebration for Baseball Hall of Famer 
Juan Marichal. A statue of Marichál was dedicated on the plaza outside 
the stadium. Leonel Fernández, the President of the Dominican Republic, 
attended. In the two games following the ceremonies, the Giants wore uniforms 
with the word GIGANTES (Spanish for "Giants") on the front of their jerseys. 
On July 14, 2005, the franchise won its 10,000th game, defeating their 
longtime rival Dodgers, 4–3 and thereby becoming the first professional 
sports franchise to have a five-figure win total. On September 28, the 
Giants were officially eliminated from the NL West race after losing to 
the division champion San Diego Padres, finishing a distant third at 75–87, 
their worst, and first losing, season since 1996. Despite the disappointing 
finish, the Giants extended manager Felipe Alou's contract for another 
year. The Giants were expected to contend in 2006 with a strong starting 
staff. Despite a losing streak in May, and the worst batting performance 
by Barry Bonds in about 15 years[18] the Giants did contend in the less-than-stellar 
Western Division and by July 23 were in first place. A 3–16 stretch ensued, 
with nine one-run losses, and combined with a season-ending eight losses 
in nine games, the team finished in third place with a 76–85 record.[38] 
On October 2, 2006, the day after the end of the regular season, the Giants 
announced that they would not renew manager Felipe Alou's contract but 
still offer him the opportunity to stay with them in an advisory role to 
the general manager and to baseball operations. With eleven free agents 
(excluding Jason Schmidt) who signed with the Dodgers for roughly $15 million 
a year, a new manager on board (Bruce Bochy, division rival San Diego manager 
since the mid-1990s who left the Padres to manage the Giants), and the 
loss of veteran catcher Mike Matheny due to complications (cumulative trauma) 
resulting from concussions sustained during his career,[39] the Giants' 
prospects for the 2007 season were less than favorable as 2006 came to 
an end. They then made several deals, re-signing infielders Pedro Feliz, 
Ray Durham and longtime fan favorite Rich Aurilia, and picking up catcher 
Bengie Molina, slugger Ryan Klesko and outfielder Dave Roberts. They also 
signed free-agent pitcher Barry Zito to a lucrative seven-year contract 
worth $126 million with an $18 million option for an eighth year, the richest 
pitcher's contract in baseball history at the time. On January 9, 2007, 
they re-signed pitcher Russ Ortiz to compete for the fifth starting position 
in spring training, which he won by late March due to his outstanding spring. 
They got off to a slow start in the regular season, with spurts of promise 
but more often stretches of mediocre play at best. Pitching was often inconsistent 
or the offense nonexistent (such as in a pair of 1–0 losses for young star 
starter Matt Cain, for whom lack of run support was a frequent problem). 
The season was memorable in some regards, such as the Giants – Red Sox 
series in Fenway Park, their first appearance there since they lost the 
deciding game of the 1912 World Series with two errors in the last of the 
tenth after scoring a go-ahead run in the top of the tenth, and their hosting 
of the 2007 MLB All-Star Game. Much more notable, however, was Bonds' march 
toward Hank Aaron's 755 career home run record that brought heavy media 
attention to the San Francisco Giants. Leading off in the top of the second 
before a sellout crowd at Petco Park in San Diego in Game 2 of that series, 
Bonds hit a high fastball off the facing of the upper deck in left field 
for an off-field jack, tying the score at 1-1 and Aaron at 755, although 
they lost 3-2 in extra innings. In the bottom of the fifth at home against 
the Washington Nationals on the night of August 7, he smashed number 756 
into the deep center field bleachers, causing a melee in the crowd scrambling 
for the ball, which later earned six figures at auction for the young man 
who came up with it. Aaron, appearing on the big screen, congratulated 
him personally, but the luckless Giants lost the game, 8-6. On August 9, 
2007, left-handed pinch-hitter Mark Sweeney was traded to the Los Angeles 
Dodgers for AA second baseman Travis Denker, marking the first trade between 
the Giants and the Dodgers since 1985.[40] The 2007 season continued discouraging 
for the Giants, with solid pitching but often without run support. Rookie 
starter Tim Lincecum, for instance, held the Chicago Cubs to two hits through 
eight innings on August 21, but the team scored only one run in a 5-1 loss. 
On September 22, 2007, the Giants officially announced they would not re-sign 
Barry Bonds for the 2008 season. After much speculation and debate, owner 
Peter Magowan announced Bonds' departure at a press conference, stressing 
the need for youth and offense throughout the lineup.[41] Bonds played 
the last game of his career on September 26, 2007. He went 0 for 3, driving 
a ball that was caught at the warning track in left-center field in his 
final at-bat and then leaving on his own although he had another at-bat 
coming had he stayed in the game. 2008, the 51st season for the Giants 
in San Francisco, was their first without Barry Bonds since 1992. Their 
first big move was to sign gutsy Philadelphia Phillies center fielder Aaron 
Rowand to a 5-year, $60 million contract. Barry Zito, in his second year 
as a Giant, once again got off to a poor start, losing his first eight 
decisions; but the team found hope with Tim Lincecum in his first full 
season. After going 7–5 as a rookie in 2007, he exploded as a sophomore 
starter, winning four straight before his first loss on April 29, 2008, 
to the Colorado Rockies. Lincecum was selected to the 2008 MLB All-Star 
Game at Yankee Stadium, but was hospitalized with flulike symptoms and 
couldn't pitch in the midsummer classic. He soon recovered, however, and 
even went on to win the 2008 NL Cy Young Award, finishing at 18–5 and becoming 
the first Giant to win that prestigious trophy since Mike McCormick won 
it in 1967.[42] The Giants finished the season in fourth place in the NL 
West with a record of 72–90. During the 2008-09 off-season, the Giants 
strengthened their pitching staff with veteran starting pitcher Randy Johnson 
and relievers Bob Howry and Jeremy Affeldt. They also signed infielders 
Édgar Rentería and Juan Uribe. Bill Neukom also became the new managing 
partner. Despite lingering questions about their struggling offense, they 
were a surprising 49–39 by the 2009 Major League Baseball All-Star Game, 
good enough for second place in the NL West. In addition to the Giants' 
overall performance as a team, the first half of 2009 was memorable for 
several individuals: Johnson became the 24th major league pitcher to win 
300 games, and phenomally gifted but perpetually struggling young southpaw 
starter Jonathan Sánchez tossed a nearly perfect no-hitter against the 
San Diego Padres on July 10 (the only Padre baserunner reached on Juan 
Uribe's late infield error, following the distant footsteps of Giants immortal 
Christy Mathewson, whose 1905 no-no was blemished by only two errors), 
the first Giants no-hitter since 1976. Incredibly, Sánchez accomplished 
his feat spot-starting in place of injured Randy Johnson and returning 
to the rotation after a brief demotion to the bullpen, striking out a career-high 
eleven hitters to boot. It was his first major league complete game and 
shutout, on only 110 pitches for an 8-0 Giants romp, and the first no-hitter 
ever thrown at AT&T Park. In fact, 2009's starting rotation was one of 
the strongest in Giants history, two of whom went to the All-Star Game 
including successfully defending Cy Young champ Tim Lincecum, who started 
the game. He won his second straight NL Cy Young Award even though he won 
only 15 games in 2009, finishing at 15-7, becoming the only pitcher to 
capture the Cy Young Award in each of his first two full major league seasons.[43] 
But tragically on July 19, Sue Burns, the team's senior general partner 
who was a virtual fixture in her seat adjacent to the Giants' dugout, died 
early that Sunday morning of cancer. She was the widow of Harmon Burns, 
a Bay area financier who was a key member of the investor group that had 
saved the team from moving to Tampa at the end of the 1992 season. The 
Giants honored her with a pregame ceremony with Barry Bonds in attendance.[44] 
On July 20, the Giants traded one of their top prospects, AA pitcher Tim 
Alderson, for Pittsburgh Pirates second baseman Freddy Sánchez. Alderson 
was the first round pick in the 2007 draft and was ranked prospect number 
four in the Giants' organization by Baseball America,[45] but Sánchez provided 
a much needed jump for their offense, batting .293 with 41 RBI and 22 walks 
for the season. On September 11, the Giants added another key player when 
they brought up their first-round draft pick, young catcher Buster Posey, 
from their AAA affiliate the Fresno Grizzlies. Although the 2009 Giants 
finished only 14 games above .500, they won 16 more games than in 2008. 
With the emergence of star slugger Pablo Sandoval to provide solid offensive 
support for their dominant pitching staff, they looked forward to making 
the playoffs next year for the first time since 2003.[46] At the start 
of the 2010 season, (Jim Caple of ESPN.com was the only baseball writer 
or pundit to pick the Giants to reach the World Series, although he later 
recanted his pick before the National League Championship Series, saying 
the Philadelphia Phillies would beat the Giants and advance to the World 
Series. Most did not expect San Francisco even to make the playoffs.[47][48][49] 
The Giants won the National League Western Division for the first time 
since 2003, after trailing the San Diego Padres for most of the season. 
In the 2010 National League Division Series, the Giants defeated the Atlanta 
Braves three games to one. In the 2010 National League Championship Series, 
the Giants defeated the Philadelphia Phillies 4–2, and advanced to face 
the Texas Rangers in the 2010 World Series. Behind Tim Lincecum, the Giants 
wrapped up the World Series with a 3-1 Game 5 win for their first world 
championship in San Francisco and the first for the Giants franchise since 
1954.[50] Édgar Rentería was named World Series Most Valuable Player.[51][52] 
The championship firsts were: With their victory in the 2010 World Series, 
the Giants also became the second Major League Baseball team (after the 
St. Louis Cardinals) to win a world championship in three different centuries: 
1800s, 1900s, and 2000s. On November 15, 2010, Giants' catcher Buster Posey 
was named NL Rookie of the Year.[55] 2011 began on a dark note when Giants 
fan paramedic Bryan Stow suffered a life-threatening head injury and was 
permanently disabled in an attack by two Dodgers fans in the Dodgers Stadium 
parking lot on Opening Day after they had insulted and threatened him in 
the stands during the game.[56] Further tragedy ensued on May 25 in extra 
innings when Florida utility man Scott Cousins crashed into the Giants' 
Rookie of the Year catcher Buster Posey as he slid home with the eventual 
Marlin winning run, fracturing Posey's ankle and ending his season.[57] 
San Francisco finished the 2011 season with an 86–76 record, winding up 
in second place in the NL West eight games behind the division-winning 
Arizona Diamondbacks for lack of hitting and other key injuries (such as 
to second baseman Freddy Sánchez in late May shortly before Posey's injury, 
and to closer Brian Wilson in August).[58] The Giants started the season 
playing barely above .500, trailing the Dodgers in second place for most 
of the first half of the season and falling to 7.5 games back near the 
end of May. But a June 17–10 record by the Giants (including a home sweep 
of the Dodgers) while the Dodgers slumped to 11–17 put the Giants as division 
leaders ahead by one game at the end of the month.[59] On June 13, Matt 
Cain pitched the first perfect game in the 130-year history of the franchise, 
against the Houston Astros, at AT&T Park.[60] The Giants and Dodgers continued 
to trade places at the top until August 20, at which point another sweep 
of the Dodgers gave the Giants the lead for good. Melky Cabrera was named 
the Most Valuable Player of the All-Star Game, while Matt Cain was the 
starting and winning pitcher and Sandoval became the first player in All-Star 
Game history to hit a bases-loaded triple.[61] At the trade deadline, the 
Giants acquired right fielder Hunter Pence from the Philadelphia Phillies 
and second baseman Marco Scutaro from the Colorado Rockies. On August 15, 
Cabrera was suspended by Major League Baseball for 50 games for testing 
positive for a performance-enhancing drug. Despite the loss of Cabrera 
and the Dodgers making several blockbuster trades, the Giants still won 
the 2012 NL West Division, led by Scútaro's 20-game hit streak in the last 
twenty games of the regular season for a .306 average and NL MVP-to-be 
Buster Posey's league-leading .336.[62] In the 2012 NLDS, the Giants became 
the first NL team to come back from a 2-0 deficit to beat the Cincinnati 
Reds in three straight games, and were also the first major league team 
to take a best-of-five postseason series by winning the last three on the 
road.[63] The St. Louis Cardinals won three out of the first four games 
in the 2012 NLCS. The Giants won the next three games to advance to the 
2012 World Series, and Scútaro was chosen MVP of the NLCS with his .500 
average.[64] The Giants finished a 4-0 sweep over the Tigers for their 
seventh all-time World Series title, and their second in the previous three 
years.[65] Pablo Sandoval, who hit home runs in his first three at-bats 
in Game 1, and had a .500 average in the World Series, was named the World 
Series MVP.[66][67] Early in the 2013 season, the Giants were in first 
place in the National League West. However, in May, during a road trip 
to Toronto, the Giants began a slide into last place. They struggled both 
offensively and defensively due to several players being injured throughout 
the season, most notably Ángel Pagán, who suffered a hamstring injury mid-season 
and was out for 12 weeks, and were no-hit against the Cincinnati Reds. 
Buster Posey, who had won the previous year's National League batting title, 
experienced a significant drop-off, hitting just 15 home runs (and just 
two in the second half of the season) and slumping to a .294 average. Although 
the Giants won the season series over every team in their own division, 
including going 11-8 over the rival Dodgers, who won the division, they 
went only 32-54 outside of their division, including an MLB second worst 
6-14 record in inter-league play, with their only season series victory 
outside of the National League West being over the Atlanta Braves. In several 
series, the Giants scored 5 runs or fewer, such as against the Red Sox 
(outscored 21-4, lost series 2-1), against the Yankees (outscored 12-3, 
lost series 2-1), against the Cardinals in St. Louis (outscored 17-5, lost 
series 2-1), against the Blue Jays in San Francisco (outscored 5-2, split 
series 1-1), and against the Cubs in San Francisco (outscored 6-3, swept). 
This slide lasted until mid-August when the Giants began to play efficiently 
again (highlighted by a 19-3 romp over the rival Dodgers in Los Angeles) 
and ended the season in a tie for 3rd place with the San Diego Padres after 
a brief resurgence. At the conclusion of the season the Giants also signed 
right fielder Hunter Pence to a five-year, $90 million contract. The Giants 
finished the 2013 season with a 76-86 record. The Giants' .469 record marked 
their first losing record since 2008 and one of the worst records ever 
for a team that had won the World Series the previous year, behind only 
the 1998 Florida Marlins.[68] One notable highlight was Tim Lincecum throwing 
his first no-hitter against the San Diego Padres at Petco Park in a 9-0 
victory. A notable oddity happened during a doubleheader with the Cincinnati 
Reds on July 23 in which the Reds were the designated home team for Game 
2 even though the Giants were playing at home. The Reds won Game 1 9-3 
and the Giants prevailed in Game 2 5-3. The Giants acquired outfielder 
Michael Morse and starting pitcher Tim Hudson in the offseason. At one 
point, the Giants had twice as many wins as they had losses, sporting a 
42-21 record.[69] However, their 9.5 game lead over the Dodgers dissipated. 
Lincecum pitched his second no-hitter, also against the Padres. With a 
won-loss record of 12-9, Lincecum achieved more wins than his previous 
2 seasons,[70] though second-half struggles put Lincecum out of the starting 
rotation.[71] The Giants finished the season with an 88-74 record, the 
first time in baseball's modern era that they had reached the postseason 
with under 90 wins.[69] The Giants defeated the Pirates in the 2014 National 
League Wild Card Game, 8-0, with Bumgarner pitching a complete game and 
Crawford hitting a grand slam off of Pirates starter Edinson Vólquez, the 
first in MLB postseason history by a shortstop.[72] The Giants won the 
2014 NLDS, defeating the Nationals[73] and passing the Cincinnati Reds' 
Big Red Machine for a new National League record in consecutive postseason 
victories.[74] The Giants played the Cardinals in the 2014 NLCS rematch, 
winning in five games. Travis Ishikawa hit a game winning walk-off 3 run 
homer in game 5. Madison Bumgarner was named MVP of the series.[75] The 
Giants faced the Kansas City Royals in the 2014 World Series, defeating 
the AL Champions in 7 games, winning 4 games to 3.[76] Madison Bumgarner 
was also named the World Series MVP.[77] The championship was the Giants' 
third in a five-year span, spurring debate over whether the Giants could 
be considered a modern-day baseball dynasty.[78][79][80] During the 2015 
offseason, the Giants lost two key contributors, Pablo Sandoval and Michael 
Morse, who both became free agents and signed with the Boston Red Sox and 
the Miami Marlins respectively. After Sandoval's departure, there was talk 
of moving Buster Posey to third base, Sandoval's position.[81] Marco Scutaro, 
the Giants injury-plagued second baseman, was also released, with Joe Panik 
taking his position. Over the offseason, Giants dealt for Casey McGehee 
and Nori Aoki to replace Sandoval and Morse respectively, avoided arbitration 
with Brandon Belt and Brandon Crawford, resigned Sergio Romo and Jake Peavy, 
had free-agent Ryan Vogelsong come back, and looked forward to the returns 
of Matt Cain and Ángel Pagán. Despite the team remaining mostly the same, 
some concerns existed. The rotation was one of the oldest in the major 
leagues, and except for Madison Bumgarner, no starting pitcher ended with 
a winning record in 2014. Many believed McGehee and Aoki couldn't make 
up for the power lost from the departures Sandoval and Morse. However, 
the Giants remained in high hopes entering 2015, looking to break the odd-year 
"curse" established in 2011 and 2013. Indeed, the season began poorly for 
the team, and included an eight-game losing streak.[82] However, a home 
sweep of the arch rival Dodgers lifted the Giants' outlook, and an additional 
sweep of the Los Angeles Angels in the opening days of May, with Lincecum 
winning the final game of the series, further improved their prospects.[83][84] 
By mid-May the team welcomed Hunter Pence, who had broken his arm in spring 
training, back to the lineup, with a fine debut performance in a lopsided 
win in Cincinnati. The victory gave the Giants a winning record and another 
boost to their morale.[85] On June 9, 2015, Chris Heston pitched the 17th 
no-hitter in Giants history against the New York Mets, making 110 pitches, 
striking out 11 including three called strikeouts in the 9th inning, with 
the only baserunners being 3 hit batsmen. Heston also had two hits and 
drove in two runs in the game. The no-hitter was the third by a Giants 
rookie and the first by a visiting pitcher at Citi Field.[86] On June 15, 
2015 the Giants set a record for most consecutive home losses at AT&T Park 
at nine straight games with a 5-1 loss to the Seattle Mariners. This losing 
streak was the Giants' longest since an 11-game home loss streak at the 
Polo Grounds in New York in 1940.[87] Despite the injury bug hitting hard 
again (with Aoki, Pagan, Pence, Panik, and newly acquired Leake suffering 
extended in-season injuries), the Giants remained deep in the playoff hunt, 
due to contributions by rookies Chris Heston and Matt Duffy, as well as 
Buster Posey's MVP-like season. However, with Hunter Pence out again with 
an oblique strain in the middle of a brutal stretch in the schedule, the 
Giants faced a major uphill battle. They acquired outfielder Marlon Byrd 
to deal with Pagan and Pence's absences; he made an immediate impact, almost 
hitting for the cycle in a 6-4 win against the Wild Card-leading Pirates. 
However, the Giants still finished 84-78 and missed the playoffs. In 2016, 
the Giants started off strong, ending their first half at the All-Star 
break with the best record in the majors at 57-33. However, due to a struggling 
bullpen in the second half, they just barely qualified for the 2016 postseason 
in the 2nd NL Wild Card spot. In the process they blew an 8 game lead to 
the rival Los Angeles Dodgers, who were missing star pitcher Clayton Kershaw 
for 2 1/2 months.[88] The Giants' run at even year championships ended 
with a game 4 loss to the eventual world champion Chicago Cubs in the 2016 
NLDS. In Game 4 the Giants led 5–2 before they were eliminated after allowing 
four runs to the Cubs in the 9th. They had MLB record 10-game winning streak 
when facing elimination in the postseason. The Giants' rivalry with the 
Los Angeles Dodgers dates back to when the two teams were based in New 
York, as does their rivalry with the New York Yankees. Their rivalry with 
the Oakland Athletics dates back to when the Giants were in New York and 
the A's were in Philadelphia and played each other in the 1905, 1911, & 
1913 World Series, and was renewed in 1968 when the Athletics moved from 
Kansas City and the teams again played each other in the earthquake-interrupted 
1989 Bay Bridge World Series. The 2010 NLCS inaugurated a Giants rivalry 
with the Philadelphia Phillies after confrontations between Jonathan Sánchez 
and Chase Utley, and between Ramón Ramírez and Shane Victorino. However, 
with the Philadelphia Phillies dropping off as one of the premier teams 
of the National League, this rivalry has died down since 2010 and 2011. 
Another rivalry that has intensified recently is with the St. Louis Cardinals, 
whom the team has faced 4 times in the NLCS. The rivalry between the New 
York Giants and Chicago Cubs in the early twentieth century had been universally 
regarded as one of the most heated in baseball,[89] with Merkle's Boner 
leading to a 1908 season-ending matchup in New York of particular note. 
That historical rivalry was revisited in their one-game playoff in Chicago 
at the end of the 1998 season, and on June 6, 2012 in a "Turn Back The 
Century" game in which both teams wore replica 1912 uniforms.[90] The Giants-Dodgers 
rivalry is one of the greatest and longest-standing rivalries in team sports, 
and has been regarded as the most intense in American baseball.[8][9] The 
Giants-Dodgers feud began in the late 19th century when both clubs were 
based in New York City, with the Dodgers based in Brooklyn and the Giants 
playing at the Polo Grounds in upper Manhattan. After the 1957 season, 
Dodgers owner Walter O'Malley decided to move the team to Los Angeles primarily 
for financial reasons.[91] Along the way, he managed to convince Giants 
owner Horace Stoneham (who was considering moving his team to Minnesota) 
to preserve the rivalry by taking his team to San Francisco as well.[91] 
New York baseball fans were stunned and heartbroken by the move.[91][92] 
Given that the cities of Los Angeles and San Francisco have long been competitors 
in economic, cultural and political arenas, their new California venues 
became fertile ground for transplantation of the ancient rivalry. Both 
teams' having endured for over a century while leaping across an entire 
continent, as well as the rivalry's growth from cross-city to cross-state, 
have led to its being considered one of the greatest in sports history.[93][94][95] 
The Giants-Dodgers rivalry has been marked by the Giants' slightly better 
success. While the Giants have more total wins, head-to-head wins, National 
League pennants and World Series titles in their franchise histories, the 
Dodgers have won the National League West 5 more times than the Giants 
since the start of division play in 1969. Both teams have made the postseason 
as a National League wild card twice. The Giants won their first world 
championship in California in 2010, while the Dodgers won their last world 
title in 1988. As of the end of the 2014 baseball season, the Los Angeles 
Dodgers lead the San Francisco Giants in California World Series triumphs, 
5-3, whereas in 20th century New York, the Giants led the Dodgers in World 
Series championships, 5-1. The combined franchise histories give the Giants 
an 8-6 edge in MLB championships, overall. A geographic rivalry with the 
cross-Bay American League Athletics greatly increased with the 1989 World 
Series, nicknamed the "Battle of the Bay", which Oakland swept (and which 
was interrupted by the Loma Prieta earthquake moments before the scheduled 
start of Game 3 in San Francisco). In addition, the introduction of interleague 
play in 1997 has pitted the two teams against each other for usually six 
games every season since 1997, three in each city (but only four in 2013, 
two in each city). Before 1997, they played each other only in Cactus League 
spring training. Their interleague play wins and losses (53-50 in favor 
of the A's after a Giants sweep of an interleague series from July 24–26, 
2015) have been fairly evenly divided despite differences in league, style 
of play, stadium, payroll, fan base stereotypes, media coverage and World 
Series records, all of which have heightened the rivalry in recent years.[96] 
The intensity of the rivalry and how it is understood varies among Bay 
Area fans. A's fans generally view the Giants as a hated rival, while Giants 
fans generally view the A's as a friendly rival much lower on the scale. 
This is most likely due to the A's lack of a historical rival, while the 
Giants have their heated rivalry with the Dodgers. Some Bay Area fans are 
fans of both teams. The "split hats" that feature the logos of both teams 
best embodies the shared fan base. Other Bay Area fans view the competition 
between the two teams as a "friendly rivalry", with little actual hatred 
compared to similar ones such as the Subway Series (New York Mets vs. New 
York Yankees), the Red Line Series (Chicago Cubs vs. Chicago White Sox) 
and the Freeway Series (Los Angeles Dodgers vs. Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim). 
The Giants and A's enjoyed a limited rivalry at the start of the 20th century 
before the Yankees began to dominate after the acquisition of Babe Ruth 
in 1920, when the Giants were in New York and the A's were in Philadelphia. 
The teams were managed by legendary leaders John McGraw and Connie Mack, 
who were considered not only friendly rivals but the premier managers during 
that era, especially in view of their longevity (Mack for 50 years, McGraw 
for 30) since both were majority owners. Each team played in five of the 
first 15 World Series (tying them with the Red Sox and Cubs for most World 
Series appearances during that time period). As the New York Giants and 
the Philadelphia A's, they met in three World Series, with the Giants winning 
in 1905 and the A's in 1911 & 1913. After becoming the San Francisco Giants 
and Oakland A's, they met in a fourth Series in 1989 resulting in the A's 
last world championship (as of 2014). Though in different leagues, the 
Giants have also been historical rivals of the Yankees,[97][98][99] starting 
in New York before the Giants moved to the West Coast. Before the institution 
of interleague play in 1997, the two teams had little opportunity to play 
each other except in seven World Series: 1921, 1922, 1923, 1936, 1937, 
1951 and 1962, the Yankees winning last five of the seven Series. The teams 
have met twice in regular season interleague play as of the end of the 
2012 season: in 2002 at old Yankee Stadium, and in 2007 at AT&T Park. The 
teams met again in late September 2013, with Alex Rodriguez hitting a Grand 
Slam in game 2, breaking Lou Gehrig's grand slam record. In his July 4, 
1939 farewell speech ending with the renowned "Today, I consider myself 
the luckiest man on the face of the earth", Yankee slugger Lou Gehrig, 
who played in 2,130 consecutive games, declared that the Giants were a 
team he "would give his right arm to beat, and vice versa."[100] As of 
2012, the Major League Baseball Hall of Fame has inducted 66 representatives 
of the Giants (55 players and 11 managers) into the Hall of Fame, more

but either played for the Giants and were inducted as a manager having 
never managed the Giants, or managed the Giants and were inducted as a 
player having never played for the Giants: Broadcasters Russ Hodges, Lon 
Simmons, and Jon Miller are permanently honored in the Hall's "Scribes 
& Mikemen" exhibit as a result of winning the Ford C. Frick Award in 1980, 
2004, and 2010 respectively. As with all Frick Award winners, none are 
officially recognized as an inducted member of the Hall of Fame. * Retired 
throughout the major leagues; Robinson actually was traded to the Giants, 
but retired before playing a game for them. In 1944, Carl Hubbell became 
the first National Leaguer to have his number retired by his team.[101] 
Bill Terry, Mel Ott and Hubbell played/managed their entire careers for 
the New York Giants. Willie Mays began his career in New York, moving with 
the Giants to San Francisco in 1958; he did not play in most of 1952 and 
all of 1953 due to his service in the Korean War. Although not officially 
retired, the team has not reissued number 25 since Barry Bonds left the 
team following the 2007 season. John McGraw (3B, 1902–06; Manager, 1902–32) 
and Christy Mathewson (P, 1900–16), who were members of the New York Giants 
before the introduction of uniform numbers, have the letters "NY" displayed 
in place of a number.[102] Broadcasters Lon Simmons (1958–73, 1976–78, 
1996–2002 & 2006), Russ Hodges (1949–70), and Jon Miller (1997–current) 
are each represented by an old-style radio microphone displayed in place 
of a number. The Giants present the Willie Mac Award annually to the player

updated November 7, 2016 Transactions • Depth Chart → All MLB rosters Giants' 
television telecasts are split between NBC-owned KNTV (broadcast) and Comcast 
SportsNet (CSN) Bay Area (cable). KNTV's broadcast contract with the Giants 
began in 2008, one year after the team and KTVU mutually ended a relationship 
that dated to 1961.[104] Jon Miller regularly calls the action on KNTV, 
while the announcing team for CSN telecasts is Mike Krukow and Duane Kuiper, 
affectionately known as "Kruk and Kuip" (pronounced "Kruke" and "Kype"). 
On September 4, 2010, Miller made his first appearance with CSN Bay Area. 
Dave Flemming fills in on select TV broadcasts. The Giants' flagship radio 
station is KNBR (680 AM). KNBR's owner, Cumulus Media, is a limited partner 
in San Francisco Baseball Associates LP, the owner of the team.[105] Miller 
and Flemming are the regular play-by-play announcers. When games are televised 
on KNTV, Kuiper replaces Miller on the radio, and Miller goes to television. 
During a July 23–25, 2010, road game series against the Arizona Diamondbacks, 
Fresno Grizzlies broadcaster Doug Greenwald filled in so that Miller could 
travel to Cooperstown to be honored with the Ford C. Frick Award. J.T. 
Snow also sat in so that Flemming could also attend the award presentation. 
On May 28, 2006, Flemming called the 715th career home run of Barry Bonds, 
which moved Bonds into second on the all-time home run list. Unfortunately, 
the power from Flemming's microphone to the transmitter cut off while the 
ball was in flight, so the radio audience heard only crowd noise. Greg 
Papa took over the broadcast and apologized to listeners. Kuiper's TV call 
was submitted to the Baseball Hall of Fame as an artifact, instead of the
