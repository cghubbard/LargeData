Brandon Tyler Webb (born May 9, 1979) is an American former professional 
baseball player. A pitcher, Webb pitched in Major League Baseball (MLB) 
for the Arizona Diamondbacks from 2003 through 2009. Prior to playing professionally, 
Webb attended the University of Kentucky, where he played college baseball 
for the Kentucky Wildcats baseball team. Webb won the 2006 National League 
Cy Young Award. He is also a three-time MLB All-Star. A series of shoulder 
injuries sidelined him for much of 2009–2012 and after several aborted 
comeback attempts, he retired in 2013. Webb attended Paul G. Blazer High 
School in Ashland, Kentucky, and graduated in 1997. Webb attended the University 
of Kentucky, where he played for the Kentucky Wildcats baseball team. Webb 
was drafted by the Diamondbacks in the 8th round of the 2000 Major League 
Baseball draft. He made his first major league appearance with the Diamondbacks 
on April 22, 2003 against the Expos.[1] Webb wound up finishing the season 
with 28 starts and a 10–9 record. He was honored with Baseball America 
Rookie of the Year Award and placed third in the Major League Baseball 
Rookie of the Year Award voting in the National League. Webb was made the 
#2 starter after the team traded Curt Schilling in the offseason. He finished 
the 2004 season with a 7–16 record, leading the league in losses, walks 
and wild pitches in a league high 35 starts. Through 35 starts, he had 
an ERA of 3.59 for the D'Backs.(The Diamondbacks won only 51 games the 
whole year.) In 2005, he posted a 14–12 record and an ERA of 3.54. He led 
the team in ERA (3.54), innings pitched (229) and wild pitches (14). After 
the season, he signed a four-year contract extension worth a guaranteed 
$19.5 million and a team option for 2010.[2] Through his first 13 starts 
of the 2006 season, Webb had a perfect 8–0 record. Through that streak, 
he also had a 30 inning scoreless streak.[3] He suffered his first losing 
effort of the season on June 10, in a 5–0 loss to the New York Mets.[4] 
An early contender to win the National League Cy Young Award, Webb pitched 
in the 2006 MLB All-Star Game, recording one hitless inning. Webb struggled 
in the second half of the season in part due to elbow soreness. Webb did 
score a win in an emotional outing versus the San Diego Padres on August 
28, pitching seven effective innings. The win came a day after close friend 
and former UK teammate Jon Hooker and his new bride were among the victims 
of the doomed Comair Flight 5191 leaving Lexington.[5] Webb went on to 
finish the 2006 season with a record of 16–8 and an earned run average 
of 3.10, and was recognized with the NL Cy Young Award. His 16 wins tied 
five other pitchers for the most victories in the National League. Webb's 
win total marked the lowest for a starting pitcher who won the Cy Young 
in a full season.[6] His 3.10 ERA was the fourth best in the majors. As 
of the conclusion of his start on August 17, 2007, Webb had logged an Arizona 
Diamondbacks franchise record with 42.0 scoreless innings including three 
straight complete game shutouts.[7] This is the twelfth longest such streak 
in major league history, and the sixth longest since 1940, surpassed only 
by Orel Hershiser (59), Don Drysdale (58), Bob Gibson (47), Sal Maglie 
(45) and R.A. Dickey (44 2/3).[7] His three consecutive complete game shutouts 
during the streak was the longest streak since Roger Clemens accomplished 
the same with Toronto in 1998. This streak came to an end when the Milwaukee 
Brewers scored in the first inning of his start on August 22, 2007. Webb 
carried the D'backs rotation, leading the team as they nabbed the National 
League West crown. Webb finished with a record of 18-10 with a 3.01 ERA. 
Webb pitched the first game of the 2007 playoffs against the Chicago Cubs. 
Webb pitched 7 innings of 1 run ball, striking out 9 en route to a win.[8] 
The Diamondbacks went on to sweep the Cubs but fell to the Rockies in the 
NLCS, Webb falling in the first game. Webb allowed 4 runs in 6 innings, 
taking the loss.[9] The Diamondbacks were ultimately swept in the process, 
losing the series 0-4. On May 15, 2008, Webb won his ninth game in as many 
starts. Webb became the first pitcher in the Majors to win his first nine 
starts of the season since Andy Hawkins won ten in his first ten starts 
in 1985.[10] Near the end of June, Webb was leading the major leagues in 
wins. He was 13–4 with an ERA of 3.21 and a WHIP of 1.13. He won his 13th 
game against the Nationals, winning 2-0 before the All star break.[11] 
He made the All-Star team and threw a scoreless 14th inning with two strikeouts 
at Yankee Stadium. Up to mid August, Webb carried a 42 scoreless innings 
streak.[12] The streak ended against the Brewers on August 23 in the first 
inning. The crowd gave two standing ovations.[13] Webb finished the 2008 
season with a career high 22 wins and just 7 losses. Despite leading the 
National League in wins, Webb finished second in the National League Cy 
Young voting to division rival Tim Lincecum. His 3.15 ground ball/fly ball 
ratio was the highest in the major leagues.[14] In 2009 he was named #31 
on the Sporting News' list of the 50 greatest current players in baseball.[15] 
Webb pitched on opening day against the Colorado Rockies, but was limited 
to pitching just four innings. On April 7, 2009, he was placed on the disabled 
list with right shoulder bursitis. On August 3, 2009, Dr. Keith Meister 
of the Rangers performed surgery on his right shoulder, ending his 2009 
season. Despite the injury, the Diamondbacks picked up Webb's $8.5 million 
option for 2010 after the 2009 season ended. Arizona would have had to 
pay a $2 million buyout if it had declined the option.[16] He spent the 
year rehabbing his injury and did not appear in any games in 2010. Webb 
became a free agent at the conclusion of the season and on December 26, 
2010 agreed to a one-year contract with the Texas Rangers.[17] Webb made 
his first appearance in a game in more than two years on May 30, 2011, 
pitching for Double-A Frisco. Over 3 1/3 innings, he allowed five runs 
on eight hits, struck out two, walked two and hit a batter. On July 24, 
the Rangers announced Webb would undergo a second right rotator cuff surgery 
on August 1, 2011, that would sideline him until the start of the 2012 
season.[18] Webb officially retired from Major League Baseball on February 
4, 2013.[19][20] In May 2013, he filed a workers' compensation claim against 
the Texas Rangers for shoulder, neck, back, arm, and musculo-skeletal system 
injuries.[21] Webb was mainly known for his sinker. Along with Roy Halladay's 
and Chien-Ming Wang's, it had often been considered the best such pitch 
in baseball.[22] His sinker was thrown in the 87–91 mph range. He also 
threw a curveball (72–75) and changeup (77–80), and occasionally cutter 
against left-handed hitters.[23] Webb's sinker had been very effective 
at getting ground balls. Webb owned one of the best ground ball/fly ball 
ratio in baseball, prior to his retirement, at more than 3.5:1.[24] His 
changeup was also useful for getting swinging strikes — it had a 55% whiff 
rate in the 2008 season.[23] Brandon and his wife, Alicia, make their home 
in Ashland, Kentucky. He decided to stick close to home for college, attending 
the University of Kentucky in Lexington.[citation needed] In December 2007, 
the City of Ashland renamed a section of Highway 60 the "Brandon Webb Highway" 
in honor of Webb.[25] In 2005 Webb established Brandon Webb's K Foundation, 
a charity that aims to "improve the lives of critically and chronically 
ill children throughout Arizona by providing daily support and life changing
