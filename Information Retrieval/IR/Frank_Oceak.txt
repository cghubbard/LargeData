Frank John Oceak (September 8, 1912 – March 19, 1983) was an American infielder 
and manager in minor league baseball and a coach in Major League Baseball 
for 11 seasons between 1958 and 1972. A trusted confidant of four-time 
Pittsburgh Pirates manager Danny Murtaugh, Oceak was coaching at third 
base on October 13, 1960, during Game 7 of the 1960 World Series, when 
Pirate second baseman Bill Mazeroski hit his dramatic walk-off home run 
to clinch the Series against the New York Yankees. Oceak, wearing uniform 
#44, can be seen in many of the films and still photos of the historic 
event, celebrating with Mazeroski as he rounds third base and following 
him to home plate. Frank Oceak was born in Pocahontas, Virginia. He batted 
and threw right-handed, and stood 5 feet 9 inches (1.75 m) tall and weighed 
172 pounds (78 kg). Primarily a second baseman and shortstop, Oceak spent 
his entire playing career (1932–40; 1942–43; 1946–47) in the lower minor 
leagues, briefly as a member of the Yankees' farm system. He became a player-manager 
at age 25 in 1938 with the Lafayette White Sox of the Class D Evangeline 
League—which was, despite its nickname, an affiliate of the St. Louis Browns. 
Two years later, as manager of the Beaver Falls Browns of the Class D Pennsylvania 
State Association, Oceak was suspended by Commissioner of Baseball Kenesaw 
Mountain Landis for the entire 1941 season for an assault on an umpire.[1] 
However, Oceak resumed his playing and managing careers in 1942 with the 
Oil City Oilers of the PSA, his first assignment in the Pirates' organization, 
where he would spend most of the rest of his baseball life. The bulk of 
his managing career, as in his playing days, took place in the lower minors, 
until 1957 when he was named skipper of the Columbus Jets of the Triple-A 
International League, one of the Pirates' two top-tier farm clubs. The 
following season, he was named to Murtaugh's coaching staff, serving for 
seven seasons as the Bucs' third base coach before Murtaugh resigned because 
of ill health at the close of the 1964 campaign. Oceak then spent one season, 
1965, with the Cincinnati Reds as a coach under Dick Sisler before returning 
to Pittsburgh as a minor league manager at the Class A and Double-A levels 
in 1966–69. In 1970, Murtaugh returned to the dugout as manager of the 
Pirates, and Oceak rejoined him as third-base coach. He served through 
another world championship with the 1971 Pirates. When Murtaugh retired 
in the days after the 1971 World Series, Oceak stayed on for one more season 
as a coach under Bill Virdon before leaving baseball. He died in Johnstown, 
Pennsylvania, at the age of 70. His career record as a minor league manager
