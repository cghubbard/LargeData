in the Caribbean  (light yellow) Curaçao (/ˈkʊrəsaʊ/ KUR-ə-sow or /ˈkjʊərəsaʊ/ 
KEWR-ə-sow; Dutch: Curaçao, pronounced [kyːraːˈsʌu̯];[8] Papiamentu: Kòrsou) 
is an island country in the southern Caribbean Sea, approximately 65 kilometres 
(40 miles) north of the Venezuelan coast, that is a constituent country 
(Dutch: land) of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. Formally called the Country 
of Curaçao, (Dutch: Land Curaçao;[9] Papiamento: Pais Kòrsou),[10] it includes 
the main island and the uninhabited island of Klein Curaçao ("Little Curaçao"). 
It has a population of over 150,000 on an area of 444 square kilometres 
(171 square miles) and its capital is Willemstad. Willemstad is made up 
of 4 quarters; the oldest, Punda, gets its name from "punta" owing to this 
area's pointed shape. East of Punda on the coast is the former Dutch quarter 
of Pietermaai, this area has undergone extensive transformations since 
2010, with many of the homes restored and renovated. Inland and to the 
east of Punda is Scharloo, the former Jewish quarter characterised by its 
large villas. In the early 19th century, after the wall around Punda was 
replaced with housing, it was clear that the east side of the Schottegat 
(Sta. Annabaai) was crowded; consequently Willemstad spread to the west 
side of the Anna Bay. This last quarter of the capital was called Otrobanda 
or "Other Side" in Papiamentu. Before the dissolution of the Netherlands 
Antilles on 10 October 2010, Curaçao was administered as the "Island Territory 
of Curaçao"[11] (Dutch: Eilandgebied Curaçao, Papiamentu: Teritorio Insular 
di Kòrsou), one of five island territories of the former Netherlands Antilles. 
In the 16th and 17th centuries, sailors on long voyages would get scurvy 
from lack of vitamin C. According to some accounts, Portuguese sailors 
who were ill were left at the island now known as Curaçao. When their ship 
returned, they had recovered, likely cured from scurvy, probably after 
eating fruit with vitamin C. From then on the Portuguese referred to this 
as Ilha da Curação (Island of Healing). "Another explanation is that it 
is derived from the Portuguese word for heart (coração), referring to the 
island as a centre in trade." Unstressed o in Continental Portuguese are 
usually pronounced [u], so the Portuguese word for heart, coração, is actually 
pronounced [kurɐsãw]. Spanish traders took the name over as Curaçao, which 
was followed by the Dutch.[12] Another explanation is that Curaçao was 
the name by which the indigenous peoples of the island identified themselves, 
their autonym. (Joubert and Van Buurt, 1994). Early Spanish accounts support 
this theory, as they refer to the indigenous peoples as Indios Curaçaos, 
or "healing Indians."[12] From 1525 the island was featured on Spanish 
maps as Curaçote, Curasaote, and Curasaore. By the 17th century it appeared 
on most maps in Portuguese as Curaçao or Curazao.[12] On a map created 
by Hieronymus Cock in 1562 in Antwerp, the island was referred to as Qúracao.[13] 
The original inhabitants of Curaçao were Arawak peoples. Their ancestors 
had migrated to the island from the mainland of South America, likely hundreds 
of years before Europeans arrived. They were believed to have migrated 
from the Amazon Basin. The first Europeans recorded as seeing the island 
were members of a Spanish expedition under the leadership of Alonso de 
Ojeda in 1499. The Spaniards enslaved most of the Arawak as their labour 
force. They sometimes forcibly relocated the survivors to other colonies 
where workers were needed. In 1634, after the Netherlands achieved independence 
from Spain, Dutch colonists started to occupy the island. European powers 
were trying to establish bases in the Caribbean. The Dutch West India Company 
founded the capital of Willemstad on the banks of an inlet called the 'Schottegat.' 
Curaçao had been ignored by colonists, because it lacked gold deposits. 
The natural harbour of Willemstad proved to be an ideal spot for trade. 
Commerce and shipping — and piracy— became Curaçao's most important economic 
activities. In addition, in 1662 the Dutch West India Company made Curaçao 
a centre for the Atlantic slave trade, often bringing slaves here for sale 
elsewhere in the Caribbean and on the mainland of South America. Sephardic 
Jews with ancestors from the Iberian Peninsula settled here with the Dutch 
and in then-Dutch Brazil; they have had a significant influence on the 
culture and economy of the island.[14] Some Jewish merchants were part 
of the Dutch colonial slave trade, as were a wide variety of people involved 
in trade and shipping.[15] In the Franco-Dutch War, Count Jean II d'Estrées 
planned to attack Curaçao. His fleet — 12 men of war, three fireships, 
two transports, a hospital ship, and 12 privateers — met with disaster, 
losing seven men-of-war and two other ships when they struck reefs off 
the Las Aves archipelago. They had made a serious navigational error, hitting 
the reefs on 11 May 1678, a week after setting sail from Saint Kitts. Curaçao 
marked the events by a day of thanksgiving, celebrated for decades into 
the 18th century, to commemorate the island's escape from being invaded 
by the French. Although a few plantations were established on the island 
by the Dutch, the first profitable industry established on Curaçao was 
salt mining. The mineral was a lucrative export at the time and was a major 
factor for the island being part of international commerce. Many Dutch 
colonists grew affluent from the slave trade, and the city built impressive 
colonial buildings. Curaçao architecture blends Dutch and Spanish colonial 
styles. The wide range of historic buildings in and around Willemstad has 
resulted in the capital being designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. 
Landhouses (former plantation estates) and West African style kas di pal'i 
maishi (former slave dwellings) are scattered all over the island. Some 
have been restored and can be visited. In 1795, a major slave revolt took 
place under the leaders Tula Rigaud, Louis Mercier, Bastian Karpata, and 
Pedro Wakao. Up to 4000 slaves on the northwest section of the island revolted. 
More than one thousand slaves took part in extended gunfights. After a 
month, the slave owners suppressed the revolt.[16] Curaçao's proximity 
to South America resulted in interaction with cultures of the coastal areas. 
For instance, architectural similarities can be seen between the 19th-century 
parts of Willemstad and the nearby Venezuelan city of Coro in Falcón State. 
The latter has also been designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site. In the 
19th century, Curaçaoans such as Manuel Piar and Luis Brión were prominently 
engaged in the wars of independence of Venezuela and Colombia. Political 
refugees from the mainland (such as Simon Bolivar) regrouped in Curaçao. 
Children from affluent Venezuelan families were educated on the island. 
During the 18th and 19th centuries, the island changed hands among the 
British, the French, and the Dutch several times. In the early 19th century, 
Portuguese and Lebanese migrated to Curaçao, attracted by the business 
opportunities. Stable Dutch rule returned in 1815 at the end of the Napoleonic 
wars, when the island was incorporated into the colony of Curaçao and Dependencies. 
The Dutch abolished slavery in 1863, bringing a change in the economy with 
the shift to wage labour. Some inhabitants of Curaçao emigrated to other 
islands, such as Cuba, to work in sugar cane plantations. Other former 
slaves had nowhere to go and remained working for the plantation owner 
in the tenant farmer system.[17] This was an instituted order in which 
the former slave leased land from his former master. In exchange the tenant 
promised to give up for rent most of his harvest to the former slave master. 
This system lasted until the beginning of the 20th century. Historically, 
Dutch was not widely spoken on the island outside of colonial administration; 
its use increased in the late 19th and early 20th century.[18] Students 
on Curaçao, Aruba, and Bonaire were taught predominantly in Spanish until 
the late 19th century. There were also efforts to introduce bilingual popular 
education in Dutch and Papiamentu in the late 19th century (van Putte 1999). 
When in 1914, oil was discovered in the Maracaibo Basin town of Mene Grande, 
the fortunes of the island were dramatically altered. In 1915, the Royal 
Dutch Shell (Shell) and the Dutch government decided to establish an extensive 
oil refinery installation on the former site of the slave-trade market 
at Asiento. The oil company suddenly had many jobs for the local population; 
it attracted a wave of immigration from surrounding nations.[citation needed]The 
installation became operational three years later. There were a number 
of geographic and political advantages to establishing a refinery on an 
island off the Venezuelan coast: the predicted market growth in the US, 
the politically troubled Mexican oil production, and the expected increase 
of traffic through the Panama Canal. A natural deepwater harbour and a 
stable political climate made Curaçao the obvious choice. Shell has been 
the largest employer on the island since 1918. Of the 44,344 inhabitants 
in 1929, 10,924 worked for the oil industry. This number peaked in 1952, 
with 12,631 employees.[citation needed] The refinery was an important source 
of fuel for allied forces in World War II. Economically, the refinery has 
been the mainstay of Curaçao since 1915: it generates currency necessary 
for vital imports and is crucial to the future economic development of 
the island. The refinery’s success is also its weak point. If this sector 
is threatened, the consequences for Curaçao would be immediate and significant.[citation 
needed] In the early years, both Shell and Exxon held drilling concessions 
in Venezuela, which ensured a constant supply of crude oil to the refineries 
in Aruba and Curaçao. Crude oil production in Venezuela was inexpensive. 
The integrated companies Shell and Exxon controlled the entire industry 
from pumping, transporting and refining to marketing the end product. The 
refineries on Aruba and Curaçao operated in global markets and were profitable 
partly because of the margin between the production costs of crude oil 
and the revenues realized on products. This provided a safety net for losses 
incurred through inefficiency or excessive operating costs at the refineries. 
The nationalization of the oil industry in Venezuela in 1975 was a setback. 
The companies had to buy oil on the international markets at higher prices. 
As the Shell refinery on Curaçao was best equipped to process the Venezuelan 
heavy crude, the company was subject to Venezuelan oil politics when it 
came to price and supply. Coupled with high operating costs, these difficulties 
were the reasons the refinery on Curaçao continually operated at a loss.[citation 
needed] Curaçao experienced an economic downturn in the early 1980s. Shell's 
refinery on Curaçao operated with significant losses from 1975 to 1979, 
and again from 1982 to 1985. Persistent losses, global over-production, 
tougher competition, and low market expectations threatened the future 
of the Shell refinery in Curaçao. In 1985, after a presence of 70 years, 
Royal Dutch Shell decided to end its activities on Curaçao. Shell's announcement 
came at a crucial moment; the fragile economy of Curaçao had been stagnating 
for some time. Several revenue-generating endeavours suffered even more 
during this period: tourism from Venezuela collapsed after the devaluation 
of the bolivar, the transport industry deteriorated with deleterious effects 
on the profits of the Antillean Airline Company, and the Curaçao Dry Dock 
Company experienced major setbacks. The offshore industry (financial services) 
also experienced a downturn because of new tax laws in the US. Significant 
intervention in the public sector was required to reduce budget deficits. 
The future did not look promising: a macro-economic study predicted economic 
stagnation for several years even if Shell stayed and other industries 
gained growth. It was more likely that the gross domestic product (GDP) 
would shrink by 20 percent, unemployment would rise to 35 percent, and 
emigration would increase. It was clear that closure had to be avoided 
because the consequences could be disastrous.[citation needed] Curaçao 
was an ideal site for the refinery, as it was away from the social and 
civil unrest of the South American mainland, but near enough to the Maracaibo 
Basin oil fields. It had an excellent natural harbour that could accommodate 
large oil tankers.[citation needed] East and South Asian immigrants arrived 
during the economic boom of the early 20th century. Shell brought affluence 
to the island. Large-scale housing was provided and Willemstad developed 
an extensive infrastructure. However, inequality among the social groups 
of Curaçao led to discontent and antagonisms between Curaçao social groups, 
culminating in rioting and protest on 30 May 1969. The civil unrest launched 
a social movement that resulted in the local Afro-Caribbean population 
gaining more influence in politics in accordance with their numbers. (Anderson 
and Dynes 1975).[citation needed] In the early 20th century, the government 
made Dutch the sole language of instruction in the educational system to 
facilitate schooling for the children of expatriate employees of Royal 
Dutch Shell (Romer, 1999). Papiamentu, the local Creole language, was tentatively 
reintroduced in the school curriculum during the mid-1980s.[citation needed] 
Curaçao gained self-government on 1 January 1954, as an island territory 
of the Netherlands Antilles. The islanders did not fully participate in 
the political process until after the social movements of the late 1960s.[citation 
needed] The island has developed a tourist industry. It offered low corporate 
taxes to encourage companies to set up holdings in order to avoid higher 
taxes elsewhere. It has emphasized its diverse heritage to expand its tourism 
industry. Since the late 20th century, immigrants have come from neighbouring 
countries, such as Venezuela, but also from the Dominican Republic, Haiti, 
and the Anglophone Caribbean and Colombia. In the early 21st century, a 
number of Dutch pensioners (pensionados) have settled on the island for 
its mild climate.[citation needed] In the mid-1980s, Shell sold the refinery 
for the symbolic amount of one Antillean guilder to a local government 
consortium. The aging refinery has been the subject of lawsuits in recent 
years, which charge that its emissions, including sulfur dioxide and particulate 
matter, far exceed safety standards.[19] The government consortium currently 
leases the refinery to the Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA. On 2 July 
1984, the 30th anniversary of the first elected Island Council, the council 
inaugurated the national flag and the official anthem. In the 2000s, the 
political relationship with the other islands of the Netherlands Antilles, 
and with the Netherlands, came under discussion again. In a referendum 
held on 8 April 2005, the residents voted for separate status outside the 
Netherlands Antilles, similar to Aruba. They rejected the options for full 
independence, becoming part of the Netherlands, or retaining the status 
quo.[citation needed] Due to an economic slump in the late 1990s and early 
2000s, emigration to the Netherlands has been high.[20] On 1 July 2007, 
the island of Curaçao was due to become a country within the Kingdom of 
the Netherlands. On 28 November 2006, this was delayed when the island 
council rejected a clarification memorandum on the process. A new island 
council ratified this agreement on 9 July 2007.[21] On 15 December 2008, 
Curaçao was scheduled to become a separate country within the Kingdom of 
the Netherlands (as Aruba and the Netherlands Antilles were). A non-binding 
referendum on this plan took place in Curaçao on 15 May 2009, in which 
52 percent of the voters supported these plans.[22] The dissolution of 
the Netherlands Antilles came into effect on 10 October 2010.[23] Curaçao 
became a country within the Kingdom of the Netherlands, with the Kingdom 
retaining responsibility for defence and foreign policy. The kingdom was 
also to oversee the island's finances under a debt-relief arrangement agreed 
between the two.[24] Curaçao's first prime minister was Gerrit Schotte. 
He was succeeded in 2012 by Stanley Betrian, ad interim. After elections 
in 2012 Daniel Hodge became the third prime minister, on 31 December 2012.[25] 
He led a demissionary cabinet until 7 June 2013, when a new cabinet under 
the leadership of Ivar Asjes was sworn in.[26] The prime minister since 
31 August 2015 is Ben Whiteman. Political debate has centered on the issue 
of Papiamentu becoming the sole language of instruction. Proponents argue 
that it will help preserve the language and will improve the quality of 
primary and secondary school education. Proponents of Dutch-language instruction 
argue that students who study in Dutch will be better prepared for the 
university education offered to Curaçao residents in the Netherlands.[citation 
needed] When the Dutch arrived in 1634, they built forts at key points 
around the island to protect themselves from foreign powers, privateers, 
and pirates. Six of the best preserved forts can still be seen today: In 
1957, the Hotel Van der Valk Plaza Curaçao was built on top of the Waterfort.[29] 
The Riffort contains restaurants, and shops. It is located on the opposite 
side of the Waterfort across the entrance to the harbour. In 2009, the 
Renaissance Curaçao Resort and Casino opened next to the Riffort.[30][31] 
Curaçao, as well as the rest of the ABC islands and also Trinidad and Tobago, 
lies on the continental shelf of South America, and is thus geologically 
considered to lie entirely in South America.[citation needed] Curaçao's 
highest point is the Sint Christoffelberg 375 m (1,230 ft).[citation needed] 
The coastlines bays, inlets and hot springs offer an on-site source of 
natural mineral, thermal or seawater used in hydrotherapy and mesotherapy, 
making this island one of many balneoclimateric areas in the region. The 
flora of Curaçao differs from the typical tropical island vegetation. Xeric 
scrublands are common, with various forms of cacti, thorny shrubs, evergreen, 
and the watapana tree, called divi-divi on Aruba, characteristic for the 
ABC islands and the national symbol of Aruba. Curaçao has a tropical savannah 
climate (Köppen climate classification As) with a dry season from January 
to September and a wet season from October to December.[32] The temperatures 
are relatively constant with small differences throughout the year. The 
trade winds bring cooling during the day and the same trade winds bring 
warming during the night. The coolest month is January with an average 
temperature of 26.5 °C (80 °F) and the warmest month is September with 
an average temperature of 28.9 °C (84 °F). The year's average maximum temperature 
is 31.2 °C (88 °F). The year's average minimum temperature is 25.3 °C (78 °F). 
Curaçao lies outside the hurricane belt, but is still occasionally affected 
by hurricanes, as for example Hazel in 1954, Anna in 1961 Felix in 2007 
and Omar in 2008. A landfall of a hurricane in Curaçao has not occurred 
since the United States National Hurricane Center started tracking hurricanes. 
Curaçao has, however, been directly affected by pre-hurricane tropical 
storms several times; the latest which did so were Tomas in 2010, Cesar 
in 1996, Joan-Miriam in 1988, Cora and Greta in 1978, Edith and Irene in 
1971 and Francelia in 1969. Tomas brushed Curaçao as a tropical storm, 
dropping as much as 265 mm (10.4 in) of precipitation on the territory, 
nearly half of the annual precipitation in one day.[33] This made Tomas 
one of the wettest events in the island's history,[34] as well as one of 
the most devastating; its flooding killed two people and caused over NAƒ60 million 
(US$28 million) in damage.[35][36] The northern sea floor drops steeply 
within 60 m (200 ft) of the shore. This drop-off is known as the "blue 
edge". On Curaçao, four major geological formations can be found: The lava 
formation, the Knip formation, the Mid-Curaçao formation and Limestone 
formations.[37] The government of Curaçao takes place in a framework of 
a parliamentary representative democratic country. The Prime Minister is 
the head of government. Executive power is exercised by the government. 
Legislative power is vested in both the government and parliament. The 
judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature. Convicted 
felons are held at the Curaçao Centre for Detention and Correction prison.[citation 
needed] Curaçao has full autonomy on most matters, with the exceptions 
summed up in the Charter for the Kingdom of the Netherlands under the title 
"Kingdom affairs".[citation needed] Two Dutch naval bases, Parera and Suffisant, 
are located on the island of Curaçao. Officers of the Arubaanse Militie 
complete further training on Curaçao. Suffisant Naval Base has facilities 
for conscription in the Caribbean, which has not been military conscription 
since 1997, but social conscription. This type of conscription offers underprivileged 
Antillean young people the chance of taking professional training.[38] 
Curaçao has an open economy, with tourism, international trade, shipping 
services, refining, storage (oil and bunkering) and international financial 
services being the most important sectors. Curaçao's economy is well developed 
and supports a high standard of living, ranking 46th in the world in terms 
of GDP (PPP) per capita and 27th in the world in terms of nominal GDP per 
capita. Curaçao possesses a high income economy, as defined by the World 
Bank. Activities related to the port of Willemstad (like the Free Trade 
Zone) make a significant contribution to the economy. To achieve the government's 
aim to make its economy more diverse, efforts are being made to attract 
more foreign investment. This policy, called the 'Open Arms' policy, features 
a heavy focus on information technology companies.[39][40][41] While tourism 
plays a major role in Curaçao's economy, it is less reliant on tourism 
than other Caribbean countries. Most tourists originate from the Netherlands, 
Eastern United States, South America and other Caribbean Islands . It currently 
leads the Caribbean in cruise tourism growth with 610,186 cruise passengers 
in 2013, a 41.4% increase over the prior year.[42] Hato International Airport 
received 1,772,501 passengers in 2013 and recently announced capital investments 
totaling US$48 million aimed at transforming the airport into a regional 
hub by 2018. The island's insular shelf has a sharp drop-off known as the 
"Blue Edge."[citation needed] Scuba diving tourists often visit for this 
vista.[citation needed] Coral reefs for snorkeling and scuba diving can 
be reached without a boat. The southern coast has calm waters as well as 
many small beaches, such as Jan Thiel and Cas Abou. The coastline of Curaçao 
features numerous bays and inlets which serve as popular mooring locations 
for boats.[43] Some of the coral reefs are affected by tourism. Porto Marie 
Beach is experimenting with artificial coral reefs in order to improve 
the reef's condition.[citation needed] Hundreds of artificial coral blocks 
that have been placed are now home to a large array of tropical fish. In 
2013, the unemployment rate was 13%.[44] Curaçao's history in financial 
services dates back to World War I. Prior to this period, the financial 
arms of local merchant houses functioned as informal lenders to the community. 
However, at the turn of the century, Curaçao underwent industrialization, 
and a number of merchant houses established private commercial banks.[45] 
As the economy grew, these banks began assuming additional functions eventually 
becoming full-fledged financial institutions. The Dutch Caribbean Securities 
Exchange is located in the capital of Willemstad, as is the Central Bank 
of Curaçao and Sint Maarten; the latter of which dates to 1828. It is the 
oldest central bank in the Western Hemisphere.[46] The island's legal system 
supports a variety of corporate structures and is a corporate haven. Though 
Curaçao is considered a tax haven, it adheres to the EU Code of Conduct 
against harmful tax practices. It holds a qualified intermediary status 
from the United States Internal Revenue Service. It is an accepted jurisdiction 
of the OECD and Caribbean Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering. 
The country enforces Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism funding 
compliance.[citation needed] Curaçao trades mainly with the United States, 
Venezuela, and the European Union. It has an Association Agreement with 
the European Union which allows companies which do business in and via 
Curaçao to export products to European markets,[47] free of import duties 
and quotas. It is also a participant in the US Caribbean Basin Initiative 
allowing it to have preferential access to the US market.[48] Prostitution 
in Curaçao is legal only for foreign women who get a temporary permit to 
work in the large open-air brothel called "Le Mirage" or "Campo Alegre" 
that has operated near the airport since the 1940s, and for the men (locals 
included) who make use of their services. Curaçao monitors, contains and 
regulates the industry. The government states that the workers in these 
establishments are thereby given a safe environment and access to medical 
practitioners. This approach does exclude local women (or men) to legally 
make a living from prostitution and does lead to loss of local income as 
the foreign prostitutes sent or take most of their earnings home.[49] The 
U.S. State Department has cited anecdotal evidence claiming that,"Curaçao...[is 
a] destination island... for women trafficked for the sex trade from Peru, 
Brazil, Colombia, the Dominican Republic, and Haiti, according to local 
observers. At least 500 foreign women reportedly are in prostitution throughout 
the five islands of the Antilles, some of whom have been trafficked."[50] 
The US Department of State has said that the government of Curaçao frequently 
underestimates the extent of human trafficking problems.[50] Births and 
deaths[51] Structure of the population[52] Structure of the population 
(01.07.2013) (Estimates) : Curaçao is a polyglot society. The official 
languages are Dutch, Papiamentu, and English.[1] However, Dutch is the 
sole language for all administration and legal matters.[53] Most of Curaçao's 
population is able to converse in at least two of the languages of Papiamentu, 
Dutch, English, and Spanish. The most widely spoken language is Papiamentu, 
a Portuguese creole spoken in all levels of society. Papiamentu was introduced 
as a language of primary school education in 1993, making Curaçao one of 
a handful of places where a creole language is used as a medium to acquire 
basic literacy.[54] Spanish and English also have a long historical presence 
in Curaçao. Spanish became an important language in the 18th century due 
to the close economic ties with Spanish colonies in what are now Venezuela 
and Colombia.[18] Use of English dates to the early 19th century, when 
the British took Curaçao and Bonaire. When Dutch rule resumed in 1815, 
officials already noted wide use of the language.[18] According to the 
2001 census, Papiamentu is the first language of 81.2% of the population. 
Dutch is the first language of 8% of the population. Spanish is the first 
language of 4% of the population, and English is the first language of 
2.9%.[55] However, these numbers divide the population in terms of first 
language and do not account for the high rate of bilingualism in the population 
of Curaçao. Because of its history, the island's population comes from 
a number of ethnic backgrounds. There is an Afro-Caribbean majority of 
African descent, and also sizeable minorities of Dutch, Latin American, 
French, South Asian, East Asian, Portuguese and Levantine people. Additionally, 
there are both Sephardic and Ashkenazi Jews. According to a 2011 estimate, 
the majority of the inhabitants of Curaçao:[56] This includes a shift towards 
the charismatic renewal or charismatic movement since the mid-1970s. Other 
denominations include the Seventh-day Adventist Church and the Methodist 
Church. Alongside these Christian denominations, some inhabitants practice 
Montamentu and other diaspora African religions.[citation needed] Like 
elsewhere in Latin America, Pentecostalism is on the rise. There are also 
practising Muslims and Hindus. The Catholic diocese of Willemstad encompasses 
all the territory of the Kingdom of the Netherlands in the Caribbean which 
includes Aruba, Curaçao, Sint Maarten, and the islands of Bonaire, St. 
Eustatius and Saba. The diocese is also a member of the Antilles Episcopal 
Conference. While small, Curaçao's Jewish community has had a significant 
impact on the island's history.[14] Curaçao has the oldest active Jewish 
congregation in the Americas, dating to 1651. The Curaçao synagogue is 
the oldest synagogue of the Americas in continuous use, since its completion 
in 1732 on the site of a previous synagogue. Public education is based 
on the Dutch educational system and besides the public schools, private 
and parochial schools are also available. Since the introduction of a new 
public education law in 1992, compulsory primary education starts at age 
six and continues six years, secondary lasts for another five.[57] The 
main institute of higher learning is the University of Curaçao, enrolling 
2,100 students.[57] The comprehensive model of education is under influences 
from both Dutch and American's education offering. Other higher education 
offering on the island include offshore medical schools, language schools 
and academies for fine art, music, police, teacher and nurse-training.[58] 
Despite the island's relatively small population, the diversity of languages 
and cultural influences on Curaçao have generated a remarkable literary 
tradition, primarily in Dutch and Papiamentu. The oral traditions of the 
Arawak indigenous peoples are lost. West African slaves brought the tales 
of Anansi, thus forming the basis of Papiamentu literature. The first published 
work in Papiamentu was a poem by Joseph Sickman Corsen entitled Atardi, 
published in the La Cruz newspaper in 1905. Throughout Curaçaoan literature, 
narrative techniques and metaphors best characterized as magic realism 
tend to predominate. Novelists and poets from Curaçao have made an impressive 
contribution to Caribbean and Dutch literature. Best known are Cola Debrot, 
Frank Martinus Arion, Pierre Lauffer, Elis Juliana,Guillermo Rosario, Boeli 
van Leeuwen and Tip Marugg. Local food is called Krioyo (pronounced the 
same as criollo, the Spanish word for "Creole") and boasts a blend of flavours 
and techniques best compared to Caribbean cuisine and Latin American cuisine. 
Dishes common in Curaçao are found in Aruba and Bonaire as well. Popular 
dishes include: stobá (a stew made with various ingredients such as papaya, 
beef or goat), Guiambo (soup made from okra and seafood), kadushi (cactus 
soup), sopi mondongo (intestine soup), funchi (cornmeal paste similar to 
fufu, ugali and polenta) and a lot of fish and other seafood. The ubiquitous 
side dish is fried plantain. Local bread rolls are made according to a 
Portuguese recipe. All around the island, there are snèks which serve local 
dishes as well as alcoholic drinks in a manner akin to the English public 
house. The ubiquitous breakfast dish is pastechi: fried pastry with fillings 
of cheese, tuna, ham, or ground meat. Around the holiday season special 
dishes are consumed, such as the hallaca and pekelé, made out of salt cod. 
At weddings and other special occasions a variety of kos dushi are served: 
kokada (coconut sweets), ko'i lechi (condensed milk and sugar sweet) and 
tentalaria (peanut sweets). The Curaçao liqueur was developed here, when 
a local experimented with the rinds of the local citrus fruit known as 
laraha. Surinamese, Chinese, Indonesian, Indian and Dutch culinary influences 
also abound. The island also has a number of Chinese restaurants that serve 
mainly Indonesian dishes such as satay, nasi goreng and lumpia (which are 
all Indonesian names for the dishes). Dutch specialties such as croquettes 
and oliebollen are widely served in homes and restaurants. In 2004, the 
Little League Baseball team from Willemstad, Curaçao, won the world title 
in a game against the United States champion from Thousand Oaks, California. 
The Willemstad lineup included Jurickson Profar, the standout shortstop 
prospect who now plays for the Texas Rangers of Major League Baseball. 
In the 2006 World Baseball Classic, Curaçaoans played for the Netherlands 
team. Shairon Martis, born in Willemstad, contributed to the Dutch team 
by throwing a seven-inning no-hitter against Panama (the game was stopped 
due to the mercy rule). The 2010 documentary film, Boys of Summer,[59] 
details Curaçao's Pabao Little League All-Stars winning their country's 
eighth straight championship at the 2008 Little League World Series, then 
going on to defeat other teams, including Puerto Rico and the Dominican 
Republic, and earning a spot in Williamsport. The prevailing trade winds 
and warm water make Curaçao a location for windsurfing.[60][61] One factor 
is that the deep water around Curaçao makes it difficult to lay marks for 
major windsurfing events, thus hindering the island's success as a windsurfing 
destination. There is warm, clear water around the island. Scuba divers 
and snorkelers may have visibility up to 30 metres (98 feet) at the Curaçao 
Underwater Marine Park, which stretches along 20 kilometres (12 miles) 
of Curaçao's southern coastline.[62] Curaçao participated in the 2013 CARIFTA 
Games. Kevin Philbert stood third in the under-20 male Long Jump with a 
distance of 7.36 metres (24.1 ft). Vanessa Philbert stood second the under-17 
female 1,500 metres (4,900 feet) with a time of 4:47.97.[63][64][65][66] 
Hato International Airport is located on the island. Its main runway parallels, 
and is adjacent to, the northern coast. The Queen Emma Bridge, a 168 metres 
(551 ft) long pontoon bridge, connects pedestrians between the Punda and 
Otrobanda districts.[67] This swings open to allow the passage of ships 
to and from the port.[68] The bridge was originally opened in 1888 and 
the current bridge was installed in 1939.[69] It is best known and, more 
often than not, referred to by the locals as "Our Swinging Old Lady".[70] 
The Queen Juliana Bridge connects mobile traffic between the same two districts. 
At 185 feet (56 m) above the sea, it is one of the highest bridges in the 
Caribbean.[68] A private company, and full member of CARILEC, Aqualectra, 
delivers potable water and electricity to the island. Rates are controlled 
by the government. Water is produced by reverse osmosis or desalinization.[71] 
It services 69,000 households and companies using 130,000 water and electric 
meters.[71] People from Curaçao include: Players in Major League Baseball:
