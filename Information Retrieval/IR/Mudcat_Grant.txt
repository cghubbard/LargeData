Montreal Expos (1969), St. Louis Cardinals (1969), Oakland Athletics (1970 
and 1971) and Pittsburgh Pirates (1970–71). He was named to the 1963[1] 
and 1965 American League All-Star Teams. In 1965, he was the first black 
pitcher to win 20 games in a season in the American League and the first 
black pitcher to win a World Series game for the American League. He pitched 
two complete game World Series victories in 1965, hitting a three-run home 
run in game 6, and was named The Sporting News American League Pitcher 
of the Year.[2] Grant signed with the Cleveland Indians in 1954 as an amateur 
free agent and made his big league debut with the Indians in 1958. His 
best season in Cleveland was in 1961 when he had a won-loss record of 15-9 
and a 3.86 earned run average. In June 1964, he was traded to the Minnesota 
Twins and had a record of 11-9 for the remainder of the season. In 1965 
Grant had the best year of his career. He was 21-7 for the Twins, helping 
to lead the team to the 1965 World Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers. 
In 1965, Grant hosted a local Minneapolis variety television program, The 
Jim Grant Show, where he sang and danced.[3] He finished 6th in voting 
for the 1965 American League MVP for leading the League in Wins, Won-Loss %

Allowed, 99 Earned Runs Allowed, 61 Walks, 142 Strikeouts, 8 Wild Pitches, 
1,095 Batters Faced, 2 Intentional Walks and a 3.30 ERA. Grant's home run 
in the 6th game of the 1965 World Series was only the second by an American 
League pitcher during a World Series game. 1966 was Grant's last year as 
a full-time starting pitcher. He spent his next five seasons in baseball 
as a reliever and occasional starter for five different big league clubs. 
He currently ranks 46th on the MLB Career Home Runs Allowed List (292). 
In 14 years, he had a 145-119 Win–Loss record, 571 Games, 293 Games Started,

Wild Pitches, 10,293 Batters Faced, 59 Intentional Walks, 3 Balks and a 
3.63 ERA. Grant's home run during Game 6 of the 1965 World Series was the 
only one he hit that season and one of only seven he hit in his entire 
career. After his playing career ended, Grant worked for the North American 
Softball League, one of three Men's Professional Softball Leagues active 
in the pro softball era. He later worked as a broadcaster and executive 
for the Indians, and also as a broadcaster for the Athletics. In recent 
years, Grant has dedicated himself to studying and promoting the history 
of blacks in baseball. On his official website, Grant pays tribute to the 
fifteen black pitchers (including himself) who have won 20 games in a season. 
The "15 Black Aces" are: Vida Blue, Al Downing, Bob Gibson, Dwight Gooden, 
Grant, Ferguson Jenkins, Sad Sam Jones, Don Newcombe, Mike Norris, David 
Price, J. R. Richard, C.C. Sabathia, Dave Stewart, Dontrelle Willis, and 
Earl Wilson. In 2006, Grant released his long-awaited book, The Black Aces, 
Baseball's Only black Twenty-Game Winners, featuring chapters on each of 
the black pitchers to have at least one twenty win season, and also featuring 
Negro League players that Mudcat felt would have been 20 game winners if 
they were allowed to play. The book was featured in the Hall of Fame during 
Induction Weekend 2006, and in February 2007 President Bush honored Mudcat 
and fellow Aces, Ferguson Jenkins, Dontrelle Willis and Mike Norris, and 
the publication of the book at a ceremony at the White House. On April 
14, 2008, he threw out the ceremonial opening pitch at Progressive Field 
to commemorate the 50th anniversary of his major league debut. Mudcat was
