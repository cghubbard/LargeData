Joseph Paul "Joe" Torre (/ˈtɔːri/; born July 18, 1940) is an American professional 
baseball executive, serving in the capacity of Major League Baseball's 
(MLB) chief baseball officer since 2011. A former player, manager and television 
color commentator, Torre ranks fifth all-time in MLB history with 2,326 
wins as a manager. With 2,342 hits during his playing career, Torre is 
the only major leaguer to achieve both 2,000 hits and 2,000 wins as a manager. 
From 1996 to 2007, he was the manager of the New York Yankees, whom he 
guided to four World Series championships. Torre's lengthy and distinguished 
career in MLB began as a player in 1960 with the Milwaukee Braves, as a 
catcher, first baseman and third baseman. He also played for the St. Louis 
Cardinals and New York Mets until becoming a manager in 1977, when he briefly 
served as the Mets' player-manager. His managerial career covered 29 seasons, 
including tenures with the same three clubs for which he played, and the 
Yankees and Los Angeles Dodgers, until 2010. From 1984 to 1989, he served 
as a television color commentator for the California Angels and NBC. After 
retiring as a manager, he accepted a role assisting the Commissioner of 
Baseball as the executive vice president of baseball operations. A nine-time 
All-Star, Torre won the 1971 National League (NL) Most Valuable Player 
(MVP) Award after leading the major leagues in batting average, hits, and 
runs batted in.[1] After qualifying for the playoffs just once while managing 
the Mets, Braves, and Cardinals, Torre's greatest success came as manager 
of the Yankees. His clubs compiled a .605 regular season winning percentage 
and made the playoffs every year, winning four World Series titles, six 
American League (AL) pennants, and ten AL East division titles. In 1996 
and 1998, he was the AL Manager of the Year. He also won two NL West division 
titles with the Dodgers for a total of 13 division titles. In 2014, Torre 
was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame. Joseph Torre was born 
July 18, 1940, in Brooklyn, New York, the youngest of five children, two 
girls and three boys to a New York City Police officer father and a mother, 
Margaret. He is of Italian descent. His siblings include two older brothers, 
Frank Torre, and Rocco, and an older sister, Marguerite.[2][3] Torre followed 
in his brother Frank Torre's footsteps when he was signed by the Milwaukee 
Braves as an amateur free agent in 1960.[1] In his first season in the 
minor leagues with the Class A Eau Claire Bears, he won the 1960 Northern 
League batting championship with a .344 batting average.[4][5] Torre made 
his major league debut late in the season on September 25, 1960.[1] He 
was assigned to the Triple A Louisville Colonels for the 1961 season where, 
the Braves had planned to groom him as the eventual successor to their 
All-Star catcher, Del Crandall.[6] However, those plans were changed when 
Crandall injured his throwing arm in May 1961, forcing the Braves to promote 
Torre to the major leagues with just over a year of minor league experience.[6] 
Torre rose to the occasion, hitting for a .278 batting average with 21 
doubles and 10 home runs.[1] He finished the season ranked second to Billy 
Williams in the 1961 National League Rookie of the Year voting.[7] Crandall 
resumed his role as the number one catcher in 1962 while Torre stayed on 
as the back-up catcher.[8] By the 1963 season, the Braves had begun to 
play Crandall at first base as Torre had taken over the starting catcher's 
role.[9][10] He ended the season with a .293 batting average with 14 home 
runs and 71 runs batted in and, earned a spot as a reserve for the National 
League team in the 1963 All-Star Game.[1][11] In December 1963, the Braves 
traded Crandall to the San Francisco Giants leaving Torre as the undisputed 
number one catcher.[12] Torre had a breakout year in 1964 when he hit 12 
home runs along with a .312 batting average by mid-season and was voted 
to be the starting catcher for the National League in the 1964 All-Star 
Game.[13][14] He ended the season with a .321 batting average, fourth highest 
in the league, along with 20 home runs and 109 runs batted in and led National 
League catchers with a .995 fielding percentage.[1][15][16] Despite the 
fact that the Braves finished the season in fifth place, Torre ranked fifth 
in voting for the 1964 National League Most Valuable Player Award.[17] 
In 1965, Torre won his first of two NL Player of the Month awards when 
he took the honour for May, batting .382, with 10 HR, and 24 RBI. Torre 
was once again voted to be the starting catcher for the National League 
in the 1965 All-Star Game and won his first and only Gold Glove Award.[18][19] 
He ended the season with 27 home runs and 80 runs batted in although his 
batting average dipped to .291.[1] In his book, The Bill James Historical 
Baseball Abstract, baseball historian Bill James said the decision to award 
Torre the 1965 Gold Glove was absurd, stating that he was given the award 
because of his offensive statistics and that, either John Roseboro or Tom 
Haller were more deserved of the award.[20] In an article for the St. Petersburg 
Independent that year, Beat Generation author Jack Kerouac called Torre 
"the best catcher since Roy Campanella."[21] The Braves relocated to Atlanta 
for the 1966 season and would play their games in the new Atlanta–Fulton 
County Stadium which, due to its less dense atmosphere in the high elevation 
in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains, made it favorable to home 
run hitters, resulting in the nickname The Launching Pad.[22] On April 
12, 1966, Torre hit the first major league home run in the history of the 
Atlanta stadium.[23] Torre would produce a career-high 36 home runs with 
101 runs batted in, a .315 batting average, a .382 on-base percentage and, 
led National League catchers with a 48.6% caught stealing percentage.[1] 
He was voted as the starting catcher for the National League All-Star team 
for the third successive year.[24] His offensive production tapered off 
in 1967 with a .277 batting average with 68 runs batted in although he 
still hit 20 home runs and won his fourth consecutive start in the 1967 
All-Star Game.[1][25] He posted another sub-par season in 1968 with a .271 
batting average, 10 home runs and 55 runs batted in however, he led National 
League catchers with a .996 fielding percentage.[1][26] Before the 1969 
season, Torre became embroiled in a feud with Braves General Manager Paul 
Richards over his salary.[27] Eventually, the Braves would trade Torre 
to the St. Louis Cardinals for the 1967 Most Valuable Player Award winner, 
Orlando Cepeda.[28] The Cardinals had Tim McCarver as their starting catcher 
so Torre replaced the departed Cepeda as their first baseman for the 1969 
season.[29] His offensive statistics rebounded and he ended the season 
with a .289 batting average with 18 home runs and 101 runs batted in.[1] 
In 1970, the Cardinals traded away McCarver along with Byron Browne, Curt 
Flood and Joe Hoerner to the Philadelphia Phillies for Dick Allen, Jerry 
Johnson and Cookie Rojas.[30] Allen took over as the Cardinals' first baseman 
while Torre split his playing time between playing third base and sharing 
catching duties with young prospect Ted Simmons.[31] His offensive statistics 
continued to improve; he hit 21 home runs with 100 runs batted in and finished 
second to Rico Carty in the National League batting championship with a 
.325 batting average.[1][32] The Cardinals made Simmons their full-time 
catcher in 1971, leaving Torre to concentrate on playing third base. Freed 
from the mentally challenging, strength-sapping job of catching, Torre 
had a career-season offensively.[33][34] He was hitting for a .359 batting 
average at mid-season and was voted to be the starting third baseman for 
the National League in the 1971 All-Star Game.[35][36] He was named NL 
Player of the Month for the second and final time in August (.373, 5 HR, 
27 RBI). Torre won the National League Batting Championship, hitting .363 
and led the league with 137 runs batted in, en route to winning the 1971 
National League Most Valuable Player award.[37][38] Adapting to a new defensive 
position proved to be a challenge as Torre led the league's third basemen 
with 21 errors.[39] In December, he was awarded the 1971 Hutch Award, given 
annually to the player who best exemplifies the fighting spirit and competitive 
desire of Fred Hutchinson.[40] In 1972, Torre won his second consecutive 
starting role as third baseman for the National League in the All-Star 
Game. However, his offensive numbers for the season dipped to a .289 batting 
average with 11 home runs and 81 runs batted in.[1] After two more sub-par 
seasons, the Cardinals traded the 34-year-old Torre to the New York Mets 
for Ray Sadecki with Tommy Moore.[41] With the Mets in 1975, Torre became 
the third player in major league history, and first in the National League, 
to hit into four double plays in one game.[42] Felix Millán singled in 
all four of his at-bats hitting ahead of Torre, and at a post-game press 
conference, Torre joked about his own performance by saying "I'd like to 
thank Félix Millán for making this possible." When Torre's batting average 
fell to .247 in 1975, it appeared his best years might be behind him. However, 
his average rebounded 59 points in 1976, and he finished the year with 
a .306 batting average.[43] In May 1977, the Mets fired manager Joe Frazier 
and named Torre as their player-manager.[44] Because he believed he could 
not do the job properly while still playing, he decided to retire at age 
37. He did serve 18 days as a player-manager (only having 2 at-bats), becoming 
the second of three players in the 1970s to take on both roles (Frank Robinson, 
in the two previous seasons with the Cleveland Indians, and Don Kessinger, 
in 1979 with the Chicago White Sox, were the others).[45] Torre managed 
the Mets from 1977 to 1981 season, but failed to improve the team's record. 
After five years without a winning season, he was fired at the end of the 
strike-shortened 1981 season.[46] In 1982, Torre replaced Bobby Cox as 
the manager of the Atlanta Braves, and immediately guided them to a Major 
League-record 13 straight wins to open the season. Atlanta subsequently 
went on to finish 89–73 and capture the National League West division title, 
its first playoff appearance since the 1969 National League Championship 
Series (NLCS). In Game 1 of the 1982 NLCS against the St. Louis Cardinals, 
the Braves jumped to a 1–0 lead before the game was rain delayed after 
four innings and eventually canceled just three outs short of an official 
game. St. Louis won the rematch and went on to sweep the series. Torre 
was named the Associated Press' (AP) Manager of the Year, becoming the 
first person to win both that and an MVP award.[47] The Braves slipped 
to second place in 1983, but with their 88–74 record, won just one fewer 
game than the previous season, and marked the first consecutive winning 
seasons for the organization since moving from Milwaukee in 1966. In 1984, 
Atlanta slipped to 80–82 the following season but, again finished runner-up 
in the division (tied with Houston Astros). He was fired after the 1984 
season. From 1985 to 1990, Torre worked as a television color commentator 
for the California Angels.[48] Torre also worked as a color commentator 
for NBC's Game of the Week[49] telecasts alongside Jay Randolph. While 
working as a guest analyst for ESPN during the 1989 World Series, Torre 
was on hand for the Loma Prieta earthquake (October 17, 1989). In 1990, 
Torre replaced the popular Whitey Herzog as Cardinals manager and posted 
a 351–354 record. Though the Cardinals were unable to reach the playoffs 
during Torre's tenure, they had winning records in each of the three full 
seasons he spent with the club (excluding the strike-shortened 1994). Despite 
a last place prediction from many commentators, the Cardinals finished 
in second place and won 84 games in 1991, Torre's first full season at 
the helm. His best record was 87–75 in 1993. Torre was fired in June 1995 
for his poor record that year as part of a rebuilding project while Anheuser-Busch 
prepared to sell the team. Torre served as the Yankees manager under owner 
George Steinbrenner, who was famous for frequently firing his team's managers. 
Torre lasted 12 full seasons, managing 1,942 regular season games, with 
a won-loss record of 1,173–767.[50] He took the team to the postseason 
every one of his twelve seasons with the club, winning six American League 
pennants and four World Series. By far the longest tenure for a Yankees 
manager in the Steinbrenner era, Torre's was the second-longest tenure 
in club history: only Joe McCarthy lasted longer.[51] Torre is the only 
Yankees manager who was born in New York City. Before his first game with 
the Yankees, Torre got off to a rough start. The New York City press (and 
fans) thought his hiring was a colossal mistake and greeted him with tabloid 
headlines such as "Clueless Joe."[52] Including his three previous jobs, 
he had been a combined 109 games below .500,[47] and had never won a playoff 
game in 14 seasons.[53] However, it was with the Yankees that he enjoyed 
the greatest success of his managerial career, leading them to the playoffs 
in each of his 12 seasons (1996–2007) with the club. He would eventually 
become a fan favorite. In 1996, he was named Manager of the Year. Torre, 
building on the Yankees' Wild Card berth in 1995, made his first-ever trip 
to the "Fall Classic", leading the Yankees to their first World Series 
since 1981. After the Yankees defeated the Atlanta Braves, Steinbrenner 
tore up Torre's contract and gave him a new, more lucrative and longer 
contract as a reward. After losing to the Cleveland Indians in the AL playoffs 
in 1997, the team won three straight World Series titles from 1998 to 2000, 
and additional American League pennants in 2001 and 2003. The 1998 season 
was Torre's most successful. Despite a slow start that included losing 
four of the first five games of the season, the Yankees set a then-American 
League record of 114 regular season wins, including David Wells' perfect 
game against the Minnesota Twins on May 17.[54] It was in an August 11 
victory over the Twins that Torre evened his career record win–loss record, 
making it 1168–1168. One other manager in Yankees' history, Casey Stengel, 
had joined the team with a career record further below .500 than Torre, 
at 166 games, and eventually reached .500 as Yankees manager.[47] During 
the 1998 playoffs, the Yankees easily bested the Texas Rangers, fought 
off the Cleveland Indians for the AL pennant, and swept the San Diego Padres 
in the World Series. His club set a major-league record of 125 total wins 
a season, including regular and postseason, breaking the 1906 Chicago Cubs' 
record of 118.[47] Torre won Manager of the Year honors, and the 1998 team 
is now widely regarded as "one of the best squads of all time,"[55] along 
with the Yankee teams of 1927, 1939 and 1961, the 1972–1974 Oakland Athletics, 
and the 1975–1976 Cincinnati Reds. When ESPN launched its Who's#1? series 
on June 15, 2004, the 1998 Yankees topped the network's list of best teams 
over the years 1979 to 2003. Presiding over his clubs' second perfect game 
in 1999, on this occasion, behind starter David Cone, the Yankees defeated 
the Montreal Expos 6–0.[56] The event occurred on July 18, also Torre's 
59th birthday. He became the first to manage his teams to two perfect game 
wins, while becoming just the fourth in MLB history to manage his club 
in two perfect games, joining Stengel (1–1), Walter Alston (1–1), and Tommy 
Lasorda (0–2).[47] The Yankees also won their second consecutive World 
Series. With a win over Minnesota on May 12, 2002, Torre became the 17th 
manager in Major League history to reach the milestone of 1,500 victories.[47] 
In 2004, Torre suffered his greatest setback, marking the end of the Yankees' 
dominance. After building a 3–0 lead in the ALCS against the Boston Red 
Sox, his team would go on to suffer one of the worst collapses in baseball 
history and lose the next four games and the ALCS. The Red Sox would go 
on to win the 2004 World Series, their first title since 1918, ending the 
"Curse of the Bambino", which was supposedly was inflicted on the team 
when Babe Ruth was sold to the Yankees in 1919.[57] Off to an 8−11 start 
in 2005, the Yankees played their last five months at 84−48. Still four 
games behind the first place Red Sox on September 11, starting pitcher 
Randy Johnson outdueled Tim Wakefield 1−0. They won 14 of their last 18 
on their way to employing a franchise record 51 players to overtake Boston 
and capture their eighth consecutive AL East title. Their season ended 
in an ALDS loss to the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim.[58] Despite pitching 
issues and injuries, the Yankees won another AL East title in 2006. In 
2007, Torre achieved his 2000th win to become the first major league employee 
to win 2000 games as manager and collect 2,000 hits. He later notched his 
2,010th managerial win, overtaking Leo Durocher for ninth place on the 
MLB all-time managerial wins list. Next, he passed Stengel on the Yankees 
all time managerial wins list in 2007 and recorded his 1,150th victory 
with the Yankees. Torre led the Yankees to their 13th consecutive postseason 
appearance. After two Yankees losses to the Cleveland Indians in the Division 
Series, Steinbrenner said in an interview that Torre's contract would not 
be renewed if the Yankees did not defeat the Indians. The Yankees saved 
their season, and potentially Torre's job, for one day, as they won Game 
3 at Yankee Stadium.[59] Following the Yankees' elimination the following 
night, earning them another first-round exit, Torre's fate remained uncertain. 
That night, as he went out to make what would be his last pitching change 
with the team, the fans in Yankee Stadium gave him a standing ovation and 
chanted his name. After the season, the Yankees met with Torre and offered 
him a one-year contract with a $5 million base pay and $1 million bonuses, 
to be paid for each of three benchmarks the team would reach: winning the 
American League Division Series; winning the American League Championship 
Series; and winning the World Series. Further, had the Yankees reached 
the World Series, that would have automatically triggered an option for 
a new contract the following year. In spite of a pay cut from an average 
of $6.4 million over the previous three seasons, the new terms would have 
kept him as the highest-paid manager in the game.[60] Yankee Global Enterprises 
chairman Hal Steinbrenner "explained the rationale behind the offer, which 
was nonnegotiable." Yankees president Randy Levine commented, "We thought 
we needed to go with a performance-based model. It's important to motivate 
people based on performance." George Steinbrenner, due to advancing age 
and deteriorating health, had noticeably less influence in the day-to-day 
operation of the club. Of the ultimatum he issued during the playoffs, 
his son Hal denied that his comments influenced the terms of the contract 
they presented to Torre.[60] The New York media portrayed the offer as 
an insult. Torre turned it down, ending his era with the Yankees.[61] On 
October 19, 2007, he held a news conference to explain his decision. After 
first thanking George Steinbrenner, he remarked, "I just felt the contract 
offer and the terms of the contract were probably the thing I had the toughest 
time with." Of the aftermath, Wallace Matthews of Newsday commented, "They 
are very slick, these thugs running the Yankees. ... They have been trying 
to figure out a way to whack Torre while making it appear as if Torre whacked 
himself. What they came up with was brilliant in its innovation and chilling 
in its cynicism, but ultimately transparent."[62] Opined Mike Lupica, "It 
was just the most famous disagreement we are ever likely to see in baseball, 
the most famous manager telling the people who run the most famous team 
to take their job and shove it. A manager finally fired the Yankees."[63] 
Added Joel Sherman, "Torre erred in turning down the Yankees' proposal 
to stay in the position that has made him rich and famous beyond what he 
could have dreamed a dozen years ago." He also walks "away from that juice 
as much as the ownership."[60] On February 3, 2009, Torre released a book 
about his experiences with the Yankees, called The Yankee Years, co-authored 
by Tom Verducci. Torre returned to Yankee Stadium for the first time since 
vacating the Yankees managerial job on September 20, 2010, to pay respect 
to George Steinbrenner on the night of the previous owner's monument being 
unveiled in Monument Park. On November 1, 2007, the Los Angeles Dodgers 
announced that Torre would be their manager beginning with the 2008 season, 
filling the void left when Grady Little resigned the post two days before. 
This marked the return of Torre to the National League, the only league 
he had played or managed in prior to becoming the Yankees skipper. According 
to ESPN, his contract was valued at $13 million over 3 years.[64] Torre 
brought two members of his 2007 Yankees coaching staff with him. Don Mattingly, 
who had served as Torre's bench coach, was tabbed as the hitting coach, 
and third base coach Larry Bowa was brought in to fill the same position 
with the Dodgers. In January 2008, Mattingly was moved to the role of special 
assignment coach for the 2008 season due to family concerns. He was replaced 
as hitting coach by Mike Easler.[65] In addition, Torre brought in Bob 
Schaefer to be bench coach, and retained first base coach Mariano Duncan 
and pitching coach Rick Honeycutt from Little's staff. Ken Howell was promoted 
from Triple-A pitching coach to bullpen coach, completing his staff.[66] 
Torre as a young boy lived in Brooklyn when the Dodgers played there, but 
admitted to being a New York Giants fan then, adding another keynote in 
the longstanding rivalry between the two clubs. On March 31, 2008, Joe 
Torre made his managerial debut with the Dodgers in a 5–0 victory. Coincidentally, 
he would be managing several former Red Sox players, such as Manny Ramirez, 
Derek Lowe, and Nomar Garciaparra. On September 25, 2008, the Dodgers clinched 
the National League West title, giving Torre his 13th consecutive postseason 
appearance. October 4, 2008 saw Torre managing the Dodgers to a 3–0 victory 
over the Chicago Cubs in the National League Division Series, earning the 
Dodgers their first post season series victory since their championship 
season of 1988.[67] Torre's Dodgers were beaten in the NLCS four games 
to one by the Phillies (who went on to win the World Series) with a 5–1 
loss on October 15. In 2009, Torre served as a coach on manager Charlie 
Manuel's staff in the All-Star Game.[47] The Dodgers achieved the National 
League's best record (95–67), clinching the top seed. They faced Torre's 
old club, the St. Louis Cardinals, in the National League Division Series, 
sweeping them three games to nothing. However, they went on to lose to 
the Philadelphia Phillies in the NLCS in five games, ending their second 
consecutive season with a loss to the Phillies. (The Phillies, however, 
lost to his former team, the Yankees, in the 2009 World Series.) During 
the 2010 season, Torre and his Dodgers played games against both the Yankees 
and the Red Sox. The Dodgers managed to only go 1–5 against the two teams. 
It was the first time ever he had faced the Yankees and the first time 
he had faced the Sox since leaving the Yankees.[68] On September 17, 2010, 
Torre announced he would step down as Dodgers manager after the 2010 season, 
with Don Mattingly being Torre's replacement for the 2011 campaign.[69] 
On October 3, 2010, the Dodgers defeated the Arizona Diamondbacks 3–1 at 
Dodger Stadium for Torre's 2,326th career win. The victory was his last 
one with the Dodgers, since he stepped down as the team's manager at the 
conclusion of the game.[70] With a desire to stay highly active post-field 
managing in spite of his advancing age,[71] Torre accepted a position assisting 
Major League Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig as the new Executive Vice 
President for Baseball Operations on February 26, 2011.[72] His stated 
duties according to the MLB.com biography include serving as the primary 
liaison for all baseball and on-field activities between the office of 
the commissioner and the general managers and field managers of all 30 
Major League clubs. Other duties include overseeing areas of major league 
operations, on-field operations and discipline and umpiring.[73] In December 
2014, as part of an executive reorganization, MLB announced Torre's title 
was modified to Chief Baseball Officer, although his duties remained the 
same.[74] Torre drew criticism when, during the 10th year anniversary of 
the September 11, 2001 attacks, MLB denied the New York Mets the right 
to wear tribute caps to first responders, like they did in the month following 
the attacks.[75][76] Torre briefly resigned from his position with Major 
League Baseball in January 2012 amid speculation that he was interested 
in joining one of the groups seeking to buy the Los Angeles Dodgers.[77] 
The following March, he returned to his position with MLB after his group 
failed to buy the Dodgers.[78] Torre was the manager of the USA team in 
the 2013 World Baseball Classic.[79] On September 22, 2013, he attended 
a Yankees pregame tribute to Mariano Rivera at Yankee Stadium.[80] In August 
2015, Torre opened dialogue around Major League Baseball amid concerns 
about umpiring, the strike zone, and instant replay, by meeting with players 
and staff of all 30 major league teams. Red Sox manager John Farrell noted 
an increasing trend of pitches below the strike zone being called strikes.[81] 
Commented Cardinals manager Mike Matheny, "it's good leadership that he's 
willing to initiate conversation, ... giving guys a chance [to express 
any issues they might have], it's impressive. He wasn't ... making excuses 
for anybody. He said, 'Help me understand how we can help improve.'"[82] 
In December 2015, Torre led an expedition to Cuba composed of MLB officials 
and players. It was the first of its kind since 1999, and one anticipated 
as an important step to help normalize relations with the United States 
that had begun to ease earlier in the year.[83][84] As a manager or player 
in the Major League Baseball All-Star Game, Torre appeared 15 total times, 
with his teams going 13–1–1. During his playing career, he was always on 
the National League squad, going 8–1. Each time he was manager, it was 
for the American League, with those teams going 5–0–1.[47] In 2011, Torre 
made his first appearance at the New York Yankees' Old Timer's Day.[85] 
He also appeared in 2012, 2014, and 2015. The Yankees retired Torre's uniform 
number 6 on "Joe Torre Day", August 23, 2014, and honored him with a plaque 
in Monument Park at Yankee Stadium.[86] On April 29, 2016, the Cardinals 
announced that Torre was selected as part of the 2016 class to be inducted 
into the franchise Hall of Fame, with the enshrinement scheduled for the 
following August 27.[87] In an 18-year major league career, Torre played 
in 2,209 games, accumulating 2,342 hits in 7,874 at bats for a .297 career 
batting average along with 252 home runs, 1,185 runs batted in and an on-base 
percentage of .365.[1] He retired with a .990 fielding percentage in 903 
games as a catcher, a .993 fielding percentage in 787 games as a first 
baseman and a .951 fielding percentage in 515 games as a third baseman.[1] 
During his individual seasons, Torre batted over .300 five times, had over 
100 runs batted in five seasons and hit over 20 home runs six times. A 
nine-time All-Star, he was the recipient one each of a Most Valuable Player 
Award, batting title, and RBI crown. He finished in the National League 
top ten four times each in batting average, on-base percentage, on-base 
plus slugging percentage, adjusted OPS+, hits, total bases, and RBI, and 
slugging percentage. Also a Rawlings Gold Glove Award winner at catcher, 
Torre led National League catchers twice in fielding percentage and was 
in the top five caught stealing percentage. In ten different seasons combined 
at catcher, first base and third base, he finished in the top five in fielding 
percentage.[1] Baseball historian Bill James ranked Torre 11th all-time 
among major league catchers.[20] Torre established a Major League record 
by guiding his clubs to 14 consecutive World Series wins from Game Three 
of the 1996 World Series through Game Two of the 2000 championship. He 
became the first manager to guide his club to 12 consecutive postseason 
appearances.[47] General reference:[88] He appeared as himself in the broadcast 
booth in the 1990 film Taking Care of Business, which showed a fictional 
World Series between the Angels and the Chicago Cubs. In the 1997 TV movie 
Joe Torre: Curveballs Along the Way, Torre was played by Paul Sorvino. 
Torre also was featured as the "Voice of the Yankees' Manager" in the 2006 
animated feature Everyone's Hero.[103] Torre's character manages a team 
that includes a fictional Babe Ruth. Torre appeared with Willie Randolph 
in a set of Subway commercials, highlighting the pun of Subway and the 
Subway Series which Torre, then as Yankees manager, took part with Randolph, 
then as Mets manager. During the 2008 season, Torre appeared in TV ads 
for State Farm Insurance, poking fun at both himself and Hollywood stereotypes.[104][105] 
On June 15, 2009, Torre was a guest on The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien[106] 
and has made appearances on Sesame Street, Castle[107] and Gary Unmarried. 
Torre also appeared as himself in the 2002 Mafia comedy Analyze That starring 
Robert De Niro and Billy Crystal.[108] On February 8, 2010, Joe Torre was 
a walk-in on the Castle episode "Suicide Squeeze" (season 2, episode 15) 
A thoroughbred horse racing enthusiast, Torre is a part owner of several 
horses.[109] Game On Dude is a retired thoroughbred who is one of the top 
older handicap horses in the United States.[110] He also was a part-owner 
of Sis City, winner of the 2005 Ashland Stakes at Keeneland Race Course. 
She was the dominant three-year-old filly that year until finishing fourth 
in the May 6 Kentucky Oaks. However, a few weeks later on June 26, Wild 
Desert, in which Torre is also a partner, won the $1.0 million Queen's 
Plate, the first leg of the Canadian Triple Crown. Wild Desert is also 
partially owned by Keith Jones, an NHL player. A horse named Torre and 
Zim, was named after Torre and his former bench coach Don Zimmer, as both 
love horse racing.[111] Homeboykris, who had upset the field by a half-length 
and won the opening card of the Preakness Stakes on May 21, 2016, collapsed 
and died on his way back to the stall immediately after the race.[112] 
In 1997, Torre's autobiography, Chasing the Dream, was released. Later, 
he authored an advice book, titled Joe Torre's Ground Rules for Winners.[113] 
His third book, The Yankee Years, was released in February 2009. The book, 
co-authored by Sports Illustrated writer Tom Verducci, details Torre's 
tenure as manager of the New York Yankees.[114] In 2002, Torre and his 
wife Ali established the Joe Torre Safe at Home Foundation. In October 
2007 the Foundation partnered with the Union City, New Jersey Board of 
Education and the North Hudson Community Action Corporation (NHCAC) to 
establish the Foundation's Margaret Place initiative at Union City, New 
Jersey's José Martí Middle School, with a $325,000 donation from Verizon. 
It continues to receive yearly funding from that company of up to $65,000. 
The Foundation's mission is to educate and prevent domestic violence. Margaret's 
Place is named after Torre's mother, who was a victim of verbal and physical 
abuse at the hands of Torre's New York City Police officer father when 
Torre was a child. Torre describes his father as a "bully", and while Torre 
himself was not a target of his father's violence, he has related that 
he never felt safe at home, and grew up in fear for his mother, saying, 
"I always felt responsible for it. I never thought I belonged anywhere. 
I never felt safe except on the ball field." Margaret's Place is a comprehensive 
program that provides students with a safe room in school where they can 
meet with a professional counselor trained in domestic violence intervention 
and prevention in order to address the student's home situation and educate 
them to understand domestic violence's impact on the community. The children 
are also given the opportunity to read, play games or talk about their 
experience with others. The program, which is administered by health care 
professionals from North Hudson Community Action Corp, also includes an 
anti-violence campaign within the school, and training for teachers and 
counselors. It has grown to 11 sites in the region, though Union City's 
is the only such program in New Jersey.[2][115][116] Torre is also a supporter 
of other anti-domestic violence programs. In September 2008, he recorded 
a public service announcement[117] and personal voice message in support 
of the RESPECT! Campaign against domestic violence. He has one son, Michael, 
by his first wife, Jackie, whom he married in 1963. He has two daughters, 
Lauren and Cristina, by his second wife, Dani, whom he married in 1968. 
Both of these marriages ended in divorce. On August 23, 1987, he married 
Alice (Ali) Wolterman, his third wife. They have a daughter, Andrea. His 
older brother Frank Torre was also a Major League Baseball player. Frank 
died in 2014. His younger brother, Rocco, was a New York Police Department 
officer who died in 1996. His older sister, Marguerite is a Roman Catholic 
nun and teacher, and through 2007 was the principal of the Nativity of 
the Blessed Virgin Mary School in Ozone Park Queens. He is also a mentor 
to and still remains very close friends to former New York Mets all star 
Lee Mazzilli.[citation needed] Torre was treated for prostate cancer[118] 
in 1999. On December 14, 2005, Torre carried the Olympic Flame in Florence, 
Italy, as part of the torch relay of the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin,
