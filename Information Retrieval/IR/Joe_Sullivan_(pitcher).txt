Joe Sullivan (September 26, 1910 – April 8, 1985), was a Major League pitcher 
who played five season in the Major Leagues with the Detroit Tigers (1935–1936), 
Boston Red Sox (1939–1940), Boston Braves (1941), and Pittsburgh Pirates 
(1941). In five major league seasons, Sullivan had a record of 30–37 with 
a 4.01 ERA. A knuckleball specialist, Sullivan once pitched 12 straight 
innings of scoreless relief. Born in Mason City, Illinois, Sullivan's family 
moved west, where he graduated from Silverdale (now Central Kitsap) High 
School in 1928. Sullivan was a three-sport player at Silverdale High. [1] 
After high school, Sullivan played semi-pro ball for the Bremerton Cruisers 
of the Northwest League. In 1929, Sullivan played for New Westminster of 
the Vancouver City League. In 1930, Bloedel-Donovan Lumber Co. of Port 
Angeles took him to a 16-team state tournament where Sullivan signed with 
New York Yankees scout Bill Essick. [2] That season, he played with Hollywood 
of the Pacific Coast League. After being released, Sullivan went to Tucson 
to play in the Arizona State League. The Detroit Tigers bought his contract 
in 1932 and sent him to Beaumont of the Texas League. Returning to play 
for Hollywood in 1934, a 25–11 season earned him his first shot in the 
bigs the following year. [3] Sullivan broke into the major leagues in 1935 
with a Detroit Tigers team that went on to win its first World Series Championship 
in Sullivan's rookie season. Sullivan started 12 games for the 1935 Tigers 
and had a 3.51 ERA. Sullivan did not appear in the 1935 World Series. In 
1936, Sullivan's performance lagged, as his ERA jumped to 6.78 in 26 games 
(22 in relief). He finished the 1936 season 2–5 and did not pitch in the 
major leagues in 1937 or 1938. In 1939, Sullivan was given a second chance 
by the Boston Braves. He played three seasons with the Braves, but never 
had a winning record. In June 1941, Sullivan was purchased from the Braves 
by the Pittsburgh Pirates, where he pitched in 16 games and finally had 
a winning record of 4–1. Despite having his first winning record with the 
Pirates, Sullivan never played another game in major league baseball. After 
his 1941 season with Pittsburgh, Sullivan played for Portland of the Pacific 
Coast League. In 1943 he played for the Bremerton Cruisers and then pitched 
home games for the original Kitsap BlueJackets in 1946, then of the class-B 
Western International League. [4] In 1945, he began a career with the Puget 
Sound Naval Shipyard, where he eventually became fire chief and worked 
until 1970.[5] Sullivan died April 8, 1985 in Sequim, Washington, after
