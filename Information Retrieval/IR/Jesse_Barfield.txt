Jesse Lee Barfield (born October 29, 1959) is a former Major League Baseball 
right fielder. He batted and threw right-handed. Barfield is considered 
to have had "by far the best outfield arm of the 1980s".[1] He led American 
League outfielders in assists for three consecutive years (1985â€“87). Along 
with George Bell (LF) and Lloyd Moseby (CF), Barfield starred in what many 
analysts considered the best all-around outfield of the 1980s with the 
Toronto Blue Jays.[2] Selected by the Blue Jays in the ninth round of the 
1977 amateur draft, Barfield debuted in the majors in 1981, where he hit 
.232 in just 25 games. He was a regular the following season, and hit .246 
with 18 home runs and 58 RBIs, including the first pinch hit grand slam 
in franchise history. He finished eighth in American League Rookie of the 
Year voting, and solidified himself as a regular in the lineup for years 
to come. In 1983, Barfield hit .253 with 27 home runs and 58 RBIs, and 
the following year, increased his average to .284 with 14 home runs and 
49 RBIs. In 1985, he helped Toronto reach the playoffs for the first time 
in franchise history. He hit a career-high .289 with 27 homers and 84 RBIs 
that season, and became the first player in franchise history to hit 20 
homers and steal 20 bases in the same season.[3] In his only playoff appearance, 
Barfield hit .280 with a home run, four RBIs, and a stolen base. Despite 
the Blue Jays' failure to defend their division title from the previous 
year, Barfield enjoyed his best personal season in 1986. He collected career-highs 
in batting average (.289), RBI (108), runs (107), hits (170) doubles (35), 
and wRC+ (147). He also hit a career-best 40 home runs, leading the major 
leagues and setting a team record which lasted one year. In addition, Barfield 
was awarded the Gold Glove Award, Silver Slugger Award and selected to 
the American League All-Star team. The 1987 season saw Barfield play in 
a career-high 159 games, hitting .263 with 28 home runs and 84 RBIs. He 
also won his second Gold Glove that year. The following year, his average 
dipped to .244 with 18 home runs and 56 RBIs. In 1989, he hit just .200 
with five home runs (out of 16 total hits) and 11 RBIs in 28 games before 
being traded to the New York Yankees for Al Leiter on April 30.[4][5] Barfield 
finished the 1989 season with the Yankees, and his average increased slightly 
to .240, with 18 home runs and 56 RBIs. In 1990, he hit .246 with 25 home 
runs with 78 RBIs, but never produced quite like the club had hoped. In 
1991 he hit just .225, although he had 17 home runs and 48 RBIs for a Yankees' 
team that was one of the worst in recent history. By 1992, injuries and 
general ineffectiveness forced his retirement at the age of 32, after he 
hit just .137 (13 hits in 95 at-bats) in 30 games. He was granted free 
agency on November 4.[4] While with the Yankees, Barfield was a resident 
of Tenafly, New Jersey. [6] In 1993, he played in Japan with the Yomiuri 
Giants, reuniting with Moseby, but batted just .215 in 114 games and was 
released. He joined the Houston Astros for spring training in 1994 and 
was projected to be the opening-day right-fielder, but injuries prevented 
him from making the ballclub. Throughout his career Barfield was a free 
swinger and racked up more than 140 strikeouts in five seasons ('85, '86, 
'87, '89 and '90). For most of his time in the major leagues his productivity 
overshadowed his strikeouts; however by 1990, 1 in 3 Barfield at bats resulted 
in a strikeout. Barfield was a career .256 hitter with 241 home runs, 716 
RBI, and 39 WAR in 1428 games. He was inducted in the Kinston Professional 
Baseball Hall of Fame in 1990. His son, Josh, is a second baseman in the 
Baltimore Orioles organization. He has another son, Jeremy, selected by 
the New York Mets during the 2006 draft. Jeremy opted to attend San Jacinto 
Community College instead, and was drafted in 2008 by the Oakland Athletics. 
On August 22, 2006 it was reported by the Associated Press that Barfield's 
younger son, Jeremy Barfield, pushed his father down the stairs, causing 
Jesse to be hospitalized. The incident also resulted in Jeremy's arrest.[7] 
In 2007 and 2008, Barfield served as a color commentator for Blue Jays 
games on CBC. Currently, Jesse Barfield works at Competitive Edge Sports
