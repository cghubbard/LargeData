George Thomas "Tom" Seaver (born November 17, 1944), nicknamed "Tom Terrific" 
and "The Franchise", is a former Major League Baseball (MLB) pitcher. He 
pitched from 1967 to 1986 for four different teams, but is noted primarily 
for his time with the New York Mets. During a 20-year career, Seaver compiled 
311 wins, 3,640 strikeouts, 61 shutouts and a 2.86 earned run average. 
In 1992, he was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame by the 
highest percentage of votes ever recorded at the time (98.84%; subsequently 
surpassed in 2016 by Ken Griffey Jr. with 99.32%), and is one of two players 
(with Mike Piazza) wearing a New York Mets hat on his plaque at Cooperstown. 
As of 2016, Seaver, Mike Piazza and Gil Hodges (who played for the expansion 
Mets in 1962-63) are the only Mets players to have their jersey numbers 
retired by the team (Gil Hodges' number was retired as a manager even though 
he also played for the Mets). He won the National League Rookie of the 
Year Award in 1967, and he received three NL Cy Young Awards as the league's 
best pitcher. Seaver is the Mets' all-time leader in wins, and he is considered 
by many baseball experts to be one of the best starting pitchers in the 
history of baseball. Seaver was born in Fresno, California, to Betty Lee 
(Cline) and Charles Henry Seaver.[1] Pitching for Fresno High School, Seaver 
compensated for his lack of size and strength by developing great control 
on the mound. Despite being an All-City basketball player, he hoped to 
play baseball in college. He joined the United States Marine Corps Reserves 
on June 28, 1962. He served with AIRFMFPAC 29 Palms, California through 
July 1963.[2] After six months of active duty in the Reserves, Seaver enrolled 
at Fresno City College. In anticipation of the following season, he was 
being recruited to pitch for the University of Southern California by legendary 
Trojan coach Rod Dedeaux. Unsure as to whether Seaver was worthy of a scholarship, 
he was sent to pitch for the Alaska Goldpanners of Fairbanks, Alaska, in 
1964. After a stellar season – in which he pitched and won a game in the 
national tournament with a grand slam — he was awarded a scholarship to 
USC. As a sophomore, Seaver posted a 10-2 record, and he was drafted in 
the tenth round of the 1965 Major League Baseball draft by the Los Angeles 
Dodgers. When Seaver asked for $70,000, however, the Dodgers passed.[3] 
In 1966, he signed a contract with the Atlanta Braves, who had drafted 
him in the first round of the secondary June draft (20th overall). However, 
the contract was voided by Baseball Commissioner William Eckert because 
his college team had played two exhibition games that year (although Seaver 
himself hadn't played). Seaver intended, then, to finish the college season, 
but because he had signed a pro contract, the NCAA ruled him ineligible. 
After Seaver's father complained to Eckert about the unfairness of the 
situation, and threatened with a lawsuit, Eckert ruled that other teams 
could match the Braves' offer.[3] The Mets were subsequently awarded his 
signing rights in a lottery drawing among the three teams (the Philadelphia 
Phillies and Cleveland Indians being the two others) that were willing 
to match the Braves' terms. Seaver spent one season with the Jacksonville 
Suns of the International League, then joined the New York Mets in 1967. 
He won 16 games for the last-place Mets, with 18 complete games, 170 strikeouts, 
and a 2.76 ERA, all Mets records to that point, and was named the National 
League Rookie of the Year. He was also named to the 1967 All-Star Game, 
and got the save by pitching a scoreless 15th inning. In 1968, he won 16 
games again, and recorded over 200 strikeouts for the first of nine consecutive 
seasons, but the Mets moved up only one spot in the standings, to ninth. 
In 1969, Seaver, fellow pitcher Jerry Koosman and the rest of the Mets 
won their first World Series championship. Seaver won a league-high 25 
games and his first National League Cy Young Award. He also finished runner-up 
to Willie McCovey for the League's Most Valuable Player Award. On July 
9, before a crowd of over 59,000 at New York's Shea Stadium, Seaver threw 
8 1⁄3 perfect innings against the division-leading Chicago Cubs. Then, 
rookie backup outfielder Jimmy Qualls lined a clean single to left field, 
breaking up Seaver's perfect game. In the first-ever NLCS game, Seaver 
outlasted Atlanta's Phil Niekro for a sloppy 9-5 victory. Seaver was also 
the starter for the Mets' first World Series game, but lost a 4-1 decision 
to the Baltimore Orioles' Mike Cuellar. Seaver then pitched a 10-inning 
complete-game for a 2-1 win in Game Four to put the Mets on the cusp of 
their first championship. At year's end, Seaver was presented with both 
the Hickok Belt as the top professional athlete of the year, and Sports 
Illustrated magazine's "Sportsman of the Year" award.[4][5] On April 22, 
1970, Seaver set a major league record by striking out the final 10 batters 
(consecutively) of the game in a 2-1 victory over the San Diego Padres 
at Shea Stadium. This record, however, was broken by several Boston Red 
Sox pitchers with 11 straight strikeouts on September 25, 2016. Al Ferrara, 
who had homered in the second inning for the Padres' run, was the final 
strikeout victim of the game. In addition to his 10 consecutive strikeouts, 
Seaver tied Steve Carlton's major league record, at the time, with 19 strikeouts 
in a nine-inning game,.[6] The Mets also won the game in which Carlton 
struck out 19, with Carlton victimized by Ron Swoboda's pair of 2-run homers 
in a 4-3 Mets victory in St. Louis on September 15, 1969. (The record was 
later eclipsed by 20-strikeout games by Kerry Wood, Randy Johnson, Max 
Scherzer, and twice by Roger Clemens.) By mid-August, Seaver's record stood 
at 17-6 and he seemed well on his way to a second consecutive 20-victory 
season. But he only won one of his last ten starts, including four on short 
rest, to finish 18-12. Nonetheless, Seaver led the National League in both 
ERA and strikeouts. His 1971 season was arguably Seaver's finest year, 
when he led the league in ERA (1.76) and strikeouts (289 in 286 innings) 
while going 20-10. However, he finished second in the Cy Young balloting 
to Ferguson Jenkins of the Chicago Cubs, due to Jenkins' league-leading 
24 wins, 325 innings pitched, and exceptional control numbers. Seaver himself 
has said that 1971 was his best season. Seaver had four more twenty-win 
seasons (20 in 1971, 21 in 1972, 22 in 1975, and 21 in 1977) (7 wins for 
the Mets, then 14 more after being traded to the Reds). He won two more 
Cy Young Awards (1973 and 1975, both with the Mets). During his tenure 
with the Mets, Seaver made 108 starts in which he pitched 9 or more innings 
and allowed 1 run or less. His record in those starts is 93-3 with 12 no-decisions. 
In seven of the 12 no-decisions, he pitched 10 or more innings. In the 
12 no-decisions, he pitched a total of 117 innings, allowing 56 hits and 
5 earned runs, compiling a 0.38 ERA. Between 1970 and 1976, Seaver led 
the National League in strikeouts five of the seven seasons, finishing 
second in 1972 and third in 1974. Seaver also won three ERA titles as a 
Met. Two famous quotes about Seaver are attributed to Reggie Jackson: "Blind 
men come to the park just to hear him pitch." The second was that, while 
pitching for the Mets during the 1973 World series, 6th game, with the 
Mets up 3 games to 2, and so poised to win their second Championship, with 
Mr. Seaver scheduled to start. He did, but did not have his "arm" that 
day, his arm strength, that is, and the opposing team knew it. Seaver would 
go on to start and lose the 6th game... Mr. Jackson is reported to have 
said "Seaver pitched with his heart that day." Seaver was perhaps the foremost 
latter-day exponent of "drop and drive" overhand delivery, but his powerful 
legs protected his arm, and ensured his longevity. Seaver was frequently 
compared to fellow Hall of Fame pitcher Christy Mathewson. By 1977, the 
free agency period had begun and contract negotiations between Mets ownership 
and Seaver were not going well. Seaver wanted to renegotiate his contract 
to bring his salary in line with what other top pitchers were making, but 
chairman of the board M. Donald Grant, who by this time had been given 
carte blanche by Met management to do what he wished, refused to budge. 
Longtime New York Daily News columnist Dick Young regularly wrote negative 
columns about Seaver's "greedy" demands. As for Seaver, he attempted to 
resolve the impasse by going to then-team owner Lorinda de Roulet, who 
along with then-GM Joe McDonald, had negotiated in principle a three-year 
contract extension by mid-June. But before the contract could be signed, 
Young wrote an unattributed story in the Daily News claiming that Seaver 
was being goaded by his wife to ask for more money because she was jealous 
of the fact that Nolan Ryan was making more money with the California Angels. 
Upon being informed of the story, Seaver informed de Roulet that he immediately 
wanted out, and asked McDonald to immediately trade him, feeling that he 
could not co-exist with M. Donald Grant.[7] In one of two trades that New 
York's sports reporters dubbed "the Midnight Massacre" (the other involved 
struggling outfielder Dave Kingman), Seaver was traded to the Cincinnati 
Reds on June 15, 1977 (the trading deadline for that year) for pitcher 
Pat Zachry, minor league outfielder Steve Henderson, infielder Doug Flynn, 
and minor league outfielder Dan Norman. Seaver would go 14-3 with Cincinnati 
and win 21 games that season, including an emotional 5-1 win over the Mets 
in his return to Shea Stadium. Seaver struck out 11 in the return, and 
also hit a double. Seaver, who was immensely popular in New York, also 
received a lengthy ovation at the 1977 All-Star Game, which was held in 
New York's Yankee Stadium. His departure from New York sparked sustained 
negative fan reaction, as the Mets became the league's worst team, finishing 
in last place the next 3 seasons. Combined with the Yankees' resurgence 
in the market, attendance dipped in 1978, and plunged in 1979 to 9,740 
per game. M. Donald Grant was fired after the 1978 season, and Joe McDonald 
was fired after the 1979 season following a sale of the team to publishing 
magnate Nelson Doubleday, Jr..[8] In a sardonic nod to the general manager, 
Shea Stadium acquired the nickname "Grant's Tomb".[9] After having thrown 
five one-hitters for New York, including two games in which no-hit bids 
were broken up in the ninth inning, Seaver recorded a 4-0 no-hitter against 
the St. Louis Cardinals on June 16, 1978 at Riverfront Stadium. It was 
the only no-hitter of his professional career. Seaver was 75-46 in Cincinnati. 
He led the Cincinnati pitching staff in 1979, when the Reds won the Western 
Division, and again in the strike-shortened 1981 season, when the Reds 
had the best record in the major leagues. In the latter season, Seaver, 
with his sterling 14-2 performance, was a close runner-up to Fernando Valenzuela 
for the 1981 Cy Young Award. (Seaver had finished third and fourth in two 
other previous years.) In 1981, during one of his 2 losses, Seaver recorded 
his 3,000th strikeout. After recording his 3000th, he took himself out 
of the game, walking off the mound to a standing ovation. He suffered through 
an injury-ridden 1982 campaign, finishing 5-13. On December 16, 1982, Seaver 
was traded back to the Mets, for Charlie Puleo, Lloyd McClendon, and Jason 
Felice. On April 5, 1983, he tied Walter Johnson's major league record 
of 14 Opening Day starts, shutting out the Philadelphia Phillies for six 
innings in a 2-0 Mets win. (He made two more such starts with the Chicago 
White Sox in 1985 and 1986 for a record total of 16 opening day assignments.) 
Despite a 9-14 record that season, Seaver had high expectations going into 
1984 and intended to finish his career where he started it. Seaver and 
the Mets were stunned on January 20, 1984 when he was claimed in a free-agent 
compensation draft by the Chicago White Sox. The team (especially GM Frank 
Cashen) had incorrectly assumed that no one would pursue a high-salaried, 
39-year-old starting pitcher, and left him off the protected list. Faced 
with either reporting to the White Sox or retiring, Seaver chose the former. 
The result for the Mets was an opening in the starting rotation that allowed 
Dwight Gooden to be part of the team.[citation needed] Seaver pitched two 
and a half seasons in Chicago, crafting his last shutout on July 19, 1985 
against the visiting Indians. In an anomaly, Seaver won two games on May 
9, 1984; he pitched the 25th and final inning of a game suspended the day 
before, picking up the win in relief against the Milwaukee Brewers, before 
starting and winning the day's regularly scheduled game, also facing the 
Brewers. This unexpected win set up one of Seaver's most memorable moments. 
After Seaver's 298th win, a reporter had pointed out to White Sox catcher 
Carlton Fisk that following his upcoming start in Boston, Seaver's next 
scheduled start would be in New York, and that the possibility existed 
that he might achieve the mark there. Fisk emphatically stated that Seaver 
would win in Boston, and then would win his 300th. On August 4, 1985, Seaver 
recorded his 300th victory at New York against the Yankees, throwing a 
complete game 4-1 victory. Don Baylor, the tying run, hit a fly ball to 
left field for the final out of the game. Coincidentally, it was Phil Rizzuto 
Day – Seaver would later become Rizzuto's broadcast partner for Yankee 
games. Lindsey Nelson, a Mets radio and TV announcer during Seaver's Mets 
days, called the final out for Yankees TV flagship WPIX. Late in 1985, 
his next-to-last season, Seaver almost returned to the Mets, as general 
manager Frank Cashen was poised to make a late-season trade. However, manager 
Davey Johnson vetoed the idea, and Seaver instead ended his career with 
the Boston Red Sox in 1986 after being traded for Steve Lyons in mid-season. 
Seaver's 311th and last win came on August 18, 1986 against the Minnesota 
Twins. At the time of his retirement, Seaver was third on the all-time 
strikeout list (3,640), trailing only Nolan Ryan and Steve Carlton. No 
major league pitcher ever has matched his feat of striking out ten consecutive 
batters.[6] His career average of 6.85 strikeouts per nine innings is fourth 
only to Steve Carlton (7.1), Nolan Ryan (9.55), and Randy Johnson (10.6) 
of any Hall of Famer with at least 300 wins. Seaver's lifetime ERA of 2.86 
was third among starting pitchers in the live-ball era, behind only Whitey 
Ford (2.73) and Sandy Koufax (2.76). (Jim Palmer and Andy Messersmith both 
have a career earned run average of 2.86 as well.) Seaver also holds the 
record for consecutive 200-strike-out seasons with nine (1968–1976). Seaver's 
61 career shutouts are second only to Warren Spahn (63) in the live-ball 
era. His career win-loss record percentage of .603 is one of the highest 
of any Hall of Fame pitcher with 300 wins in the live-ball era, and his 
record of 7.84 hits per nine innings is second only to Nolan Ryan (6.56) 
for all Hall of Fame pitchers with at least three hundred wins, and first 
among all HOF pitchers in any era with 300 wins, 3000 strikeouts, and a 
winning percentage of .600 or better. A knee injury prevented him from 
appearing against the Mets in the 1986 World Series between the Mets and 
Red Sox, but Seaver received among the loudest ovations during player introductions 
prior to Game 1. Roger Clemens attributes the time he shared with Seaver 
as 1986 Red Sox teammates as instrumental in helping him make the transition 
from thrower to pitcher. The Red Sox did not offer Seaver a contract to 
his liking for the 1987 season. His 1986 salary was $1 million; the Red 
Sox offered $500,000, which Seaver declined. When no new contract agreement 
was reached, Seaver was granted free agency on November 12, 1986. In 1987, 
with their starting rotation decimated by injury, the Mets sought help 
from Seaver. Though no actual contract was signed, Seaver joined the club 
on June 6, and was hit hard in an exhibition game against the Triple-A 
Tidewater Tides on June 11. After similarly poor outings on the 16th & 
20th, he announced his retirement, saying, "I've used up all the competitive 
pitches in my arm!" The Mets retired his uniform number 41 in 1988 in a 
special Tom Seaver Day ceremony. As of 2016, Seaver and Mike Piazza remain 
the only Met players to have their uniform numbers retired. Casey Stengel 
and Gil Hodges had their numbers retired as Met managers, and Jackie Robinson 
had his number retired by all teams. Their numbers—14 (Hodges), 31 (Piazza), 
37 (Stengel), 41 (Seaver), and 42 (Jackie Robinson) -- were posted in large 
numerals on the outfield fence at Shea Stadium, and are posted on the left 
field corner wall at Citi Field. He is one of only two pitchers (the other 
being Walter Johnson) to have 300 wins, 3,000 strikeouts, and an under 
3.00 ERA. Seaver was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame on January 7, 
1992. He received the second highest-ever percentage of votes with 98.84% 
(on 425 of 430) (Ken Griffey Jr. had 437 of 440, which got him a 99.3%), 
higher than Nolan Ryan's 98.79% (491 of 497), and Ty Cobb's 98.23% (222 
of 226). Three of the five ballots that had omitted Seaver were blank, 
cast by writers protesting the Hall's decision to make Pete Rose ineligible 
for consideration. One ballot was sent by a writer who was recovering from 
open-heart surgery and failed to notice Seaver's name. The fifth "no" vote 
was cast by a writer who said he never voted for any player in their first 
year of eligibility.[10] Seaver is one of two players enshrined in the 
Hall of Fame with a Mets cap on his plaque, along with Mike Piazza. He 
was also inducted into the New York Mets Hall of Fame in 1988, the Marine 
Corps Sports Hall of Fame in 2003, and the Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame 
in 2006. In 1999, Seaver ranked 32nd on The Sporting News' list of the 
100 Greatest Baseball Players, the only player to have spent a majority 
of his career with the Mets to make the list. That year, he was also a 
nominee for the Major League Baseball All-Century Team. Baseball purists 
often compare him to Christy Mathewson for his combination of raw power, 
pinpoint control, intelligence, and intense scrutiny of his performance. 
Seaver was the foremost latter-day exponent of "drop and drive" overhand 
delivery that utilitized his powerful legs, took strain off of his arm, 
and helped ensure his longevity. He always credited the training he received 
in the Mets organization, citing the long careers of teammates Jerry Koosman, 
Nolan Ryan and Tug McGraw as further proof. Seaver could also help himself 
at the plate. A decent hitter and proficient bunter, Seaver hit 12 home 
runs during his career, along with a relatively solid lifetime average 
for a pitcher of .154. Hank Aaron stated that Seaver was the toughest pitcher 
he ever faced. Seaver approached Aaron before his first All-Star Game in 
1967 and asked Aaron for his autograph. Seaver felt the need to introduce 
himself to Aaron, as he was certain "Hammerin' Hank" would not know who 
he was. Aaron replied to Seaver, "Kid, I know who you are, and before your 
career is over, I guarantee you everyone in this stadium will, too." On 
September 28, 2006, Seaver was chosen as the "Hometown Hero" for the Mets 
franchise by ESPN. Seaver made a return to Shea Stadium during the "Shea 
Goodbye" closing ceremony on September 28, 2008, where he threw out the 
final pitch in the history of the stadium to Mike Piazza. He and Piazza 
then opened the Mets' new home, Citi Field with the ceremonial first pitch 
on April 13, 2009. The 2013 Major League Baseball All-Star Game was dedicated 
to Seaver. He concluded the introduction of the starting lineup ceremonies 
by throwing out the ceremonial first pitch. Mets player David Wright participated. 
Since retirement, Seaver has sometimes been a television color commentator, 
working variously for the Mets, the New York Yankees, and with Vin Scully 
in 1989 for NBC. Seaver replaced Joe Garagiola[11] as NBC's lead baseball 
color commentator. He worked as an analyst for Yankees telecasts on WPIX 
from 1989 to 1993 and for Mets telecasts on WPIX from 1999 to 2005, making 
him one of three sportscasters to be regular announcers for both teams; 
the others are Fran Healy and Tim McCarver. He has also worked as a part-time 
scout, and as a spring training pitching coach. Seaver's TV experience 
dates back to his playing career, when he was invited to serve as a World 
Series analyst for ABC in 1977 and for NBC in 1978, 1980, and 1982. While 
an active player, Seaver called the 1981 National League Division Series 
between Montreal and Philadelphia and that years's National League Championship 
Series alongside Dick Enberg for NBC. Seaver married the former Nancy Lynn 
McIntyre on June 9, 1966. They are parents of two daughters, Sarah and 
Annie. They live in Calistoga, California, where he started his own 3.5-acre 
(14,000 m2) vineyard, Seaver Family Vineyards,[12] on his 116-acre (0.47 km2) 
estate in 2002.[13] His first vintage was produced in 2005.[14][15] He 
presented his two cabernets, "Nancy's Fancy" and "GTS", in an April 2010 
wine-tasting event in SoHo to positive reviews.[16] His media nickname 
referred to the cartoon character Tom Terrific. In 1991 Seaver was diagnosed 
with Lyme disease which caused Bell's palsy. After lying dormant in his 
system the disease reoccurred in 2012. Seaver suffered from loss of memory 
not even remembering long term acquaintances, "sleep disorder, nausea, 
and a general overall feeling of chemical imbalance". In January 2013 Seaver 
was diagnosed with Stage 3 of the disease. As of July 2013, after a treatment
