Kenshin Kawakami (川上 憲伸) (born June 22, 1975) is a retired right-handed 
Japanese professional baseball starting pitcher. He originally pitched 
for the Chunichi Dragons of the Central League. Kawakami was the Rookie 
of the Year in 1998 as he went 14-6 with a 2.57 ERA. He helped the Dragons 
to the Central League Title in 1999, but would lose in the Japan Series 
in 5 games to the Fukuoka Daiei Hawks. He has pitched a no-hitter in his 
professional career. In 2004, Kawakami went 17-7 and led Chunichi to the 
Central League Title, though they fell to the Seibu Lions in 7 games in 
the Japan Series. That year, Kawakami was named Central League MVP and 
received the Eiji Sawamura Award as Japan's best pitcher. Kawakami again 
won 17 games in 2006 and led the Dragons to the Central League title again, 
winning Game 1 of the Japan Series against the Hokkaido Nippon Ham Fighters. 
In 2007, Kawakami helped the Dragons end a streak of 53 years without a 
championship as they beat the Nippon Ham Fighters in 5 games. On January 
13, 2009, Kawakami signed a three-year deal with the Atlanta Braves. [1][2] 
Kenshin Kawakami threw his first game as an Atlanta Brave on February 26 
in a Spring training game against the Pirates. Kawakami pitched two innings 
allowing one hit and striking out one batter. Kawakami pitched his first 
Major League game on April 11, 2009 against the Washington Nationals. He 
picked up his first Major League win, giving up 3 earned runs, and striking 
out 8 in 6 innings.[3] On May 22 and against countryman Daisuke Matsuzaka 
at Fenway Park, he limited the Boston Red Sox to two hits and two earned 
runs in six innings and helped the Braves begin a 13-game stretch with 
an 8-2 win over the Red Sox.[4] A video game version of Kawakami helped 
Wade McGilberry from Mobile, Alabama win $1 million as part of the Major 
League Baseball 2K10 Perfect Game Challenge. McGilberry used Kawakami to 
pitch a perfect game in Major League Baseball 2K10, and won the contest 
by being the first person to do so in accordance with the contest rules.[5] 
Kawakami went 1-10 in 2010 and recorded nine straight losses before picking 
up his first win on June 26 against the Detroit Tigers at Turner Field[6] 
He pitched seven innings with six strikeouts in a 4-3 win for the Braves. 
After being sent to the bullpen, Kawakami only pitched once in 40 games, 
where he performed poorly, allowing 2 runs in one inning. On November 12, 
following the season, the Braves outrighted Kawakami to their Double-A 
affiliate, the Mississippi Braves.[7] During the 2010 season, a group of 
fans would dress as "Kenshin's Geishas" to support Kawakami during homestands.[8] 
After spending the entirety of the 2011 season pitching at the AA level 
for the Mississippi Braves, Kawakami agreed to a contract with his previous 
team, the Chunichi Dragons of Japan's Central League.[9] Kawakami has struggled 
with injury since his return to the Dragons, making only a combined 12 
starts during the 2012 and 2013 seasons. He went 3-1 with a 2.83 in 7 starts 
during 2012 and 1-1 with a 3.21 ERA in 5 starts during 2013.[10] Due to 
shoulder pain, he did not make his first start in 2013 until 22 August. 
[11] On 22 November 2013, The Chunichi Dragons announced that they had 
signed Kawakami to a 1-year extension.[12] Kawakami throws a fastball around 
90 mph (tops out at 94), shuuto (sinker), slow curveball, splitter, and 
a good cutter.[13] In response to the 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan,
