Ed Wade (born January 31, 1956) is the former General Manager of the Houston 
Astros and previously the Philadelphia Phillies. After graduating from 
Temple University in 1977,[1] Wade started his baseball career as an intern 
in the Phillies public relations department. In 1977, he was named public 
relations assistant for the Astros and was promoted to public relations 
director in 1979, replacing Kenneth "Flannel" Mung. In 1981, he left Houston 
to become the public relations director for the Pittsburgh Pirates, and 
he remained with that club for five seasons. In 1986, Wade returned to 
Houston to work as an associate for Tal Smith Enterprises, a firm that 
has provided consulting services to 26 of the 30 Major League Baseball 
clubs. The most recognized functions have been in the preparation of arbitration 
cases, the financial appraisal of franchise, contract negotiations and 
other baseball-related matters. Wade worked for the company until May 5, 
1989, when he rejoined the Phillies as assistant to the general manager. 
In 1995, he was promoted to assistant general manager, and he served in 
that role until assuming the general manager duties for Philadelphia in 
1998. Wade traded Curt Schilling, the Phillies' long-time ace, to the Arizona 
Diamondbacks for Omar Daal, Vicente Padilla, and Travis Lee. He signed 
veterans Mike Lieberthal and David Bell to large contracts when they were 
approaching the end of their careers. He also included no-trade clauses 
in star players Bobby Abreu, Jim Thome, and Pat Burrell's contracts. During 
his tenure, the Phillies drafted power-hitting outfielder Pat Burrell, 
starting pitcher Brett Myers, All Star second baseman Chase Utley, MVP 
first baseman Ryan Howard and World Series MVP Cole Hamels. He also hired 
manager Charlie Manuel, who led the Phillies to their first world championship 
in 28 years. Wade hired two managers during his tenure. He inherited Terry 
Francona when he was promoted, whom he fired after the 2000 season. Wade 
hired former Phillies shortstop Larry Bowa, who led the Phillies to their 
first winning season since winning the 1993 National League pennant in 
2001, falling just two games short of the postseason. Bowa was fired with 
two games remaining in the 2004 season. Wade was fired by the Phillies 
after the 2005 season due to the team's inability to make the postseason 
despite several seasons of high expectations. In Wade's last three seasons 
with the Phillies, the team missed the playoffs by margins of 5.0, 6.0, 
and 1.0 games respectively. In total, the Phillies compiled a record of 
643 wins and 652 losses over Wade's eight-year tenure, with a winning percentage 
of .497. Although the Phillies showed marked improvement from the first 
three years of Wade's tenure (217–269, .447) to its next five years (426–383, 
.527), the team never exceeded 90 wins in any given season, instead winning 
exactly 86 or 88 games in four of Wade's last five seasons. Three years 
after being fired, the core players drafted and developed during his tenure 
brought Philadelphia its first World Series championship in 28 years. On 
September 20, 2007, Wade was named the General Manager of the Houston Astros, 
beating out 10 other candidates.[2] On November 8, 2007, Wade traded relief 
pitcher Brad Lidge, along with reserve infielder Eric Bruntlett, to the 
Phillies in exchange for second-year outfielder Michael Bourn, middle reliever 
Geoff Geary, and third base prospect Mike Costanzo.[3] Lidge had been a 
highly successful closer for the Astros in 2004 and 2005, but had fallen 
out of favor after giving up a dramatic home run to Albert Pujols in the 
2005 National League Championship Series and struggling the following season. 
The Phillies and Lidge went on to win the World Series in 2008. On December 
12, 2007, Wade acquired shortstop Miguel Tejada in exchange for Luke Scott, 
Matt Albers, Costanzo, Dennis Sarfate, and Troy Patton. The trade was controversial, 
in part because Tejada was mentioned as a possible steroid user in the 
Mitchell Report, which was released the day after the trade. The day after 
the Mitchell Report, he traded Chad Qualls, Chris Burke, and Juan Gutierrez 
to the Arizona Diamondbacks for closer José Valverde. On June 25, 2008, 
Wade was engaged in a dispute with Astros reliever Shawn Chacón. After 
a while, Chacon burst and grabbed Wade by the neck and threw him to the 
ground. The Astros suspended Chacon indefinitely. This event eventually 
led to his release. He has not played in Major League Baseball since. In 
December 2009, Wade and the Astros signed reliever Brandon Lyon and acquired 
fireballer closer Matt Lindstrom from the Florida Marlins. On July 29, 
2010 Wade traded Roy Oswalt to the Philadelphia Phillies for J.A. Happ 
and two minor league players, center fielder Anthony Gose, and shortstop 
Jonathan Villar. Gose was then traded to the Toronto Blue Jays for Brett 
Wallace.[4] On July 29, 2011, Wade traded All-Star right fielder Hunter 
Pence to the Philadelphia Phillies for Jonathan Singleton, Jarred Cosart, 
Josh Zeid, and a player to be named later (Domingo Santana). On July 30, 
2011, he traded Bourn to the Braves for pitchers Juan Abreu and Brett Oberholtzer 
and center fielder Jordan Schafer.[5] The Astros ended the season with 
a record of 56–106, last in the majors. On November 28, 2011, Wade was 
fired by new Astros owner Jim Crane.[6] In December 2011, Wade returned
