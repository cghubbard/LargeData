Dallas Keuchel (/ˈkaɪkəl/, KY-kəl; born January 1, 1988), nicknamed Kid 
Keuchy, is an American professional baseball pitcher for the Houston Astros 
of Major League Baseball (MLB). He is a left-handed starting pitcher. He 
previously attended the University of Arkansas, where he played baseball 
for the Arkansas Razorbacks. Keuchel made his MLB debut in 2012. In 2014, 
he was awarded both the Gold Glove Award and Fielding Bible Award. The 
next year, Keuchel was named the starting pitcher for the American League 
in the 2015 MLB All-Star Game and won the Cy Young Award, in addition to 
his second Gold Glove and Fielding Bible Awards. In 2016, he was awarded 
a third straight Gold Glove Award. Keuchel attended Bishop Kelley High 
School in Tulsa, Oklahoma, where he led the baseball team to the state 
championship.[1] Keuchel then attended the University of Arkansas, where 
he played college baseball for the Arkansas Razorbacks baseball team. He 
registered a 5.88 earned run average (ERA) as a freshman, a 4.58 ERA as 
a sophomore, and a 3.92 ERA as a junior.[2] During the 2009 season, Keuchel 
led the Razorbacks as the Friday-night ace. Entering May, Keuchel had a 
6–1 record before defeating Anthony Ranaudo and #4 LSU. Keuchel pitched 
8.1 innings and allowed only four runs. The following week, the Razorbacks 
lost at #21 Alabama, 2–1, with Keuchel taking the loss. The final regular 
season series was against Drew Pomeranz and #9 Ole Miss at Baum Stadium. 
The Razorbacks committed four errors in Keuchel's last regular season start, 
and he was tagged with the loss, ending the regular season with a 7–3 record. 
After his junior year at Arkansas, the Houston Astros selected Keuchel 
in the seventh round of the 2009 Major League Baseball (MLB) Draft.[3] 
He signed with the Astros and began his professional career with the Tri-City 
ValleyCats of the Class A-Short Season New York–Penn League, where he had 
a 2.70 ERA. He began the 2010 season with the Lancaster JetHawks of the 
Class A-Advanced California League. After posting a 3.36 ERA, the Astros 
promoted him to the Corpus Christi Hooks of the Class AA Texas League in 
July, where he had a 4.70 ERA for the remainder of the season. He began 
the 2011 season with Corpus Christi, and after pitching to a 3.17 ERA, 
received a promotion to the Oklahoma City RedHawks of the Class AAA Pacific 
Coast League, where he struggled with a 7.50 ERA.[2] Keuchel began the 
2012 season with Oklahoma City. Keuchel made his MLB debut on June 17, 
2012 against the Texas Rangers.[4] He threw a complete game in his second 
start.[5] Keuchel finished the 2012 season with a 5.27 ERA in 16 games 
started, while allowing more walks (39) than strikeouts (38). He pitched 
to a 5.15 ERA in the 2013 season.[6] In 2014, Keuchel had a 9–5 win-loss 
record and a 3.20 ERA at the All-Star break, and was a finalist for the 
final American League (AL) roster spot in the 2014 MLB All-Star Game.[7] 
He finished the season with a 12–9 record and a 2.93 ERA.[8] For his strong 
defense, Keuchel won both the Gold Glove Award[9] and Fielding Bible Award.[10] 
In April 2015, Keuchel pitched to a 3–0 record and a 0.73 ERA in five games 
started. He was named the AL's Pitcher of the Month for April 2015.[8] 
He was honored as the AL Pitcher of the Month for May 2015, in which he 
pitched to a 4–1 record and a 2.62 ERA in six starts.[11] Keuchel was selected 
for the AL roster in the 2015 MLB All-Star Game,[12] and was chosen as 
the AL's starting pitcher.[13] He won his third AL Pitcher of the Month 
Award for August, after pitching to a 4–1 record and a 1.94 ERA in six 
starts.[14] Keuchel finished the 2015 season with a 15–0 record at Minute 
Maid Park, becoming the first player in MLB history to finish with an undefeated 
record at home with at least 14 wins.[15] His overall record for the year 
was 20–8, and he had a 2.48 ERA and 216 strikeouts.[16] Keuchel started 
and won the 2015 American League Wild Card Game on three days rest.[17] 
On October 11, he followed up by beating the Kansas City Royals, 4–2, in 
Game 3 of the AL Divisional Series, to move the Astros within one game 
of advancing.[18] In Game 5, Keuchel was brought in for a relief appearance 
on just 2 days of rest in the 8th inning and surrendered a 3-run home run 
as the Royals extended their lead to 7-2 which they held on to win the 
game and the series. Following the season, Keuchel won the Cy Young Award, 
the Gold Glove Award, the Fielding Bible Award,[citation needed] and the 
Warren Spahn Award, given to the best left-handed pitcher in MLB.[19] Keuchel 
became the third Astro to win a Cy Young Award, Mike Scott and Roger Clemens 
having won the National League honors in 1986 and 2004 respectively. Keuchel 
throws five pitches: a sinker averaging 89 miles per hour (143 km/h), a 
four-seam fastball averaging 89 miles per hour (143 km/h), a cut fastball 
averaging 86 miles per hour (138 km/h), a slider averaging 79 miles per 
hour (127 km/h), and a changeup averaging 80 miles per hour (130 km/h).[20] 
He had learned a slurve while in high school, which he did not use in college, 
as he relied on his sinker and changeup. Needing a breaking ball in his 
arsenal when he became a professional, he learned to throw a curveball. 
He did not succeed with the curveball in the major leagues, and he developed 
a slider, which helped his results.[21] Keuchel's sinker and slider both 
induce more ground balls than average across the league.[20] Keuchel was 
born to Dennis and Teresa Keuchel. He has an older sister, Krista.[22]
