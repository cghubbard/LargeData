Frank O'Donnell "Don" Hurst (August 12, 1905 – December 6, 1952) was a 
first baseman in Major League Baseball. He played with the Philadelphia 
Phillies and Chicago Cubs from 1928 to 1934. In 1932, he led the National 
League in runs batted in with 143. Hurst stood at 6 ft 0 in (1.83 m). Hurst 
was born in Maysville, Kentucky, and attended Ohio State University. He 
started his professional baseball career in 1926 in the International League.[1]

he slugged a career-high 31 home runs and drove in 125 runs. His best season 
was 1932, when he batted .339 with 24 home runs and led the National League 
with 143 runs batted in.[2] However, he slumped badly in 1933 and 1934. 
In June 1934, Hurst was traded to the Cubs for first baseman Dolph Camilli.

He managed the Hamilton Red Wings in 1939[1] and then retired from baseball. 
In his later years, he worked at the Veterans Memorial Auditorium in Culver 
City, California.[3] In 1952, Hurst became ill and died in December, at
