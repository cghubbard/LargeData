Baseball WA is the governing body of baseball within Western Australia. 
Baseball WA is governed by the Australian Baseball Federation. In 1999, 
Baseball WA Ltd was formed as a company limited by shares by the merger 
of the West Australian Baseball League, the West Australian Junior Baseball 
League and the Baseball Development Foundation. Each member club is considered 
a shareholder in the company, as well as the local umpires and scorers 
associations and the local masters league, for players over 35 years of 
age. The top level of baseball locally in Western Australia is the Baseball 
WA State League. The league began in 1936 as the West Australian Baseball 
League's 'A Grade' competition, changing its name to State League in 1991/92. 
The league played during the winter months from its formation until 1963, 
switching to a summer competition for the 1963/64 season. *Premierships 
since 1936 The Neville Pratt Medal is the most prestigious baseball award 
in Western Australia and is presented to the best and fairest player in 
the State League season. Until 2014/15, the award was determined through 
umpires votes from each minor round game with the best player on the day 
receiving 3 votes, the second best 2 votes and the third best 1 vote. For 
the 2015/16 season, a special panel will be convened by Baseball WA to 
determine the winner. The medal was known as the President's Medal from 
its founding in 1952 until 2000, when it was renamed for its 1961 winner, 
1956 Olympian and legendary WABL administrator Neville Pratt. Since 1984/85, 
the medal has also incorporated the James Garfield Crawford Memorial Award.
