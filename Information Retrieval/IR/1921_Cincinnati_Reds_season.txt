The 1921 Cincinnati Reds season was a season in American baseball. The 
team finished sixth in the National League with a record of 70â€“83, 24 games 
behind the New York Giants. Following a disappointing ending to the 1920 
season, in which the Reds lost 17 of their final 25 games to drop out of 
the National League pennant race, Cincinnati made some moves during the 
off-season. On November 20th, the club traded away outfielder Greasy Neale 
and pitcher Jimmy Ring to the Philadelphia Phillies, getting pitcher Eppa 
Rixey in return. Rixey had spent his entire eight year career with the 
Phillies, and in 1920, despite a poor record of 11-22, Rixey had an ERA 
of 3.48, struck out 110 batters in 284.1 innings pitched, and pitched 25 
complete games. His best season came in 1916, as Rixey had a 22-10 record 
and a 1.85 ERA in 38 games. He played under current Reds manager Pat Moran 
in Philadelphia. In December, the Reds picked up outfielder Dode Paskert 
off of waivers from the Chicago Cubs. Paskert, now 39 years old, had previously 
played with Cincinnati from 1907-1910. With the Cubs in 1920, he appeared 
in 139 games, batting .279 with five home runs and 71 RBI. The Reds then 
traded pitcher Dutch Ruether to the Brooklyn Robins for pitcher Rube Marquard. 
Marquard, a 34 year old veteran, had a 10-7 record with a 3.23 ERA in 28 
games with the Robins in 1920. Marquard also previously pitched for the 
New York Giants, where he had the most success in his career. In 1911, 
he led the National League with a .774 winning percentage and in strikeouts 
with 237. The following season, in 1912, he led the National League in 
wins with 26. The Reds also acquired catcher Bubbles Hargrave from the 
St. Paul Saints of the American Association for $10,000. He hit .335 with 
22 home runs with the Saints in 1920. The team also acquired second baseman 
Sam Bohne from the Seattle Rainiers of the Pacific Coast League, where 
he hit .333 with the club. Cincinnati struggled at the start of the season, 
as the team had a record of 7-9 in the month of April. The losses continued 
to pile up in May, with Cincinnati winning only seven of 26 games, to drop 
their overall record to 14-28, last place in the National League. At the 
beginning of June, the Reds picked up outfielder Greasy Neale off of waivers 
from the Philadelphia Phillies. Neale had previously played with Cincinnati 
from 1916-1920, and the club traded him in the off-season to the Phillies 
in a deal that brought pitcher Eppa Rixey to the Reds. Neale struggled 
in Philadelphia, batting .211 with a home run and three RBI in 22 games. 
The club played better baseball in June, as in the middle of the month, 
the Reds had a streak where they won eight of nine games, and while the 
club moved out of last place into seventh, they were still well behind 
in the pennant race with a 25-41 by the end of the month. In July, Cincinnati 
continued to struggle early in the month, and the team made a move, purchasing 
pitcher Bob Geary from the Seattle Rainiers of the Pacific Coast League 
for $10,000. Geary had previous experience in the American League, pitching 
in 25 games with the Philadelphia Athletics from 1918 until 1919, where 
he had a 2-8 record and a 3.24 ERA. The Reds finished July with a 16-14 
record, their first winning month of the season, as the team improved to 
41-55, remaining in seventh place. The Reds had a second consecutive winning 
month, as the team went 16-15 in August, and moved into sixth place in 
the National League. The team continued to play .500 baseball in the last 
26 games of the season, going 13-13. Overall, the club finished the year 
with a disappointing 71-83, which was their first under .500 record since 
1916. Outfielder Edd Roush led the club with a .352 batting average with 
four home runs and 71 RBI in 112 games. Third baseman Heinie Groh hit .311 
with 48 RBI in only 97 games. First baseman Jake Daubert batted .306 with 
two home runs and 64 RBI in 136 games, while rookie second baseman Sam 
Bohne hit .285 with three home runs, 44 RBI and a team high 26 stolen bases 
in 153 games. Outfielder Pat Duncan had another very solid season with 
a .308 batting average, two home runs and 60 RBI in 145 games. Newly acquired 
Eppa Rixey led the Reds in wins, as he had a 19-18 record with a team best 
2.78 ERA in 301 innings pitched in 40 games. Dolf Luque finished the season 
with a 17-19 record and had a 3.38 ERA, as well as a team best 304 innings 
pitched and 102 strikeouts and 25 complete games in 41 games pitched. Rube 
Marquard, also in his first season with Cincinnati, had a solid 17-14 record 
with a 3.39 ERA over 265.2 innings pitched in 39 games. [1] [2] [3] [4]
