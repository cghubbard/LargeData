Armando Marsans (October 3, 1887 in Matanzas, Cuba – September 3, 1960 
in Havana, Cuba) was a Major League Baseball outfielder from 1911 to 1918. 
He played in three different major leagues in his career: with the Cincinnati 
Reds in the National League (1911 to 1914), with the St. Louis Terriers 
in the Federal League (1914 to 1915), and with the St. Louis Browns and 
New York Yankees (1916 to 1918). Marsans and Rafael Almeida debuted together 
with the Reds on July 4, 1911.[1] They are sometimes named the first major 
league players born in Cuba, which is untrue since Havana-born Chick Pedroes 
played in the National League in 1902. (Cuban-born Steve Bellán played 
from 1871 to 1873 in the National Association of Professional Base Ball 
Players, whose status as a major league is disputed by baseball historians). 
Six years before Cincinnati, Marsans and Almeida played "Negro baseball" 
in the United States as 1905 members of the integrated All Cubans. Marsans 
also played Negro league baseball in 1923 for the Cuban Stars (Riley, 514). 
He is buried at Colon Cemetery, Havana. Marsans played winter baseball 
in the Cuban League from 1905 to 1928 and was one of ten players elected 
to the Cuban Baseball Hall of Fame in its 1939 inaugural class. Marsans 
was also a long-time manager in the Cuban League and won a championship 
in the winter of 1917 as manager of the Orientals team.[2] In 1923, he 
served as manager of the minor league Elmira Pioneers. In 1953, he managed
