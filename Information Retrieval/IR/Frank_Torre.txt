Frank Joseph Torre (December 30, 1931 – September 13, 2014) was an American 
professional baseball player. He played in Major League Baseball as a first 
baseman. Torre, who batted and threw left-handed, played for the Milwaukee 
Braves (1956–60) and Philadelphia Phillies (1962–63). He was the older 
brother of Baseball Hall of Fame member Joe Torre, himself a former Major 
League Baseball player and longtime manager. Signed by the Boston Braves 
as an amateur free agent in 1950,[1] Torre spent four seasons in the Braves' 
farm system. He debuted with the team in 1956 (the Braves had since moved 
to Milwaukee) and played in 111 games, most of them as a backup. He hit 
.258 in 159 at-bats. Torre's two best seasons were in 1957 and 1958; in 
the former year, he batted .272 with 5 home runs and 40 runs batted in. 
He also tied a National League record that year by scoring six runs in 
one game, the first game of a September 2 doubleheader against the Chicago 
Cubs at Wrigley Field, which the Braves won 23–10. The Braves defeated 
the New York Yankees in that year's World Series; Torre homered twice in 
the Series, which the Braves won in seven games on the strength of Lew 
Burdette's three victories. In 1958 Torre established career highs in batting 
average (.309), home runs (six) and runs batted in (55) as the Braves repeated 
as National League champions. However, the Yankees defeated Milwaukee in 
their World Series rematch after trailing 0–2 and 1–3 in the Series. In 
his career Torre played 714 games, batting .273 with 13 home runs and 179 
RBIs. He was also a difficult man to strike out, fanning only 64 times 
in 1482 at-bats, or one per 23.2 at-bats. Torre was also an excellent defensive 
player, coming into the game as a replacement for Joe Adcock in late-inning 
situations in games where he did not start. Torre led all National League 
first basemen in fielding percentage in 1957 and 1958. In 1996, as his 
brother Joe was managing the New York Yankees to a World Series title (his 
first as a player or manager–39 years after Frank had won his) over the 
Atlanta Braves, Frank made news of his own by successfully undergoing a 
heart transplant. He received the new heart on October 25 at New York-Presbyterian 
Hospital after a two-and-a-half month wait. The very next night, he watched 
from his hospital bed as Joe managed the Yankees to the World Series title.[2] 
Like the 1958 World Series against Frank's Milwaukee Braves, the Yankees 
had rallied from an 0–2 deficit to win this Series, taking the next four 
games. In 2006 it was reported that Frank needed a kidney transplant as 
a result of the medication he had been taking for his heart. A year later 
he received a kidney from one of his daughters.[2] Torre served as a Vice 
President of the Baseball Assistance Team, a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization 
dedicated to helping former Major League, Minor League and Negro League 
players through financial and medical hardships.[3] Torre suffered cardiac 
arrest on September 13, 2014, doctors tried to revive him, but he could
