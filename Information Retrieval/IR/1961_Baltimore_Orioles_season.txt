The 1961 Baltimore Orioles season involved the Orioles finishing 3rd in 
the American League with a record of 95 wins and 67 losses, 14 games behind 
the AL and World Series champion New York Yankees. The team was managed 
by Paul Richards and Lum Harris, and played their home games at Baltimore's 
Memorial Stadium. Roger Maris of the Yankees hit his 59th and 60th home 
runs of the season against the Orioles, tying what was at the time Babe 
Ruth's single-season record. The 59th was hit on September 20 at Memorial 
Stadium,[6] and the 60th was hit on September 26 at Yankee Stadium. [1]
