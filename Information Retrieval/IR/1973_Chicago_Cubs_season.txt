The 1973 Chicago Cubs season was the 102nd season of the Chicago Cubs franchise, 
the 98th in the National League and the 58th at Wrigley Field. The Cubs 
finished fifth in the National League East with a record of 77–84. After 
a strong finish to the 1972 season,[2] the Cubs dominated the National 
League East for the first half of 1973. On June 29, they were 47-31 with 
an 8.5 game lead in the National League East.[3] But then the Cubs fell 
into a deep swoon, losing 33 of their next 42 games, including 11 straight 
losses from August 4–16, to fall below .500 and out of the division lead.[4] 
However, the rest of the division was so mediocre that it was nicknamed 
the "National League Least", enabling the Cubs to stay in contention even 
as they remained below .500. In fact, 1973 was the only season between 
1945 and 1984 in which the Cubs were still in contention on the last day 
of the regular season, September 30. Due to several rainouts, the Cubs 
still had four games to play against the first place Mets, so double headers 
were scheduled for September 30 and October 1, the day after the end of 
the season. If the Cubs were to win all four games, there could have been 
an unprecedented five-way tie for first place, with each team having a 
below .500 record of 80-82 (also unprecedented). It would have taken at 
least three days of games to break a five-way tie. Rain was still in the 
forecast for both days, and with Wrigley Field having no lights, the NL 
President ordered both double headers to start at 10AM (again, unprecedented), 
making it clear that the umpires would wait out any rain as long as there 
was daylight. The Cubs won the first game on September 30, and suddenly 
it seemed possible that the most unusual end to any season of baseball 
might happen. But the Mets won the second game, eliminating three of the 
teams, including the Cubs. On a dismal October 1, in light cold rain, the 
Mets won the first game and clinched the NL East. The second game was immediately 
canceled. Milt Pappas was scheduled to pitch for the Cubs in the second 
game, and the cancellation cost him his chance for his 100th victory in 
the National League. Infielders Coaches Note: Pos = Position; G = Games
