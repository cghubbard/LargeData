The St. Louis Cardinals are an American professional baseball team based 
in St. Louis, Missouri. The Cardinals compete in Major League Baseball 
(MLB) as a member club of the National League (NL) Central division. The 
new Busch Stadium has been their home ballpark since 2006. With origins 
as one of the early professional baseball clubs in St. Louis, entrepreneur 
Chris von der Ahe purchased a barnstorming club in 1881 then known as the 
Brown Stockings and established them as charter members of the American 
Association (AA) the following season. Upon the discontinuation of the 
AA, St. Louis joined the NL in 1892; at that time, they were called the 
Browns and the Perfectos before they were officially renamed as the Cardinals 
in 1900. One of the most successful franchises in baseball history, the 
Cardinals have won 11 World Series championships (second only to the New 
York Yankees' 27 and most among National League franchises), 19 National 
League pennants (third behind the San Francisco Giants and Los Angeles 
Dodgers), and 13 division titles. While still in the AA, St. Louis won 
four league championships, qualifying them to play in a forerunner of the 
World Series. They tied in 1885 and won outright in 1886[3] (both times 
against the predecessor of the Chicago Cubs) in a storied rivalry that 
continues on today. Cardinals achievements that have impacted MLB and sports 
in general include Branch Rickey's pioneering of the farm system, Rogers 
Hornsby's two batting Triple Crowns, Dizzy Dean's 30-win season in 1934, 
Stan Musial's 17 MLB and 29 NL records, Bob Gibson's 1.12 earned run average 
(ERA) in 1968, Whitey Herzog's Whiteyball, Mark McGwire breaking the single-season 
home run record in 1998, and the 2011 championship team's unprecedented 
comebacks.[4] The Cardinals have won 105 or more games in four different 
seasons and won 100 or more a total of nine times. Cardinals players have 
won 20 league MVPs, four batting Triple Crowns, and three Cy Young Awards. 
Baseball Hall of Fame inductees include Lou Brock, Dizzy Dean, Bob Gibson, 
Whitey Herzog, Rogers Hornsby, Joe Medwick, Stan Musial, Branch Rickey, 
Red Schoendienst, Ozzie Smith, and Bruce Sutter. In 2016, Forbes valued 
the Cardinals at $1.6 billion, making them the 7th-most valuable franchise 
in MLB; their revenue the previous year was $300 million and operating 
income of $60.0 million.[5][6] Since their purchase in 1995, owner William 
DeWitt, Jr.'s investment group has seen enormous growth from the $147 million 
purchase price. John Mozeliak is the general manager and Mike Matheny is 
the manager.[7] The Cardinals are renowned for their strong fan support: 
despite being in one of the sport's mid-level markets, they routinely see 
attendances among the league's highest, and are consistently among the 
Top 3 in MLB in local television ratings.[8][9] Professional baseball began 
in St. Louis with the inception of the Brown Stockings in the National 
Association (NA) in 1875. The NA folded following that season, and the 
next season, St. Louis joined the National League as a charter member, 
finishing in third place at 45-19. George Bradley hurled the first no-hitter 
in Major League history. The NL expelled St. Louis from the league after 
1877 due to a game-fixing scandal and the team went bankrupt.[10] Without 
a league, they continued play as a semi-professional barnstorming team 
through 1881. The magnitudes of the reorganizations following the 1877 
and 1881 seasons are such that the 1875–1877 and 1878–1881 Brown Stockings 
teams are not generally considered to share continuity as a franchise with 
the current St. Louis Cardinals;[11][12] For the 1882 season, Chris von 
der Ahe purchased the team, reorganized it, and made it a founding member 
of the American Association (AA), a league to rival the NL.[13] 1882 is 
generally considered to be the first year existence of the St. Louis Cardinals.[11][12][14][c] 
The next season, St. Louis shortened their name to the Browns. Soon thereafter 
they became the dominant team in the AA, as manager Charlie Comiskey guided 
St. Louis to four pennants in a row from 1885 to 1888.[3][17] Pitcher and 
outfielder Bob Caruthers led the league in ERA (2.07) and wins (40) in 
1885 and finished in the top six in both in each of the following two seasons. 
He also led the AA in OBP (.448) and OPS (.974) in 1886 and finished fourth 
in batting average in 1886 (.334) and fifth in 1887 (.357).[18] Outfielder 
Tip O'Neill won the first batting triple crown in franchise history in 
1887 and the only one in AA history.[19][20][21] By winning the pennant, 
the Browns played the NL pennant winner in a predecessor of the World Series. 
The Browns twice met the Chicago White Stockings – the Chicago Cubs prototype 
– tying one in a heated dispute and winning the other, thus spurring the 
vigorous St. Louis-Chicago rivalry that ensues to this day.[22] During 
the franchise's ten seasons in the AA, they compiled an all-time league-high 
of 780 wins and .639 winning percentage. They lost just 432 contests while 
tying 21 others.[3] The AA went bankrupt after the 1891 season and the 
Browns transferred to the National League. This time, the club entered 
an era of stark futility. Between 1892 and 1919, St. Louis managed just 
five winning seasons, finished in last or next-to-last place sixteen times, 
and ended four seasons with 100 losses or more. The nadir was the 1897 
season: a 29–102 record for a franchise-worst .221 winning percentage.[3] 
St. Louis' 84-67 finish as the Perfectos would be the team's best finish 
between the AA era and Sam Breadon's purchase of the team.[23] As the "Perfectos", 
the team wore their jersey with a cardinal red trim and sock striping.[23] 
Later that season, St. Louis Republic sportswriter Willie McHale included 
an account in a column of a female fan he heard remarking about the uniforms, 
"What a lovely shade of cardinal." Fans liked the moniker "Cardinals" and, 
the next year, popularity for the nickname induced an official change to 
Cardinals.[23] In 1902, an American League team moved from Milwaukee into 
St. Louis, renamed themselves the St. Louis Browns and built a new park 
on the site of the Cardinals' old stadium, striking a rivalry that lasted 
five decades.[24] Breadon bought a minority interest in the Cardinals in 
1917 and in 1919 Browns manager Branch Rickey joined the Cardinals.[25][26] 
The Cardinals' first twenty-eight seasons in the NL were a complete reversal 
of their stay in the AA – with a .406 winning percentage, they compiled 
1,632 wins, 2,425 losses and 74 ties.[3] St. Louis baseball commenced a 
renaissance: since 1926 the Cardinals have won eleven World Series and 
nineteen NL pennants.[3] Breadon spurred this revival when bought out the 
majority stake in 1920 and appointed Rickey as business manager, who expanded 
scouting, player development, and pioneered the minor league farm system, 
filling the role of today's general manager.[27] With Rogers Hornsby at 
second base, he claimed Triple Crowns in 1922 and 1925, and the Cardinals 
won the 1926 World Series, their first.[21][28] St. Louis then won the 
league in 1928, 1930, and 1931 and the 1931 World Series.[29] The Gashouse 
Gang edition claimed the 1934 World Series[29] and the Cardinals amassed 
new thresholds of popularity far outside St. Louis via radio.[30] Dizzy 
Dean led the Gang, winning the 1934 MVP, and leading the NL multiple times 
in wins, strikeouts, innings, complete games and shutouts.[31] Johnny Mize 
and Joe Medwick emerged as two power threats, with Medwick claiming the 
last Triple Crown for a Cardinal in 1937.[21][29][32][33][34] In the 1940s, 
a golden era emerged as Rickey's farm system became laden with such talent 
as Marty Marion,[35] Enos Slaughter,[36] Mort Cooper,[37] Walker Cooper,[38] 
Stan Musial,[39] Max Lanier,[40] Whitey Kurowski,[41] Red Schoendienst[42] 
and Johnny Beazley.[43] It was one of the most successful decades in franchise 
history with 960 wins 580 losses for a winning percentage higher than any 
other Major League team at .623.[44] With Billy Southworth managing, they 
won the World Series in 1942 and 1944 (in the only all-St. Louis series 
against the Browns), and won 105 or more games each in 1942, 1943, and 
1944.[3] Southworth's managerial winning percentage (.642) is St. Louis' 
highest since the franchise joined the National League.[45][46] Musial 
was considered the most consistent hitter of his era and most accomplished 
in team history, winning three MVPs and seven batting titles.[39][47] St. 
Louis then won the 1946 World Series on Slaughter's Mad Dash in Game 7.[48] 
Breadon was forced to sell the team in 1947 but won six World Series and 
nine NL pennants as Cardinals owner.[49] They remained competitive, finishing 
.500 or better in thirteen of the next seventeen seasons, but fell short 
of winning the league or World Series until 1964.[3] In 1953 the Anheuser-Busch 
brewery bought the Cardinals and August "Gussie" Busch became team president,[51] 
spurring the Browns' departure in 1953 to Baltimore to become the Orioles, 
and making the Cardinals the only major league club in town.[52] More success 
followed in the 1960s, starting with what is considered one of the most 
lopsided trades in Major League history, as St. Louis received outfielder 
Lou Brock from the Cubs for pitcher Ernie Broglio.[53] MVP third baseman 
Ken Boyer and pitcher Bob Gibson led the club to a World Series win the 
same year[54] and Curt Flood, Bill White, Curt Simmons, and Steve Carlton 
also made key contributions in this decade.[55][56][57][58] In 1967, new 
arrival Orlando Cepeda won the MVP, helping to propel St. Louis to the 
World Series.[59][60] The Cardinals won the league the following year behind 
their Major League-leading 2.49 staff ERA[61] in what was an all-round 
record-breaking season of pitching dominance. Posting a modern-day record 
low ERA of 1.12 and striking out a one-game World Series-record of 17,[62] 
Gibson won both the MVP and Cy Young awards that year.[63] However, the 
Cardinals failed to repeat as World Series champions, blowing a 3-1 lead 
to the underdog Detroit Tigers. In the 1970s, catcher/third baseman Joe 
Torre and first baseman Keith Hernández each won MVPs, but the team's best 
finishes were second place and 90 wins.[49][64][65] The team found their 
way back to the World Series the next decade, starting with manager Whitey 
Herzog and his Whiteyball style of play and another trade that altered 
course of the franchise: in 1982, shortstop Garry Templeton was shipped 
to the Padres for fellow shortstop Ozzie Smith.[66][67] Widely regarded 
as one of the best defensive players in history, Smith ranks first all-time 
among shortstops in Gold Glove Awards (13), All-Star games (15), assists 
(8,375), and double plays (1,590).[68][69] St. Louis won the 1982 World 
Series from the Milwaukee Brewers that fall.[70][71] The Cardinals again 
won the league in 1985 and 1987.[72] In the 1985 Series, they faced-off 
with cross-state rivals Kansas City Royals for the first time in a non-exhibition 
game, and lost the World Series.[73] After Gussie Busch died in 1989,[75] 
the brewery took control[76] and hired Joe Torre to manage late in 1990,[77] 
then sold the team to an investment group led by William DeWitt, Jr. in 
1996.[78] Tony La Russa replaced Torre in the spring of 1996.[79] In 1998, 
Mark McGwire competed with the Cubs' Sammy Sosa for a barrage of home runs 
in their pursuit of the single-season home run record.[80] From 2000 to 
2013, the Cardinals reestablished their way to the top with ten playoff 
appearances, four NL pennants, two World Series titles and 1,274 regular 
season wins against 993 losses for a .560 winning percentage, leading the 
National League and second in MLB only to the New York Yankees.[81] With 
the addition of Jim Edmonds, Albert Pujols, and Scott Rolen, the Cardinals 
featured three prominent sluggers and defenders nicknamed "MV3;"[82] Pujols 
won three MVPs and hit .328 with 445 home runs in his Cardinals career.[83] 
In 2004, playoff stalwart Chris Carpenter's 3.09 ERA and 15 wins[74] helped 
power the team to a major-league best 105 wins and take the NL pennant.[84] 
In 2006, beset with injuries and inconsistency,[85] they won the World 
Series, beating Detroit in five games to set an all-time record-low of 
83 wins for a World Series winner.[86][87][88] In 2009, the Cardinals reached 
10,000 wins, dating to when they first played in the American Association 
(AA).[d][89][90] St. Louis returned to the playoffs in 2011, first surmounting 
the largest games-won deficit after 130 games (at 10.5) to upstage the 
Atlanta Braves on the final day for the wild card playoff berth.[91] In 
Game 3 of the World Series, Pujols became just the third player to hit 
three home runs in a World Series game.[92] In Game 6, third baseman David 
Freese and outfielder Lance Berkman each tied the score on the Cardinals' 
final strike – the first such occurrence in any game in MLB history – and 
St. Louis defeated the Texas Rangers later that game with a walk-off home 
run from Freese.[93] After winning that Series, La Russa retired and became 
the only manager to do so after winning a title. He also finished with 
the most wins for managers in franchise history with 1,408.[94][95] La 
Russa's successor, Mike Matheny, helped extend St. Louis' playoff run as 
he became the first manager in the division play era to guide the Cardinals 
to the NLCS and playoffs in his first two seasons.[96] In 2014, the Cardinals 
extended their NLCS streak to 4, with their 3-1 series victory over the 
Dodgers, in the NLDS. Ten days after being eliminated from the postseason 
by the San Francisco Giants, rookie outfielder Oscar Taveras was killed 
in a car accident while traveling to his hometown Puerto Plata in the Dominican 
Republic.[97] On November 17, they acquired Atlanta Braves right-fielder 
Jason Heyward (who had just come off a Gold Glove-winning season) to replace 
Taveras.[98] On June 16, 2015, the FBI and the Justice Department started 
an investigation on the Cardinals for possibly hacking the Houston Astros. 
The hacking incident was perpetrated by Scouting Director Chris Correa..[99] 
The Cardinals play their home games at Busch Stadium (also referred to 
as New Busch Stadium or Busch III) in downtown St. Louis, straddling 7th 
and Clark near the intersection of Interstates 64 and 70.[100] The stadium 
opened for the 2006 season at a cost of $411 million and holds a normal 
capacity of 46,861.[101][102] The Cardinals finished their inaugural season 
in the new Busch Stadium by winning the 2006 World Series, the first team 
since the 1923 New York Yankees to do so.[103] This open-air stadium emulates 
the HOK Sport-designed "retro-style" baseball-only parks built since the 
1990s.[104] The open panoramic perspective over the outfield wall offers 
a remarkable view of St. Louis' downtown skyline featuring the distinctive 
Gateway Arch.[105] A replica of Eads Bridge spans the entrance to the park 
on the third base side, while the statue of Stan Musial arises in front 
of that entrance.[106] Other statues at the corner of 8th and Clark include 
Hall of Famers Rogers Hornsby, Ozzie Smith, George Sisler, Cool Papa Bell, 
Bob Gibson, Jack Buck and others.[107] Due to increased demand, Game 7 
of the 2011 World Series accommodated a baseball record of 47,399 by increasing 
the number of standing room only tickets. The attendance record for any 
sporting event is 48,263, in a 2013 Association Football (soccer) friendly 
match between Chelsea F.C. and Manchester City F.C., made possible by on 
field seating.[108] The largest attendance (53,000) of any event at Busch 
belongs to U2 during a concert from their 360° Tour in 2011.[109] Ballpark 
Village, a mixed-use development located across Clark Street from Busch 
Stadium, is targeted to enhance the ballpark goers' experience. Phase 1 
of the development, completed for the start of the 2014 season, includes 
entertainment venues, restaurants, and retail. Anchored by Cardinals Nation 
(which includes the Cardinals Hall of Fame, a two-story Cardinals-themed 
restaurant and all-inclusive rooftop seating for 300+ fans featuring spectacular 
views of the field across the street), a 20,000 sq ft Budweiser Brew House, 
FOX Sports Midwest Live! and PBR, the $100 million phase 1 development 
of Ballpark Village promises to be a vibrant gathering space throughout 
the year, not just during the baseball season.[110] Busch Stadium is the 
Cardinals' fourth home ballpark and the third of that name. The Cardinals' 
original home ballpark was Sportsman's Park from 1882–1892 when they played 
in the American Association and were known as the Browns. In 1893, the 
Browns moved to a new ballpark five blocks northwest of Sportsman's Park 
which would serve as their home from 1893–1920. The new park was originally 
called New Sportsman's Park but became more commonly referred to as Robison 
Field.[23] Midway through the 1920 season the Cardinals abandoned Robison 
Field and returned to the original Sportsman's Park and became tenants 
of their American League rivals, the St. Louis Browns. In 1953, the Anheuser-Busch 
Brewery purchased the Cardinals and the new owner subsequently also purchased 
Sportsman's Park from the Browns and renamed it Busch Stadium, later becoming 
Busch I. The Browns then left St. Louis for Baltimore after the season. 
The Cardinals built Busch Memorial Stadium, or Busch II, in downtown St. 
Louis, opened it during the 1966 season and played there until 2005.[49] 
It was built as the multi-purpose stadium home of both the baseball Cardinals 
and the football Cardinals, now the Arizona Cardinals. The current Busch 
Stadium was constructed adjacent to, and partly atop, the site of Busch 
Memorial Stadium. The Cardinals home field in spring training is Roger 
Dean Stadium in Jupiter, Florida. They share the complex, which opened 
in 1998, with the Miami Marlins. Before moving to Jupiter, the Cardinals 
hosted spring training at Al Lang Field in St. Petersburg, Florida from 
1937–1997. The Cardinals have exceeded the attendance total of 3 million 
every season since 2004. The Cardinals have had few logos throughout their 
history, although those logos have evolved over time. The first logo associated 
with the Cardinals was an interlocking "SL" that appeared on the team's 
caps and or sleeves as early as 1900. Those early uniforms usually featured 
the name "St. Louis" on white home and gray road uniforms which both had 
cardinal red accents. In 1920, the "SL" largely disappeared from the team's 
uniforms, and for the next 20 years the team wore caps that were white 
with red striping and a red bill. In 1922, the Cardinals wore uniforms 
for the first time that featured the two familiar cardinal birds perched 
on a baseball bat over the name "Cardinals" with the letter "C" of the 
word hooked over the bat. The concept of the birds originated after general 
manager Branch Rickey noticed a colorful cardboard arrangement featuring 
cardinal birds on a table in a Presbyterian church in Ferguson, Missouri, 
at which he was speaking. The arrangement's production was by a woman named 
Allie May Schmidt. Schmidt's father, a graphic designer, helped Ricky make 
the logo a familiar staple on Cardinals uniforms.[112] Colloquially referred 
to as the "birds on the bat", it initially appeared with the birds perched 
on a black bat and "Cardinals" in printed letters. An alternate version 
of this logo with "St. Louis" replacing "Cardinals" appeared in 1930 and 
was the primary logo in 1931 and 1932 before "Cardinals" returned. In 1940, 
the now-familiar "StL" logo was introduced on the team's caps. The interlocking 
"StL" has undergone several slight modifications over the years but has 
appeared on the team's caps every year since. The first appearance of the 
"STL" in 1940 coincided with the introduction of navy blue as a uniform 
color. From 1940 until 1955, the team wore navy blue caps with red bills 
and a red interlocking "StL" while the jerseys featured both cardinal red 
and navy blue accents. In 1951, the "birds on the bat" logo was changed 
to feature a yellow baseball bat.[113] In 1956, the Cardinals changed their 
caps to solid blue with a red "StL", removing the red bill. Also, for that 
season only, the Cardinals wore a script "Cardinals" wordmark on their 
uniforms excluding the "birds on the bat." An updated version of the "birds 
on the bat" logo returned in 1957 with the word "Cardinals" written in 
cursive beneath the bat. In 1962, the Cardinals became the first National 
League team to display players' names on the back of their jerseys. In 
1964, while retaining their blue caps for road games, the Cardinals changed 
their home caps to all red with a white interlocking "StL". The next year, 
they changed their road caps to red as well. In 1967, the birds on the 
bat emblem on the jersey was again tweaked, making the birds more realistic 
and changing the position of their tails relative to the bat and this version 
remained on all Cardinals game jerseys through 1997. In 1971, following 
the trend in baseball at the time, the Cardinals replaced the traditional 
flannel front-button shirts and pants with belts with new pullover knit 
jerseys and elastic waist pants. Another trend in baseball led the Cardinals 
to change their road uniforms from gray to light blue from 1976–1984. In 
1992, the Cardinals returned to wearing traditional button-down shirts 
and pants with belts. That same year they also began wearing an all-navy 
cap with a red "StL" on the road only while wearing the same red and white 
cap at home games. In 1998, the "birds on the bat" was updated for the 
first time in 30 years with more detailed birds and bolder letters. That 
year, St. Louis introduced a cap featuring a single cardinal bird perched 
on a bat worn only on Sunday home games. The new birds on the bat design 
was modified again the next year, with yellow beaks and white eyes replacing 
the red beaks and yellow eyes of the 1998 version. Uniform numbers also 
returned to the front of the jerseys in 1999 after a two-year absence.[113] 
On November 16, 2012, the Cardinals unveiled a new alternate uniform to 
be worn at home games on Saturdays beginning with the 2013 season.[needs 
update] The modified jersey, cream-colored with red trim on the sleeves 
and down the front, was the first since 1932 in which "St. Louis" will 
be used instead of "Cardinals" and retained the "birds on the bat."[114] 
2013 also saw the team adopt their red caps as their main uniform for both 
home and away games; the navy cap was retained as an alternate, used mainly 
against other red-capped teams. Over the years, the Cardinals have released 
various marketing logos depicting anthropomorphized cardinals in a pitching 
stance, swinging a baseball bat, or wearing a baseball cap that never became 
part of the game uniform.[113] The team mascot is an anthropomorphic cardinal 
wearing the team's uniform named Fredbird. He is assisted by Team Fredbird, 
a group of eleven women who entertain fans from the field and on top of 
the dugouts. While unofficial, the Rally Squirrel became an unexpected 
phenomenon during the 2011 postseason. Making its "debut" in Game 3 of 
the NLDS on Oct 4, a squirrel ran across home plate in the middle of a 
pitch from Roy Oswalt of the Phillies to the Cardinals' Skip Schumaker. 
The Cardinals would win Game 4 and subsequently Game 5 (Oct. 7) in Philadelphia 
to advance to the NLCS, symbolizing the squirrel's "role" in the victory. 
The squirrel was popularized as "Buschie the Rally Squirrel"[115] As a 
tribute to the popularity of the squirrel, a small depiction of the Rally 
Squirrel is also included on the official World Series rings the team received. 
It shows up under the "STL" logo on the side of the ring. Fredbird sparked 
controversy in May 2015, when he was asked by a fan for a photograph and 
handed him a sign that said "Police Lives Matter". The team later claimed 
that Fredbird should not be involved in any political activity or social 
commentary. The Cardinals–Cubs rivalry refers to games between the Cardinals 
and the Chicago Cubs. The rivalry is also known as the Downstate Illinois 
rivalry or the I-55 Series (in earlier years as the Route 66 Series) as 
both cities are located along Interstate 55 (which itself succeeded the 
famous U.S. Route 66). The Cubs lead the series 1,134–1,103 through June 
22, 2016, while the Cardinals lead in National League pennants with 19 
against the Cubs' 16. The Cubs have won 10 of those pennants in Major League 
Baseball's Modern Era (1901–present), while all 19 of the Cardinals' pennants 
have been won since 1926. The Cardinals also have an edge when it comes 
to World Series successes, having won 11 championships to the Cubs' three. 
Games featuring the Cardinals and Cubs see numerous visiting fans in either 
Busch Stadium in St. Louis or Wrigley Field in Chicago.[116] When the National 
League split into two and then three divisions, the Cardinals and Cubs 
remained together. This has added excitement to several pennant races over 
the years. The Cardinals and Cubs have played each other once in the postseason, 
when the Cubs beat the Cardinals 3 games to 1 in the 2015 National League 
Division Series. Although both teams play in the state of Missouri, they 
did not play each other for the first time until the 1985 World Series, 
which the Royals won in seven games, but which is perhaps best remembered 
for a controversial call from umpire Don Denkinger in Game 6. Due to their 
geographical proximity, the teams have faced each other every regular season 
in interleague play since it started in 1997. This is also referred to 
as the "Show Me Series" or the "I-70 Series", as both cities are located 
in Missouri and are connected by Interstate 70. The two teams celebrated 
the 30th anniversary of their rivalry in 2015. St. Louis leads the series 
51 games to 37 as of June 28, 2016. An investment group led by William 
DeWitt, Jr. owns the St. Louis Cardinals, having bought the team from Anheuser-Busch 
(AB) in 1996.[117] As with other periods of the Cardinals' transaction 
history, doubt loomed as to whether the purchaser would keep the team in 
St. Louis, due to the city's status as a "small market", which appear to 
handicap a club's competitiveness. Such was the case when Sam Breadon put 
the Cardinals up for sale in 1947: then-NL President Ford Frick proposed 
moving the Cardinals to Chicago.[118] When AB placed the Cardinals for 
sale in 1995, they publicly expressed intention to find a buyer who would 
keep the club in St. Louis.[119] In March 1996, AB sold the team for $147 
million to a partnership headed by Southwest Bank's Drew Baur, Hanser and 
DeWitt, Jr.[118] Civic Center Redevelopment, a subsidiary of AB, held the 
parking garages and adjacent property and also transferred them to the 
Baur ownership group.[120] Baur's group then sold the garages to another 
investment group, lowering the net franchise purchase price to about $100 
million, about $10 million less than Financial World's value of the team 
at the time $110 million.[119][121] Current Cincinnati Reds owners Bob 
Castellini and brothers Thomas Williams and W. Joseph Williams Jr. each 
once owned a stake in the Cardinals dating back to the Baur-DeWitt group's 
purchase of the team. To allow their purchase of the Reds in 2005, the 
rest of the group bought out Castellini's and the Williams brothers' shares, 
totaling an estimated thirteen percent. At that time, the Forbes valued 
the Cardinals at about $370 million.[122] However, after reabsorbing that 
stake into the remainder of the group, they decided to make it available 
to new investors in 2010. Amid later allegations that the Cardinals owed 
the city profit shares, DeWitt revealed that their profitability had not 
reached the threshold to trigger that obligation.[123] As of 2016, Forbes 
valued the Cardinals seventh among 30 MLB franchises. Their estimated value 
of $1.60 billion was an increase of $200 million from the season before, 
when they ranked sixth. St. Louis' revenue in 2015 was $300 million, up 
$6 million. Their operating income was $60.0 million.[5][6][124][125][126] 
In 2014, Forbes valued the Cardinals at $820 million and opined previously 
that they play "in the best single-team baseball market in the country 
and are among the league's leaders in television ratings and attendance 
every season."[126] Concurrent with the growth of Major League Baseball, 
the Cardinals value has increased significantly since the Baur-DeWitt purchase. 
In 2000, the franchise was valued at $219 million,[127] a growth rate of 
374% through 2014. The franchise's value grew 12.7% from 2013 to 2014.

of the franchise Hall of Fame after a 6-year hiatus. A formal selection 
process will recognize former Cardinals as Cardinals Hall of Famers each 
year. In conjunction, the team released the names of 22 former players 
and personnel to be inducted for the inaugural class of 2014.[167] The 
Cardinals have retired 12 total jersey numbers––second in MLB only to the 
New York Yankees' 20––in honoring 14 total former players and club personnel 
on the left field wall at Busch Stadium.[168][169] A 15th, Jackie Robinson, 
is honored by all MLB teams.[170] It should be noted that, during the time 
Rogers Hornsby had played, the Cardinals did not have any numbers on their 
uniforms. This practice had begun with the Cleveland Indians in 1920. Thus, 
Hornsby had no number to retire. Notes: Beginning with the 2015 season, 
#25 was reissued to Cardinals bench coach David Bell. The number holds 
historical significance within the Bell baseball family. Capable of reaching 
21 million listeners in nine states including Missouri, Illinois, Arkansas, 
Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Mississippi, Oklahoma, and Tennessee, the Cardinals 
radio network is the second-largest in MLB with 117 affiliate stations.[9] 
In St. Louis, CBS-owned KMOX (1120 AM) airs Cardinals games over radio 
and feeds the rest of the Cardinals network. Mike Shannon and John Rooney 
alternate as play-by-play announcers, with Chris Hrabe serving as pre-game 
and post-game host. KMOX's 50,000-watt clear-channel signal covers much 
of the continental United States at night. At one time, owing to the Cardinals' 
status as a "regional" franchise, the Cardinals radio network reached almost 
half of the country. The 2011 season marked the Cardinals' return to KMOX 
following five seasons on KTRS (550 AM), a station which is 50 percent 
owned by the Cardinals. With a partnership spanning seven decades, and 
continuously since 1954, its conclusion realized after the 2005 season 
when CBS Radio and the Cardinals failed to reach terms on a new rights 
agreement. However, frustrated by the underpowered coverage of 5,000-watt 
KTRS, the Cardinals reached a new deal with KMOX in 2011. Mike Shannon 
will announce 30 fewer games in 2013, compared to the 15 he took off in 
2012, and in previous seasons. Most of the games will be road games and 
three-city trips. He has been announcing Cardinals' games starting in 1972, 
making 2013 his 41st year announcing. He turns 74 in July.[174] He has 
announced Cardinals' games for more years than anyone except Jack Buck 
(1954–58, 1961–2001) who announced for 46 years. Since 2000, Cardinals 
telecasts have generated the top three in ratings in MLB every season.[9] 
Fox Sports Midwest airs all games in high-definition and is the team's 
exclusive television broadcaster, with the exception of selected Saturday 
afternoon games on Fox (via its St. Louis affiliate, KTVI) or Sunday Night 
Baseball on ESPN. Fox Sports Indiana, Fox Sports South, Fox Sports Tennessee, 
Fox Sports Oklahoma, Fox Sports Southwest, and SportSouth air Cardinals 
games for fans living within the Cardinals broadcast territory who do not 
receive the Fox Sports Midwest channel. The television commentators lineup 
includes Dan McLaughlin, Rick Horton, and Al Hrabosky. Jimmy "The Cat" 
Hayes serves as dugout reporter during the game as well as on Cardinals 
Live, a pre- and post-game show. Cardinals Live is hosted in-studio by 
Pat Parris along with game analysts and former Cardinals players Jim Edmonds, 
Gary Bennett and Chris Duncan.[175] Cardinals Kids, a program aimed at 
the team's younger fans, airs weekly in-season on Fox Sports Midwest. It's 
hosted by former Cardinals pitcher Andy Benes, team mascot Fredbird, and 
Busch Stadium Public Address announcer John "The U-Man" Ulett. The 30-minute 
show began airing in 2003 and presents team news, player profiles, and 
Cardinals team history in a kid-friendly manner along with games and trivia.[176] 
A weekly magazine program, This Week in Cardinal Nation, airs on St. Louis' 
NBC affiliate KSDK. Cardinals games had been seen on KSDK (and its predecessor, 
KSD-TV) from 1947 through 1958, 1963 through 1987, and 2007 until 2010. 
KPLR-TV was the Cardinals' other over-the-air broadcaster, carrying games 
from 1959 through 1962 and from 1988 until 2006. Former Cardinals broadcasters 
include Jack Buck, Harry Caray, Dizzy Dean, Joe Garagiola, Sr., and Jay 
Randolph. Joe Buck, the son of Jack Buck, was an official member of the 
Cardinals' broadcast team from 1991 until 2007. The younger Buck is currently 
the lead play-by-play caller for Fox Sports' national Major League Baseball 
and National Football League broadcasts. Opening Day payrolls for 25-man
