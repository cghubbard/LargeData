Darold Duane Knowles (born December 9, 1941) is a former Major League Baseball 
relief pitcher, and the current pitching coach of the Florida State League's 
Dunedin Blue Jays. In the 1973 World Series, Knowles became the only pitcher 
to date to appear in all seven games of a World Series.[1] Knowles signed 
with the Baltimore Orioles in 1961 after attending the University of Missouri. 
He spent four seasons in their farm system, going 45–28 with a 2.83 earned 
run average, mostly as a starter. He made his debut with the Orioles in 
1965, pitching 1.2 innings out of the bullpen, and giving up five earned 
runs before returning to the triple A Rochester Red Wings. Upon completion 
of the International League season, Knowles received a September call back 
up to Baltimore. He went 0–1 with a 6.92 ERA in his return. The loss came 
against the Detroit Tigers in his only start.[2] After the season, he and 
Jackie Brandt were traded to the Philadelphia Phillies for Jack Baldschun.[3] 
He won the season opener against the St. Louis Cardinals, pitching six 
innings of one-run ball to earn his first career win.[4] His first career 
save came on May 12 against the Los Angeles Dodgers.[5] For the 1966 season, 
he earned thirteen saves. His 69 appearances, all in relief, were the third 
highest total of any pitcher in the league. At the end of his only season 
in Philadelphia, he was traded to the Washington Senators for Don Lock. 
Knowles began earning a reputation as a work-horse reliever, as he was 
used 61 times by manager Gil Hodges in 1967. He was used 32 times in 1968 
when his season was cut short by President Lyndon B. Johnson's reserve 
call-up of the USAF's 113th Tactical Fighter Wing in which he was an airman 
first class.[6] He returned to the Senators in May 1969, and went 4–1 with 
four saves and a 2.01 ERA to earn his only career All-Star nod.[7] Despite 
a 2–14 record in 1970, Knowles enjoyed career highs in saves (27), appearances 
(71) and innings pitched (119.1). On May 8, 1971, the first place Oakland 
Athletics acquired Knowles and Mike Epstein for Frank Fernandez, Paul Lindblad 
and Don Mincher. Knowles only allowed four of 35 inherited runners to score, 
and earned seven saves and five wins out of a bullpen that already included 
Rollie Fingers and Bob Locker. The A's won the American League West by 
sixteen games over the Kansas City Royals, but were swept by the Baltimore 
Orioles in the 1971 American League Championship Series. Knowles' only 
appearance came in game three.[8] In 1972, Knowles went 5–1 with a 1.37 
ERA and eleven saves, however, he was lost for the postseason due to a 
broken thumb.[9] Knowles made five starts for the World Champion A's in 
1973, pitching his only complete game shutout against the Boston Red Sox 
on August 14.[10] The A's repeated as AL champions, and faced the New York 
Mets in the World Series. Knowles appeared in all seven games of the World 
Series, pitching 6.1 innings without giving up an earned run, and earning 
the save in games one[11] and seven.[12] He is, to date, the only pitcher 
ever to appear in all seven games of a World Series. Knowles had an off 
year in 1974, going 3–3 with a 4.22 ERA and blowing two of his five save 
opportunities. His .296 batting average against was the highest in the 
Oakland bullpen. Regardless, the A's won their third World Series in a 
row in 1974, however, Knowles did not make a post-season appearance. Shortly 
after the World Series, he, Bob Locker and Manny Trillo were dealt to the 
Chicago Cubs for Billy Williams.[13] Knowles inherited the closer's role 
in Chicago, saving fifteen in 1975 and nine in 1976. Shortly before Spring 
training 1977, Knowles was dealt to the Texas Rangers for a player to be 
named later and cash. He went 5–2 with a 3.22 ERA and four saves to help 
the Rangers to a second-place finish. After the season, he was reunited 
with his former A's manager Dick Williams when his contract was sold to 
the Montreal Expos. He appeared in sixty games with the Expos, going 3–3 
with six saves and a 2.38 ERA. Knowles did not enjoy playing in Canada, 
citing taxes, language problems and political unrest in Quebec[14] as the 
reasons for his displeasure. After just one season in Montreal, Knowles 
signed a two-year deal with his home team St. Louis Cardinals. Knowles 
made 48 appearances and earned six saves with the Cards in 1979. He made 
just two appearances in April 1980 before retiring and accepting a coaching 
position in the Cardinals' farm system. At the time of his retirement, 
he was tied for 13th in career saves. In between, Knowles played winter 
ball with the Tiburones de La Guaira club of the Venezuelan League in the 
1964–1965 season, where he posted a 13-9 record with a 2.37 ERA and 155 
strikeouts to earn Triple Crown honors.[15] After eight years as a minor 
league pitching coach for the Cardinals, Knowles was hired as the Philadelphia 
Phillies' pitching coach in January 1988 by new manager Nick Leyva. Under 
Knowles, the Phillies' pitching staff, which had a National League worst 
4.14 ERA and 628 walks in 1988, showed only mild improvement, and he was 
demoted to a minor league coaching position after the 1990 season. On January 
13, 2014, Knowles was named as the pitching coach for the Toronto Blue
