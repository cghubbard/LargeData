Throwback uniforms, throwback jerseys (AmE) or retro kits (BrE) or heritage 
guernseys (AuE) are sports uniforms styled to resemble the uniforms that 
a team wore in the past. One-time or limited-time retro uniforms are sometimes 
produced to be worn by teams in games, on special occasions such as anniversaries 
of significant events. Throwback uniforms have proven popular in all major 
pro and college sports in North America, not only with fans, but with the 
teams' merchandising departments. Because the "authentic" uniforms (accurate 
reproductions) and less-authentic "replicas" had been so popular at retail, 
the professional leagues institutionalized throwbacks as "third jerseys". 
Throwbacks were first popularized in Major League Baseball, where teams 
not only wore renditions of their past styles, but also tributes to defunct 
minor league and Negro League baseball teams as well. Often, the games 
where teams will wear throwbacks are promoted as "Turn Back The Clock Nights". 
Throwbacks also make frequent appearances every season in college football 
games, National Hockey League games, and in National Basketball Association 
games. The first companies to produce throwback uniforms were Tiedman & 
Company Sportswear (college football, basketball, hockey, NFL and World 
Cup soccer), Mitchell & Ness (Major League Baseball), and Ebbets Field 
Flannels (Negro League baseball). All three companies are still in business; 
Tiedman & Company relaunched in 2009 under the brand name Tiedman & Formby 
Vintage Athletic Co.. In some instances, teams will wear "fauxbacks": retro 
designed uniforms harkening back to an era which pre-dates the team itself. 
For example, the Tampa Bay Rays, formed in 1998, wore 1979-style baseball 
uniforms in 2012,[1] and the Dallas Mavericks have used a 1970s-like basketball 
uniform since 2004, despite having been established in 1980. Throwbacks 
were introduced in the NFL in 1991 at retail through the NFL Throwbacks 
Collection.[citation needed] The rights to produce the vintage apparel 
was limited to six apparel licensees, including Tiedman & Company Sportswear 
(exclusive to jerseys), Riddell (helmets), Starter (caps), Nutmeg Mills 
(sweatshirts), and DeLong (jackets). In 1994, to honor the NFL's 75th Anniversary, 
teams were allowed to wear modern versions of their old uniform styles. 
However, the designs varied widely in their accuracy: All the teams were 
informed that they would be wearing the Throwbacks during Week Three of 
the season. Some teams continued to wear theirs throughout the season. 
The San Francisco 49ers wore replicas of their 1955 uniforms in their Super 
Bowl XXIX victory. The uniforms were well-liked enough that the 49ers brought 
them back, in slightly modified form, for 1996–1997. In 1998, the gold 
pants from before were returned, in more modern form. In 2009, the team 
debuted an updated design of the 1980s uniforms that won them four of their 
five Super Bowls. Both of the NFL's New York City teams' throwbacks proved 
so popular with their fans that the teams returned to wearing them full-time 
soon afterwards: The Jets' replicas of their 1968 uniforms (with a darker 
shade of green than before), and the Giants' 1961 uniforms, with the lowercase 
"ny" instead of the underlined uppercase "GIANTS" – which was retained 
as a secondary logo – imposed after moving to East Rutherford, New Jersey. 
Both teams have modernized the 1960s decals for their current primary corporate 
logos. As a result of the NFL modifying its rules to allow teams to wear 
alternate jerseys in 2002, throwbacks still make occasional appearances. 
The Thanksgiving Day games hosted by the Detroit Lions and Dallas Cowboys 
have been a showcase of throwbacks in recent years. The Bills, San Diego 
Chargers and Cowboys traditionally wear their early 1960s throwbacks twice 
each season. Additionally, the Lions dropped their much criticized black 
alternates in favor of the popular 1940's and 1950s throwbacks (plain blue 
jersey, silver pants and helmets) in 2008. However; due to the NFL's regulations 
about player safety and helmets both teams have ceased wearing the throwback 
uniforms. The Lions in 2011 and Cowboys in 2013. The Cleveland Browns throwbacks 
are based on a uniform/helmet combination that first appeared in 1957 when 
Jim Brown was drafted. (Player numbers appeared on the side of the helmet 
that year.) The Browns began wearing their throwbacks in 2006 as part of 
the team's 60th Anniversary. They only wear them once per season. The Tampa 
Bay Buccaneers, who substantially changed their uniforms and team colors 
in 1997, never wore their orange throwbacks from 1997–2008. In 2009, the 
team wore their throwbacks for the first time in against the Packers on 
November 8 to debut the "Buccaneers' Ring of Honor." The club has continued 
to do so annually until 2014. The San Diego Chargers wore their 1960s style 
powder-blue uniforms with white helmets as alternates from 2002–2006 and 
in 2007 adopted a modified version as their full-time uniforms. Meanwhile, 
the San Francisco 49ers wore their 1980s-style home red uniforms as throwbacks 
in 2002 (in 2005 the team re-designated them as alternate uniforms to be 
worn 1-2 home games a season). The team also petitioned the league to wear 
the throwbacks on the 2007 season opening night, as a tribute to their 
late former head coach Bill Walsh. For the 2009 season, an updated design 
based heavily on the 1980s throwbacks was debuted by the 49ers, which was 
combined with the team's current modern logo. On September 16, 2007, the 
Pittsburgh Steelers, celebrating their 75th season, wore a variation of 
their older early '60s uniforms that featured gold helmets with black stripe, 
black jerseys with gold numbers and stripes, and white pants with black-and-gold 
side stripes as they hosted Buffalo. They wore them again on Monday Night 
Football on November 5 against Baltimore. The Steelers enjoyed immense 
success in both games, winning each handily (26-3 vs. Buffalo, 38-7 vs. 
Baltimore), in direct contrast to the team's struggles when they wore those 
jerseys originally. On November 11, 2007, The New York Giants, wore their 
red uniforms against the division rival Dallas Cowboys. Also in 2007, the 
New York Jets twice wore replicas of their New York Titans uniforms – once 
against the Philadelphia Eagles, and once against the Miami Dolphins. Since 
then, the Jets have worn the Titans uniforms several more times – twice 
in 2008, three times in 2009, and once in 2011. For two of the 2009 games, 
the Jets wore white versions, replicating the Titans road uniforms. The 
Eagles wore their powder blue and yellow throwback jerseys during the home 
game against the Lions on September 23, 2007. Though the Eagles had a big 
56-21 victory, these particular Throwbacks were criticised as being very 
unattractive. During Sunday Night Football on NBC that week, Keith Olbermann 
named the Philadelphia Eagles the "Worst Persons in the NFL" for their 
blue-and-yellow throwback jerseys, citing "Throwbacks? Try throw-ups!". 
The blue and yellow uniforms, which are the same colors as the flag of 
the City of Philadelphia, were used by the Eagles, and their predecessors, 
the defunct Frankford Yellowjackets franchise, until the 1940s when the 
more familiar pre-Jeffrey Lurie era kelly green was introduced. The kelly 
green throwbacks from the 1960 season were wore for the 2010 season opener 
vs. the Green Bay Packers to commemorate the 50th anniversary of when the 
Eagles beat the Packers to win the 1960 NFL Championship. For the 2009 
season, commemorating the 50th anniversary of the founding of the American 
Football League, the eight charter members of the AFL wore throwback uniforms 
from the early 1960s on select "Legacy Weekends." The Dallas Cowboys, also 
celebrating their 50th anniversary season, wore throwback jerseys for some 
games. The Packers, starting in 2010, introduced their 1929 throwback uniforms 
as their alternative uniform. Honoring the Packers first ever championship 
team in 1929, the uniform features a navy blue jersey with yellow numbers, 
with an added twist, as the uniforms in 1929 featured a small yellow circle 
in the front with a blue number in it. The circle and numbers were enlarged 
to meet current NFL uniform rules. Complimenting the rest of the uniform 
were tan pants, replicating the canvas uniform pants used during the 1920s. 
The team switched to their 1940s uniforms for the 2015 season, which removed 
the yellow circle but retained the color scheme. The NFL imposed a new 
rule for the 2013 season prohibiting the use of alternate colored helmets, 
eliminating many of the historically accurate throwback uniforms that had 
been in use up to that point. Teams are still allowed to use alternate 
decals (or no decals at all) for their throwbacks, but they must use them 
on the regular helmets.[3] The Texas Longhorns college football team wore 
throwback uniforms for a single game during their 2005 national championship 
season as a way of honoring the past. The throwback jerseys were similar 
to jerseys worn during their 1963 National Championship season under Coach 
Darrell K. Royal.[4][5][6] The University of Virginia football team wore 
throwback uniforms in a single game on September 6, 2008, in honor of Virginia's 
teams from 1984 through 1993. The university's athletic department termed 
the game a "Retro Game" instead of using the term "throwback."[7] The University 
of Virginia football team also wore throwback uniforms in a single game 
on September 29, 2012, in honor of Virginia's 1968 team and Frank Quayle.[8] 
The University of Florida football team wore throwback uniforms in a single 
game on September 30, 2006, in honor of Florida's teams in the 1960s.[9] 
For the 2009 and 2010 seasons, as part of Nike's Pro Combat program, several 
college football teams, including Ohio State and Oregon State wore throwback-inspired 
uniforms. In addition, for the 2009 playing of the "Holy War" rivalry against 
the University of Utah Utes (and also in the Las Vegas Bowl), the BYU Cougars 
donned royal blue throwback uniforms to commemorate the 25th anniversary 
of their 1984 National Championship season. These throwbacks, along with 
another alternate royal blue uniform, have been employed occasionally in 
subsequent seasons; since in 2014, they have been worn for the team's homecoming 
game each year.[10] The Kansas Jayhawks football team wore throwback uniforms 
on October 1, 2011 to honor the 50th anniversary of the 1961 KU football 
team, winners of the 1961 Bluebonnet Bowl, the program's first-ever bowl 
victory.[11] 'Retro shirts', as they are known in the United Kingdom, are 
also sometimes used in association football, albeit (as with the NFL) with 
modern fabrics. In 2005–06 Arsenal changed their home colours from their 
traditional red and white to a variant of maroon known as redcurrant as 
a commemoration of their final season at Highbury Stadium; this colour 
was the same shade the team had worn when they had moved to Highbury in 
1913.[12] Redcurrant still played a part in their kits since; most recently 
on their yellow third shirt featuring redcurrant pinstripes, between 2009 
and 2012. Manchester United wore several retro-style kits in the 1990s 
and 2000s, based on kits the worn by the club in the 1950s and '60s, as 
well as that worn by their first ever team, known then as Newton Heath. 
The Newton Heath-inspired kit was introduced for their centenary in 1992 
and worn for two seasons as a third kit.[13] They wore a replica of their 
jersey from 1958 during the Manchester derby against Manchester City on 
February 10, 2008 at Old Trafford to mark the 50th anniversary of the Munich 
air disaster four days earlier. United were granted special dispensation 
by the Premier League to wear the one-off uniform which was devoid of logos 
and kit markings, and used the traditional "one to eleven" numbering scheme 
rather than using squad numbers.[14] In a gesture of solidarity, Manchester 
City similarly removed the sponsor and manufacturer logos from their kits 
for the game, giving their shirts the same clean and empty look resembling 
the plain shirts of the 1950s when logos and team badges were not worn. 
However, they used the current season's kit style and chose not to go the 
whole distance in producing a retro-looking kit; retaining the club crest, 
and the player name and squad number on the back of the shirts but added 
a black ribbon above the right breast.[15] The previous season, 2006–07, 
United introduced a similar 1950s-style uniform to celebrate 50 years of 
the Busby Babes' first league championship.[16] After their Champions League 
victory in 2008, United introduced another retro-style kit for 2008–09, 
celebrating the 40th anniversary of their first European Cup win. The club 
unveiled an all-blue third kit, based on the one worn against Benfica in 
the 1968 final.[17] More authentic reproductions of kits from the past 
have become popular fashion items, especially jerseys linked to successful 
or memorable teams. When France won the 1998 World Cup, their uniform was 
reminiscent of the design of the 1984 team with a red horizontal stripe 
and three thin horizontal stripes across the chest. When the United States 
men's soccer team took the field between 1999 and 2001, their plain white 
uniform with a thick V-neck collar looked reminiscent of the U.S. Soccer 
Federation's first uniform worn in 1916. For the FIFA Centenary Match in 
2004, France and Brazil played in kits resembling their first ever home 
kits. The Brazilian team wore white tops with blue trim, the original colours 
of their home kit, which was replaced in 1951 by today's yellow top with 
green trim after the 1950 World Cup defeat.[18] For the 2009–10 Premier 
League, newly promoted Burnley wore a redesigned version of their 1959–60 
Football League kits, when they last won the then-First Division. Southampton 
celebrated the club's 125th anniversary in 2010–11, by wearing the strip 
worn by the team's original forebears, which consisted of a white shirt 
with a red sash, white shorts and black socks. During the later stages 
of the 2011–12 season, financially-troubled Scottish club Rangers wore 
their normal blue shirts on the pitch, but began selling and encouraging 
fans to wear throwback red and black striped scarves, the traditional colours 
of the burgh of Govan (where Ibrox Stadium is located) in an attempt to 
raise money. The club would be placed in administration, face liquidation 
and then sold to a new ownership group, with a severe relegation penalty 
for the 2012–13 season. English club West Bromwich Albion wore a replica 
of their 1968 FA Cup Final kit, in their Premier League game against Leicester 
City on 11 April 2015.[19] It was worn to honour the match-winning goalscorer 
in the 1968 Cup Final, Jeff Astle, who died in 2002 due to chronic traumatic 
encephalopathy as a result of heading the heavy leather footballs through 
his career. The kit used the 1–11 numbering system save for the goalkeeper's 
shirt, which was left blank as they were in those days. 2014–15 Scottish 
Championship winners Heart of Midlothian F.C. chose for their current season 
a replica of the shirt worn by the team 100 years ago, for the 1914–15 
season. The shirt is plain maroon with a white collar and fly-button opening 
and has no sponsorship logos. Though the 1914–15 shirt bore no badge, the 
current shirt has an embroidered badge in the style of the club's logo 
of one hundred years ago. The shirt and badge also commemorate Hearts first 
and reserve teams, management and fans who, though currently topping the 
Scottish league, volunteered for the Great War effort en-masse in November 
1914 to join a newly forming wartime volunteer infantry battalion, 16th 
Battalion Royal Scots, commanded by George McCrae (politician) MP. Spurred 
on by Hearts, "McCrae’ s Battalion" also attracted players and supporters 
from other Scottish teams plus various sportsmen. The first football team 
to join up, Hearts and "McCrae's Battalion" were mentioned in thanks by 
Winston Churchill in Parliament and proved a catalyst in the formation 
of other football and sportsmen battalions of Kitchener's Army. Heart of 
Midlothian lost 7 players killed in the war, plus others maimed or gassed 
and unable to resume their careers after the war. Throwback uniforms, more 
commonly called heritage guernseys, are worn occasionally by clubs in the 
Australian Football League, mostly to commemorate the anniversaries of 
past successes or events. Between 2003 and 2007, there was an annual "Heritage 
Round", in which all clubs were encouraged to wear heritage guernseys from 
either their club or state. The heritage guernsey of the Port Adelaide 
Football Club has been a regular source of controversy. The primary historical 
guernsey of the Port Adelaide Football Club, when it dominated national 
football the years before World War I and the South Australian National 
Football League for the 19th century, was black with a white "prison bars" 
design; however, when the club entered the Australia Football League in 
1997, it was forced to change its colours to avoid a clash with the Collingwood 
Football Club, who wore black and white in a different design. Whether 
or not Port Adelaide is permitted to wear its black and white guernsey 
in any heritage matches, even those not played against Collingwood, has 
been a point of contention between the clubs. The most recent instance 
of the club wearing the guernsey was during the Elimination Final of the 
2014 AFL season. In 1990, the Chicago White Sox wore replicas of their 
1917 World Series uniforms against the Milwaukee Brewers as part of the 
White Sox celebration of the final season at Comiskey Park. During the 
game, the scoreboard and public address system were turned off, and the 
lineups announced with a hand-held megaphone.[21] Since then, these games 
have proven popular not only among team fans but also with viewers of TV 
highlight shows. ESPN, for the highlights of the 1990 game, sped up the 
highlights and showed them in black and white. The team then adopted a 
modified version of the 1959 "Go-Go Sox" era jerseys for the first year 
at the new Comiskey Park in 1991, having kept that design since and winning 
the 2005 World Series in that design, ending an 88-year World Series championship 
drought. With the introduction of Interleague Play, when the Atlanta Braves 
played the Boston Red Sox for the first time in a regular season game in 
Boston in 1997, the teams wore uniforms that traced back to the initial 
season in which each team adopted the current nickname, the Braves wearing 
road uniforms from the 1912 season with the word 'BOSTON' and the Red Sox 
wearing 1908 uniforms with a large red sock with the word 'BOSTON' in white 
on the sock. It was the Braves' first official game against the Red Sox 
since the team moved to Milwaukee after the 1952 season. Braves manager 
Bobby Cox went on record as being firmly against his team being identified 
as 'Boston' by their uniforms. Some throwback nights featured the Oakland 
Athletics wearing one combo or another of the gold/white/green uniform 
set it featured in the 1970s and 1980s, or the Pittsburgh Pirates' black-and-gold 
combo from the same era – on June 26, 2010, they did so against one another, 
with Pittsburgh in black and Oakland in gold. In 2003 the St. Louis Cardinals 
hosted the Baltimore Orioles with teams wearing retro St. Louis Cardinals 
and St. Louis Browns (the predecessor to today's Orioles, which moved to 
Baltimore for 1954) uniforms, respectively. The scoreboard that day said 
"Browns" and the stadium announcer played along with the fantasy as well.[22] 
Also in 2003, in commemoration of the 100th anniversary of the first modern 
World Series, the two participants in that game (the Boston Red Sox and 
the Pittsburgh Pirates) met in a 3-game Interleague series at PNC Park 
in Pittsburgh. While the Red Sox took two of three of those games with 
both teams wearing their standard uniforms, the one the Pirates won was 
meant to replicate their matchup in the 1903 World Series with both teams 
wearing 1903-era throwbacks. Although baseball teams did not have uniform 
numbers at the time, to keep with the current rules numbers were put on 
the backs of the otherwise-accurate throwbacks. The JumboTron screen was 
left with a static background, and the scoreboard had the different team 
names at the time: the "Boston Americans" and the "Pittsburg Pirates". 
The stadium crew at PNC Park also did other 1903-era activities such as 
using a megaphone for announcements. In 2006 the New York Mets, in honor 
of the 20th anniversary of the 1986 World Series, held a "turn-back-the-clock-night" 
and wore their 1986 uniforms. In 2009 the Mets played three games of a 
four-game set against the San Francisco Giants in a "fauxback" jersey based 
on early 20th century New York Giants' jerseys with a giant "NY" on the 
chest, but using the Mets' current team colors of orange and blue. (The 
Mets are the only team to have worn a throwback from their home city's 
past instead of their franchise's past; while the Minnesota Twins and Texas 
Rangers, both of whom were once the Washington Senators, have each used 
throwbacks from their previous hometown, the city's current team, the Washington 
Nationals, have worn both Twin-Senators and Ranger-Senators throwbacks 
as well.) In 2008, the Philadelphia Phillies adopted an alternate uniform 
based on their 1948 uniforms, but with modern graphics on an off-white 
color background. Not all throwbacks use Major League uniforms; at least 
15 MLB teams have at some point paid tribute to the pre-integration Negro 
Leagues by wearing the uniform of a Negro League from the city's past; 
in almost every case both teams do so simultaneously. Since the Homestead 
Grays played "home" games in both Washington and Pittsburgh, the team has 
been honored as such by both the Nationals and Pirates; in 2008 the two 
teams did so together, with Washington wearing the Grays' home uniforms 
and Pittsburgh the away ones. The Tampa Bay Rays have staged a "Turn Back 
the Clock" promotion with a retro theme and throwback uniforms almost every 
season of their existence. Because the franchise does not yet have a long 
history from which to choose uniforms, they have often worn the uniforms 
of historical local teams such as the Tampa Tarpons of the Florida State 
League (worn in 1999, 2006, and 2010), the St. Petersburg Pelicans of the 
Senior Professional Baseball Association (worn in 2008), the St. Petersburg 
Saints (2007) and Tampa Smokers (2011) of the Florida International League, 
and the University of Tampa Spartans (2000). The Rays have worn their own 
uniforms for Turn Back the Clock night only once: in 2009, when they wore 
Devil Rays "rainbow" uniforms from their 1998 inaugural season.[23] Usually, 
the Rays' opponent on Turn Back the Clock night wear throwbacks of their 
own from the same era as the Rays' retro uniforms. For example, the Houston 
Astros wore their 1980s "Rainbow Guts" uniforms, the Dodgers wore the 1955 
road uniforms of the Brooklyn Dodgers, the Mets wore the road unis of their 
1969 championship team, and the Orioles wore their rare all-orange uniforms 
from the early 1970s. The San Diego Padres have also worn multiple throwback 
uniforms. Pre-1969 designs have represented the Padres of the Pacific Coast 
League. During the 2010 season, throwback uniforms were worn during all 
Thursday home day games. Multiple designs and color schemes were used, 
including the 1969 "first major league season" brown and gold, 1984 "first 
World Series" white with gold lettering and brown trim (and "RAK" on the 
sleeves for then-recently deceased owner Ray A. Kroc), and a 1990s era 
white with orange-trimmed blue lettering (while these were the accurate 
Padres jersey of the period, the design is also very similar to that of 
the New York Mets, as the owners of the team at the time were investors 
from New York). All of these were fairly accurate representations of the 
team's uniforms and colors of the period, and in most games the visiting 
team wore throwback uniforms of a similar period. For example, at the final 
home game on September 30, the visiting Chicago Cubs and the Padres both 
wore 1984-era jerseys, in tribute to the 1984 NLCS, in which the same two 
teams played against each other. In recent years, the Milwaukee Brewers 
have resurrected their old 1980s pinstriped uniforms with the old ball-in-glove 
"MB" logo on the caps for use as an alternate uniform. In 2008, the Toronto 
Blue Jays unveiled their new "Flashback Friday" powder blue throwback uniforms, 
similar to those worn between the 1977 and 1979 seasons. The Cleveland 
Indians throwbacks are usually worn once a year in July and normally are 
based on their uniforms from the mid-1970s to the early 1980s. (Most notably, 
their 1974 "All Red" Home Uniforms.) They have also worn uniforms based 
on the 1948 Indians in honor of Larry Doby who was the first African-American 
player in the American League with the Indians. The 2011 Arizona Diamondbacks 
celebrated the tenth anniversary of their 2001 World Series championship 
on September 9–11. To commemorate the event the Diamondbacks held a reunion 
of players who had been on the championship team. They also wore the purple, 
teal, and copper uniforms that the team wore from 1998–2006. To celebrate 
the 100th anniversary of Fenway Park, the New York Yankees and Boston Red 
Sox wore 1912 throwbacks during a regular-season game on April 20, 2012; 
the Yankees' 1912 uniforms were a nod to their days as the New York Highlanders. 
In the 1999 season, MLB held a series of "Turn Ahead the Clock" nights. 
It was inspired by an independently-held promotion on July 18, 1998 at 
a game between the Seattle Mariners and the Kansas City Royals. During 
those nights, teams wore uniforms envisioned as they might be in the year 
2021. Twenty-two teams ultimately participated over 13 different games 
in 1999, with some teams wearing the uniforms more than once. The promotion 
proved unpopular, and has yet to be repeated since.[24] In 2016, to celebrate 
the 30th anniversary of their 1986 world championship season, the New York 
Mets revived their 1986 uniforms to be used for all Sunday home games. 
In 1921 a baseball game held at Rickwood Field as part of the Semicentennial 
of Birmingham, Alabama was played in "old-style" uniforms and according 
to "the rules of the games as they were in 1872.".[25] Since 1996 Rickwood 
Field has been the site of the annual "Rickwood Classic", a regular season 
Birmingham Barons game in which both Southern League teams wear uniforms 
honoring some period of their respective histories. The Lotte Giants of 
the Korea Baseball Organization has "Again 1984/1992" day once per month 
in commemoration of their league titles from those respective years. The 
team dresses in their old baby blue jerseys as well as their old cap, complete 
with the old logo. The "Again 1984/1992" games are usually the most popular 
games of the year in Busan, with the stadium as well as the throwback merchandising 
usually selling out fast. Due to this success, starting in 2008, other 
teams in the league such as Doosan Bears and Samsung Lions have started 
to incorporate a similar style of throwback day as well. The Buffalo Bisons 
of the International League adopted a throwback uniform as their main jersey 
in 2012 as part of their change in parent club affiliation to the Toronto 
Blue Jays. In the 1996–97 NBA season, the NBA celebrated its 50th anniversary 
by introducing throwback jerseys, known as "Hardwood Classics". The Toronto 
Raptors were notable for wearing the uniforms of the long-defunct Toronto 
Huskies, an original BAA team. The Raptors have since brought back this 
tradition on certain occasions, notably games against the New York Knicks. 
The Chicago Bulls wore script-logo throwbacks from the beginning of Michael 
Jordan's career. Some of the throwbacks that were introduced in this season 
have been brought back on more occasions since, notably the Golden State 
Warriors, whose throwback placed the players' numbers inside an angled 
cable car (a reference to San Francisco, where they had played in the early 
years in California). In more recent years, throwback jerseys in the NBA 
have recalled some of the more gaudy uniforms of the NBA and the ABA, ranging 
from the aforementioned Warriors uniforms, to the Detroit Pistons' lightning 
bolt uniforms of the Dick Vitale era of the late 1970s, to the Miami Floridians 
throwbacks worn by the Heat, and the Cleveland Cavaliers' 1980s era jerseys 
worn by Brad Daugherty, Mark Price, and Ron Harper as well as uniforms 
based on the early and mid-1970s. In contrast, the New York Knicks often 
wear throwback uniforms from the 1970s and 1980s that are understated by 
comparison. The warmups and uniform shorts of that era feature an "interlocking 
NY" identical to the one worn by the New York Yankees on their caps and 
home jerseys. Most "Hardwood Classics" jerseys worn by current players 
for games, however, are based on modern fabrics, and not the classic fabric 
designs of the past. The Los Angeles Lakers wore throwback short-shorts 
in 2007 for one game. Kobe Bryant complained, saying, "I feel violated. 
I feel naked. It's one thing to see those old guys wearing them on film, 
it's another to actually wear them". The Philadelphia 76ers began wearing 
throwback jerseys from their championship season of 1982–83 in 2007–08 
to honor the 25th anniversary of their championship. They were so popular 
that the Sixers kept these jerseys for next year, and reverted to their 
old logo (modified with a newer "6") for the 2009–10 season. The Orlando 
Magic are notable for wearing the same throwback design at least twice; 
their black pinstriped throwback was used in 2003–04, 2006–07 and 2009–10 
seasons. They also wore the blue pinstriped throwbacks in 2004–05 and the 
white pinstriped throwbacks in 2005–06. The then-New Orleans Hornets, Charlotte 
Bobcats, Los Angeles Clippers, Minnesota Timberwolves and Memphis Grizzlies 
were also notable for wearing throwbacks of long-forgotten American Basketball 
Association franchises New Orleans Buccaneers, Carolina Cougars, Los Angeles 
Stars, Minnesota Muskies and Memphis Tams/Pros. The San Antonio Spurs also 
paid tribute to their predecessors Dallas Chaparrals, while the Bulls and 
the Washington Wizards did the same to a pair of former Chicago-based NBA 
franchises, the Stags and Zephyrs. The usage of throwback uniforms even 
inspired some NBA teams to acquire elements used from old uniform designs 
in creating new ones. For example, the Detroit Pistons, Milwaukee Bucks, 
Cleveland Cavaliers and Golden State Warriors reverted to their original 
color schemes while adding some accent colors to create a more modern look, 
while the Magic and the Charlotte Bobcats revived the use of pinstripes 
on their uniforms. The Dallas Mavericks briefly used a third jersey with 
the green, blue and white color scheme of the 1980s. The Houston Rockets 
revived the classic red and gold scheme in unveiling their new alternate 
uniform in 2009. The Utah Jazz are re-using their classic "J" note logo 
and a similar (though not the same) color scheme, and also plan to adopt 
a similar uniform design to what they originally wore from 1974–96. The 
Washington Wizards also went retro, with secondary logos inspired from 
the old Bullets logos and the modernized "Stars and Stripes" uniform worn 
from 1974 through 1987. The New York Knicks eliminated black from their 
color scheme and unveiled a modern adaptation of their 1970–75 uniforms, 
sans the shorts' side stripes, addition of silver trim, and a bolder, less 
arched "NEW YORK" script. The Sacramento Kings have used their classic 
Kansas City-era script to their gold and then black alternate uniforms. 
The Denver Nuggets revived the 'rainbow' uniforms from the 1980s as an 
alternate uniform, this time with the current colors and typeface, while 
the Oklahoma City Thunder wore alternate uniforms with a vertically-arranged 
front script similar to those worn by the Oscar Robertson-era Cincinnati 
Royals. The Phoenix Suns paid tribute to the 1990s by unveiling new uniforms 
featuring a modified streaking sun. In 2003, the Kansas State Wildcats 
men's basketball team wore throwback jerseys in home games against Kansas 
and Missouri to celebrate the program's 100th anniversary season. The jerseys 
were lavender with black letters and numerals, similar to the uniforms 
worn by Jack Hartman's teams in the 1970s and 1980s, during some of KSU's 
best seasons. The Kansas Jayhawks basketball team wore throwbacks in March 
2005 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Allen Fieldhouse. In February 
2008 and February 2013, they wore throwbacks for the 20th and 25th anniversaries, 
respectively, of the 1988 NCAA championship team, and did so again in February 
2012 to honor the 1952 NCAA championship team's 60th anniversary. The Philadelphia 
Wings indoor lacrosse team ditched their silver, red, and black uniforms 
for a game to wear their original orange and white jerseys worn in the 
early 1970s from the original National Lacrosse League. For the 100th anniversary 
of the rivalry between Johns Hopkins and Maryland in men's lacrosse, both 
teams wore special retro jerseys.[26] During the 35th anniversary of women's 
field hockey at Dartmouth College, the Big Green are wearing a special 
harlequin-design throwback uniform. The first documented use of a throwback 
uniform came during the 1998 season, when the Calgary Stampeders wore 1948 
red striped jerseys to celebrate the first Grey Cup championship won by 
the Stampeders franchise. The jerseys were worn on October 4, 1998 against 
the BC Lions.[27] The BC Lions were the next to wear throwback jerseys 
in 2003, as they were celebrating their 50th season with orange replica 
jerseys from the 1954 BC Lions season. Those jerseys were worn four times 
that season with the first being the home opener that year.[28] In both 
cases, neither uniform was accurate as the jerseys were paired with pants 
and helmets from both teams' present day sets. In 2007, the Saskatchewan 
Roughriders wore green replica jerseys from the late 1960s to 1970s with 
double white striping over the shoulders. As opposed to the single season 
usage the Stampeders and Lions employed, the Roughriders wore these jerseys 
from 2007 to 2013, including their usage in the 97th and 98th Grey Cup. 
It wasn't until the 2008 CFL season that the league started to truly embrace 
throwback uniforms when they announced that the Winnipeg Blue Bombers and 
Toronto Argonauts would play two games (September 12 in Toronto and October 
10 in Winnipeg) to celebrate and recognize the 1950s and in particular, 
the 1950 Mud Bowl Grey Cup game.[29] Both teams wore coloured jerseys, 
as was common during the 1950s. Toronto's jerseys were a light blue in 
colour, with dark blue striping on the sleeves and the team's old "Pull 
Together" football-as-a-ship logo on the shoulders. The Blue Bombers' jerseys 
were dark blue in colour, with gold sleeve stripes. The team's 1950s-era 
logo was on the front of the jersey, just below the V in the neck. A special 
CFL "Retro Week" logo adorned each jersey as well, that logo being a take-off 
of the maple leaf one used as the league symbol from 1954 through 1969. 
For the 2009 CFL season, all eight teams wore retro uniforms, this time 
based on uniforms from the 1960s.[30] Week 3 of the 2009 season featured 
all teams wearing their retro uniforms. When revealed at the time, four 
teams had white retro jerseys and four had coloured retro jerseys. As the 
season progressed, Saskatchewan added a green 1960s jersey for the Labour 
Day Classic and Calgary wore a white 1960s jersey for the Labour Day rematch 
versus Edmonton. 11 games were scheduled during the season to feature both 
teams wearing these uniforms while more were added later on. In 2010, all 
eight teams again wore retro uniforms and for this season it was based 
on uniforms worn from the 1970s.[31] Teams wore retro uniforms during weeks 
6 and 7, however, contrary to the previous year, only the Saskatchewan 
Roughriders wore white throwback uniforms, meaning most teams wore their 
regular white uniforms as the away team.[32] The Roughriders wore their 
regular 1970s throwback jersey during retro games they hosted. Additionally, 
during this season, the Roughriders were celebrating their 100th anniversary 
as a franchise and wore black, red, and silver throwback uniforms similar 
to the ones worn by the Regina Roughriders from 1912 to 1947. These uniforms 
were worn on July 17, 2010.[33] While the league had originally planned 
to celebrate with retro uniforms each season leading up to the 100th Grey 
Cup, the CFL did not introduce 1980s-themed uniforms for the 2011 CFL season.[29] 
Some teams (Calgary, Saskatchewan, Toronto, and Winnipeg) continued wearing 
the previous year's retro uniforms while the rest wore no throwback uniforms 
at all. In 2012, all teams remodeled their full uniform set with only Saskatchewan 
and Winnipeg carrying over their 1970s throwback uniforms. In 2013, the 
Toronto Argonauts wore 1980s throwback uniforms on August 23, 2013 to celebrate 
the 30th anniversary of the 71st Grey Cup championship.[34] Also that year, 
the Hamilton Tiger-Cats wore red, black, and white replicas of the 1943 
Hamilton Flying Wildcats to celebrate the 70th anniversary of their 31st 
Grey Cup victory.[35] In both cases, the uniforms from these games were 
worn only once. The Winnipeg Blue Bombers wore 1980s-themed uniforms from 
2013 to 2015 before switching full-time to similar royal blue jerseys in 
2016. The Roughriders introduced new throwback uniforms based on the uniforms 
from the early 1980s in 2014 and wore them again in 2015. The franchise 
introduced another green retro-styled jersey in 2016, but due to lack of 
numbers on the shoulders, were never actually worn before in their history. 
As of the 2015 CFL season, the Saskatchewan Roughriders, Winnipeg Blue 
Bombers, and Toronto Argonauts have worn throwback uniforms representing 
four different decades, which is the most in the league. The Roughriders 
have worn six different throwback jerseys, including two white jerseys, 
which is also the most in the league. No Ottawa franchise (Ottawa Rough 
Riders, Ottawa Renegades, and Ottawa Redblacks) has ever worn a throwback 
uniform, presumably due to their checkered absences from the league over 
the past 20 years. In February 2005 at Eden Park, Auckland, Australia and 
New Zealand contested the very first Twenty20 cricket international match. 
Both teams appeared in retro 1980s style tight fitting one day international 
uniforms without team names, numbers or sponsors logos. The Australians 
wore their original "yellow and gold" whilst New Zealand were in "beige" 
inspired by the Beige Brigade sports fans. The game was played in a light 
hearted manner with both teams sporting 1980s style head bands, moustaches 
and hairstyles.[36] When Lance Armstrong won his fifth Tour de France championship, 
in 2003, his U.S. Postal Service-sponsored team wore a special jersey sporting 
the old U.S. Mail logo from the 1970s for the final day of the race. This 
was not technically a throwback jersey, as the team itself did not exist 
in that era, and had only been affiliated with USPS since 1998. Throwbacks 
were first introduced in the National Hockey League in their 75th anniversary 
season of 1991–92. At the time, only the Original Six teams wore throwbacks, 
although they were also used in the All-Star game. While the NHL had long 
since replaced the heavy wool sweaters with more modern air-knit jerseys, 
the patterns for the 75th anniversary throwbacks were consistent with the 
original versions, with a few exceptions (as noted below). Player surnames 
were worn on the back of the throwback jerseys, even though this was not 
originally the case (the NHL did not require names on the jerseys until 
1977). The Original Six teams' throwbacks included the following modifications: 
As other leagues began using throwbacks, interest in retro jerseys increased 
within the NHL. To celebrate new ownership, the New York Islanders wore 
a modified throwback design for one game in 1998. The Buffalo Sabres pulled 
a similar stunt for a game in 2003. The Toronto Maple Leafs also brought 
back a 1960s-era jersey as a third jersey beginning in 1998–99. In 2003–04, 
the NHL implemented a Vintage program, allowing several teams to wear throwback 
uniforms that were specially branded with a vintage "V" patch. The following 
teams were among those that participated in the program: A few teams also 
introduced "fauxback" uniform (a term that was coined by Paul Lukas, the 
creator of the Uni Watch column and blog, for a uniform design not worn 
in the past, but given the appearance of decades-old vintage) designs as 
alternate jerseys. The Colorado Avalanche introduced burgundy third jerseys 
similar in design to the New York Rangers' blue ones, while the Minnesota 
Wild introduced a red alternate featuring a logo encased in a circle containing 
the team's name, a feature previously used by the Blackhawks and Pittsburgh 
Penguins. The 2004 National Hockey League All-Star Game also featured faux 
throwback designs. The Sabres introduced a "fauxback" jersey designed as 
an homage to its American Hockey League predecessor, the Bisons, in 2010 
and wore it as their third jersey until 2012. The Bruins, Canadiens, Maple 
Leafs, and Canucks used their throwbacks through 2006–07. The Buffalo Sabres 
also wore a throwback blue-and-gold jersey for one season, bringing it 
back again in 2008–09, and making it their 2009–10 home sweater. Although 
third jerseys were temporarily discontinued for 2007–08 so that teams could 
get used to the new Rbk Edge uniforms (third jerseys returned for the 2008–09 
season), Boston and Vancouver have adopted new uniforms that are based 
on their throwback designs. On January 1, 2008, the Sabres and the Penguins 
donned throwback uniforms in the AMP Energy NHL Winter Classic at Ralph 
Wilson Stadium in Orchard Park, New York, albeit with Reebok's "Edge" design 
template. The Penguins also used the throwbacks as their third jersey for 
the 2008–09 season. And as mentioned earlier, at the 2009 NHL Winter Classic, 
the Blackhawks and the Red Wings wore throwback replicas at Wrigley Field 
and the Flyers and Bruins donned retro schemes at Fenway Park in 2010. 
For the 2011 game, the Penguins (1967–68) and their opposition, the Washington 
Capitals (1974–75) are expected to wear their first season replicates. 
In recent years, CCM, now owned by Reebok, has made additional replica 
throwbacks available for sale, in addition to those in current use. 1992 
throwbacks such as Detroit's and Chicago's were among those reissued, while 
others included older-era jerseys of current NHL teams the Phoenix Coyotes, 
the Colorado Avalanche, the Dallas Stars, the Carolina Hurricanes and the 
New Jersey Devils when they had played in their former markets of (Winnipeg, 
Quebec City, Bloomington, Minnesota, Hartford and Denver). The much-maligned 
"Flying-V" uniforms of the Vancouver Canucks were also reissued. The Winnipeg 
jerseys were particularly popular and were seen throughout Winnipeg after 
it became clear that a new Winnipeg Jets franchise would be established 
in 2011; Jets jerseys were prevalent at the 2011 NHL Draft, where the new
