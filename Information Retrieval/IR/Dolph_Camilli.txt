Adolph Louis Camilli (April 23, 1907 – October 21, 1997) was an American 
first baseman in Major League Baseball who spent most of his career with 
the Philadelphia Phillies and Brooklyn Dodgers. He was named the National 
League's Most Valuable Player in 1941 after leading the league in home 
runs and runs batted in as the Dodgers won the pennant for the first time 
since 1920. He was the ninth NL player to hit 200 career home runs, and 
held the Dodgers franchise record for career home runs from 1942 to 1953. 
His son Doug was a major leaguer catcher in the 1960s.[1] His brother, 
who boxed under the name Frankie Campbell, died of cerebral hemorrhaging 
following a 1930 match with Max Baer. Born and raised in San Francisco, 
California attending Sacred Heart Cathedral Preparatory, Camilli had an 
eight-year minor league career before making his major league debut with 
the Chicago Cubs at the end of the 1933 season. He was traded to the Phillies 
in June 1934, and in each year from 1935 to 1937 he hit 25 or more home 
runs, batting a career-high .339 and leading the NL in on-base percentage 
in the last season. But he also had a free-swinging style that led to numerous 
strikeouts; in his 1934 rookie season, he tied Hack Wilson's modern NL 
record of 94 strikeouts, and in 1935 he set a new league mark with 113. 
In March 1938, Camilli was traded to the Dodgers in a move that new general 
manager Larry MacPhail hoped would spark a change in the team's image from 
lovable losers to solid contenders. He drove in 100 or more runs in four 
of the next five seasons, being named an All-Star in 1939 and 1941 and 
becoming team captain. He also led the NL in walks in 1938 and 1939, but 
in the latter year became the first player to have three 100-strikeout 
seasons. In his MVP season of 1941, he again led the league with 115 strikeouts 
and also surpassed Rabbit Maranville's NL career record of 756. He also 
set career-highs in home runs (34) and RBI (120), leading the league in 
both categories. In the 1941 World Series, he batted just .167 with only 
1 RBI as the Dodgers lost to the New York Yankees in five games. In 1942, 
he finished second in the NL in home runs and RBI. That year, he also broke 
Zack Wheat's club record of 131 career home runs (Gil Hodges surpassed 
his final total of 139 in 1953, and Duke Snider broke his mark for left-handed 
batters later the same year). In July 1943 Camilli was traded to the New 
York Giants, but he refused to report to the Dodgers' hated rivals;[1] 
instead, he managed the Oakland Oaks of the Pacific Coast League in 1944–45 
before joining the Boston Red Sox in mid-1945, batting .212 with two home 
runs in his last season. In a 12-season career, Camilli posted a .277 batting 
average with 239 home runs and 950 RBI in 1490 games played. After leading 
the NL in errors in both 1934 and 1935, setting a record with three errors 
in one 1935 inning, he improved his defense and later led the NL in assists 
and fielding percentage once each. He also ended his career with 961 strikeouts, 
more than any player except Babe Ruth (1330) and Jimmie Foxx (1311); his 
NL record of 923 was broken by Gil Hodges in 1958. Among his career highlights 
was recording the last out of Ruth's career. Following his playing career, 
Camilli returned to the Pacific Coast League and managed the Oaks and Sacramento 
Solons, as well as several other minor league teams, winning a pennant 
with Spokane in 1948. He later was a scout for the Yankees and California 
Angels before finishing his baseball career as a spring training instructor 
for the Angels. Camilli was inducted into the Dodgers Hall of Fame in 1984, 
and recalled of his fans: "All they cared about was their family, their 
job and the Dodgers. And I don't know which one was the most important." 
In an article in 1976 in Esquire magazine, sportswriter Harry Stein published 
an "All Time All-Star Argument Starter", consisting of five ethnic baseball 
teams. Camilli was the first baseman on Stein's Italian team. Camilli died
