Richard John "Dick" McAuliffe (November 29, 1939 – May 13, 2016) was an 
American professional baseball player. He played in Major League Baseball 
as a shortstop and second baseman for the Detroit Tigers from 1960 to 1973 
and for the Boston Red Sox from 1974 to 1975.[1] He was a part of the Tigers' 
1968 World Series championship, and was known for his unusual batting stance. 
A left-handed hitter, he held his hands very high with an open stance that 
faced the pitcher. As the pitcher delivered to home plate, McAuliffe moved 
his forward (right) foot to a more conventional position for his swing.[2] 
Born in Hartford, Connecticut,[3] McAuliffe graduated from Farmington High 
School in Farmington, Connecticut, where he was coached by Leo Pinsky and 
won the state championship in 1957.[2] McAuliffe signed with the Detroit 
Tigers as an amateur free agent out of high school and spent three seasons 
in the Tigers' farm system.[4] In 1960, he led the Southern League in runs 
(109), triples (21), and shortstop assists (430) while playing for the 
Knoxville Smokies.[2] He was called up to the big leagues at the end of 
the 1960 season and made his major league debut on September 17, 1960.[5] 
In the 1961 and 1962 seasons, McAuliffe shifted between shortstop and second 
base before replacing Chico Fernandez as the Tigers starting shortstop 
from 1963–1966. Known for his wide-open batting stance and leg kick, McAuliffe 
never hit higher than .264 but was a significant contributor to the Tigers' 
offensive output in the 1960s. In 1965, he was the American League's starting 
shortstop in the All Star game, and he went 2-for-3 with a home run and 
2 RBIs.[6] In 1966, he finished the season ranked fourth in the league 
with a .373 on-base percentage and, fifth in the league with a .509 slugging 
percentage.[7] After making the American League All Star team in 1965 and 
1966 at shortstop,[8] McAuliffe agreed to move to second base in 1967 to 
make room for Ray Oyler to take over at shortstop. Even with the move, 
McAuliffe was selected for his third consecutive All Star team in 1967.[9] 
In 1967, McAuliffe was among the American League leaders in walks with 
105 (3rd), 245 times on base (3rd), 7 triples (3rd), 92 runs (5th), 118 
strikeouts (5th), 22 home runs (8th), and a .364 on-base percentage (9th).[10] 
In the Tigers' 1968 World Championship season, McAuliffe played a key role.[11] 
He had a .344 on-base percentage, led the American League with 95 runs 
scored, and showed power with 50 extra base hits.[3][12] He also tied a 
major league record by going the entire 1968 season without grounding into 
a double play and is the only American League player who has done so.[13] 
McAuliffe also improved defensively in 1968, reducing his error total from 
28 in 1967 to nine in 1968 and, finished second among American League second 
basemen in fielding percentage.[2][14] He finished seventh in the 1968 
American League Most Valuable Player Award voting, behind teammates Denny 
McLain, Bill Freehan, and Willie Horton.[15] On August 22, 1968, McAuliffe 
was involved in a brawl with Chicago White Sox pitcher Tommy John.[2][16] 
After one pitch barely missed McAuliffe's head, and another was thrown 
behind him, McAuliffe charged the mound, drove his knee into John's shoulder 
and separated it.[2] John was out for the season, and McAuliffe was suspended 
for five games.[2] Interviewed 30 years later, McAuliffe was still convinced 
John was throwing at his head: "The first pitch at me was right at my head, 
and I mean right at my head. The catcher never laid any leather on it, 
and it hit the backstop. The next pitch, he spun me down, threw it behind 
me."[2] In the 1968 World Series, McAuliffe played all seven games at second 
base, scored 5 runs, and had 6 hits, 4 walks, 3 RBIs, and a home run.[17] 
His steadying influence in the middle infield helped make it possible for 
manager Mayo Smith to take the radical step of playing center fielder Mickey 
Stanley at shortstop in the World Series in order to get a better bat in 
the lineup against the St. Louis Cardinals, led by Bob Gibson.[18][19] 
McAuliffe continued as the Tigers' starting second baseman through the 
1973 season. In October 1973, the Tigers traded him to the Boston Red Sox 
for Ben Oglivie.[20] McAuliffe hit only .210 in 100 games for the Red Sox 
in 1974.[3] He began 1975 as the manager of Boston's Double-A farm team, 
the Bristol Red Sox, located in McAuliffe's native state of Connecticut.[21] 
He guided Bristol into first place in the Eastern League, but was recalled 
to Boston in August to resume his playing career as a utility infielder. 
However, McAuliffe was released after playing only seven more games. His 
career ended on September 1, 1975, in a Yankees-Red Sox game. McAuliffe 
dropped an easy popup for an error.[2] Later in the inning, McAuliffe's 
throw pulled Carl Yastrzemski off the bag.[2] Though it was scored a single, 
the Boston fans booed McAuliffe. McAuliffe was left off Boston's post-season 
roster, and his major league career was over.[2] McAuliffe was among the 
American League leaders in triples eight times, and his ability to draw 
walks also increased his offensive output, ending his career with a .343 
on-base percentage.[3] After retiring from baseball, McAuliffe owned a 
business that repaired and installed coin-operated washers and dryers for 
ten years, and also ran baseball schools.[2] Bill James ranked McAuliffe 
22nd all-time among second baseman in his Historical Baseball Abstract.[2][22] 
McAuliffe died on May 13, 2016, at the age of 76, after suffering a stroke.[23]
