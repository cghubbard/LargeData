The Cleveland Buckeyes were a Negro league baseball team that played from 
1942 to 1950 in the Negro American League. The Buckeyes played in two Negro 
World Series, defeating the Washington Homestead Grays in 1945, and losing 
to the New York Cubans in 1947. They were based in Cincinnati for their 
first season and Louisville for their second-to-last season. The Buckeyes 
were established in 1942 as the Buckeyes Baseball Club,[1] established 
initially in Cincinnati, Ohio[2] (Ohio being the Buckeye State), scheduling 
seven league games in Cincinnati and nine in Cleveland, plus another five 
in Meadeville, Pennsylvania.[3][4] The following season, owner Ernest White 
made Cleveland the team's home city, where they played their games at League 
Park.[5] While in Cleveland, the team achieved great success, including 
winning a pair of Negro American League championships (1945, 1947) and 
a Negro League World Series title in 1945.[2] In 1949 the team moved again, 
to Louisville, Kentucky, but it was to no avail and the Louisville Buckeyes 
returned to Cleveland for the first two months of the 1950 season before 
disbanding.[2][6] The Buckeyes played their inaugural season's home games 
at Crosley Field in Cincinnati.[7] After one season, they moved upstate 
to Cleveland and played at League Park until their demise,[8] except for 
1949 when they played at Parkway Field in Louisville, Kentucky.[9] On May 
20, 2006, in Cleveland, the Pittsburgh Pirates and Cleveland Indians honored 
the Negro league teams by wearing the uniforms of the Homestead Grays and 
the Cleveland Buckeyes, respectively, during an inter-league game, as well 
as displaying the names on the scoreboard. The Pirates won the game 9-6. 
On April 25, 2015, in Detroit, the Cleveland Indians and Detroit Tigers 
wore the uniforms of the Cleveland Buckeyes and Detroit Stars, respectively.[10]
