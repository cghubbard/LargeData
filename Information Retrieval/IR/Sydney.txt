Sydney /ˈsɪdni/[6] is the state capital of New South Wales and the most 
populous city in Australia and Oceania.[7] Located on Australia's east 
coast, the metropolis surrounds the world's largest natural harbour, and 
sprawls towards the Blue Mountains to the west.[8] Residents of Sydney 
are known as "Sydneysiders". Sydney is the second official seat and second 
official residence of the Governor-General of Australia and the Prime Minister 
of Australia. The Sydney area has been inhabited by indigenous Australians 
for at least 30,000 years.[9] The first British settlers, led by Captain 
Arthur Phillip, arrived in 1788 to found Sydney as a penal colony, the 
first European settlement in Australia.[10] Since convict transportation 
ended in the mid-19th century, the city has transformed from a colonial 
outpost into a major global cultural and economic centre. As at June 2015 
Sydney's estimated population was 4.92 million.[11] In the 2011 census, 
34 percent of the population reported having been born overseas,[3] representing 
many different nationalities and making Sydney one of the most multicultural 
cities in the world. There are more than 250 different languages spoken 
in Sydney and about one-third of residents speak a language other than 
English at home.[12][13] Despite being one of the most expensive cities 
in the world,[14] the 2014 Mercer Quality of Living Survey ranks Sydney 
tenth in the world in terms of quality of living,[15] making it one of 
the most livable cities.[16] It is classified as an Alpha+ World City by 
the Globalization and World Cities Research Network, indicating its influence 
in the region and throughout the world.[17][18] Ranked eleventh in the 
world for economic opportunity,[19] Sydney has an advanced market economy 
with strengths in finance, manufacturing and tourism. Its gross regional 
product was $337 billion in 2013, the largest in Australia.[20] There is 
a significant concentration of foreign banks and multinational corporations 
in Sydney and the city is promoted as Asia Pacific's leading financial 
hub.[21][22][23][24] In addition to hosting events such as the 2000 Summer 
Olympics, Sydney is amongst the top fifteen most-visited cities in the 
world,[25] with millions of tourists coming each year to see the city's 
landmarks.[26] Its natural features include Sydney Harbour, the Royal National 
Park, and the Royal Botanic Gardens. Man-made attractions such as the Sydney 
Opera House, Sydney Tower and the Sydney Harbour Bridge are also well known 
to international visitors. The first people to inhabit the area now known 
as Sydney were indigenous Australians having migrated from northern Australia 
and before that from southeast Asia. Radiocarbon dating suggests human 
activity first started to occur in the Sydney area from around 30,735 years 
ago.[9] However, numerous Aboriginal stone tools were found in Western 
Sydney's gravel sediments that were dated from 45,000 to 50,000 years BP,[27] 
which would indicate that there was human settlement in Sydney earlier 
than thought.[28] The earliest British settlers called them Eora people. 
"Eora" is the term the indigenous population used to explain their origins 
upon first contact with the British. Its literal meaning is "from this 
place". Prior to the arrival of the British there were 4,000 to 8,000 native 
people in Sydney from as many as 29 different clans.[29] Sydney Cove from 
Port Jackson to Petersham was inhabited by the Cadigal clan.[29] The principal 
language groups were Darug, Guringai, and Dharawal. The earliest Europeans 
to visit the area noted that the indigenous people were conducting activities 
such as camping and fishing, using trees for bark and food, collecting 
shells, and cooking fish.[30] Development has destroyed much of the city's 
history including that of the first inhabitants. There continues to be 
examples of rock art and engravings located in the protected Ku-ring-gai 
Chase National Park.[31] The first meeting between the native people and 
the British occurred on 29 April 1770 when Lieutenant James Cook landed 
at Botany Bay on the Kurnell Peninsula and encountered the Gweagal clan.[30][32][33] 
He noted in his journal that they were confused and somewhat hostile towards 
the foreign visitors.[30] Cook was on a mission of exploration and was 
not commissioned to start a settlement. He spent a short time collecting 
food and conducting scientific observations before continuing further north 
along the east coast of Australia and claiming the new land he had discovered 
for Britain. Britain—before that, England—and Ireland had for a long time 
been sending their convicts across the Atlantic to the American colonies. 
That trade was ended with the Declaration of Independence by the United 
States in 1776. Overrun with prisoners, Britain decided in 1786 to found 
a new penal outpost in the territory discovered by Cook some 16 years earlier. 
The colony was at first to be titled "New Albion", but Phillip decided 
on "Sydney" in recognition of The 1st Baron Sydney—later created The 1st 
Viscount Sydney in 1789—and his role in authorising the establishment of 
the settlement.[34] Captain Philip led the First Fleet of 11 ships and 
about 850 convicts into Botany Bay on 18 January 1788, though deemed the 
location unsuitable due to poor soil and a lack of fresh water. He travelled 
a short way further north and arrived at Port Jackson on 26 January 1788.[35][36] 
This was to be the location for the new colony. Phillip described Sydney 
Cove as being "without exception the finest harbour in the world".[37] 
The official proclamation and naming of the colony happened on 7 February 
1788. Between 1788 and 1792 about 4,300 convicts were landed at Sydney. 
The colony was not founded on the principles of freedom and prosperity. 
Maps from this time show no prison buildings; the punishment for convicts 
was transportation rather than incarceration, but serious offences were 
penalised by flogging and hanging.[38][39] Officers and convicts alike 
faced starvation as supplies ran low and little could be cultivated from 
the land.[40] The region's indigenous population was also suffering. It 
is estimated that half of the native people in Sydney died during the smallpox 
epidemic of 1789.[29][41] Some mounted violent resistance to the British 
settlers. Lachlan Macquarie became Governor in 1810. Macquarie did make 
the most of less than ideal circumstances. His first task was to restore 
order after the Rum Rebellion of 1808 against the previous Governor. Conditions 
in the colony were not conducive to the development of a thriving new metropolis, 
but the more regular arrival of ships and the beginnings of maritime trade 
(such as wool) helped to lessen the burden of isolation.[38][42] Macquarie 
undertook an extensive building programme of some 265 separate works.[43] 
Roads, bridges, wharves, and public buildings were constructed using convict 
labour and come 1822 the town had banks, markets, and well-established 
thoroughfares. Part of Macquarie's effort to transform the colony was his 
authorisation for convicts to re-enter society as free citizens.[43] The 
year 1840 was the final year of convict transportation to Sydney, which 
by this time had a population of 35,000.[35][38] The municipal council 
of Sydney was incorporated in 1842 and became Australia's first city.[44] 
Gold was discovered in the colony in 1851 and with it came thousands of 
people seeking to make money.[35][44] Sydney's population reached 200,000 
by 1871.[45] Following the depression of the 1890s, the six colonies agreed 
to form a federated nation of The Commonwealth of Australia. Under the 
reign of Queen Victoria federation of the six colonies occurred on 1 January 
1901. Sydney, with a population of 481,000, then became the state capital 
of New South Wales.[39] The Great Depression of the 1930s had a severe 
effect on Sydney's economy, as it did with most cities throughout the industrial 
world. For much of the 1930s up to one in three breadwinners was unemployed.[46] 
Construction of the Sydney Harbour Bridge served to alleviate some of the 
effects of the economic downturn by employing 1,400 men between 1924 and 
1932.[47] The population continued to boom despite the Depression and reached 
1 million in 1925.[45] When Britain declared war on Germany in 1939, Australia 
too entered. During the war Sydney experienced a surge in industrial development 
to meet the needs of a wartime economy. Far from mass unemployment, there 
were now labour shortages and women becoming active in male roles. Sydney's 
harbour was attacked by the Japanese in May and June 1942 with a direct 
attack from Japanese submarines with some loss of life.[48] Households 
throughout the city had built air raid shelters and performed drills. Following 
the end of the war the city continued to expand. There were 1.7 million 
people living in Sydney at 1950 and almost 3 million by 1975. The people 
of Sydney warmly welcomed Queen Elizabeth II in 1954 when the a reigning 
monarch stepped onto Australian soil for the first time to commence her 
Australian Royal Tour.[49] Having arrived on the Royal Yacht Britannia 
through Sydney Heads, Her Majesty came ashore at Farm Cove. Sydney's iconic 
Opera House was opened in 1973 by Her Majesty. A strong rivalry between 
Sydney and Melbourne that began in the 1850s still exists to this day.[citation 
needed] Sydney exceeded Melbourne's population in the early twentieth century 
and remains Australia's largest city.[7][50] The 2000 Summer Olympics were 
held in Sydney and became known as the "best Olympic Games ever" by the 
President of the International Olympic Committee.[51] The Opera House became 
a World Heritage Site in 2007.[52] Sydney is a coastal basin with the Tasman 
Sea to the east, the Blue Mountains to the west, the Hawkesbury River to 
the north, and the Woronora Plateau to the south. The inner city measures 
25 square kilometres (10 square miles), the Greater Sydney region covers 
12,367 square kilometres (4,775 square miles), and the city's urban area 
is 1,687 square kilometres (651 square miles) in size.[53][54][55] Sydney 
spans two geographic regions. The Cumberland Plain lies to the south and 
west of the Harbour and is relatively flat. The Hornsby Plateau is located 
to the north and is dissected by steep valleys. The flat areas of the south 
were the first to be developed as the city grew. It was not until the construction 
of the Sydney Harbour Bridge that the northern reaches of the coast became 
more heavily populated. Seventy beaches can be found along its coastline 
with Bondi Beach being one of the most famous. The Nepean River wraps around 
the western edge of the city and becomes the Hawkesbury River before reaching 
Broken Bay. Most of Sydney's water storages can be found on tributaries 
of the Nepean River. The Parramatta River is mostly industrial and drains 
a large area of Sydney's western suburbs into Port Jackson. The southern 
parts of the city are drained by the Georges River and the Cooks River 
into Botany Bay. In 1820s, Peter Miller Cunningham described the region 
west of Parramatta and Liverpool as "a fine timbered country, perfectly 
clear of bush, through which you might, generally speaking, drive a gig 
in all directions, without any impediment in the shape of rocks, scrubs, 
or close forest". This confirmed earlier accounts by Governor Phillip, 
who suggested that the trees were "growing at a distance of some twenty 
to forty feet from each other, and in general entirely free from brushwood..."[56] 
The most prevalent plant communities in the Sydney region are Dry Sclerophyll 
Forests,[57] which mainly consist of eucalyptus trees and sclerophyll shrubs 
in the understory. Sclerophyll forests developed as a result of the extreme 
age of the continent combined with Aboriginal fire use. Deep weathering 
of the crust leached chemicals out of the rock, leaving Australian soils 
deficient in nutrients. The most widespread eucalyptus species within the 
biome include Angophora costata (Sydney red gum), Eucalyptus piperita (Sydney 
peppermint), Eucalyptus sieberi (Silvertop Ash), Eucalyptus oblonga (stringybark), 
Eucalyptus capitellata (Brown Stringybark), Corymbia gummifera (red bloodwood), 
Eucalyptus racemosa (scribbly gum) and Eucalyptus haemastoma (scribbly 
gum). Most common shrub species include, but are not limited to, Banksia 
serrata, Ceratopetalum gummiferum, Banksia spinulosa and Xanthosia pilosa.[58] 
Sydney is made up of mostly Triassic rock with some recent igneous dykes 
and volcanic necks. The Sydney Basin was formed when the Earth's crust 
expanded, subsided, and filled with sediment in the early Triassic period.[59] 
The sand that was to become the sandstone of today was washed from Broken 
Hill and laid down about 200 million years ago. The sandstone has shale 
lenses and fossil riverbeds dotted throughout and it is some 200 metres 
(656 feet) thick. The Basin's sedimentary rocks have been subject to uplift 
with gentle folding and minor faulting during the formation of the Great 
Dividing Range.[59] Erosion by coastal streams has created a landscape 
of deep gorges and remnant plateaus. The Sydney Basin bioregion includes 
coastal features of cliffs, beaches, and estuaries. Deep river valleys 
known as rias were carved during the Triassic period in the Hawkesbury 
sandstone of the coastal region where Sydney now lies. The rising sea level 
between 18,000 and 6,000 years ago flooded the rias to form estuaries and 
deep harbours.[59] Port Jackson, better known as Sydney Harbour, is one 
such ria.[60] Under the Köppen–Geiger classification, Sydney has a humid 
subtropical climate (Cfa)[61] with warm summers, cool winters and uniform 
rainfall throughout the year.[62] At Sydney's primary weather station at 
Observatory Hill, extreme temperatures have ranged from 45.8 °C (114.4 °F) 
on 18 January 2013 to 2.1 °C (35.8 °F) on 22 June 1932;[63][64] whereas 
at the Sydney Airport station, extremes have ranged from 46.4 to −0.1 °C 
(115.5 to 31.8 °F).[65][66] An average of 14.9 days a year have temperatures 
at or above 30 °C (86 °F) in the CBD.[67] In contrast, the metropolitan 
area averages between 35 and 65 days, depending on the suburb.[68] The 
highest minimum temperature recorded at Observatory Hill is 27.6 °C (82 °F), 
in February 2011 while the lowest maximum temperature is 7.7 °C (46 °F), 
recorded in July 1868.[67] The weather is moderated by proximity to the 
ocean, and more extreme temperatures are recorded in the inland western 
suburbs.[67] Sydney experiences an urban heat island effect.[69] This makes 
certain parts of the city more vulnerable to extreme heat.[69] In late 
spring and summer, temperatures over 35 °C (95 °F) are not uncommon,[70] 
though hot, dry conditions are usually ended by a southerly buster.[71] 
This powerful storm brings gale winds and rapid fall in temperature, followed 
by brief heavy rain and thunder.[72] Due to the inland location, frost 
is recorded in Western Sydney a few times in winter. Autumn and spring 
are the transitional seasons, with spring showing a larger temperature 
variation than autumn.[73] The rainfall has a moderate to low variability 
and it is evenly spread through the months, though is slightly higher during 
the first half of the year.[67][74] In late autumn and winter, east coast 
lows may bring large amounts of rainfall, especially in the CBD.[75] Depending 
on the wind direction, summer weather may be humid or dry, with the late 
summer/autumn period having a higher average humidity and dewpoints than 
late spring/early summer. In summer, most rain falls from thunderstorms 
and in winter from cold fronts.[76] Snowfall was last reported in the Sydney 
City area in 1836, while a fall of graupel, or soft hail, mistaken by many 
for snow, in July 2008, has raised the possibility that the 1836 event 
was not snow, either.[77] The city is rarely affected by cyclones, although 
remnants of ex-cyclones do affect the city. The El Niño–Southern Oscillation 
plays an important role in determining Sydney's weather patterns: drought 
and bushfire on the one hand, and storms and flooding on the other, associated 
with the opposite phases of the oscillation. Many areas of the city bordering 
bushland have experienced bushfires, these tend to occur during the spring 
and summer. The city is also prone to severe storms. One such storm was 
the 1999 hailstorm, which produced massive hailstones of at least 9 cm 
(3.5 in) in diameter.[78] The Bureau of Meteorology has reported that 2002 
through 2005 were the warmest summers in Sydney since records began in 
1859.[79] The summer of 2007–08, however, proved to be the coolest since 
1996–97 and is the only summer this century to be at or below average in 
temperatures.[80] In 2009, dry conditions brought a severe dust storm towards 
eastern Australia.[81][82] The average annual temperature of the sea is 
above 21 °C (70 °F), and the monthly average ranges from 18 °C (64 °F) 
in July to 24 °C (75 °F) in January.[83][84] Lieutenant William Dawes produced 
a town plan in 1790 but it was ignored by the colony's leaders. Sydney's 
layout today reflects this lack of planning.[89] The geographical area 
covered by urban Sydney is divided into 658 suburbs for addressing and 
postal purposes and is administered as 40 local government areas.[90] The 
City of Sydney is responsible for 33 of these suburbs, all of which are 
located close to the central business district.[91] There are 15 contiguous 
regions around Sydney: the CBD, Canterbury-Bankstown, the Eastern Suburbs, 
the Forest District, Greater Western Sydney, the Hills District, the Inner 
West, Macarthur, the Northern Beaches, the Northern Suburbs, the North 
Shore, Southern Sydney, St George, Sutherland Shire, and Western Sydney. 
The largest commercial centres outside of the CBD are North Sydney and 
Chatswood in the north, Parramatta to the west, Liverpool in the south-west, 
Hurstville in the south, and Bondi Junction to the east.[92] There has 
been accelerating commercial development in Parramatta since the 1950s 
as firms serving Western Sydney have set up regional offices and recognised 
the region's significant residential population mass and cheaper rents.[93] 
The CBD itself extends about 3 kilometres (1.9 miles) south from Sydney 
Cove. It is bordered by Farm Cove within the Royal Botanic Gardens to the 
east and Darling Harbour to the west. Suburbs surrounding the CBD include 
Woolloomooloo and Potts Point to the east, Surry Hills and Darlinghurst 
to the south, Pyrmont and Ultimo to the west, and Millers Point and The 
Rocks to the north. Most of these suburbs measure less than 1 square kilometre 
(0.4 square miles) in area. Several localities, distinct from suburbs, 
exist throughout Sydney's inner reaches. Central and Circular Quay are 
transport hubs with ferry, rail, and bus interchanges. Chinatown, Darling 
Harbour, and Kings Cross are important locations for culture, tourism, 
and recreation. There is a long trend of gentrification amongst Sydney's 
inner suburbs. Pyrmont located on the harbour was redeveloped from a centre 
of shipping and international trade to an area of high density housing, 
tourist accommodation, and gambling.[94] Originally located well outside 
of the city, Darlinghurst is the location of a former gaol, manufacturing, 
and mixed housing. It had a period when it was known as area of prostitution. 
The terrace style housing has largely been retained and Darlinghurst has 
undergone significant gentrification since the 1980s.[95][96][97] Green 
Square is a former industrial area of Waterloo which is undergoing urban 
renewal worth $8 billion. On the city harbour edge the historic suburb 
and wharves of Millers Point are being built up as the new area of Barangaroo. 
The Millers Point/Barangaroo development has significant controversy regardless 
of the $6 billion worth of economic activity it is generating.[98][99] 
The suburb of Paddington is a well known suburb for its streets of restored 
terrace houses, Victoria Barracks, and shopping including the weekly Oxford 
Street markets.[100] The North Shore, an informal geographic term referring 
to the northern metropolitan area of Sydney, consists of Artarmon, Chatswood, 
Roseville, Lindfield, Killara, Gordon, Pymble and many others. The North 
Shore has one of the highest property prices in Sydney with the recent 
property price inflation sending the average property prices in suburbs 
such as Roseville,[101] Lindfield, Killara[102] and Gordon over 2 million 
dollars. The North Shore includes the commercial centres of North Sydney 
and Chatswood. North Sydney itself consists of a large commercial centre, 
with its own business centre, which contains the second largest concentration 
of high-rise buildings in Sydney, after the CBD. North Sydney is dominated 
by advertising, marketing businesses and associated trades, with many large 
corporations holding office in the region. The Lower North Shore usually 
refers to the suburbs adjacent to the harbour such as Neutral Bay, Waverton, 
Mosman, Cremorne, Cremorne Point, Lavender Bay, Milsons Point, Cammeray 
and North Sydney. The Lower North Shore's eastern boundary is Middle Harbour, 
or at the Roseville Bridge at Castle Cove and Roseville Chase. The Lower 
North Shore encompasses suburbs belonging to the local government areas 
of Municipality of Mosman, City of Willoughby, Municipality of Lane Cove, 
Municipality of Hunter's Hill and North Sydney Council. Taronga Zoo is 
situated in Mosman. The adjacent suburbs of Kirribilli and Milsons Point 
are the locations of Kirribilli House and Luna Park. The Upper North Shore 
usually refers to the suburbs between Chatswood and Hornsby. It is made 
up of suburbs located within Ku-ring-gai and Hornsby Shire councils. Vaucluse 
in the Eastern Suburbs is amongst Australia's most affluent addresses. 
Neighbouring suburb Point Piper contains Wolseley Road, the ninth dearest 
street in the world.[103] Coogee and Bondi, both known for tourism and 
recreation, are also found in the Eastern Suburbs. The Northern Beaches 
area includes Manly one of Sydney's most popular holiday destinations for 
much of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.[104] The suburb of Cronulla 
in southern Sydney is close to Royal National Park, Australia's oldest 
national park. The western suburbs encompasses the areas of Parramatta, 
the sixth largest business district in Australia.[105] Bankstown, Liverpool, 
Penrith, and Fairfield. Further to the south west is the region of Macarthur 
and the city of Campbelltown, a significant population centre until the 
1990s considered a region separate to Sydney proper. The Inner Western 
suburbs include Balmain was once a working class industrial and mining 
town but has undergone extensive gentrification.[106] The Inner West also 
includes Sydney Olympic Park, a suburb created to host the 2000 Summer 
Olympics. The earliest structures in the colony were built to the bare 
minimum of standards. Upon his appointment, Governor Lachlan Macquarie 
set ambitious targets for the architectural design of new construction 
projects. The city now has a world heritage listed building, several national 
heritage listed buildings, and dozens of Commonwealth heritage listed buildings 
as evidence of the survival of Macquarie's ideals.[107][108][109] In 1814 
the Governor called on a convict named Francis Greenway to design Macquarie 
Lighthouse.[110] The lighthouse and its Classical design earned Greenway 
a pardon from Macquarie in 1818 and introduced a culture of refined architecture 
that remains to this day.[111] Greenway went on to design the Hyde Park 
Barracks in 1819 and the Georgian style St James's Church in 1824.[112][113] 
Gothic-inspired architecture became more popular from the 1830s. John Verge's 
Elizabeth Bay House and St Philip's Church of 1856 were built in Gothic 
Revival style along with Edward Blore's Government House of 1845.[114][115] 
Kirribilli House, completed in 1858, and St Andrew's Cathedral, Australia's 
oldest cathedral,[116] are rare examples of Victorian Gothic construction.[114][117] 
From the late 1850s there was a shift towards Classical architecture. Mortimer 
Lewis designed the Australian Museum in 1857.[118] The General Post Office, 
completed in 1891 in Victorian Free Classical style, was designed by James 
Barnet.[119] Barnet also oversaw the 1883 reconstruction of Greenway's 
Macquarie Lighthouse.[110][111] Customs House was built in 1844 to the 
specifications of Lewis, with additions from Barnet in 1887 and W L Vernon 
in 1899.[120] The neo-Classical and French Second Empire style Town Hall 
was completed in 1889.[121][122] Romanesque designs gained favour amongst 
Sydney's architects from the early 1890s. Sydney Technical College was 
completed in 1893 using both Romanesque Revival and Queen Anne approaches.[123] 
The Queen Victoria Building was designed in Romanesque Revival fashion 
by George McRae and completed in 1898.[124] It was built on the site of 
the Sydney Central Markets and accommodates 200 shops across its three 
storeys.[125] The Great Depression had a tangible influence on Sydney's 
architecture. New structures became more restrained with far less ornamentation 
than was common before the 1930s. The most notable architectural feat of 
this period is the Harbour Bridge. Its steel arch was designed by John 
Jacob Crew Bradfield and completed in 1932. A total of 39,000 tonnes of 
structural steel span the 503 metres (1,650 feet) between Milsons Point 
and Dawes Point.[47][126] Modern and International architecture came to 
Sydney from the 1940s. Since its completion in 1973 the city's Opera House 
has become a World Heritage Site and one of the world's most renowned pieces 
of Modern design. It was conceived by Jørn Utzon with contributions from 
Peter Hall, Lionel Todd, and David Littlemore. Utzon was awarded the Pritzker 
Prize in 2003 for his work on the Opera House.[127] Sydney's first tower 
was Culwulla Chambers on the corner of King Street and Castlereagh Street 
which topped out at 50 metres (160 feet). With the lifting of height restrictions 
in the 1960s there came a surge of high-rise construction.[128] Acclaimed 
architects such as Jean Nouvel, Harry Seidler, Richard Rogers, Renzo Piano, 
Norman Foster, and Frank Gehry have each made their own contribution to 
the city's skyline. Important buildings in the CBD include Citigroup Centre,[129] 
Aurora Place,[130] Chifley Tower,[131][132] the Reserve Bank building,[133] 
Deutsche Bank Place,[134] MLC Centre,[135] and Capita Centre.[136] The 
tallest structure is Sydney Tower, designed by Donald Crone and completed 
in 1981.[137] Regulations limit new buildings to a height of 235 metres 
(771 feet) due to the proximity of Sydney Airport, although strict restrictions 
employed in the early 2000s have slowly been relaxed in the past ten years. 
There were 1.5 million dwellings in Sydney in 2006 including 940,000 detached 
houses and 180,000 semi-detached terrace houses.[138] Units or apartments 
make up 25.8% of Sydney's dwellings, more than the 12.8% which are semi-detached 
but less than the 60.9% which are separate houses.[139] Whilst terrace 
houses are common in the inner city areas, it is detached houses that dominate 
the landscape in the outer suburbs. About 80% of all dwellings in Western 
Sydney are separate houses.[138] Due to environmental and economic pressures 
there has been a noted trend towards denser housing. There was a 30% increase 
in the number of apartments in Sydney between 1996 and 2006.[138] Public 
housing in Sydney is managed by the Government of New South Wales.[140] 
Suburbs with large concentrations of public housing include Claymore, Macquarie 
Fields, Waterloo, and Mount Druitt. The Government has announced plans 
to sell nearly 300 historic public housing properties in the harbourside 
neighbourhoods of Millers Point, Gloucester Street, and The Rocks.[141] 
A range of heritage housing styles can be found throughout Sydney. Terrace 
houses are found in the inner suburbs such as Paddington, The Rocks, and 
Balmain. Federation homes, constructed around the time of Federation in 
1901, are located in Penshurst, Turramurra, and in Haberfield. Haberfield 
is known as "The Federation Suburb" due to the extensive number of Federation 
homes. Workers cottages are found in Surry Hills, Redfern, and Balmain. 
California bungalows are common in Ashfield, Concord, and Beecroft.[142] 
The Royal Botanic Gardens are the most important green space in the Sydney 
region, hosting both academic and leisure activities. There are 15 separate 
parks under the administration of the City of Sydney.[143] Parks within 
the city centre include Hyde Park, The Domain and Prince Alfred Park. The 
outer suburbs include Centennial Park and Moore Park in the east, Sydney 
Park and Royal National Park in the south, Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park 
in the north, and the Western Sydney Parklands in the west. The Royal National 
Park was proclaimed on 26 April 1879 and with 13,200 hectares (51 square 
miles) is the second oldest national park in the world.[144] The largest 
park in the Sydney metropolitan region is Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park, 
established in 1894 with an area of 15,400 hectares (59 square miles).[145] 
It is regarded for its well-preserved records of indigenous habitation 
and more than 800 rock engravings, cave drawings, and middens have been 
located in the park.[146] The area now known as The Domain was set aside 
by Governor Arthur Phillip in 1788 as his private reserve.[147] Under the 
orders of Macquarie the land to the immediate north of The Domain became 
the Royal Botanic Gardens in 1816. This makes them the oldest botanic garden 
in Australia.[147] The Gardens are not just a place for exploration and 
relaxation, but also for scientific research with herbarium collections, 
a library, and laboratories.[148] The two parks have a total area of 64 
hectares (0.2 square miles) with 8,900 individual plant species and receive 
over 3.5 million annual visits.[149] To the south of The Domain is Hyde 
Park. It is the oldest public parkland in Australia and measures 16.2 hectares 
(0.1 square miles) in area.[150] Its location was used for both relaxation 
and the grazing of animals from the earliest days of the colony.[151] Macquarie 
dedicated it in 1810 for the "recreation and amusement of the inhabitants 
of the town" and named it in honour of the original Hyde Park in London. 
Researchers from Loughborough University have ranked Sydney amongst the 
top ten world cities that are highly integrated into the global economy.[152] 
The Global Economic Power Index ranks Sydney number eleven in the world.[153] 
The Global Cities Index recognises it as number fourteen in the world based 
on global engagement.[154] The prevailing economic theory in effect during 
early colonial days was mercantilism, as it was throughout most of Western 
Europe.[155] The economy struggled at first due to difficulties in cultivating 
the land and the lack of a stable monetary system. Governor Lachlan Macquarie 
solved the second problem by creating two coins from every Spanish silver 
dollar in circulation.[155] The economy was clearly capitalist in nature 
by the 1840s as the proportion of free settlers increased, the maritime 
and wool industries flourished, and the powers of the East India Company 
were curtailed.[155] Wheat, gold, and other minerals became additional 
export industries towards the end of the 1800s.[155] Significant capital 
began to flow into the city from the 1870s to finance roads, railways, 
bridges, docks, courthouses, schools, and hospitals. Protectionist policies 
after federation allowed for the creation of a manufacturing industry which 
became the city's largest employer by the 1920s.[155] These same policies 
helped to relieve the effects of the Great Depression during which the 
unemployment rate in New South Wales reached as high as 32%.[155] From 
the 1960s onwards Parramatta gained recognition as the city's second central 
business district and finance and tourism became major industries and sources 
of employment.[155] Sydney's gross regional product was $337.45 billion 
in 2013 with the City of Sydney responsible for $95.18 billion of this 
total.[20][22] The Financial and Insurance Services industry accounts for 
18.1% of gross product and is ahead of Professional Services with 9% and 
Manufacturing with 7.2%. In addition to Financial Services and Tourism, 
the Creative and Technology sectors are focus industries for the City of 
Sydney and represented 9% and 11% of its economic output in 2012.[156][157] 
There were 451,000 businesses based in Sydney in 2011, including 48% of 
the top 500 companies in Australia and two-thirds of the regional headquarters 
of multinational corporations.[158] Global companies are attracted to the 
city in part because its time zone spans the closing of business in North 
America and the opening of business in Europe. Most foreign companies in 
Sydney maintain significant sales and service functions but comparably 
less production, research, and development capabilities.[159] There are 
283 multinational companies with regional offices in Sydney.[160] Sydney 
has been ranked between the fifteenth and the fifth most expensive city 
in the world and is the most expensive city in Australia.[161] To compensate, 
workers receive the seventh highest wage levels of any city in the world.[161] 
Sydney's residents possess the highest purchasing power of any city after 
Zürich.[161] Working residents of Sydney work an average of 1,846 hours 
per annum with 15 days of leave.[161] The labour force of Sydney in 2011 
was 2,188,854 with a participation rate of 61.7%. It was made up of 62.1% 
full-time workers, 26.7% part-time workers, and 5.7% unemployed individuals.[139][162] 
The largest reported occupations are professionals, clerical and administrative 
workers, managers, technicians, trades workers, and sales workers.[139] 
The largest industries by employment across Sydney are Health Care and 
Social Assistance with 10.9%, Retail with 9.8%, Professional Services with 
9.6%, Manufacturing with 8.5%, Education and Training with 7.6%, Construction 
with 7.1%, and Financial and Insurance Services with 6.6%.[3] The Professional 
Services and Financial and Insurance Services industries account for 26.9% 
of employment within the City of Sydney.[163] 62.8% of working age residents 
had a total weekly income of less than $1,000 and 29.1% had a total weekly 
income of $1,000 or more.[3] The median weekly income for the same period 
was $619 for individuals, $2,302 for families without children, and $2,537 
for families with children.[139] Unemployment in the City of Sydney averaged 
4.6% for the decade to 2013, much lower than the current rate of unemployment 
in Western Sydney of 7.3%.[22][164] Western Sydney continues to struggle 
to create jobs to meet its population growth despite the development of 
commercial centres like Parramatta. Each day about 200,000 commuters travel 
from Western Sydney to the central business district and suburbs in the 
east and north of the city.[164] Home ownership in Sydney was less common 
than renting prior to World War II but this trend has since reversed.[138] 
Median house prices have increased by an average of 8.6% per annum since 
1970.[165][166] The median house price in Sydney in March 2014 was $630,000.[167] 
The primary cause for rising prices is the increasing cost of land which 
made up 32% of house prices in 1977 compared to 60% in 2002.[138] 31.6% 
of dwellings in Sydney are rented, 30.4% are owned outright, and 34.8% 
are owned with a mortgage.[139] 11.8% of mortgagees in 2011 had monthly 
loan repayments of less than $1,000 and 82.9% had monthly repayments of 
$1,000 or more.[3] 44.9% of renters for the same period had weekly rent 
of less than $350 whilst 51.7% had weekly rent of $350 or more. The median 
weekly rent in Sydney is $450.[3] Macquarie gave a charter in 1817 to form 
the first bank in Australia, the Bank of New South Wales.[168] New private 
banks opened throughout the 1800s but the financial system was unstable. 
Bank collapses were a frequent occurrence and a crisis point was reached 
in 1893 when 12 banks failed.[168] The Bank of New South Wales exists to 
this day as Westpac.[169] The Commonwealth Bank of Australia was formed 
in Sydney in 1911 and began to issue notes backed by the resources of the 
nation. It was replaced in this role in 1959 by the Reserve Bank of Australia 
which is also based in Sydney.[168] The Australian Securities Exchange 
began operating in 1987 and with a market capitalisation of $1.6 trillion 
is now one of the ten largest exchanges in the world.[170] The Financial 
and Insurance Services industry now constitutes 43% of the economic product 
of the City of Sydney.[21] Sydney makes up half of Australia's finance 
sector and has been promoted by consecutive Commonwealth Governments as 
Asia Pacific's leading financial centre.[23][24] Structured finance was 
pioneered in Sydney and the city is a leading hub for asset management 
firms.[171] In 1985 the Federal Government granted 16 banking licences 
to foreign banks and now 40 of the 43 foreign banks operating in Australia 
are based in Sydney, including the People's Bank of China, Bank of America, 
Citigroup, UBS, Mizuho Bank, Bank of China, Banco Santander, Credit Suisse, 
State Street, HSBC, Deutsche Bank, Barclays, Royal Bank of Canada, Société 
Générale, Royal Bank of Scotland, Sumitomo Mitsui, ING Group, BNP Paribas, 
and Investec.[21][168][172][173] Sydney has been a manufacturing city since 
the protectionist policies of the 1920s. By 1961 the industry accounted 
for 39% of all employment and by 1970 over 30% of all Australian manufacturing 
jobs were in Sydney.[174] Its status has declined in more recent decades, 
making up 12.6% of employment in 2001 and 8.5% in 2011.[3][174] Between 
1970 and 1985 there was a loss of 180,000 manufacturing jobs.[174] The 
city is still the largest manufacturing centre in Australia. Its manufacturing 
output of $21.7 billion in 2013 was greater than that of Melbourne with 
$18.9 billion.[175] Observers have noted Sydney's focus on the domestic 
market and high-tech manufacturing as reasons for its resilience against 
the high Australian dollar of the early 2010s.[175] Sydney is a gateway 
to Australia for many international visitors. It has hosted over 2.8 million 
international visitors in 2013, or nearly half of all international visits 
to Australia. These visitors spent 59 million nights in the city and a 
total of $5.9 billion.[26] The countries of origin in descending order 
were China, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, the United States, South Korea, 
Japan, Singapore, Germany, Hong Kong, and India.[176] The city also received 
8.3 million domestic overnight visitors in 2013 who spent a total of $6 
billion.[176] 26,700 workers in the City of Sydney were directly employed 
by tourism in 2011.[177] There were 480,000 visitors and 27,500 people 
staying overnight each day in 2012.[177] On average, the tourism industry 
contributes $36 million to the city's economy per day.[177] Popular destinations 
include the Sydney Opera House, the Sydney Harbour Bridge, Watsons Bay, 
The Rocks, Sydney Tower, Darling Harbour, the Royal Botanic Gardens, the 
Royal National Park, the Australian Museum, the Museum of Contemporary 
Art, the Art Gallery of New South Wales, the Queen Victoria Building, Taronga 
Zoo, Bondi Beach, the Blue Mountains, and Sydney Olympic Park.[178] Major 
developmental projects designed to increase Sydney's tourism sector include 
a casino and hotel at Barangaroo and the redevelopment of East Darling 
Harbour, which involves a new exhibition and convention centre that will 
become Australia's largest upon completion.[179][180][181] Sydney is the 
highest ranking city in the world for international students. More than 
50,000 international students study at the city's universities and a further 
50,000 study at its vocational and English language schools.[154][182] 
International education contributes $1.6 billion to the local economy and 
creates demand for 4,000 local jobs each year.[183] The population of Sydney 
in 1788 was less than 1,000.[185] With convict transportation it tripled 
in ten years to 2,953.[186] For each decade since 1961 the population has 
increased by more than 250,000.[187] Sydney's population at the time of 
the 2011 census was 4,391,674.[139] It has been forecasted that the population 
will grow to between 8 and 8.5 million by 2061.[188] Despite this increase, 
the Australian Bureau of Statistics predicts that Melbourne will replace 
Sydney as Australia's most populous city by 2053.[189] The four most densely 
populated suburbs in Australia are located in Sydney with each having more 
than 13,000 residents per square kilometre (33,700 residents per square 
mile).[190] The median age of Sydney residents is 36 and 12.9% of people 
are 65 or older.[139] The married population accounts for 49.7% of Sydney 
whilst 34.7% of people have never been married.[139] 48.9% of couples have 
children and 33.5% of couples do not.[139] 32.5% of people in Sydney speak 
a language other than English at home with Arabic, Mandarin, Cantonese, 
Vietnamese, and Greek the most widely spoken.[139][13] There were 54,746 
people of indigenous heritage living in Sydney in 2011.[139] Most immigrants 
to Sydney between 1840 and 1930 were British, Irish, or Chinese. There 
were significant clusters of people based on nationality or religion throughout 
the history of Sydney development. In the early 20th century Irish people 
were centred in Surry Hills, the Scottish in Paddington. The mass migration 
following World War II has seen further ethnic groups establish. Such ethnic 
groups include, but are not limited to, Dutch,[192] Sri Lankan,[193] Indian,[194] 
Assyrian,[195][196][197] Turkish,[198][199] Thai,[200] Russian, Vietnamese, 
Filipino, Korean, Greek, Lebanese, Italian, Jewish, Czech, Polish, German, 
Serbian, Macedonian, and Maltese communities.[185] As of the 2011 census 
night there were 1,503,620 people living in Sydney that were born overseas, 
accounting for 42.5% of the population of the City of Sydney and 34.2% 
of the population of Sydney, the seventh greatest proportion of any city 
in the world.[3][201][202] Sydney's largest ancestry groups are English, 
Australian, Irish, Chinese, and Scottish.[139] Foreign countries of birth 
with the greatest representation are England, China, India, New Zealand, 
and Vietnam.[139] The concentration of immigrants in Sydney, relative to 
the rest of Australia (excluding Melbourne), make it the exception rather 
than the norm on having such a high foreign born population. The Australian 
Museum opened in Sydney in 1857 with the purpose of collecting and displaying 
the natural wealth of the colony.[203] It remains Australia's oldest natural 
history museum. In 1995 the Museum of Sydney opened on the site of the 
first Government House. It recounts the story of the city's development.[204] 
Other museums based in Sydney include the Powerhouse Museum and the Australian 
National Maritime Museum.[205][206] In 1866 then Queen Victoria gave her 
assent to the formation of the Royal Society of New South Wales. The Society 
exists "for the encouragement of studies and investigations in science, 
art, literature, and philosophy". It is based in a terrace house in Darlington 
owned by the University of Sydney.[207] The Sydney Observatory building 
was constructed in 1859 and used for astronomy and meteorology research 
until 1982 before being converted into a museum.[208] The Museum of Contemporary 
Art was opened in 1991 and occupies an Art Deco building in Circular Quay. 
Its collection was founded in the 1940s by artist and art collector John 
Power and has been maintained by the University of Sydney.[210] Sydney's 
other significant art institution is the Art Gallery of New South Wales 
which coordinates the coveted Archibald Prize for portraiture.[211] Contemporary 
art galleries are found in Waterloo, Surry Hills, Darlinghurst, Paddington, 
Chippendale, Newtown, and Woollahra. Sydney's first commercial theatre 
opened in 1832 and nine more had commenced performances by the late 1920s. 
The live medium lost much of its popularity to cinema during the Great 
Depression before experiencing a revival after World War II.[212] Prominent 
theatres in the city today include State Theatre, Theatre Royal, Sydney 
Theatre, The Wharf Theatre, and Capitol Theatre. Sydney Theatre Company 
maintains a roster of local, classical, and international plays. It occasionally 
features Australian theatre icons such as David Williamson, Hugo Weaving, 
and Geoffrey Rush. The city's other prominent theatre companies are New 
Theatre, Belvoir, and Griffin Theatre Company. The Sydney Opera House is 
the home of Opera Australia and Sydney Symphony. It has staged over 100,000 
performances and received 100 million visitors since opening in 1973.[127] 
Two other important performance venues in Sydney are Town Hall and the 
City Recital Hall. The Sydney Conservatorium of Music is located adjacent 
to the Royal Botanic Gardens and serves the Australian music community 
through education and its biannual Australian Music Examinations Board 
exams.[213] Filmmaking in Sydney was quite prolific until the 1920s when 
spoken films were introduced and American productions gained dominance 
in Australian cinema.[214] Fox Studios Australia commenced production in 
Sydney in 1998. Successful films shot in Sydney since then include The 
Matrix, Mission: Impossible II, Moulin Rouge!, Australia, and The Great 
Gatsby. The National Institute of Dramatic Art is based in Sydney and has 
several famous alumni such as Mel Gibson, Judy Davis, Baz Luhrmann, and 
Cate Blanchett.[215] Sydney is the host of several festivals throughout 
the year. The city's New Year's Eve celebrations are the largest in Australia.[216] 
The Royal Easter Show is held every year at Sydney Olympic Park. Sydney 
Festival is Australia's largest arts festival.[217] Big Day Out is a travelling 
rock music festival that originated in Sydney. The city's two largest film 
festivals are Sydney Film Festival and Tropfest. Vivid Sydney is an annual 
outdoor exhibition of art installations, light projections, and music. 
In 2015, Sydney was ranked 15th for being the top fashion capitals in the 
world.[218] It hosts the Australian Fashion Week in autumn. The Sydney 
Mardi Gras has commenced each February since 1979. Sydney's Chinatown has 
had numerous locations since the 1850s. It moved from George Street to 
Campbell Street to its current setting in Dixon Street in 1980.[219] The 
Spanish Quarter is based in Liverpool Street whilst Little Italy is located 
in Stanley Street.[155] Popular nightspots are found at Kings Cross, Oxford 
Street, Circular Quay, and The Rocks. The Star is the city's only casino 
and is situated around Darling Harbour. The indigenous people of Sydney 
held totemic beliefs known as "dreamings". Governor Lachlan Macquarie made 
an effort to found a culture of formal religion throughout the early settlement 
and ordered the construction of churches such as St Matthew's, St Luke's, 
St James's, and St Andrew's.[220] These and other religious institutions 
have contributed to the education and health of Sydney's residents over 
time. 28.3% identify themselves as Catholic, whilst 17.6% practice no religion, 
16.1% are Anglican, 4.7% are Muslim, 4.2% are Eastern Orthodox, 4.1% are 
Buddhist, 2.6% are Hindu, and 0.9% are Jewish.[3][139] Sydney's earliest 
migrants brought with them a passion for sport but were restricted by the 
lack of facilities and equipment. The first organised sports were boxing, 
wrestling, and horse racing from 1810 in Hyde Park.[221] Horse racing remains 
popular to this day and events such as the Golden Slipper Stakes attract 
widespread attention. The first cricket club was formed in 1826 and matches 
were played within Hyde Park throughout the 1830s and 1840s.[221] Cricket 
is a favoured sport in summer and big matches have been held at the Sydney 
Cricket Ground since 1878. The New South Wales Blues compete in the Sheffield 
Shield league and the Sydney Sixers and Sydney Thunder contest the national 
Big Bash Twenty20 competition. Rugby was played from 1865 as sport in general 
gained more popularity and better organisation. One-tenth of the colony 
attended a New South Wales versus New Zealand rugby match in 1907.[221] 
Rugby league separated from rugby union in 1908. The New South Wales Waratahs 
contest the Super Rugby competition. The national Wallabies rugby union 
team competes in Sydney in international matches such as the Bledisloe 
Cup, Rugby Championship, and World Cup. Sydney is home to nine of the sixteen 
teams in the National Rugby League competition: Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs, 
Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks, Manly Sea Eagles, Penrith Panthers, Parramatta 
Eels, South Sydney Rabbitohs, St George Illawarra Dragons, Sydney Roosters, 
and Wests Tigers. New South Wales contests the annual State of Origin series 
against Queensland. Sydney FC and the Western Sydney Wanderers compete 
in the A-League soccer tournament and Sydney frequently hosts matches for 
the Australian national team, the Socceroos. The Sydney Swans and the Greater 
Western Sydney Giants are local Australian rules football clubs that play 
in the Australian Football League. The Sydney Kings compete in the National 
Basketball League. The Sydney Uni Flames play in the Women's National Basketball 
League. The Sydney Blue Sox contest the Australian Baseball League. The 
Waratahs are a member of the Australian Hockey League. The Sydney Bears 
and Sydney Ice Dogs play in the Australian Ice Hockey League. The Swifts 
are competitors in the national women's netball league. Women were first 
allowed to participate in recreational swimming when separate baths were 
opened at Woolloomooloo Bay in the 1830s. From being illegal at the beginning 
of the century, sea bathing gained immense popularity during the early 
1900s and the first surf lifesaving club was established at Bondi Beach.[221][222] 
Disputes about appropriate clothing for surf bathing surfaced from time 
to time and concerned men as well as women. The City2Surf is an annual 
14-kilometre (8.7-mile) running race from the central business district 
to Bondi Beach and has been held since 1971. In 2010, 80,000 runners participated 
which made it the largest run of its kind in the world.[223] Sailing races 
have been held on Sydney Harbour since 1827.[224] Yachting has been popular 
amongst wealthier residents since the 1840s and the Royal Sydney Yacht 
Squadron was founded in 1862. The Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race is a 1,170-kilometre 
(727-mile) event that starts from Sydney Harbour on Boxing Day.[225] Since 
its inception in 1945 it has been recognised as one of the most difficult 
yacht races in the world.[226] Six sailors died and 71 vessels of the fleet 
of 115 failed to finish in the 1998 edition.[227] The Royal Sydney Golf 
Club is based in Rose Bay and since its opening in 1893 has hosted the 
Australian Open on 13 occasions.[221] Royal Randwick Racecourse opened 
in 1833 and holds several major cups throughout the year.[228] Sydney benefitted 
from the construction of significant sporting infrastructure in preparation 
for its hosting of the 2000 Summer Olympics. Sydney Olympic Park accommodates 
athletics, aquatics, tennis, hockey, archery, baseball, cycling, equestrian, 
and rowing facilities. It also includes the high capacity Stadium Australia 
used for rugby, soccer, and Australian rules football. Sydney Football 
Stadium was completed in 1988 and is used for rugby and soccer matches. 
Sydney Cricket Ground was opened in 1878 and is used for both cricket and 
Australian rules football fixtures.[221] The Sydney Morning Herald is Australia's 
oldest newspaper still in print. Now a compact form paper owned by Fairfax 
Media, it has been published continuously since 1831.[229] Its competitor 
is the News Corporation tabloid The Daily Telegraph which has been in print 
since 1879.[230] Both papers have Sunday tabloid editions called The Sun-Herald 
and The Sunday Telegraph respectively. The Bulletin was founded in Sydney 
in 1880 and became Australia's longest running magazine. It closed after 
128 years of continuous publication.[231] Each of Australia's three commercial 
television networks and two public broadcasters is headquartered in Sydney. 
Nine's offices are based in Willoughby,[232] Ten and Seven are based in 
Pyrmont,[232][233] the Australian Broadcasting Corporation is located in 
Ultimo,[234] and the Special Broadcasting Service is based in Artarmon.[235] 
Multiple digital channels have been provided by all five networks since 
2000. Foxtel is based in North Ryde and sells subscription cable television 
to most parts of the urban area.[236] Sydney's first radio stations commenced 
broadcasting in the 1920s. Radio became a popular tool for politics, news, 
religion, and sport and has managed to survive despite the introduction 
of television and the Internet.[237] 2UE was founded in 1925 and under 
the ownership of Fairfax Media is the oldest station still broadcasting.[237] 
Competing stations include the more popular 2GB, 702 ABC Sydney, KIIS 106.5, 
Triple M, Nova 96.9, and 2Day FM.[238] During early colonial times the 
presiding Governor and his military shared absolute control over the population.[36] 
This lack of democracy eventually became unacceptable for the colony's 
growing number of free settlers. The first indications of a proper legal 
system emerged with the passing of a Charter of Justice in 1814. It established 
three new courts, including the Supreme Court, and dictated that English 
law was to be followed.[239] In 1823 the British Parliament passed an act 
to create the Legislative Council in New South Wales and give the Supreme 
Court the right of review over new legislation.[240] From 1828 all of the 
common laws in force in England were to be applied in New South Wales wherever 
it was appropriate.[240] Another act from the British Parliament in 1842 
provided for members of the Council to be elected for the first time.[240] 
The Constitution Act of 1855 gave New South Wales a bicameral government. 
The existing Legislative Council became the upper house and a new body 
called the Legislative Assembly was formed to be the lower house.[241] 
An Executive Council was introduced and constituted five members of the 
Legislative Assembly and the Governor.[242] It became responsible for advising 
the ruling Governor on matters related to the administration of the state. 
The colonial settlements elsewhere on the continent eventually seceded 
from New South Wales and formed their own governments. Tasmania separated 
in 1825, Victoria did so in 1850, and Queensland followed in 1859.[241] 
With the proclamation of the Commonwealth of Australia in 1901 the status 
of local governments across Sydney was formalised and they became separate 
institutions from the state of New South Wales.[243] Sydney is divided 
into local government areas (also known as councils or shires) which are 
comparable in nature to London's boroughs. These local government areas 
have elected councils which are responsible for functions delegated to 
them by the New South Wales Government. The 28 local government areas making 
up Sydney according to the New South Wales Division of Local Government 
are: The Parliament of New South Wales sits in Parliament House on Macquarie 
Street. This building was completed in 1816 and first served as a hospital. 
The Legislative Council moved into its northern wing in 1829 and by 1852 
had entirely supplanted the surgeons from their quarters.[239] Several 
additions have been made to the building as the Parliament has expanded, 
but it retains its original Georgian façade.[244] Government House was 
completed in 1845 and has served as the home of 25 Governors and 5 Governors-General.[245] 
The highest court in the state is the Supreme Court of New South Wales 
which is located in Queen's Square in Sydney.[246] The city is also the 
home of numerous branches of the intermediate District Court of New South 
Wales and the lower Local Court of New South Wales.[247] Public activities 
such as main roads, traffic control, public transport, policing, education, 
and major infrastructure projects are controlled by the New South Wales 
Government.[248] It has tended to resist attempts to amalgamate Sydney's 
more populated local government areas as merged councils could pose a threat 
to its governmental power.[249] Established in 1842, the City of Sydney 
is one such local government area and includes the central business district 
and some adjoining inner suburbs.[250] It is responsible for fostering 
development in the local area, providing local services (waste collection 
and recycling, libraries, parks, sporting facilities), representing and 
promoting the interests of residents, supporting organisations that target 
the local community, and attracting and providing infrastructure for commerce, 
tourism, and industry.[251] The City of Sydney is led by an elected Council 
and Lord Mayor who has in the past been treated as a representative of 
the entire city.[252] Education became a proper focus for the colony from 
the 1870s when public schools began to form and schooling became compulsory.[253] 
The population of Sydney is now highly educated. 90% of working age residents 
have completed some schooling and 57% have completed the highest level 
of school.[3] 1,390,703 people were enrolled in an educational institution 
in 2011 with 45.1% of these attending school and 16.5% studying at a university.[139] 
Undergraduate or postgraduate qualifications are held by 22.5% of working 
age Sydney residents and 40.2% of working age residents of the City of 
Sydney.[3][254] The most common fields of tertiary qualification are commerce 
(22.8%), engineering (13.4%), society and culture (10.8%), health (7.8%), 
and education (6.6%).[3] There are six public universities based in Sydney: 
the University of New South Wales, the University of Sydney, the University 
of Technology Sydney, Macquarie University, the Western Sydney University, 
and the Australian Catholic University. Four public universities maintain 
secondary campuses in the city: the University of Notre Dame Australia, 
the University of Wollongong, Curtin University of Technology, and the 
University of Newcastle. 5.2% of residents of Sydney are attending a university.[255] 
The University of Sydney was established in 1850 and remains the oldest 
university in Australia while the other city's universities were all founded 
after World War II. The Universities of New South Wales and Sydney are 
similarly ranked in the top 50 in the world, the University of Technology 
Sydney is ranked 193, while Macquarie University ranks 237, and the Western 
Sydney University below 500.[256] Sydney has public, denominational, and 
independent schools. 7.8% of Sydney residents are attending primary school 
and 6.4% are enrolled in secondary school.[255] There are 935 public preschool, 
primary, and secondary schools in Sydney that are administered by the New 
South Wales Department of Education.[257] 14 of the 17 selective secondary 
schools in New South Wales are based in Sydney.[258] Public vocational 
education and training in Sydney is run by TAFE New South Wales and began 
with the opening of the Sydney Technical College in 1878. It offered courses 
in areas such as mechanical drawing, applied mathematics, steam engines, 
simple surgery, and English grammar.[123] The college became the Sydney 
Institute in 1992 and now operates alongside its sister TAFE facilities 
across the Sydney metropolitan area, namely the Northern Sydney Institute, 
the Western Sydney Institute, and the South Western Sydney Institute. At 
the 2011 census, 2.4% of Sydney residents are enrolled in a TAFE course.[255] 
The first hospital in the new colony was a collection of tents at The Rocks. 
Many of the convicts that survived the trip from England continued to suffer 
from dysentery, smallpox, scurvy, and typhoid. Healthcare facilities remained 
hopelessly inadequate despite the arrival of a prefabricated hospital with 
the Second Fleet and the construction of brand new hospitals at Parramatta, 
Windsor, and Liverpool in the 1790s.[259] Governor Lachlan Macquarie arranged 
for the construction of Sydney Hospital and saw it completed in 1816.[259] 
Parts of the facility have been repurposed for use as Parliament House 
but the hospital itself still operates to this day. The city's first emergency 
department was established at Sydney Hospital in 1870. Demand for emergency 
medical care increased from 1895 with the introduction of an ambulance 
service.[259] The Sydney Hospital also housed Australia's first teaching 
facility for nurses, the Nightingale Wing, established with the input of 
Florence Nightingale in 1868.[260] Healthcare gained recognition as a citizen's 
right in the early 1900s and Sydney's public hospitals came under the oversight 
of the Government of New South Wales.[259] The administration of healthcare 
across Sydney is handled by eight local health districts: Central Coast, 
Illawarra Shoalhaven, Sydney, Nepean Blue Mountains, Northern Sydney, South 
Eastern Sydney, South Western Sydney, and Western Sydney.[261] The Prince 
of Wales Hospital was established in 1852 and became the first of several 
major hospitals to be opened in the coming decades.[262] St Vincent's Hospital 
was founded in 1857,[97] followed by Royal Alexandra Hospital for Children 
in 1880,[263] the Prince Henry Hospital in 1881,[264] the Royal Prince 
Alfred Hospital in 1882,[265] the Royal North Shore Hospital in 1885,[266] 
the St George Hospital in 1894,[267] and the Nepean Hospital in 1895.[268] 
Westmead Hospital in 1978 was the last major facility to open.[269] The 
motor vehicle, more than any other factor, has determined the pattern of 
Sydney's urban development since World War II.[270] The growth of low density 
housing in the city's outer suburbs has made car ownership necessary for 
hundreds of thousands of households. The percentage of trips taken by car 
has increased from 13% in 1947 to 50% in 1960 and to 70% in 1971.[270] 
The most important roads in Sydney were the nine Metroads, including the 
110-kilometre (68-mile) Sydney Orbital Network. Widespread criticism over 
Sydney's reliance on sprawling road networks, as well as the motor vehicle, 
have stemmed largely from proponents of mass public transport and high 
density housing.[271][272][273] There can be up to 350,000 cars using Sydney's 
roads simultaneously during peak hour, leading to significant traffic congestion.[270] 
84.9% of Sydney households own a motor vehicle and 46.5% own two or more.[139] 
Car dependency is high in Sydney–of people that travel to work, 58.4% use 
a car, 9.1% catch a train, 5.2% take a bus, and 4.1% walk.[139] In contrast, 
only 25.2% of working residents in the City of Sydney use a car, whilst 
15.8% take a train, 13.3% use a bus, and 25.3% walk.[274] With a rate of 
26.3%, Sydney has the highest utilisation of public transport for travel 
to work of any Australian capital city.[275] Sydney once had one of the 
largest tram networks in the world. It was the second largest in the British 
Empire, after London, with routes covering 291 kilometres (181 miles). 
The internal combustion engine made buses more flexible than trams and 
consequently more popular, leading to the progressive closure of the tram 
network with the final tram operating in 1961.[270] From 1930 there were 
612 buses across Sydney carrying 90 million passengers per annum.[276] 
A 12.8-kilometre (8.0-mile) light rail network opened in 1997. It links 
the Inner West and Darling Harbour with Central Station and carries 4.5 
million passengers per annum.[277] A second 12 km (7.5 mi) line serving 
the CBD and south-eastern suburbs is planned to open in early 2019.[278] 
Bus services today are conducted by a mixture of Government and private 
operators. In areas previously serviced by trams the government State Transit 
Authority of New South Wales operates, in other areas, there are private 
(albeit part funded by the state government) operators. Integrated tickets 
called Opals operate on both Government and private bus routes. State Transit 
alone operated a fleet of 2,169 buses and serviced over 160 million passengers 
during 2014. In total, nearly 225 million boardings were recorded across 
the bus network [279] NightRide is a nightly bus service that operate between 
midnight and 5am, also replacing trains for most of this period. Train 
services are today operated by Transport for New South Wales. It maintains 
176 stations and 937 kilometres (582 miles) of railway and provides 281 
million journeys each year.[280] Sydney's railway was first constructed 
in 1854 with progressive extension to the network to serve both freight 
and passengers across the city, suburbs, and beyond to country NSW. In 
the 1850s and 1860s the railway reached Parramatta, Campbelltown, Liverpool, 
Blacktown, Penrith, and Richmond.[270] Central Station opened for service 
in 1906 and is the main hub of the city's rail network.[281] Prior to 1906, 
Central Railway was located further west of the current Central Railway 
Station in the vicinity of Redfern. A large infrastructure project worth 
$1 billion and known as Clearways was completed in 2014 with the purpose 
of easing railway congestion.[282] In 2014 94.2% of trains arrived on time 
and 99.5% of services ran as scheduled.[283][284] Construction of Sydney 
Metro, an automated rapid transit system separate from the existing suburban 
network, started in 2013.[285][286][287][288] The first stage is expected 
to open in 2019, with plans in place to extend the system through the central 
business district by 2024.[289][290] At the time the Sydney Harbour Bridge 
opened in 1932, the city's ferry service was the largest in the world.[291] 
Patronage declined from 37 million passengers in 1945 to 11 million in 
1963 but has recovered somewhat in recent years.[270] From its hub at Circular 
Quay the ferry network serves Balmain, Double Bay, Manly, Parramatta, Taronga 
Zoo, Darling Harbour, and Cockatoo Island.[291] Sydney Airport, officially 
"Sydney Kingsford-Smith Airport", is located in the inner southern suburb 
of Mascot with two of the runways going into Botany Bay. Kingsford-Smith 
Airport is one of the world's oldest continually operating airports.[292] 
It services 46 international and 23 domestic destinations.[292] As the 
busiest airport in Australia it handled 37.9 million passengers in 2013 
and 530,000 tonnes of freight in 2011.[292] It has been announced that 
a new facility named Western Sydney Airport will be constructed at Badgerys 
Creek from 2016 at a cost of $2.5 billion.[293] Bankstown Airport is Sydney's 
second busiest airport, and serves general aviation, charter and some scheduled 
cargo flights. Bankstown is also the fourth busiest airport in Australia 
by number of aircraft movements.[294] Port Botany has surpassed Port Jackson 
as the city's major shipping port. Cruise ship terminals are located at 
Sydney Cove and White Bay. As climate change, greenhouse gas emissions 
and pollution have become a major issue for Australia, Sydney has in the 
past been criticised for its lack of focus on reducing pollution, cutting 
back on emissions and maintaining water quality.[295] Since 1995, there 
have been significant developments in the analysis of air pollution in 
the Sydney metropolitan region. The development led to the release of the 
Metropolitan Air Quality Scheme (MAQS), which led to a broader understanding 
of the causation of pollution in Sydney, allowing the government to form 
appropriate responses to the pollution.[296] Australian cities are some 
of the most car dependent cities in the world.[297] Sydney in particular 
has a very high level of car dependency,[298] especially by world city 
standards. It also has a low level of mass-transit services, with a historically 
low-density layout and significant urban sprawl, thus increasing the likelihood 
of car dependency.[299][300] Strategies have been implemented to reduce 
private vehicle pollution by encouraging mass and public transit,[301] 
initiating the development of high density housing and introducing a fleet 
of 10 new Nissan LEAF electric cars, the largest order of the pollution-free 
vehicle in Australia.[302] Electric cars do not produce carbon monoxide 
and nitrous oxide, gases which contribute to climate change.[303][304] 
Cycling trips have increased by 113% across Sydney's inner-city since March 
2010, with about 2,000 bikes passing through top peak-hour intersections 
on an average weekday.[305] Transport developments in the north-west and 
east of the city have been designed to encourage the use of Sydney's expanding 
public transportation system. The City of Sydney became the first council 
in Australia to achieve formal certification as carbon-neutral in 2008.[306][307] 
The city has reduced its 2007 carbon emissions by 6% and since 2006 has 
reduced carbon emissions from city buildings by up to 20%.[305][308] The 
City of Sydney introduced a Sustainable Sydney 2030 program, with various 
targets planned and a comprehensive guide on how to reduce energy in homes 
and offices within Sydney by 30%.[305][309] Reductions in energy consumption 
have slashed energy bills by $30 million a year.[310] Solar panels have 
been established on many CBD buildings in an effort to minimise carbon 
pollution by around 3,000 tonnes a year.[311] The city also has an "urban 
forest growth strategy", in which it aims to regular increase the tree 
coverage in the city by frequently planting trees and vegetation to provide 
cleaner air and create moisture during hot weather, thus lowering city 
temperatures.[312] Sydney has also become a leader in the development of 
green office buildings and enforcing the requirement of all building proposals 
to be energy-efficient. The One Central Park development, completed in 
2013, is an example of this implementation and design.[313][314][315][316] 
Obtaining sufficient fresh water was difficult during early colonial times. 
A catchment called the Tank Stream sourced water from what is now the central 
business district but was little more than an open sewer by the end of 
the 1700s.[317] The Botany Swamps Scheme was one of several ventures during 
the mid 1800s that saw the construction of wells, tunnels, steam pumping 
stations, and small dams to service Sydney's growing population.[317] The 
first genuine solution to Sydney's water demands was the Upper Nepean Scheme 
which came into operation in 1886 and cost over £2 million. It transports 
water 100 kilometres (62 miles) from the Nepean, Cataract, and Cordeaux 
rivers and continues to service about 15% of Sydney's total water needs.[317] 
Dams were built on these three rivers between 1907 and 1935.[317] In 1977 
the Shoalhaven Scheme brought several more dams into service.[318] The 
Sydney Catchment Authority now manages eleven major dams: Warragamba one 
of the largest domestic water supply dams in the world,[319] Woronora, 
Cataract, Cordeaux, Nepean, Avon, Wingecarribee Reservoir, Fitzroy Falls 
Reservoir, Tallowa, the Blue Mountains Dams, and Prospect Reservoir.[320] 
Water is collected from five catchment areas covering 16,000 square kilometres 
(6,178 square miles) and total storage amounts to 2.6 teralitres (0.6 cubic 
miles).[320] The Sydney Desalination Plant came into operation in 2010.[317] 
The two distributors which maintain Sydney's electricity infrastructure 
are Ausgrid and Endeavour Energy.[321][322] Their combined networks include 
over 815,000 power poles and 83,000 kilometres (52,000 miles) of electricity 
cables. National and ACT Canberra NSW Sydney NT Darwin QLD Brisbane SA
