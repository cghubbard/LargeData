Twenty20 cricket, sometimes written Twenty-20, and often abbreviated to 
T20, is a short form of cricket. At the professional level, it was originally 
introduced by the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) in 2003 for the 
inter-county competition in England and Wales.[1] In a Twenty20 game the 
two teams have a single innings each, which is restricted to a maximum 
of 20 overs. Together with first-class and List A cricket, Twenty20 is 
one of the three current forms of cricket recognised by the International 
Cricket Council (ICC) as being at the highest international or domestic 
level. A typical Twenty20 game is completed in about three hours, with 
each innings lasting around 75–90 minutes and a 10–20-minute interval. 
This is much shorter than previously-existing forms of the game, and is 
closer to the timespan of other popular team sports. It was introduced 
to create a fast-paced form of the game which would be attractive to spectators 
at the ground and viewers on television. Since its inception the game has 
been very successful resulting in its spread around the cricket world. 
On most international tours there is at least one Twenty20 match and all 
Test-playing nations have a domestic cup competition. The inaugural ICC 
World Twenty20 was played in South Africa in 2007 with India winning by 
five runs against Pakistan in the final.[2] Pakistan won the second tournament 
in 2009,[3] and England won the title in the West Indies 2010. West Indies 
won in 2012, with Sri Lanka winning the 2014 tournament. West Indies are 
the reigning champions, winning the 2016 competition, and in doing so, 
became the first nation to win the tournament twice. When the Benson & 
Hedges Cup ended in 2002, the ECB needed another one day competition to 
fill its place. Cricketing authorities were looking to boost the game's 
popularity with the younger generation in response to dwindling crowds 
and reduced sponsorship. It was intended to deliver fast paced, exciting 
cricket accessible to thousands of fans who were put off by the longer 
versions of the game. Stuart Robertson, the marketing manager of the ECB, 
proposed a 20 over per innings game to county chairmen in 2001 and they 
voted 11–7 in favour of adopting the new format.[4] The first official 
Twenty20 matches were played on 13 June 2003 between the English counties 
in the Twenty20 Cup.[5] The first season of Twenty20 in England was a relative 
success, with the Surrey Lions defeating the Warwickshire Bears by 9 wickets 
in the final to claim the title.[6] The first Twenty20 match held at Lord's, 
on 15 July 2004 between Middlesex and Surrey, attracted a crowd of 27,509, 
the highest attendance for any county cricket game at the ground – other 
than a one-day final – since 1953.[7] Thirteen teams from different parts 
of the country participated in Pakistan's inaugural competition in 2004, 
with Faisalabad Wolves the first winners. On 12 January 2005 Australia's 
first Twenty20 game was played at the WACA Ground between the Western Warriors 
and the Victorian Bushrangers. It drew a sell-out crowd of 20,000, which 
was the first time in nearly 25 years the ground had been completely sold 
out and in Indian Premier League 2008 CSK vs KKR match played. The Attendance 
of the match close to 100,000 at Eden Garden stadium.[8] Starting 11 July 
2006 19 West Indies regional teams competed in what was named the Stanford 
20/20 tournament. The event was financially backed by billionaire Allen 
Stanford, who gave at least US$28,000,000 funding money. It was intended 
that the tournament would be an annual event. Guyana won the inaugural 
event, defeating Trinidad and Tobago by 5 wickets, securing US$1,000,000 
in prize money.[9][10] On 5 January 2007 Queensland Bulls played the New 
South Wales Blues at The Gabba, Brisbane. A crowd of 11,000 was expected 
based on pre-match ticket sales. However, an unexpected 16,000 turned up 
on the day to buy tickets, causing disruption and confusion for surprised 
Gabba staff as they were forced to throw open gates and grant many fans 
free entry. Attendance reached 27,653.[11] For 1 February 2008 Twenty20 
match between Australia and India, 85,824[12] people attended the match 
at the Melbourne Cricket Ground involving the Twenty20 World Champions 
against the ODI World Champions. The Stanford Super Series was held in 
October 2008 between Middlesex and Trinidad and Tobago, the respective 
winners of the English and Caribbean Twenty20 competitions, and a Stanford 
Superstars team formed from West Indies domestic players; Trinidad and 
Tobago won the competition, securing US$280,000 prize money.[13][14] On 
1 November, the Stanford Superstars played England in what was expected 
to be the first of five fixtures in as many years with the winner claiming 
a US$20,000,000 in each match. The Stanford Superstars won the first match,[15] 
however no further fixtures were held as Allen Stanford was charged with 
fraud in 2009.[16] On 17 February 2005 Australia defeated New Zealand in 
the first men's full international Twenty20 match, played at Eden Park 
in Auckland. The game was played in a light-hearted manner – both sides 
turned out in kit similar to that worn in the 1980s, the New Zealand team's 
a direct copy of that worn by the Beige Brigade. Some of the players also 
sported moustaches/beards and hair styles popular in the 1980s taking part 
in a competition amongst themselves for best retro look, at the request 
of the Beige Brigade. Australia won the game comprehensively, and as the 
result became obvious towards the end of the NZ innings, the players and 
umpires took things less seriously – Glenn McGrath jokingly replayed the 
Trevor Chappell underarm incident from a 1981 ODI between the two sides, 
and Billy Bowden showed him a mock red card (red cards are not normally 
used in cricket) in response. The first Twenty20 international in England 
was played between England and Australia at the Rose Bowl in Hampshire 
on 13 June 2005, which England won by a margin of 100 runs, a record victory 
which lasted until 2007.[17] On 9 January 2006 Australia and South Africa 
met in the first international Twenty20 game in Australia. In a first, 
each player's nickname appeared on the back of his uniform, rather than 
his surname. The international match drew a crowd of 38,894 people at The 
Gabba. Australia convincingly won the match with man of the match Damien 
Martyn scoring 96 runs. On 16 February 2006 New Zealand defeated West Indies 
in a tie-breaking bowl-out 3–0; 126 runs were scored apiece in the game 
proper. The game was the last international match played by Chris Cairns 
– NZC handed out life-size cardboard masks of his face to patrons as they 
entered the ground. Every two years an ICC World Twenty20 tournament is 
to take place, except in the event of an ICC Cricket World Cup being scheduled 
in the same year, in which case it will be held the year before. The first 
tournament was in 2007 in South Africa where India defeated Pakistan in 
the final. Two Associate teams had played in the first tournament, selected 
through the 2007 ICC World Cricket League Division One, a 50-over competition. 
In December 2007 it was decided to hold a qualifying tournament with a 
20-over format to better prepare the teams. With six participants, two 
would qualify for the 2009 World Twenty20 and would each receive $250,000 
in prize money.[18] The second tournament was won by Pakistan who beat 
Sri Lanka by 8 wickets in England on 21 June 2009. The 2010 ICC World Twenty20 
tournament was held in West Indies in May 2010, where England defeated 
Australia by 7 wickets. The 2012 ICC World Twenty20 was won by the West-Indies, 
by defeating Sri Lanka at the finals. It was the first time in Cricket 
history when a T20 World Cup tournament took place in an Asian country. 
The 2014 ICC World Twenty20 was won by Sri Lanka, by defeating India at 
the finals, where the tournament was held in Bangladesh. Twenty20 cricket 
is claimed to have resulted in a more athletic and "explosive" form of 
cricket. Indian fitness coach Ramji Srinivasan declared in an interview 
with the Indian fitness website Takath.com, that Twenty20 had "raised the 
bar" in terms of fitness levels for all players, demanding higher levels 
of strength, speed, agility and reaction time from all players regardless 
of role in the team.[19] Matthew Hayden credited retirement from international 
cricket with aiding his performance in general and fitness in particular 
in the Indian Premier League.[20] In June 2009, speaking at the annual 
Cowdrey Lecture at Lord's, former Australian wicketkeeper Adam Gilchrist 
pushed for Twenty20 to be made an Olympic sport. "It would," he said, "be 
difficult to see a better, quicker or cheaper way of spreading the game 
throughout the world."[21] Twenty20 match format is a form of limited overs 
cricket in that it involves two teams, each with a single innings, the 
key feature being that each team bats for a maximum of 20 overs. In terms 
of visual format, the batting team members do not arrive from and depart 
to traditional dressing rooms, but come and go from a "bench" (typically 
a row of chairs) visible in the playing arena, analogous to association 
football's "technical area" or a baseball "dugout".[22] The Laws of cricket 
apply to Twenty20, with some exceptions:[23] Currently, if the match ends 
with the scores tied and there must be a winner, the tie is broken with 
a one over per side "Eliminator"[24] or "Super Over":[25][26] Each team 
nominates three batsmen and one bowler to play a one-over per side "mini-match". 
The team which bats second in the match bats first in the Super Over.[27][28] 
In turn, each side bats one over bowled by the one nominated opposition 
bowler, with their innings over if they lose two wickets before the over 
is completed. The side with the higher score from their Super Over wins. 
If the super over also ends up in a tie, the team that has scored the most 
boundaries (4s+6s) in the 20 overs wins. In the Australian domestic competition 
the Big Bash League the Super Over is played slightly differently, with 
no 2-wicket limit, and if the super over is also tied then a "countback" 
is used, with scores after the fifth ball for each team being used to determine 
the result. If it is still tied, then the countback goes to 4 balls and 
so on.[29] The latest Super Over to decide a match was between the Melbourne 
Stars winning against the Sydney Sixers on the 5th January 2015, in the 
Big Bash League at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, with the Stars winning 
19/0 to 9/2 in the Super Over after tying on 150.[30] Tied Twenty20 matches 
were previously decided by a "bowl-out".[31] Twenty20 Internationals have 
been played since 2005. To date, 20 nations have played the format, including 
all test playing nations. In November 2011, the ICC released the first 
Twenty20 International rankings, based on the same system as the Test and 
ODI rankings. The rankings cover a 2 to 3-year period, with matches since 
the most recent 1 August weighted fully, matches in the preceding 12 months 
weighted two-thirds, and matches in the 12 months preceding that weighted 
one-third. To qualify for the rankings, teams must have played at least 
eight Twenty20 Internationals in the ranking period.[32][33] This is a 
list of the current Twenty20 domestic competitions in several of the leading 
cricket countries. These statistics are correct as of 6 November 2015 and 
include all first-class-equivalent level Twenty20 matches. Twenty 20 records
