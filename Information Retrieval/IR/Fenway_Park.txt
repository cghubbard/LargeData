Fenway Park is a baseball park located in Boston, Massachusetts, at 4 Yawkey 
Way near Kenmore Square. Since 1912, it has been the location for the Boston 
Red Sox, the city's Major League Baseball (MLB) franchise. It is the oldest 
ballpark in Major League Baseball.[8] Because of its age and constrained 
location in Boston's dense Fenway–Kenmore neighborhood, the park has been 
renovated or expanded many times, resulting in quirky heterogeneous features 
including "The Triangle" (below), "Pesky's Pole", and the Green Monster 
in left field. It is the fourth smallest among MLB ballparks by seating 
capacity, second smallest by total capacity, and one of eight that cannot 
accommodate at least 40,000 spectators. Fenway has hosted the World Series 
ten times, with the Red Sox winning five of them, and the Braves (then 
of Boston) winning one.[note 1] The first, in the park's inaugural season, 
was the 1912 World Series and the most recent was the 2013 World Series. 
Besides baseball games it has been the site of many other sporting and 
cultural events including professional football games for the Boston Redskins, 
Boston Yanks, and the Boston Patriots; concerts; soccer and hockey games; 
and political and religious campaigns. April 20, 2012, marked Fenway Park's 
centennial.[9] On March 7 of that year, the park was added to the National 
Register of Historic Places.[10] Former pitcher Bill Lee has called Fenway 
Park "a shrine".[11] It is a pending Boston Landmark which will regulate 
further changes to the park. Today, the park is considered to be one of 
the most well-known sports venues in the world.[12] The Red Sox moved to 
Fenway Park from the old Huntington Avenue Grounds. In 1911, owner John 
I. Taylor purchased the land bordered by Brookline Avenue, Jersey Street, 
Van Ness Street and Lansdowne Street and developed it into a larger baseball 
stadium.[13] Taylor claimed the name Fenway Park came from its location 
in the Fenway neighborhood of Boston, which was partially created late 
in the nineteenth century by filling in marshland or "fens",[13] to create 
the Back Bay Fens urban park. However, given that Taylor's family also 
owned the Fenway Realty Company, the promotional value of the naming at 
the time has been cited as well.[14] Like many classic ballparks, Fenway 
Park was constructed on an asymmetrical block, with consequent asymmetry 
in its field dimensions.[15] The General Contractor was the Charles Logue 
Building Company.[16] The first game was played April 20, 1912, with mayor 
John F. Fitzgerald throwing out the first pitch and Boston defeating the 
New York Highlanders (renamed the Yankees the next year), 7-6 in 11 innings. 
Newspaper coverage of the opening was overshadowed by continuing coverage 
of the Titanic sinking a few days earlier.[17] Fenway Park has historically 
drawn low attendance, its lowest occurring late in the 1965 season with 
two games having paid attendance under 500 spectators.[18] Its attendance 
has risen since the Red Sox' 1967 "Impossible Dream" season, and on September 
8, 2008, with a game versus the Tampa Bay Rays, Fenway Park broke the all-time 
Major League record for consecutive sellouts with 456, surpassing the record 
previously set by Jacobs Field (now Progressive Field) in Cleveland, Ohio.[19] 
On Wednesday, June 17, 2009, the park celebrated its 500th consecutive 
Red Sox sellout. According to WBZ-TV, the team joined three NBA teams which 
achieved 500 consecutive home sellouts.[20] The sellout streak ended on 
April 11, 2013; in all the Red Sox sold out 794 regular season games and 
an additional 26 postseason games during this streak.[21] The park's address 
was originally 24 Jersey Street. In 1977, the section of Jersey Street 
nearest the park was renamed Yawkey Way in honor of longtime Red Sox owner 
Tom Yawkey, and the park's address is now 4 Yawkey Way. Some of the changes 
include:[22] On May 15, 1999, then Red Sox CEO John Harrington announced 
plans for a new Fenway Park to be built near the existing structure.[33] 
It was to have seated 44,130 and would have been a modernized replica of 
the current Fenway Park, with the same field dimensions except for a shorter 
right field and reduced foul territory. Some sections of the existing ballpark 
were to be preserved (mainly the original Green Monster and the third base 
side of the park) as part of the overall new layout. Most of the current 
stadium was to be demolished to make room for new development, with one 
section remaining to house a baseball museum and public park.[34] The proposal 
was highly controversial; it projected that the park less than 15 years 
of usable life, would require hundreds of millions of dollars of public 
investment, and was later revealed to be part of a scheme by current ownership 
to increase the marketable value of the team as they were ready to sell.[35] 
Several groups (such as "Save Fenway Park") formed in an attempt to block 
the move.[36] Discussion took place for several years regarding the new 
stadium proposal. One plan involved building a "Sports Megaplex" in South 
Boston, where a new Fenway would be located next to a new stadium for the 
New England Patriots. The Patriots ultimately built Gillette Stadium in 
Foxborough, Massachusetts, their home throughout most of their history, 
which ended the Megaplex proposal. The Red Sox and the city of Boston failed 
to reach an agreement on building the new stadium, and in 2005, the Red 
Sox ownership group announced that the team would stay at Fenway Park indefinitely.[37] 
The stadium has since been renovated, and will remain usable until as late 
as 2061.[38] The park is located along Lansdowne Street and Yawkey Way 
in the Kenmore Square area of Boston. The area includes many buildings 
of similar height and architecture and thus it blends in with its surroundings. 
When pitcher Roger Clemens arrived in Boston for the first time in 1984, 
he took a taxi from Logan Airport and was sure the driver had misunderstood 
his directions when he announced their arrival at the park. Clemens recalled 
telling the driver "No, Fenway Park, it's a baseball stadium ... this is 
a warehouse." Only when the driver told Clemens to look up and he saw the 
light towers did he realize he was in the right place.[47] Fenway Park 
is one of the two remaining classic parks still in use in major league 
baseball (the other being Wrigley Field), and both have a significant number 
of obstructed view seats, due to pillars supporting the upper deck. These 
are sold as such, and are a reminder of the architectural limitations of 
older ballparks.[48] George Will asserts in his book Men at Work that Fenway 
Park is a "hitters' ballpark", with its short right-field fence (302 feet), 
narrow foul ground (the smallest of any current major league park), and 
generally closer-than-normal outfield fences. By Rule 1.04, Note(a),[49] 
all parks built after 1958 have been required to have foul lines at least 
325 feet (99 m) long and a center-field fence at least 400 feet (120 m) 
from home plate. Regarding the narrow foul territory, Will writes: The 
narrow foul territory in Fenway Park probably adds 5 to 7 points onto batting 
averages. Since World War II, the Red Sox have had 18 batting champions 
(through 1989)... Five to 7 points are a lot, given that there may be only 
a 15- or 20-point spread between a good hitting team and a poor hitting 
team.[50]:p. 175 Will states that some observers might feel that these 
unique aspects of Fenway give the Red Sox an advantage over their opponents, 
given that the Red Sox hitters play 81 games at the home stadium while 
each opponent plays no more than nine games as visiting teams but Will 
does not share this view.[50]:p. 177 The Green Monster is the nickname 
of the 37.167 feet (11.329 m)[51] left field wall in the park. It is located 
310 to 315 feet (94 to 96 m) from home plate; this short distance often 
benefits right-handed hitters.[52] Part of the original ballpark construction 
of 1912, the wall is made of wood, but was covered in tin and concrete 
in 1934 when the scoreboard was added. The wall was covered in hard plastic 
in 1976. The scoreboard is manually updated throughout the game. Despite 
the name, the Green Monster was not painted green until 1947; before that 
it was covered with advertisements. The Monster designation is relatively 
new; for most of its history it was simply called "the wall."[53] In 2003, 
terrace-style seating was added on top of the wall.[28] "The Triangle" 
is a region of center field where the walls form a triangle whose far corner 
is 420 feet (130 m) from home plate. That deep right-center point is conventionally 
given as the center field distance. The true center is unmarked, 390 feet 
(120 m) from home plate, to the left of "The Triangle" when viewed from 
home plate.[54] There was once a smaller "triangle" at the left end of 
the bleachers in center field, posted as 388 feet (118 m). The end of the 
bleachers form a right angle with the Green Monster and the flagpole stands 
within that little triangle. That is not the true power alley, but deep 
left-center. The true power alley distance is not posted. The foul line 
intersects with the Green Monster at nearly a right angle, so the power 
alley could be estimated at 336 feet (102 m), assuming the power alley 
is 22.5° away from the foul line as measured from home plate.[55] "Williamsburg" 
was the name, invented by sportswriters, for the bullpen area built in 
front of the right-center field bleachers in 1940. It was built there primarily 
for the benefit of Ted Williams, to enable him and other left-handed batters 
to hit more home runs, since it was 23 feet (7.0 m) closer than the bleacher 
wall.[56] The lone red seat in the right field bleachers (Section 42, Row 
37, Seat 21) signifies the longest home run ever hit at Fenway. The home 
run, hit by Ted Williams on June 9, 1946, was officially measured at 502 
feet (153 m) – well beyond "Williamsburg". According to Hit Tracker Online, 
the ball, if unobstructed, would have flown 520 to 535 feet (158 to 163 m).[57] 
The ball landed on Joseph A. Boucher, penetrating his large straw hat and 
hitting him in the head. A confounded Boucher was later quoted as saying, 
How far away must one sit to be safe in this park? I didn't even get the 
ball. They say it bounced a dozen rows higher, but after it hit my head, 
I was no longer interested. I couldn't see the ball. Nobody could. The 
sun was right in our eyes. All we could do was duck. I'm glad I did not 
stand up.[58] There have been other home runs hit at Fenway that have contended 
for the distance title. In the 2007 book The Year Babe Ruth Hit 104 Home 
Runs, researcher Bill Jenkinson found evidence that on May 25, 1926, Babe 
Ruth hit one in the pre-1934 bleacher configuration which landed five rows 
from the top in right field. This would have placed it at an estimated 
545 feet (166 m) from home plate.[59] On June 23, 2001, Manny Ramirez hit 
one that struck a light tower above the Green Monster, which would have 
cleared the park had it missed. The park's official estimate placed the 
home run one foot short of Williams' record at 501 feet (152.7 m).[60] 
Pesky's Pole is the name for the pole on the right field foul line, which 
stands 302 feet (92 m) from home plate,[54] the shortest outfield distance 
(left or right field) in Major League Baseball.[61] Despite the short wall, 
home runs in this area are relatively rare, as the fence curves away from 
the foul pole sharply. The pole was named after Johnny Pesky, a light-hitting 
shortstop and long-time coach for the Red Sox, who hit some of his six 
home runs at Fenway Park around the pole but never off the pole. Pesky 
and the Red Sox give credit to pitcher Mel Parnell for coining the name. 
The most notable for Pesky is a two-run homer in the eighth inning of the 
1946 Opening Day game to win the game (in his career, Pesky hit 17 home 
runs). In similar fashion, Mark Bellhorn hit what proved to be the game-winning 
home run off of Julián Tavárez, in Game 1 of the 2004 World Series off 
that pole's screen. On September 27, 2006, on Pesky's 87th birthday, the 
Red Sox organization officially dedicated the right field foul pole as 
Pesky's Pole with a commemorative plaque placed at its base.[62] In a ceremony 
before the Red Sox's 2005 game against the Cincinnati Reds, the pole on 
the left field foul line atop the Green Monster was named Fisk Foul Pole, 
in honor of Carlton Fisk.[63] Fisk provided one of baseball's most enduring 
moments in Game 6 of the 1975 World Series against the Reds. Facing Reds 
right-hander Pat Darcy in the 12th inning with the score tied at 6, Fisk 
hit a long fly ball down the left field line. It appeared to be heading 
foul, but Fisk, after initially appearing unsure of whether or not to continue 
running to first base, famously jumped and waved his arms to the right 
as if to somehow direct the ball fair. It ricocheted off the foul pole, 
winning the game for the Red Sox and sending the series to a seventh and 
deciding game the next night, which Cincinnati won. From 1912 to 1933, 
there was a 10-foot (3.0 m) high incline in front of the then 25-foot (7.6 m)-high 
left field wall at Fenway Park, extending from the left-field foul pole 
to the center field flag pole. As a result, a left fielder had to play 
part of the territory running uphill (and back down). Boston's first star 
left fielder, Duffy Lewis, mastered the skill so well that the area became 
known as "Duffy's Cliff".[13] The incline served two purposes: it was a 
support for a high wall and it was built to compensate for the difference 
in grades between the field and Lansdowne Street on the other side of that 
wall. The wall also served as a spectator-friendly seating area during 
the dead ball era when overflow crowds would sit on the incline behind 
ropes.[64] As part of the 1934 remodeling of the ballpark, the bleachers, 
and the wall itself, Red Sox owner Tom Yawkey arranged to flatten the ground 
along the base of the wall, so that Duffy's Cliff no longer existed. The 
base of the left field wall is several feet below the grade level of Lansdowne 
Street, accounting for the occasional rat that might spook the scoreboard 
operators.[65] There has been debate as to the true left field distance, 
which was once posted as 315 feet. A reporter from The Boston Globe was 
able to sneak into Fenway Park and measure the distance. When the paper's 
evidence was presented to the club in 1995, the distance was remeasured 
by the Red Sox and restated at 310 feet.[66] The companion 96 meters sign 
remained unchanged until 1998, when it was corrected to 94.5 meters.[67] 
In 1983, private suites were added to the roof behind home plate. In 1988, 
610 stadium club seats enclosed in glass and named the "600 Club", were 
added above the home plate bandstand, replacing the existing press box. 
The press box was then added to the top of the 600 Club.[68] The 1988 addition 
has been thought to have changed the air currents in the park to the detriment 
of hitters.[69] In 2002, the organization renamed the club seats the ".406 
Club" (in honor of Ted Williams' batting average in 1941).[69] Between 
the 2005 and 2006 seasons the existing .406 club was rebuilt as part of 
the continuing ballpark expansion efforts. The second deck now features 
two open-air levels: the bottom level is the new "EMC Club" featuring 406 
seats and concierge services and the upper level, the State Street Pavilion, 
has 374 seats and a dedicated standing room area. The added seats are wider 
than the previous seats.[69] The Red Sox's one-time cross-town rivals, 
the Boston Braves used Fenway Park for the 1914 World Series and the 1915 
season until Braves Field was completed; ironically, the Red Sox would 
then use Braves Field – which had a much higher seating capacity – for 
their own World Series games in 1915 and 1916.[70] Since 1990 (except in 
2005 when, because of field work, it was held in a minor league ballpark), 
Fenway Park has also played host to the final round of a Boston-area intercollegiate 
baseball tournament called the Baseball Beanpot. The teams play the first 
rounds in minor league stadiums before moving on to Fenway for the final 
and a consolation game.[71] Boston College, Harvard University, Northeastern 
University, and the University of Massachusetts Amherst compete in the 
four-team tournament.[72] Beginning in 2006, the Red Sox have hosted the 
"Futures at Fenway" event, where two of their minor-league affiliates play 
a regular-season doubleheader as the "home" teams. Before the Futures day 
started, the most recent minor-league game held at Fenway had been the 
Eastern League All-Star Game in 1977.[73] The 2009 Atlantic Coast Conference 
Baseball Tournament was scheduled to be held at Fenway Park, but a scheduling 
conflict caused the 2010 tournament to be scheduled at Fenway Park instead.[74] 
Due to economic reasons, the ACC elected to move the 2010 tournament from 
Fenway Park to NewBridge Bank Park in Greensboro, North Carolina, but is 
still looking to host a tournament at Fenway Park in the future.[75] Fenway 
Park has also hosted the Cape Cod Baseball League All Star Game in 2009 
and 2010.[76] Since its construction, Fenway Park has hosted 20 soccer 
matches.[77] The first game was played on May 30, 1931; 8,000 fans were 
on hand to see the New York Yankees of the American Soccer League lose 
to Celtic 6–0. The Yankees goalkeeper, Johnny Reder, would later return 
to play for the Boston Red Sox. During 1968, the park was home to the Boston 
Beacons of the now-defunct NASL.[78] In July 2010 Fenway hosted an exhibition 
game between European soccer clubs Celtic F.C. and Sporting C.P. in an 
event called "Football at Fenway". A crowd of 32,162 watched the two teams 
play to a 1-1 draw. Celtic won 6-5 on penalty shoot out, winning the first 
Fenway football challenge Trophy.[78] Recent matches have taken place between 
Liverpool, an English Premier League club owned by Fenway Sports Group, 
and A.S. Roma, an Italian Serie A club. The July 25, 2012 match ended in 
a 2-1 win for AS Roma before a crowd of 37,169.[79] AS Roma also won the 
rematch on July 23, 2014 by a score of 1-0.[80] In 1926, the first American 
Football League's Boston Bulldogs played at both Fenway and Braves Field; 
the Boston Shamrocks of the second AFL did the same in 1936 and 1937. The 
National Football League's Boston Redskins played at Fenway for four seasons, 
1933 to 1936, after playing their inaugural season in 1932 at Braves Field 
as the Boston Braves. The Boston Yanks played there in the 1940s; and the 
American Football League's Boston Patriots called Fenway Park home from 
1963 to 1968 after moving there from Nickerson Field. At various times 
in the past, Dartmouth College, Boston College and Boston University teams 
have also played football games at Fenway Park. Boston College and Notre 
Dame played a game at Fenway in 2015 as part of Notre Dame's Shamrock Series.[81] 
The third annual NHL Winter Classic was held at Fenway on New Year's Day 
in 2010.[82] The Boston Bruins beat the Philadelphia Flyers 2-1 in sudden-death 
overtime, securing the first home-team victory in the relatively short 
history of the NHL Winter Classic. The Winter Classic paved the way for 
the Frozen Fenway series of ice skating and hockey events at the ballpark. 
Frozen Fenway is an annual series of collegiate and amateur games featuring 
ice hockey teams from local and regional colleges and universities, including 
the University of Massachusetts Amherst, University of New Hampshire, University 
of Maine, University of Vermont, University of Massachusetts Lowell, Northeastern 
University, Boston College and Boston University, and is held during the 
first part of the event. After the completion of the hockey series, the 
rink was opened to the public for free ice skating.[83] Fenway has been 
home to several concerts beginning in 1973 when Stevie Wonder and Ray Charles 
first played there. No further concerts were played there until 2003 when 
Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band played a leg of their The Rising 
Tour.[84] Since 2003, there has been at least one concert every year at 
Fenway by such artists as Billy Joel, The Rolling Stones, The Police, Jason 
Aldean, Dave Matthews Band, Aerosmith, Phish, Roger Waters, Paul McCartney 
and Pearl Jam. Polartec Big Air At Fenway is the first big air snowboarding 
and skiing competition that was held on February 11–12, 2016. The spectacle 
took place at Fenway Park in Boston, USA. This is event was part of the 
U.S. Grand Prix Tour and the International Ski Federation's World Tour. 
Notable winter athletes that competed are Ty Walker, Sage Kotsenburg, and 
Joss Christensen. The big air jump was constructed to be about 140 feet 
tall, standing above the lights of the stadium.[85] Frank Fallon was the 
first public address (PA) announcer for the Red Sox, and held the job from 
1953 to 1957. Fred Cusick, better known for his career of announcing Boston 
Bruins hockey games, joined him in 1956 and also left after 1957.[86] Jay 
McMaster took over in 1958, until his replacement by Sherm Feller in 1967.[87] 
Feller served as the announcer for 26 years until his death after the 1993 
season.[88] He was known for beginning his games by welcoming the fans 
with "Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls. Welcome to Fenway 
Park", and ending them by saying "Thank you."[89] Leslie Sterling took 
the job for the 1994 season, becoming the second female PA announcer in 
the history of Major League Baseball.[86] Ed Brickley took over in 1997, 
and was replaced by Carl Beane in 2003.[86][87] Beane was regarded as an 
"iconic" announcer, and served until his death in 2012, which was caused 
by a heart attack suffered while driving.[89][90] Fenway used a series 
of guest announcers to finish the 2012 season[note 2] before hiring its 
current announcers: Henry Mahegan, Bob Lobel, and Dick Flavin.[92] There 
are nine retired numbers above the right field grandstand. All of the numbers 
retired by the Red Sox are red on a white circle. Jackie Robinson's 42, 
which was retired by Major League Baseball, is blue on a white circle. 
The two are further delineated through the font difference; Boston numbers 
are in the same style as the Red Sox jerseys, while Robinson's number is 
in the more traditional "block" numbering found on the Dodgers jerseys. 
Until the late 1990s, the numbers originally hung on the right-field facade 
in the order in which they were retired: 9-4-1-8. It was pointed out that 
the numbers, when read as a date (9/4/18), marked the eve of the first 
game of the 1918 World Series, the last championship that the Red Sox won 
before 2004. After the facade was repainted, the numbers were rearranged 
in numerical order.[93] The numbers remained in numerical order until the 
2012 season, when the numbers were rearranged back into the order in which 
they were retired by the Red Sox. The Red Sox policy on retiring uniform 
numbers was once one of the most stringent in baseball—the player had to 
be elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame, play at least 10 years 
with the team, and retire as a member of the Red Sox. The final requirement 
was waived for Carlton Fisk as he had finished his playing career with 
the Chicago White Sox. However, Fisk was assigned a Red Sox front office 
job and effectively "finished" his baseball career with the Red Sox in 
this manner.[94] In 2008, the ownership relaxed the requirements further 
with the retirement of Johnny Pesky's number 6. Pesky has not been inducted 
into the Hall of Fame, but in light of his over 50 years of service to 
the club, the management made an exception. Pesky would have had 10 seasons, 
but he was credited with the three seasons he served as an Operations Officer 
in the U.S. Navy during World War II.[95] The most recent number retired 
was 26, worn by Wade Boggs. 2013 World Series Most Valuable Player David 
Ortiz will have his number 34 retired during the 2017 season.[citation 
needed] It is a misconception among fans that a fly ball that gets stuck 
in the ladder above the scoreboard on the left field wall is ruled a ground 
rule triple. There is no mention of it in the Red Sox ground rules list.[97]
