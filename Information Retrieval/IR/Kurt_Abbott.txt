Kurt Thomas Abbott (born June 2, 1969) is a former Major League Baseball 
player who played primarily as a shortstop and second baseman from 1993 
to 2001. Abbott was born in Zanesville, Ohio and graduated from Dixie M. 
Hollins High School in St. Petersburg, Florida. He played collegiately 
at St. Petersburg Junior College.[1] Abbott was drafted by the Oakland 
Athletics in the 15th round of the 1989 Major League Baseball Draft.[2] 
He was the last player selected in that round and the only position player 
from that round to make it to the major leagues.[3] Abbott would break 
into the major leagues on September 7, 1993 as a member of the Athletics 
in an 11-7 win over the Blue Jays.[4] Abbott was called upon in the top 
of the 10th inning to run for Dave Henderson after Henderson singled off 
Mike Timlin. He was retired when Ruben Sierra grounded into a double play 
and was replaced in the field by Scott Lydy in the bottom of the 10th inning. 
Abbott would see action in 24 games for the Athletics that fall, and was 
traded to the Florida Marlins after the season in exchange for Kerwin Moore.[5] 
It was with the Marlins that Abbott spent the majority of his career, staying 
with them until 1998, primarily as a shortstop. He drove in six runs in 
an 11-2 victory over the Astros on July 17, 1996, missing the cycle by 
only a double.[6] He was a member of the 1997 team that won the World Series, 
appearing in three games as a pinch hitter but failing to get a hit.[7] 
He would be traded back to the Athletics after the season for Eric Ludwick. 
He did not stay long in his second tour of duty, appearing in only 35 games 
before being traded to the Colorado Rockies on June 9 for a player to be 
named later. Abbott proved a valuable utilityman, playing all infield and 
outfield positions in his time with the team. He became a free agent after 
the 1999 season and signed a one-year contract with the New York Mets for 
the 2000 season. Abbott appeared in 79 games for the Mets in 2000, primarily 
as a shortstop but also seeing time at second base. He was ejected for 
the only time in his career on June 9, arguing a play at first base in 
the top of the 2nd inning.[8] He was granted free agency after the season 
and signed a one-year contract with the Atlanta Braves. Abbott would only 
appear in 6 games for the Braves in 2001, playing the final game of his 
career on April 13, a win over the Phillies.[9] Pinch-hitting for Mike 
Remlinger, he reached base on an error and stole second base, but was thrown 
out trying to score by the Phillies' Doug Glanville to end the inning. 
Abbott was granted free agency after the season, and lingered in the minor 
leagues until 2003, playing his final 21 games for the Memphis Redbirds.[10] 
Since 2006, Kurt Abbott has worked as a Sheriff's Deputy in Martin County,
