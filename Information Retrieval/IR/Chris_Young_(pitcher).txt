Christopher Ryan "Chris" Young (born May 25, 1979) is an American professional 
baseball right-handed pitcher for the Kansas City Royals of Major League 
Baseball (MLB). He made his major league debut on August 24, 2004, with 
the Texas Rangers and also has Major League experience with the San Diego 
Padres, New York Mets, Seattle Mariners, and Kansas City Royals. He had 
previously excelled in basketball and baseball at Highland Park High School 
in University Park, Texas, and Princeton University. Young helped Highland 
Park reach the Class 4A Region II basketball final in 1997 and the Class 
4A Texas state basketball final in 1998. He tossed a no-hitter in 1997 
while compiling a 6–0 record, helping Highland Park reach the Class 4A 
Texas state baseball final. During his senior year, he was District Most 
Valuable Player in basketball, and led his baseball team to the state championship, 
while pitching in two no-hitters. That year, he was a first-team All-State 
selection in basketball and baseball. After a high school career as an 
athlete and scholar, Young excelled in both baseball and basketball for 
Princeton University and became the Ivy League's first male two-sport Rookie 
of the Year. Selected by the Pittsburgh Pirates in the third round of the 
June 2000 draft, he had brief professional experiences in the Pirates, 
Montreal Expos, and Texas Rangers minor league systems before debuting 
with the Rangers in August 2004. Young's professional baseball career took 
off in the 2006 season, when he was the major league leader in opponent 
batting average, hits per nine innings and road earned run average (ERA) 
and was named the National League Pitcher of the Month for June. Additionally, 
he extended his streak of consecutive undefeated games started as a visiting 
pitcher to 24, and secured the only Padres win in the team's 3–1 series 
loss to the St. Louis Cardinals in the 2006 National League Division Series.[1] 
In 2007, he defended his opponent batting average and hits per nine innings 
titles, but instead of winning the road ERA title he won the home ERA title. 
He is 6 feet 10 inches (2.08 m), which makes him, along with former pitchers 
Eric Hillman, Randy Johnson, Andrew Brackman and Andrew Sisco, the second 
tallest player in baseball history, next to relief pitcher Jon Rauch (who 
is 6 feet 11 inches (2.11 m) and Young's teammate on the 2012 New York 
Mets). He was elected to the 2007 MLB All-Star Game as a first-time All-Star 
via the All-Star Final Vote.[2] Young attended Highland Park High School, 
where he played basketball and baseball.[3] He lettered three times in 
basketball, in a career in which he scored over 1,000 points, and accumulated 
500 rebounds and 200 blocks. He was a two-year letterman in baseball, compiling 
a 14–3 record with 180 strikeouts. In basketball he averaged 16 points, 
12 rebounds, and 3 blocked shots a game, and in baseball he had an 8–3 
record with a 1.70 ERA and 95 strikeouts in 80 innings pitched.[3] As a 
sophomore in the fall of 1995, he was moved up to the varsity basketball 
team from the junior varsity due to injuries.[4] As a junior, his presence 
was significant enough that one opposing team practiced with a coach holding 
a broom in the air to simulate playing against him.[5] He helped his team 
reach the Class 4A-state Region II final.[6] As a junior in baseball, Young 
threw a no-hitter against McKinney High School in Spring 1997.[7] However, 
he missed a large part of the season after getting off to a 6–0 start because 
of a stress fracture in his foot.[8] Nonetheless, he was already considered 
a top professional prospect,[9] and he was named as one of seven Highland 
Park players on the all-district team.[10] By the summer of 1997, he was 
able to play for the Dallas Mustangs who were the defending national champions 
in the Connie Mack World Series,[11][12] and he earned the win in the fifth 
place game of the World Series.[13] By January of Young's senior season, 
he had led his basketball team to a district-leading 23–1 (4–0 in district) 
record and first place in both the The Dallas Morning News' Class 4A area 
poll and the Texas Association of Basketball Coaches' state poll.[14] Young 
developed a reputation as a finesse post player,[15][16] and that season 
he led his team to the UIL State Tournament championship game.[17][18] 
Highland Park lost to Houston's Waltrip High School and Young was credited 
with a tournament-high 18 rebounds by the Fort Worth Star-Telegram,[19] 
although The Dallas Morning News only credited him with 17 points and 14 
rebounds.[20] Young finished his senior season as a Texas Association of 
Basketball Coaches' first-team All-State selection and the District 9-4A 
Most Valuable Player.[21] He was later chosen to play in the mid-summer 
Texas High School Coaches Association's Southwestern All-Star basketball 
game at the Hofheinz Pavilion.[22] Young announced he planned to attend 
Princeton in May 1998. He chose Princeton over Boston College, University 
of Oklahoma, University of Pennsylvania, University of Texas, Vanderbilt 
University, and Yale University. Young's decision was based on Princeton's 
rising national profile in basketball and the opportunity to work with 
baseball coach Scott Bradley, who had played catcher for the Seattle Mariners 
while 6–10 pitcher Randy Johnson was with the team.[23] On May 9, 1998, 
Young was involved in a combined no-hitter when he pitched into the fifth 
inning against Moisés E. Molina High School and was relieved by Mike Matthews. 
Highland Park won this game, which was the clinching Region II best-of-3 
bi-district series game, by the 10-run rule.[24] Young displayed home run 
power as a senior,[25][26] and in some games, he played designated hitter.[27] 
Later that month, Young pitched another no-hitter in another 10-run rule 
victory, this time against Carthage High School.[28][29] Young was the 
starting pitcher at UFCU Disch-Falk Field during the Texas state 4A championship 
game victory against Calallen High School,[30] and he clinched the game 
with a successful pickoff move.[31] He was selected to the Texas High School 
Baseball Coaches Association 1998 All-State baseball team as well as The 
Texas Sports Writers Association third-team Class 4A all-state baseball.[32][33] 
In his freshman season at Princeton University, Young was the first male 
athlete to be named Ivy League Rookie of the Year in two sports—basketball 
and baseball—and was a unanimous selection for both awards.[34][35] In 
addition, Young was named second-team All-Ivy in basketball and was basketball 
Rookie of the Week each of the final six weeks and seven weeks overall.[35] 
His season was capped with Ivy League Player of the Year and freshman All-America 
honors from Basketball Weekly. Statistically, Young set Princeton Tigers 
men's basketball freshman records for points (387) and rebounds (160) by 
averaging 12.9 points and 5.3 rebounds a game with the 1998–99 Princeton 
Tigers men's basketball team. He also had 39 points, 19 rebounds, and 15 
assists in three games at the Rainbow Classic basketball tournament, hosted 
by the University of Hawaii.[35][36][37][38] He posted a season-high 24 
points in an National Invitation Tournament win against the NC State Wolfpack.[39] 
In baseball, Young led Princeton and the Ivy League with a 2.38 ERA. During 
this performance he allowed only one home run over the course of 150 batters 
faced, and was twice named Ivy League Rookie of the Week.[35] Young concluded 
his college basketball career by starting every game with the 1999–2000 
team.[40] Among his accomplishments that season were 22 double-digit scoring 
games, breaking his own single-season school record for blocked shots with 
87, and leading the team with 13.8 points per game, 6.3 rebounds per game, 
87 blocked shots and 40 steals.[40] He was also second on the team with 
105 assists. Young had the highest rebounding average of any Princeton 
player since 1978 and was also the thirteenth player in school history 
to record 100 assists in a season.[40] For his college basketball career, 
Young accumulated 801 points, 350 rebounds, and 142 blocks.[40] His best 
game performances included a 20-point game on the road against the 11th-ranked 
Kansas Jayhawks,[41] a career-high 30 points against Harvard,[42] and a 
school record of nine blocked shots against the Ohio Bobcats.[43] During 
his sophomore baseball season in 2000, Young was the Ivy League's leading 
pitcher with a 1.82 ERA overall and a 1.05 figure in conference games.[40] 
He compiled a perfect record of 5–0 in eight appearances, with 52 strikeouts 
in 49⅓ innings.[40] Young was a unanimous first-team All-Ivy League baseball 
selection, and he led the Tigers to their first Ivy League title since 
1996.[44] Young pitched a complete game and struck out seven batters in 
the 5–2 win in the championship series opener against Dartmouth.[44] Young 
was selected by the Pittsburgh Pirates in the third round of the 2000 amateur 
draft and signed a US$1.65 million contract with Pittsburgh on September 
6 after holding out until he gained assurances that he would be able to 
complete his collegiate education.[44] His athletic career was not entirely 
on hold as an upperclassman, and he was able to get some low minor league 
experience before completing his degree at Princeton in politics in June 
2002 and becoming a full-time professional athlete.[44][45] He played in 
the class A minor leagues after his junior year.[44] Young then completed 
his senior thesis, entitled "The Impact of Jackie Robinson and the Integration 
of Baseball on Racial Stereotypes in America: A Quantitative Content Analysis 
of Stories about Race in the New York Times" while commuting on minor league 
buses as a player for the Hickory Crawdads.[44][45] Young was also offered 
a two-year guaranteed contract to play basketball for the Sacramento Kings 
of the National Basketball Association in 2002 by fellow Princeton alum 
and Kings president Geoff Petrie.[44][45] Young was drafted by the Pittsburgh 
Pirates in the third round of the 2000 MLB draft.[46] He was signed to 
a deal on September 6. After a few years of minor league service, he was 
traded to the Montreal Expos' organization. The Expos traded him to the 
Texas Rangers, for whom he eventually made his major league debut. After 
less than two seasons with the Rangers, he was traded to the San Diego 
Padres.[46] In 2001, Young went 5–3 with a 4.12 ERA in 12 starts for the 
Hickory Crawdads in the Class-A South Atlantic League, including two complete 
games.[47] In 2002, Young helped the Crawdads to the league title with 
an 11–9 record and 3.11 ERA in 26 starts. Young earned decisions in fifteen 
straight starts from April 16 and July 4. He allowed more than three earned 
runs in just two of 26 starts. Opposing batters batted .234. He was traded 
to the Montreal Expos with Jon Searles for pitcher Matt Herges in a postseason 
trade.[48] Young began the 2003 season on the disabled list before joining 
the Brevard County Manatees of the Florida State League towards the end 
of April.[49] He posted a 5–2 record with a 1.62 ERA, and held opposing 
batters to a .150 batting average in eight starts.[49] His season was highlighted 
by an eight-inning, one-hit, no-walk, eight-strikeout performance against 
the Fort Myers Miracle on May 11.[50] This capped a 3–0, 0.47 ERA start 
to the season.[49] In June 2003, Young was promoted to the Harrisburg Senators 
of the Double-A Eastern League. He went 4–4 with a 4.01 ERA in 15 starts. 
In July, he went 3–0 and finished with an ERA of 3.03 over five starts. 
His season was highlighted by an eight-strikeout final outing on August 
30 against the Norwich Navigators and a win on July 27 against the Reading 
Phillies in which he threw seven shutout innings.[49][51][52] He was traded 
by the Montreal Expos to the Texas Rangers organization on April 3, 2004 
in a preseason deal along with Josh McKinley for Einar Díaz and Justin 
Echols.[46][53] He started the 2004 season with the Frisco RoughRiders 
of the Texas League where he went 6–5 with a 4.48 ERA in 18 starts.[53] 
The only two home runs he allowed in his final 12 starts and 61 innings 
with the RoughRiders occurred on July 3, against Round Rock.[53][54] He 
struck out a season-high eight batters on May 9 against El Paso.[53][55] 
Young was promoted to the Triple-A Oklahoma RedHawks of the Pacific Coast 
League in late July and went a perfect 3–0 with a 1.48 ERA in five starts.[53] 
During this brief stint he allowed only nine walks while compiling 34 strikeouts, 
and held opposition batters to a .189 average.[53] He posted four quality 
starts, and in his fifth start he only allowed two runs. The club was 4–1 
in his PCL starts. The only loss was due to a blown save with a 4–2 ninth-inning 
lead on August 7 against the Tacoma Rainiers in a game in which Young allowed 
no earned runs.[56] He was named Pacific Coast League Pitcher of the Week 
for August 16 to 22 after his last start on August 18 against the Memphis 
Redbirds.[53][57] Young took a no-hitter into the sixth inning of his second 
Triple-A start on August 2 against the Sacramento River Cats.[58] Young 
debuted with the Rangers on August 24, 2004 against the Minnesota Twins. 
He pitched 5⅔ innings, giving up four hits and three earned runs, while 
striking out four and walking three batters.[59] Young exited the game 
trailing 3–0, but was rescued by a comeback walk-off 5–4 win.[53] This 
debut made Young the first Princeton baseball player to start a major league 
game at any position since Dave Sisler (son of Hall of Famer George Sisler 
and brother of Dick Sisler) gave up six earned runs in just over four innings 
on August 27, 1961 in the second game of a doubleheader against the Detroit 
Tigers.[34] The game also marked the first appearance in a major league 
game by a Princeton baseball player since Bob Tufts played his final game 
for the Kansas City Royals on May 6, 1983.[34][60] Other Princeton baseball 
players who have recorded either 50 innings pitched or 130 at bats (the 
requirements to qualify for Rookie of the Year) in the major leagues are 
Moe Berg, Homer Hillebrand, King Lear, Dutch Meier, Dutch Sterrett, and 
Bobby Vaughn.[61] Young has been joined in the major leagues by Princetonian 
Ross Ohlendorf who debuted for the New York Yankees on September 11, 2007.[62] 
Another Princetonian, Tim Lahey, was on the Philadelphia Phillies roster 
from the team's Opening Day on March 31, 2008 until April 5, 2008 without 
making an appearance.[63][64] The debut, which occurred in a home game 
at Ameriquest Field in Arlington, served as a homecoming for Young who 
grew up in nearby Dallas, Texas and went to Highland Park High School.[34] 
With his debut, Young became the second-tallest player in Major League 
Baseball, only an inch shorter than the 6-foot-11-inch (2.11 m) Jon Rauch.[65] 
Three other current and previous pitchers—Randy Johnson,[66] Andrew Sisco[67] 
and Eric Hillman[68]—are also 6 feet 10 inches (2.08 m). He became the 
tallest pitcher in Rangers history, surpassing the 6-foot-8-inch (2.03 m) 
right-handed pitcher Mike Smithson.[53] After becoming part of the starting 
rotation, he made seven starts and compiled a 3–2 record with a 4.71 ERA.[46] 
Young signed a three-year contract through 2007 on November 19.[53] Young's 
first major league decision came during his second start in an August 29 
loss to the Baltimore Orioles.[53][69] His first win came in his third 
start on September 4 against the Boston Red Sox.[53][70] His fifth start 
was a six-inning performance in a 1–0 win against the Anaheim Angels on 
September 19.[71][72] This was the first Ranger 1–0 victory since August 
25, 2000 against the Toronto Blue Jays,[73] a stretch of 669 games.[53] 
The club went 5–2 during his starts in his brief 2004 stint with the club.[53] 
Young was one of three rookies on the Opening Day roster.[74] He made 31 
starts in 2005 with the Rangers, compiling a 12–7 record with a 4.26 ERA.[46] 
His twelve victories tied Kevin Brown's record for most wins by a Rangers 
rookie.[75] His season started slowly, with seven earned runs allowed in 
7⅓ innings pitched (8.59 ERA) over his first two starts.[74][76][77] However, 
over the course of 11 starts from April 17 – June 13, he lowered his ERA 
to a season-low 2.78 by going 6–2, 2.18 in 70⅓ innings pitched over that 
stretch.[74] This included the month of May when he went 3–0 in five starts 
with a 1.42 ERA that was third-best among all qualifying major leaguers 
for the month.[74] This included his season-high 13⅔ scoreless innings 
recorded from May 3–9.[78][79] He had subsequent hot and cold streaks, 
with a record of 2–4 and a 9.07 ERA in nine starts from June 20 – August 
2, followed by a 2.53 ERA over his final nine starts.[74] He closed out 
the season by winning his final four decisions, which was a personal best.[74] 
May 9 was one of two times Young came within an inning of a shutout by 
pitching eight scoreless innings; August 17 against the Cleveland Indians 
was the other.[80][81] Young recorded a personal-best eight strikeouts 
in a seven-inning no-decision on June 2 at Detroit.[82][83] The closest 
Young came to a no-hitter was 5⅔ innings of hitless pitching in a road 
game against the Houston Astros on June 25 before allowing a Craig Biggio 
single in the sixth inning.[84][85] Over the course of the season, Young 
was the beneficiary of the second-highest run support in the majors, trailing 
only David Wells of the Boston Red Sox.[74] However, he surrendered three 
runs or less in 22 of 31 starts.[74] After a 2005 season when he went 5–0 
with a 3.47 ERA in 11 games during the day and 7–7 with a 4.71 ERA in 20 
games at night, he had a career 8–1 record with a 3.31 ERA in 15 day games 
and 7–8 with a 5.05 mark in 23 games at night.[74] In his rookie season, 
Young ranked in the top five among qualifying major league rookies in several 
statistical categories: strikeouts (second, 137), wins (tied for third, 
12), ERA (fourth, 4.26), starts (fifth, 31) and innings pitched (fifth, 
164⅔).[74] He also tied Rangers rookie club records: wins (12, Edwin Correa 
in 1986 and Kevin Brown in 1989) and pre All-Star break wins (8, Jeff Zimmerman 
in 1999 and José Guzmán in 1986).[74] Young ranked fifth among all American 
League pitchers with 7.5 strikeouts per 9 innings.[74] Despite this success, 
however, he was a key part of an offseason trade that also sent Terrmel 
Sledge and Adrian Gonzalez to the San Diego Padres for starting pitcher 
Adam Eaton, middle reliever Akinori Otsuka and minor-league catcher Billy 
Killian.[86] 2006 marked Young's breakout season. His ERA continued its 
downward trend, falling to 3.46 over 31 starts, good enough for sixth best 
in the National League, and he recorded a career-high 169 strikeouts. He 
finished with an 11–5 record,[46] led all major league pitchers with a 
2.41 road ERA,[86][87] allowed a league-leading 6.72 hits per 9 innings 
pitched, and a .206 opponent batting average.[46][86] During 2006 he led 
the majors in stolen bases allowed, with 41. During the season, Young won 
a National League Pitcher of the Month award, took a no-hitter into the 
sixth inning or beyond three times, and extended his undefeated road start 
streak to 24 games.[86] This streak made Young one of only three pitchers 
in major league history to have gone at least 23 straight road starts without 
a loss; Allie Reynolds set the record at 25 straight road starts spanning 
the 1948 and 1949 seasons, with Russ Meyer falling one short, going undefeated 
in 24 straight road contests spanning the 1953 and 1954 seasons.[86] In 
his first six starts after Memorial Day, he improved from a 3–3 with a 
4.32 ERA to 7–3 with a 2.97 ERA, by allowing only four earned runs over 
38⅔ innings. He was named one of five candidates from the National League 
for Major League Baseball's "All-Star Final Vote" to determine the final 
official selection for the 2006 Major League Baseball All-Star Game; however, 
Los Angeles Dodgers first baseman Nomar Garciaparra was elected.[88] Nonetheless, 
his strong June performance – during which he allowed 16 hits and 13 walks 
over 30⅔ innings, maintained a 1.17 ERA and struck out 34 – earned him 
the National League Pitcher of the Month award.[75][86] His five starts 
in June were highlighted by a career-best 12-strikeout performance on June 
9 against the Florida Marlins and a June 21 win over his former team, the 
Texas Rangers.[75][89][90][91][92] On September 22, Young had a no-hitter 
through 8⅓ innings of the game against the Pittsburgh Pirates before pinch 
hitter Joe Randa hit a two-run home run.[93][94] This would have been the 
first no-hitter in Padres history.[93] It was the first time a Padre had 
taken a no-hitter into the ninth inning since Andy Ashby on September 5, 
1997 vs. the Atlanta Braves.[86][95] Young had been on pace for a perfect 
game through 5⅔ innings.[96] Young also took a no-hitter into the eighth 
inning on May 30 against the Colorado Rockies as a prelude to his June 
performance.[93] In that game, which marked the first time a pitcher took 
a no-hitter into the eighth inning during the 2006 season,[3] he surrendered 
a double to Brad Hawpe, who had been a teammate in the 1997 Connie Mack 
World Series,[11][13] on his first pitch of the eighth inning and 99th 
of the game.[97][98] During Young's next start on June 4 at Pittsburgh, 
he did not allow a hit for the first 5⅓ innings,[99][100] making him one 
of only two pitchers (Steve Trachsel – June 20–25, 2002)[101][102] to have 
consecutive starts with at least five hitless innings since the 2000 season.[3][103] 
He ended the season by winning his first career postseason start; on October 
7, he earned a 3–1 victory in Game 3 of the 2006 National League Division 
Series against the St. Louis Cardinals.[104] He pitched 6⅔ shutout innings, 
struck out nine, walked two and allowed four hits.[104] It remains the 
Padres' only victory in ten post-season games against the Cardinals. The 
Padres lost the series three games to one. Young's 6–0 road performance 
in 2006 was one of 49 undefeated road seasons with at least five victories 
by a pitcher since post-season play began in 1903. However, it was the 
first to be followed by a postseason road victory.[105] In November, he 
traveled to Japan to take part in the Major League Baseball Japan All-Star 
Series.[106][107] Young was the starter in an exhibition game against the 
Yomiuri Giants, which was memorable for the major leaguers' three-run ninth-inning 
rally to earn a tie.[108] This game was the prelude to the five-game series 
which began with three games at the Tokyo Dome and was followed by games 
in Osaka and Fukuoka.[109] Young pitched the fourth game of the series. 
Young also blogged on behalf of mlb.com about daily life during the trip. 
He detailed visits with United States Ambassador to Japan Tom Schieffer, 
time in the Harajuku, and travels on the Bullet Train.[106] In his season 
debut on April 4 against the San Francisco Giants, Young became the 435th 
different pitcher to surrender a home run to Barry Bonds when he surrendered 
Bonds' first of the season and 735th of his career.[110] The game marked 
Young's 25th consecutive road start without a loss.[110] Young was 9–0 
during the streak, which ended in his subsequent road start on April 15 
at Dodger Stadium in a 9–3 loss to the Los Angeles Dodgers.[87][111] The 
last of the nine other pitchers to go 20 consecutive road starts without 
a loss was Greg Maddux who went 22 starts without a loss during 1997 and 
1998.[112] Young's streak began on June 25, 2005.[87][112][113] On April 
10, Young signed a four-year extension with the Padres through the 2010 
season, reportedly worth US$14.5 million with a club option for 2011.[114] 
On June 16, Young threw a pitch that hit Chicago Cubs All-Star first baseman 
Derrek Lee on the back of the upper left arm.[115] The day before the fracas, 
Alfonso Soriano homered off David Wells, and the Padres believed Soriano 
showed poor sportsmanship by admiring and celebrating his home run.[115] 
The pitch nicked Lee's left hand near his surgically repaired wrist.[116][117] 
When the 6 ft 5 in (1.96 m) Lee began walking towards first base, both 
he and Young, 6 ft 10 in (2.08 m), exchanged words, and a bench-clearing 
altercation ensued.[117] Both Young and Lee were ejected from the game, 
along with Jake Peavy and Cubs bench coach Gerald Perry. On June 18, Young 
and Lee were suspended five games each for their roles in the brawl, and 
Perry was suspended three games. All suspended parties were fined, as were 
Peavy and Brian Giles.[118] Young and Lee appealed their suspensions, which 
were to begin the following day.[119][120] At the time of the scuffle in 
the fourth inning, both pitchers were working on no-hitters. Young was 
ejected in the game, and he earned a no-decision in the game which the 
Padres ultimately won 1–0.[121] On June 24, Jake Peavy surrendered three 
earned runs in five innings, which caused his ERA to rise from 1.98 to 
2.14.[122] This gave Young, who had a 2.08 ERA, the National League-leading 
average for one day. The next day, Brad Penny allowed only one earned run 
over eight innings to take the lead with a 2.04 ERA.[123] On July 1, Young 
was nominated as a candidate for the All-Star Final Vote, contending against 
Tom Gorzelanny, Roy Oswalt, Brandon Webb and Carlos Zambrano.[124] In a 
bid for the final spot on July 4, Young posted seven scoreless innings 
in a 1–0 victory over the Florida Marlins to not only retake the National 
League ERA lead, but also assume the major league lead over Brad Penny 
by a slim margin (1.9968 to 1.9970).[125] The voting ended on July 5, with 
Young defeating the four opposing pitchers to earn his first career All-Star 
Game selection.[2] The selection made Young the sixth Ivy League athlete 
named to the All-Star team (joining Lou Gehrig, Red Rolfe, Ron Darling, 
Brad Ausmus and Mike Remlinger).[126] Young entered the All-Star break 
with the major league lead in ERA and opponent batting average as well 
as an undefeated streak extending back to a May 12 loss to the Cardinals.[126][127] 
Prior to the announcement of his election, Young dropped his appeal of 
the five-game suspension.[128] Young served his suspension during the final 
four games before the All-Star break and the first game afterwards, yet 
was allowed to play in the All-Star Game at AT&T Park in San Francisco, 
California.[129] In the fifth inning of the 5–4 American League victory 
for which Young was the losing pitcher, he surrendered the first inside-the-park 
home run in All-Star game history to Ichiro Suzuki.[130] He was placed 
on the disabled list after he incurred a strained oblique muscle during 
the third inning of his July 24 start.[131] On August 9, he was activated 
off the disabled list to make a scheduled start. He took a 12-start (five-decision) 
undefeated streak,[132] dating back to a May 12 loss to the Cardinals,[133] 
into his first start off the disabled list, but he took the loss in a 5–0 
defeat, which was again against the Cardinals.[134] Young ended the 2007 
season as the major league leader in opponent batting average and hits 
per nine innings, but also in stolen bases allowed (with 44). He battled 
injuries late in the season and surrendered the ERA leadership to Jake 
Peavy in his August 30 start.[135] Young started the season in the second 
spot in the Padres rotation between ace Peavy and Maddux. He pitched his 
first three turns from the second spot in the rotation. On April 18, he 
missed his turn and Maddux moved into the second spot in the rotation. 
Young has since been pitching in the third spot in the rotation.[136][137] 
The number three spot in the rotation is the only one that was not scheduled 
to start during the Padres visit to Wrigley Field May 12–15, 2008. Young, 
thus, did not make a start against the Cubs with whom he had an altercation 
in 2007. On May 21, 2008 in a game against the St. Louis Cardinals, Young 
was hit in the face by a line-drive from Albert Pujols. Young was sitting 
on the ground for several minutes but was able to leave the field under 
his own power as he only sustained a nasal fracture and a laceration on 
his nose. Later in the same inning, Pujols would also sprain the ankle 
of Padres catcher Josh Bard while sliding into home plate.[138] Young returned 
to the mound on July 29 with five shutout innings against the Arizona Diamondbacks.[139] 
Young then did not pitch between August 10 and September 1 due to another 
disabled list stint and returned to the lineup to take the loss in a game 
where Greg Maddux, who had become a Los Angeles Dodger, earned his 354th 
victory to tie Roger Clemens for eighth on the all-time list.[140] Then, 
on September 7 he came within four outs of perfection when Milwaukee Brewers' 
Gabe Kapler hit a one-out home run in the eighth inning. He allowed two 
hits, did not walk a batter and struck out five, en route to 10–1 victory 
at Milwaukee's Miller Park. Young did not get his first perfect game or 
first no-hitter, but he did end up with the first complete game of his 
career after 114 starts.[46][141] Two starts later he hit his first home 
run as a major league batter.[142] After starting the season with a 4–2 
record, Young lost his last four starts before spending the remainder of 
the season on the disabled list. His final start occurred on June 14.[143] 
He was initially placed on the 15-day disabled list on June 19, but on 
July 31 he was transferred to the 60-day disabled list.[144] In August, 
he had season ending arthroscopic surgery to repair partial tears in his 
labrum. He had been disabled with shoulder inflammation.[145] Young pitched 
six shutout innings in the second game of the season before being pulled 
with a right shoulder strain.[146] He missed almost the entire season except 
for three starts near the end of the season, finishing the season 2–0 with 
a 0.90 ERA.[146] In November, the Padres declined to pick up the option 
for 2011.[146] In 2010, he was chosen as the eighth-smartest athlete in 
sports by Sporting News.[147] On January 17, 2011, Young signed a contract 
with the New York Mets worth $1.1 million with the ability to reach up 
to $4.5 million through incentives.[148] In his first career start with 
the Mets on April 5, 2011, Young went five and a third innings while striking 
out seven batters, recording the victory in a 7–1 Mets win over the Philadelphia 
Phillies. He also went three for three at the plate with two runs batted 
in against Phillies starter Cole Hamels. In that game, Young became the 
first Mets pitcher in team history to record two hits in a single inning.[149] 
Shortly after the start of the season, Young sustained an arm injury which 
forced him to miss the remainder of the 2011 season on the disabled list.[150] 
Following the season, he was a free agent.[151] On March 26, 2012, Young 
signed on a minor league deal with the Mets. He had recently undergone 
surgery to repair a torn anterior capsule in his right shoulder.[152] He 
spent the first 33 days of the season on the triple A Buffalo Bisons' disabled 
list before being activated on May 10.[153] Young subsequently made three 
starts with the single A St. Lucie Mets on May 11, May 16 and 25 before 
being promoted back to Buffalo on May 27.[154][155][156] He compiled a 
1–0 record with 3.18 ERA in 17.0 innings during the three starts.[153] 
On May 31, he pitched 6 scoreless innings for the Bisons against the Columbus 
Clippers.[157][158] The Mets announced on June 4 that they would call Young 
up to the major league roster on June 5.[159] On June 5, 2012, Young made 
his return against the Washington Nationals at Nationals Park with the 
Mets, giving up 3 runs (2 earned) over 5 innings in a game that was eventually 
decided in 12 innings.[160] On June 6 his wife gave birth and he was placed 
on a paternity leave, which was not intended to interfere with his June 
10 scheduled start.[161][162] The move was for the purpose of freeing up 
a roster spot during Young's off days under a Major League Baseball rule 
that allows for a three-day leave.[163] Young made his next start on June 
12 against the Tampa Bay Rays, earning his first win in over a year.[164] 
On February 21, 2013, Young signed a minor league deal with the Washington 
Nationals and an invitation to training camp.[165][166] On March 26, 2013 
he was granted his unconditional release by the Nationals after opting 
out of his contract.[167] He was re-signed by the Nationals on April 4, 
2013.[168] He was then assigned to Triple-A Syracuse. He made his season 
debut on April 23 against Rochester, giving up 6 runs in 4.2 innings. He 
made 6 additional starts before going on the disabled list with a neck 
injury on May 28, 2 days after leaving a start against Columbus after the 
first inning. He made 2 starts at the end of the year in the Gulf Coast 
League and with Short-Season Auburn before the end of the injury-marred 
season. In 9 total starts, he went 1–2 with a 6.81 ERA, striking out 21 
in 37 innings.[169] After experiencing pain in his shoulder and neck, he 
had surgery to repair what was diagnosed as thoracic outlet syndrome. This 
condition is a nerve problem that puts pressure on a pitcher's shoulder.[170] 
On November 19, 2013, Young re-signed with the Nationals on a minor league 
deal.[171] He was released on March 25, 2014.[172] Young signed a highly 
incentivized one-year deal with the Seattle Mariners on March 27, 2014.[173] 
Young was scheduled to debut as a starter for the Mariners on April 4.[174] 
However, the Oakland Coliseum had its first rainout since 1998.[175] As 
a result, after 159 Major League starts and 102 Minor League starts, Young 
made his first appearance as a relief pitcher (other than the 2007 All-Star 
Game) and he pitched two shutout innings on April 6 against the Oakland 
A's later in that series.[176][177] He made his first Major League start 
since September 9, 2012 on April 13 against Oakland. He posted six scoreless 
innings, while scattering 4 hits and 3 walks.[178] By early June, Young 
was in the conversation for Major League Baseball Comeback Player of the 
Year Award, with a 5–2 start and 3.27 ERA, according to MLB.com's Adam 
Lewis. In helping to stabilize a rotation battered by injuries and ineffectual 
fifth starters, Mariners manager Lloyd McClendon was unabashed in his praise 
of the right-hander at the time, calling him a "godsend."[179] Young finished 
the season with a 12–9 record and a 3.65 ERA in 29 starts. His 7.8 hits 
per nine innings was the sixth in the AL. Following the season, Young was 
recognized with the Major League Baseball Comeback Player of the Year Award, 
The Sporting News American League Comeback Player of the Year Award, and 
Players Choice Comeback Player of the Year Award.[180][181][182] At the 
conclusion of the season, Young became a free agent.[183][184] On March 
7, 2015, Young signed with the Kansas City Royals.[185] Young entered the 
season in the long reliever role with the Royals.[186] He appeared in the 
Royals' sixth game on April 12 against the Los Angeles Angels with two 
scoreless innings as the Royals started the season 6–0.[187] Young made 
his first start with the Royals on May 1. He tossed five no-hit innings 
against the Detroit Tigers.[188] On June 16, Young posted 7 shutout innings 
and 3 runs batted in against the Milwaukee Brewers, becoming the first 
Royals pitcher to tally 3 RBI in a game since 1972.[189] After achieving 
a record of 8–6 with a 3.25 ERA through the end of July, Young was returned 
to the bullpen on July 31 after posting a 5.11 ERA over a 5-game stretch.[190][191] 
On September 27 (one day after his father died), Young made his first start 
since July 28 and pitched 5 no-hit innings against the Cleveland Indians.[192] 
On October 20, Young started and pitched 4 2/3 innings in a game 4 victory 
in the 2015 American League Championship Series against the Toronto Blue 
Jays.[193] It was Young's first postseason start since the 2006 National 
League Division Series.[194] He earned the win in the October 27 game 1 
of the 2015 World Series when he shut down the New York Mets, giving up 
a walk and no hits while striking out 4 over the final three innings, to 
help the Royals win 5–4 in 14 innings.[195][196] On December 7, 2015, the 
Royals announced that they had signed Young to a two-year $11.75 million 
contract with mutual third-year option.[197] After beginning the 2016 season 
with a record of 1-5 in 7 starts, Young was placed on the disabled list 
with a strained right forearm from May 12 to May 28.[198][199] Young is 
not a traditional power pitcher. He is said to be a control pitcher in 
a 6 feet 10 inches (2.08 m) power pitcher's body—his pitching style is 
more like Greg Maddux's than that of five-time Cy Young Award winner Randy 
Johnson, who is the same height as Young.[200] Young has been traded three 
times partly because of the low velocity of his fastball, which is in the 
83–87 miles per hour (133.6–140 km/h) range. Young has learned how to use 
precise location to make his fastball effective. He has also been compared 
to another control pitcher, Jim Palmer, because Young similarly induces 
popups and fly ball outs with deceptive late movement on his high fastballs.[201] 
Over 50% of the balls put in play against him are fly balls.[202] Of the 
flyballs hit off Young in 2007, 3.8% were home runs.[203] while the average 
is about 11%.[202] From 2003 to 2006 the best single-season percentage 
was 6.2% by Dontrelle Willis in 2005.[202] Young's mid-2000s repertoire 
included fastballs, curveballs, sliders and changeups. His curveball is 
a slow curveball and his 85 miles per hour (137 km/h) fastball has been 
described by former teammate and catcher Mike Piazza as having late life 
and late movement that seems to jump. His curveball is used to keep the 
hitters off balance so that they do not jump on his low-velocity fastball.[204] 
Former Ranger pitching coach Orel Hershiser says Young has the ability 
to throw his fastball to all locations effectively which gives him a chance 
at success. Hershiser describes Young's pitches as sneaky fast because 
his methodical delivery and size give him deception.[205] This delivery 
has also left him susceptible to stolen bases due to the relatively long 
time it takes for him to deliver a pitch from the stretch.[206] By 2012, 
nearly all of his pitches were fastballs or sliders.[207] As of the end 
of the 2015 season, Young has a career .150 batting average, including 
31 hits, eight of which were extra base hits (six doubles, one triple, 
and one home run). He has yet to record a stolen base. The only Princeton 
players who have hit a home run or recorded a stolen base at least once 
during their careers, along with Young, are Moe Berg, Dutch Sterrett, Homer 
Hillebrand, Dutch Meier, Ted Reed, Bobby Vaughn, and Will Venable. Venable 
is the most recent player to have accomplished the feat.[61] These same 
players join Young as Princeton alumni to have hit a home run.[61] Berg 
had been the last to do so before Young hit his home run on September 20, 
2008.[61][142] Young's wife, Elizabeth Patrick, is the granddaughter of 
Lester Patrick, who was the namesake of the National Hockey League's Patrick 
Division and the Lester Patrick Trophy.[3] She was also a member of the 
Princeton University class of 2002, and she attends law school in Washington, 
D.C.[44] On March 4, 2008, she was induced into labor four days before 
her due date to deliver a girl named Catherine Elizabeth.[208][209] In 
July 2010, the Youngs had their second child (first son), Scott Patrick.[210][211] 
On June 6, 2012, the Youngs had their third child, Grant Christopher.[163]
