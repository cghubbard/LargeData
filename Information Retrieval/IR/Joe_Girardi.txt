As player As coach As manager Joseph Elliott Girardi (born October 14, 
1964) is an American professional baseball manager for the New York Yankees 
of Major League Baseball (MLB). Formerly a catcher, Girardi played for 
the Chicago Cubs, the Colorado Rockies, the Yankees and the St. Louis Cardinals. 
In 2006, he managed the Florida Marlins and was named the National League 
Manager of the Year. Girardi, the fourth son of Jerry, a former blue collar 
worker and United States Air Force veteran,[1] and Angela Girardi, was 
born in Peoria, Illinois and grew up in East Peoria, Illinois.[2][3] He 
attended East Peoria's Neil Armstrong grade school; and Peoria's Sacred 
Heart/Father Sweeney, where he was coached in basketball by his father. 
He then attended Academy of Our Lady/Spalding Institute in Peoria, Illinois, 
where he played quarterback for the football team and catcher for the baseball 
team.[citation needed] He went on to play baseball at Northwestern University 
in Evanston, Illinois, where he earned a bachelor of science degree in 
industrial engineering. He was the first freshman to be elected president 
of a fraternity (Alpha Tau Omega) at Northwestern.[4] The Chicago Cubs 
drafted Girardi in the fifth round of the 1986 Major League Baseball draft. 
He spent four seasons in the Cubs minor leagues system before making his 
major league debut. In 1986, Girardi batted .309 in 68 games with the Peoria 
Chiefs of the Midwest League. In 1989, he also played for the Águilas del 
Zulia in the Venezuelan Winter League.[5] Girardi made his Major League 
debut for the Cubs on April 4, 1989. During his rookie year with the Cubs, 
Girardi batted .248 with a home run and 14 RBI in 59 games played. In 1990, 
he played in 133 games, batting .270 with a home run and 38 RBI. In 1991, 
he played in only 21 games, batting .191 with 6 RBI. In 1992, he played 
in 91 games, batting .270 with a home run and 12 RBI. The Cubs left Girardi 
unprotected in the 1992 expansion draft and the Colorado Rockies chose 
him. During his first year with the Rockies in 1993, he played in 86 games 
batting .290 with five triples, three home runs, and 31 RBI. In 1994, he 
played in 93 games batting .276 with four triples, four home runs, and 
34 RBI. In 1995, he played in 125 games batting .262 with a career-high 
8 home runs and 55 RBI. Girardi was traded in 1995 to the New York Yankees 
for pitcher Mike DeJean. On May 14, 1996, Girardi caught Dwight Gooden's 
no-hitter. Girardi played in 124 games during the 1996 season, batting 
.294 with 2 home runs and 45 RBI. In Game 6 of the 1996 World Series, Girardi 
hit an RBI triple off of Greg Maddux that eventually led the Yankees winning 
the World Series for the first time since 1978. When the Yankees made 25-year-old 
prospect Jorge Posada his backup, Girardi became his mentor.[6] The two 
catchers split time for the Yankees through 1999.[7] In 1997, Girardi played 
in 112 games batting .264 with a home run and 50 RBI. During the World 
Series-winning 1998 season, he played in 78 games batting .276 with 3 home 
runs and 31 RBI. On July 18, 1999, Girardi caught David Cone's perfect 
game. During the World Series-winning 1999 season, Girardi played in 65 
games batting .239 with 2 home runs and 27 RBI. In 2000, Girardi left the 
Yankees and returned to the Cubs, where he was named to that year's All-Star 
team, his first and only All-Star appearance as a player. (He was manager 
of the 2010 American League All-Star team.) During the 2000 season, Girardi 
played in 106 games batting .278 with 6 home runs and 40 RBI. In 2001, 
he played in 78 games batting .253 with 3 home runs and 25 RBI. On June 
22, 2002, St. Louis Cardinals player Darryl Kile was found dead in his 
hotel room prior to a nationally televised game against the Cubs at Wrigley 
Field. Minutes after the game's scheduled start time, a tearful Girardi 
announced to the crowd that the game was canceled by Commissioner of Baseball 
Bud Selig "because of a tragedy in the Cardinal family", without mentioning 
Kile's death.[8][9] Overall, during 2002, Girardi batted .226 with a home 
run and 26 RBI in 90 games played. In 2003, Girardi played for the Cardinals. 
He only appeared in 16 games with a .130 average and an RBI. Girardi retired 
from playing after the season was over. After a spring training stint with 
the Yankees in 2004, Girardi retired and became a commentator for the YES 
Network. He hosted the youth-oriented Yankees on Deck, received good reviews 
and was offered a larger role on 2005 Yankee broadcasts. But he rejected 
that offer, as well as an offer by Florida Marlins to become the bench 
coach with a guarantee to become the team's manager in 2006, although he 
subsequently got that job. Instead, he became the Yankees' bench coach. 
He managed a game during a Joe Torre suspension, a loss to the Kansas City 
Royals. Girardi remained the host of Kids on Deck in 2005, having shot 
his shows before spring training. During games, YES promoted Kids on Deck 
by showing Girardi sitting in the dugout during breaks in the game.[10] 
Girardi worked games three, four and five of the 2006 World Series for 
Fox as part of the network's pregame and postgame team, along with host 
Jeanne Zelasko and regular analyst Kevin Kennedy. After fielding managerial 
offers for the 2007 season, Girardi instead came to terms with the YES 
network to return to the broadcast booth for 60-plus games as a Yankees 
analyst and co-host a new show on the network, Behind The Plate, with John 
Flaherty, also a former Yankee catcher.[11] Girardi also served as color 
commentator for the No.2 booth (usually with Thom Brennaman) on Major League 
Baseball on Fox. After the 2005 regular season, Girardi was named the manager 
of the Marlins, replacing departed manager Jack McKeon. His first notable 
action as manager was to prohibit facial hair, a policy similar to that 
of Yankees owner George Steinbrenner.[12] Girardi managed the team to a 
78–84 record[13] and a wild-card contention even though the team had the 
lowest payroll in Major League Baseball.[14] At $15 million, the Marlins' 
2006 payroll was lower than the salaries of several MLB players. However, 
Girardi was nearly fired in early August when he got into an argument with 
Marlins owner Jeffrey Loria during a game. According to witnesses and video 
footage, the Marlins owner was heckling home plate umpire Larry Vanover. 
When the umpire warned Girardi about the harassment, Girardi and his bench 
coach Gary Tuck then turned to Loria and told him to stop. Loria had to 
be talked out of firing Girardi immediately after the game.[15] On October 
3, 2006, the Marlins announced that they had fired Girardi, despite him 
winning 2006 Manager of the Year. Girardi said only that he appreciated 
the opportunity to manage the club. Girardi was thought to be among the 
leading candidates to replace New York Yankees manager Joe Torre after 
they lost in the 2006 American League Division Series, but Torre remained 
with the team. Girardi was also a candidate for the Cubs' manager position, 
to succeed Dusty Baker; he interviewed for the job just days after leaving 
the Marlins. With his playing experience in Chicago, he was considered 
a front-runner for the position.[16] However, the Cubs chose to go with 
veteran manager Lou Piniella. Girardi took himself out of the running for 
the Washington Nationals' managerial job shortly thereafter and returned 
to the broadcast booth for the YES Network in 2007. He said taking another 
managerial job would have meant a third move in as many years for his family.[17] 
Despite Girardi's firing, he was rewarded for his achievements with the 
Marlins in 2006 with the National League Manager of the Year Award and 
Sporting News Manager of the Year Award for the National League. In June 
2007, after the Baltimore Orioles fired manager Sam Perlozzo, Girardi interviewed 
for and was offered the job but turned it down.[18] When the Yankees' managerial 
position became vacant after the 2007 season, the Yankees interviewed Girardi, 
Tony Peña, and Don Mattingly. On October 29, 2007, Girardi was reported 
to be the Yankees' choice[19] and the next day he signed a three-year contract, 
reportedly worth about $7.5 million.[20] Girardi chose to wear number 27 
to signify his wish to lead the Yankees to their 27th world championship.[21] 
Girardi is a health enthusiast and has a ban on sweets such as ice cream 
and soda in the clubhouse.[22] On August 2, 2008, Girardi participated 
in his first Old Timer's Day, the last such game played at the original 
Yankee Stadium. Girardi participated in the next Old Timer's Day on July 
19, 2009, the first in the new Yankee Stadium, as well as every one since 
then. Girardi's first year as a Yankees manager was unsuccessful as the 
team was eliminated from postseason contention for the first time since 
1993, finishing 2008 with a 89–73 record, 3rd in the AL East. In 2009, 
his second year as manager, the Yankees were a much improved team. He led 
the Yankees to their 40th AL pennant and their 27th World Series title 
(defeating the Philadelphia Phillies), his first World Series title as 
manager and the Yankees' first since 2000. Before the 2010 season, Girardi 
changed his number to 28. Newly acquired center-fielder Curtis Granderson 
had worn 28, but agreed to change his number to 14.[23] Following the 2010 
season, Girardi and the Yankees agreed to a three-year deal to keep him 
as the Yankees' manager.[24] Some predicted that the 2011 Yankees would 
finish behind the Boston Red Sox due to Boston's high-profile free agency 
moves and the Yankees lack of action. The Yankees season was plagued by 
injuries that caused disabled list stints for several key players. Despite 
the setbacks, Girardi managed to lead the team to the AL East title. Rob 
Parker of ESPN commended Girardi's performance and felt his efforts were 
deserving of American League Manager of the Year, but felt he would not 
get the award due to the Yankees high payroll and what Parker alleges is 
an anti-Yankee bias.[25] The Yankees were defeated by the Detroit Tigers 
3–2 in the divisional round.[26] On June 15, 2012, Girardi won his 500th 
game as a manager.[27] Eventually, the Yankees reached the playoffs and 
defeated the Baltimore Orioles 3–2 in the first round but were swept by 
the Detroit Tigers in the 2012 ALCS on October 18, 2012. Girardi's 2013 
season was marred by numerous player injuries and controversies, resulting 
in the Yankees finishing 85-77 (tied 3rd in AL East) and missing the postseason 
for only the second time after five years. On October 10, 2013, Girardi 
signed a four-year deal worth $16 million to remain as manager of the New 
York Yankees.[28] In 2014, the Yankees finished 84-78, (2nd place in AL 
East) and did not qualify for the postseason for the second straight year. 
In 2015, a year the Yankees had low expectations, but finished the year 
87-75, (2nd place again in AL East), clinching the top wild card spot which 
marks the team's first playoff appearance since 2012, but losing to the 
Houston Astros in the 2015 American League Wild Card Game. On May 21, 2016, 
Girardi managed his 1,500th game. Girardi and his wife Kim live in Purchase, 
New York, and have three children.[29] Girardi is of Italian descent and 
is a devout Christian.[30] While driving home after winning the 2009 World 
Series, Girardi stopped to help a car crash victim on a dangerous blind 
curve of the Cross County Parkway in Eastchester, New York. Police said 
Girardi put his own life at risk while trying to help the driver who had 
just crashed into a wall. The driver said she had no idea who Girardi was 
until the responding officers identified him. The next day, Girardi said, 
"I think the most important thing is that, obviously, there's a lot of 
joy in what we do, but we can't forget to be human beings when we help 
others out."[31][32] On October 6, 2012, during the 2012 ALDS against the 
Baltimore Orioles, Girardi's father Jerry Girardi died at the age of 81. 
He had been battling Alzheimer's disease and spent the past several years 
in an assisted care facility.[33] His mother had died from cancer while
