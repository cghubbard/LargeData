In 1943 and earlier, several stations carried the White Sox simultaneously. 
The team allowed as many stations as desired to carry their games, although 
probably not all stations carried all games, especially road games. For 
example, in 1931, Sox games aired on WIBO, WMAQ, WGN, WENR, and WCFL. Announcers 
for stations other than WGN and WMAQ are unknown. Exclusive radio rights 
weren't awarded by the Sox until 1944. Station frequencies and call letters 
are accurate for the years of their White Sox broadcasts. Due to the North 
American Regional Broadcasting Agreement that took effect on March 29, 
1941, WBBM moved from 770 to 780 kHz, WENR/WLS moved from 870 to 890, WCFL 
moved from 970 to 1000 and WJJD moved from 1130 to 1160. Most American 
and Canadian stations above 730 kHz changed frequencies on this date. WJJD 
was a daytime-only station the years they had the White Sox radio rights. 
Night games were carried on WIND, WFMF, WBKI, and WCFL as listed above. 
Station frequencies and call letters are accurate for the years of their 
White Sox broadcasts. WBBS-TV and WPWR-TV shared Channel 60 and carried 
SportsVision programming in 1982 and 1983. In 1984, SportsVision programming 
was carried by ON-TV on WSNS-TV Ch. 44. All broadcasts were scrambled. 
SportsVision became a cable and satellite station in 1985 when ON-TV ceased 
operations. It changed its name to SportsChannel Chicago in 1989 and Fox
