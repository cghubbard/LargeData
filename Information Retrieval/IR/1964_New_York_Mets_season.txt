The 1964 New York Mets season was the third regular season for the Mets. 
They went 53–109 and finished 10th in the NL, 40 games behind the World 
Series Champion St. Louis Cardinals. They were managed by Casey Stengel. 
They played home games at Shea Stadium, which opened on April 17 of that 
year. One high point of Shea Stadium's first season came on Father's Day, 
when Philadelphia Phillies pitcher Jim Bunning threw a perfect game against 
the Mets, the first in the National League since 1880. For perhaps the 
only time in the stadium's history, the Shea faithful found themselves 
rooting for the visitors, caught up in the rare achievement, and roaring 
for Bunning on every pitch in the ninth inning.[2] His strikeout of John 
Stephenson capped the performance. Another high point was Shea Stadium's 
hosting of the All-Star Game. Johnny Callison's ninth-inning three-run 
home run off Dick Radatz capped a four-run rally and gave the National 
League a 7–4 win over the American League in that game, which evened the 
series at seventeen wins for each league. The stadium also saw pitcher 
Masanori Murakami of the San Francisco Giants become the first Japanese 
player to appear in the Major Leagues. He entered the game in the ninth 
inning of the Giants' 4–1 loss to the Mets Unexpectedly thrust into the 
spotlight in the final hectic weekend of the 1964 season, the Mets relished 
the role of spoiler, beating the Cardinals in St. Louis on Friday and Saturday 
(keeping alive the hopes of the Phillies, Giants, and Reds) before succumbing 
to the eventual National League champions on Sunday. The Mets' new home 
park was originally to be called "Flushing Meadows Stadium" – the name 
of the public park on which it was built – but a movement was launched 
to name it in honor of William A. Shea, the man who brought National League 
baseball back to New York. After 29 months and $28.5 million, Shea Stadium 
opened on April 17, 1964, with the Mets losing to the Pittsburgh Pirates, 
led by Roberto Clemente and Bill Mazeroski, 4–3 before a crowd of 50,312.[8] 
Shea was a circular stadium, with the grandstand forming a perfect circle 
around the field and ending a short distance beyond the foul lines. The 
remainder of the perimeter was mostly empty space beyond the outfield fences. 
This space was occupied by the bullpens, the scoreboard, and the centerfield 
"batter's eye" backdrop. The stadium boasted 54 restrooms, 21 escalators 
and seats for 57,343. It was big, airy, sparkling, with a massive 86' x 
175' scoreboard. Also, rather than the standard light towers, Shea had 
lamps along its upper reaches, like a convoy of semis with their brights 
on, which gave the field that unique high-wattage glow. Praised for its 
convenience, even its elegance, Shea was deemed a showplace.[9] Infielders
