The St. Louis Cardinals' 2010 season was the 129th season for the franchise 
in St. Louis, Missouri and the 119th season in the National League. The 
Cardinals began their season on the road against the Cincinnati Reds on 
April 5. St. Louis was coming off a 91-71 (.562) season and first place 
in the NL Central, followed by a quick playoff exit when they were swept 
in the NLDS versus Los Angeles. In 2010, however, the Cardinals fell back 
to the same record of 2008 (86-76), finishing second in the NL Central 
to the Reds by five games. On October 26, 2009, Tony La Russa agreed to 
come back for a 15th season as manager of the Cardinals, thus extending 
his record for longest-serving manager in Cardinal history. Pitching coach 
and long-time LaRussa partner Dave Duncan, who earlier in 2009 had expressed 
displeasure with the franchise after his son Chris was traded, also agreed 
to return. However, hitting coach Hal McRae was fired after five seasons 
with the Cardinals and replaced with former Cardinal and former home run 
champion Mark McGwire. McGwire's hiring as hitting coach marked the slugger's 
first job in baseball since his retirement eight years prior. It was also 
his return to the public eye following his implication as a steroids user 
in Jose Canseco's book and his controversial 2005 appearance at the United 
States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform's inquiry into 
the steroid scandal.[1] The Cardinals announced on November 30 that backup 
catcher Jason LaRue was signed to a third season. It was LaRue's third 
straight one-year deal with St. Louis.[2] Mark DeRosa, acquired from the 
Indians via an in-season trade in 2009, left St. Louis via free agency, 
signing with the San Francisco Giants on Dec. 28.[3] Troy Glaus, who hit 
27 home runs as the third baseman for the 2008 Cardinals but was limited 
to 29 at-bats at the end of 2009 due to a shoulder injury, signed a contract 
with the Atlanta Braves on Jan 5 after passing a physical.[4] Rick Ankiel, 
who started 2009 as the everyday center fielder but lost his starting job 
and struggled to a .285 OBP for the season, signed a one-year deal with 
the Kansas City Royals on Jan. 21.[5] The same day, Khalil Greene, who 
started 2009 as the everyday shortstop for St. Louis but was sidelined 
with social anxiety disorder, signed a one-year deal to be a utility infielder 
for the Texas Rangers.[6] On Jan 7 the Cardinals announced that they had 
signed their 2009 trade deadline acquisition, left fielder Matt Holliday, 
to a seven-year $120 mil. deal with the Cardinals.[7] It is the largest 
contract in club history, surpassing Albert Pujols seven-year $100 mil. 
deal in 2004.[8] The contract includes a full no-trade clause, an average 
$17.0M per year salary through 2016, and a $17M vesting option for 2017 
which will occur if he makes the Top 10 in the 2016 MVP voting. The buyout 
on the vesting option is $1M, making the total contract worth $120M.[7] 
His uniform number changes from 15 to 7.[9] On Feb 27 the Cardinals completed 
a one-year deal with infielder Felipe López. Lopez, who hit .385 in a two-month 
stint with the 2008 Cardinals, was anticipated to fill a utility role.[10] 
The acquisition of Lopez led the Cardinals to deal their other utility 
infielder, Julio Lugo, to the Baltimore Orioles for a player to be named 
later.[11] On Nov 4 St. Louis released Brad Thompson, who made his debut 
for the Cardinals in 2005 and was one of only six players remaining from 
the 2006 World Series champion Cardinals.[12] Starting pitcher Joel Piñeiro, 
who had a career year for the 2009 Cardinals (3.49 ERA, 1.145 WHIP), capitalized 
by signing with the Anaheim Angels for two years and $16 million on Jan. 
20.[13] Starter Todd Wellemeyer, who struggled badly for the 2009 Cardinals, 
signed a minor-league deal with the Giants in February.[14] On December 
8 the Cardinals announced the finalization of a deal to sign Brad Penny, 
who spent 2009 as a starter for the Red Sox and Giants, to a one-year deal 
for $7.5 million with an additional $1.5 million in incentives.[15][16] 
The Cardinals were 15-14 (.517) in 2010 compared to 19-12-2 (.613) [Team 
BA: .290; Team ERA: 4.35] in 2009's spring exhibitions. Attendance at Roger 
Dean Stadium was 96,910 for 14 games, averaging 6,922 per game.[17] Jaime 
García, a Cardinal draft pick who underwent Tommy John surgery in 2008 
after a cup of coffee with the big-league club, won the fifth-starter role 
in spring training.[18] David Freese won the starting job at third base.[19] 
Allen Craig, Joe Mather and Nick Stavinoha filled out the Cardinal bench. 
On March 24, Yadier Molina suffered a right oblique muscle strain sliding 
into second base. Molina, batting .314 (11-for-35) at the time of his injury, 
missed the rest of spring training[20] but was ready for Opening Day.[21] 
The Cardinals opened 2010 on April 5, on the road at Cincinnati. St. Louis 
won 11-6 on six effective innings from Chris Carpenter. Albert Pujols had 
two home runs. Colby Rasmus had a home run, and robbed Scott Rolen of a 
home run. Yadier Molina hit a grand slam home run, and became only the 
third Cardinals ever to do so on opening day. The other two Cardinals to 
ever do so, Mark McGwire and Scott Rolen, were also in attendance.[22] 
In the home opener on April 12, St. Louis beat Houston 5-0 behind a three-run 
home run from Pujols and eight shutout innings from Adam Wainwright.[23] 
Jason LaRue became the first Cardinal to go on the disabled list on April 
14, after suffering a strained hamstring. Bryan Anderson was called up 
from the minors to replace him on the roster.[24] On April 17 the Cardinals 
and Mets played a memorable game at Busch Stadium lasting 20 innings. The 
game lasted 6 hours and 53 minutes, ending with a 2-1 Mets' victory. This 
was only the 42nd game in baseball history that lasted as long as 20 innings.[25] 
Backup outfielder Joe Mather took the loss after pitching and giving up 
a run in the 19th and 20th, after utility infielder Felipe López pitched 
a scoreless 18th. The Mets left 13 on-base, while the Cardinals stranded 
22.[26][27][28] Lopez went on the DL on April 26. He had been suffering 
from elbow discomfort since April 11 but did not report the issue until 
two days after he pitched an inning against the Mets on April 17. Concurrent 
with Lopez's trip to the DL, the Cardinals sent Allen Craig to Memphis, 
recalled infielder Tyler Greene, and called up for his big-league debut 
Jon Jay, their second pick in the 2006 draft.[29] Buoyed by excellent pitching 
from 4/5 of their starting rotation (Lohse's 6.55 ERA for April made him 
the only Cardinal starter who didn't come in under 3.50 for the month), 
the Cardinals only lost one series in all of April, and they finished the 
month at 15-8, and in first place in the Central Division. The Cardinals 
fell into a severe slump in early May. St. Louis lost 3 of 4 on the road 
to the East-leading Phillies, then, after taking two of three from Pittsburgh, 
returned home and were swept in three games by the Houston Astros, who 
were the worst team in the league prior to the series.[30] A victory against 
the Reds with first place on the line included a two-run homer by Pujols, 
snapping a nine-game team homerless streak. However, subsequent losses 
to the Reds on May 15 and 16 knocked the Cardinals out of first place for 
the first time all season. On May 17, Felipe López came off the DL and 
entered the starting lineup at shortstop. Brendan Ryan was demoted to a 
utility role due to a season-long slump that saw his average slide to .162 
at the time he lost the starting job.[31] In another effort to kickstart 
a stagnating offense on that same day, manager LaRussa switched Pujols 
and Matt Holliday in the lineup, with Holliday batting third and Pujols 
fourth. It was the first time Pujols had hit somewhere other than third 
in the lineup since May 30, 2003, but the change was short-lived, lasting 
only five days. Brad Penny hit a grand slam in the third inning that proved 
decisive in St. Louis's 9-5 victory over the Anaheim Angels on May 21—but 
suffered a strained lat muscle in his back, apparently on the swing, and 
left the game immediately.[32] The next day he went on the DL, and P. J. 
Walters was called up to take his place.[33] St. Louis lost a second starting 
pitcher five days after Penny, when Kyle Lohse went to the DL on May 27 
(retroactive to May 23), after being diagnosed with exertional compartment 
syndrome in his right (pitching) arm. Fernando Salas was called up from 
Memphis to replace Lohse on the roster.[34] Shortly thereafter further 
roster moves resulted in the demotion of Joe Mather and Salas, and the 
promotion of two pitchers making their major league debuts: former Cardinals 
first-round draft pick Adam Ottavino and minor-league veteran Evan MacLane.[35] 
The roster shuffling continued on May 31, when MacLane was sent back down 
without appearing in a game and Allen Craig was recalled.[36] The Cardinals 
offense continued to stall. On May 25 and 26 St. Louis lost consecutive 
games in San Diego by scores of 1-0 and 2-1. Both games were decided on 
home runs by Jerry Hairston, Jr., who had zero home runs in 2010 entering 
the series. An 8-3 Cardinal victory on May 27 in the third game of the 
series featured Pujols' first home run since May 14 and only his second 
of the month.[37] Three days later, on May 30, Pujols exploded out of his 
power slump by hitting three home runs in a 9-1 victory over the Cubs in 
Wrigley Field. It was the fourth three-homer game of his career and his 
first since 2006.[38][39] The suddenly surging Cardinal offense delivered 
a 12-4 victory over the Reds on May 31 that gave St. Louis a winning record 
for May (15-14) and put the Cardinals back into a first-place tie with 
Cincinnati. On June 1, the Cardinals promoted Aaron Miles from Memphis 
and sent Allen Craig down.[40] Miles, who played for St. Louis from 2006 
through 2008, and was a member of the 2006 World Series champion Cardinals, 
signed a minor-league contract with St. Louis in the spring. Further bench 
maneuvering took place on June 5, when the Cardinals signed veteran outfielder 
Randy Winn, recently designated for assignment by the Yankees. Jon Jay 
was sent back down to Memphis to make room, and pitcher Kyle Lohse was 
sent to the 60-day DL.[41] Adam Wainwright threw a complete game two-hitter 
on June 4, and the Cardinals beat the Brewers 8-0, retaking sole possession 
of first place. It was the first shutout of Wainwright's career.[42] Jason 
Motte's outing on June 6, in which he took the loss in a 5-4, 10-inning 
defeat by the Brewers, snapped his streak of 32 consecutive batters retired. 
Motte was nine batters shy of the reliever record of 41 straight set by 
Bobby Jenks.,[43] and 13 shy of the major league record of 45 set by Mark 
Buehrle. Seeking to shore up a rotation with gaping holes in the back end 
after the loss of Penny and Lohse, St. Louis acquired pitcher Jeff Suppan, 
a veteran of the 2006 World Series champion Cardinals and the MVP of the 
2006 NLCS.[44] Suppan, increasingly ineffective since he left St. Louis 
for the Milwaukee Brewers following the World Series victory, had an ERA 
of 7.84 when he was released by the Brewers in early June.[45] On June 
30, Albert Pujols had his 37th career multihomer game at Busch Stadium 
tying Stan Musial's franchise record by a Cardinals' player.[46] David 
Freese went on the DL on June 30 with a bone bruise on his ankle. Freese 
suffered the injury on June 5 and had been playing in pain all month.[47] 
The Cardinals, slowed by nagging injuries to Freese and Ludwick, plagued 
by poor performances from the back end of their rotation, and further weighed 
down by the season-long slumps of Ryan, Schumaker and Molina, treaded water 
in June, going 13-13 to finish the month at 43-35. On July 3, Ryan Ludwick 
went on the DL after he aggravated a prior left calf strain while exercising 
on a treadmill, and outfielder Jon Jay was recalled to take his place.[48] 
MLB announced rosters for the 2010 Major League Baseball All-Star Game 
on July 4, and five Cardinals made the NL team. Albert Pujols led the National 
League in votes.[49] Yadier Molina was voted starting catcher for the NL 
squad despite having one of the worst seasons of his career, with a .229 
batting average on the day the rosters were announced. Chris Carpenter 
and Adam Wainwright were named to the pitching staff, and Matt Holliday 
was selected as a reserve.[50] In the game, played in Anaheim on July 13, 
Pujols was 0-for-2, Molina was 1-for-1 with a single, Holliday singled 
and scored, Wainwright pitched a scoreless seventh, but Carpenter was held 
back in reserve and did not pitch. Holliday scored on a three-run double 
by the Braves' Brian McCann that won the All-Star Game, 3-1, giving the 
National League their first win since the 1996. On July 6, in Colorado, 
the Cardinals suffered one of the worst ninth-inning collapses in franchise 
history. Leading 9-3 going into the bottom of the ninth, Dennys Reyes and 
Ryan Franklin combined to give up nine runs to the Rockies, with Seth Smith's 
three-run walk-off homer capping an amazing 12-9 Colorado victory. It was 
the first time in 51 years that the Cardinals allowed nine runs in the 
ninth inning, and the first time St. Louis lost a game it led by seven 
runs or more since 1998.[51] It also was the first time all season the 
Cardinals lost a game when they were leading after eight innings. Previously, 
they were a perfect 38-0. The next night, the Cardinals followed up that 
collapse by blowing leads of 5-0 and 7-4, losing to the Rockies 8-7 on 
another walk-off homer, this one by Chris Iannetta.[52] After the Rockies 
completed a three-game sweep the next day, the Cardinals traveled to Houston 
and took two of three to go into the All-Star Break with a 47-41 record, 
one game behind the first-place Cincinnati Reds. St. Louis won its last 
game before the break against Houston (Jul. 11), then came out and won 
seven in a row against the Dodgers and Phillies (Jul. 15–21) before losing 
the last home game in that stand 2-0 in 11 inn. The eight-game win streak 
was the longest by the Cardinals since the 105-win NL champions of 2004 
won nine in a row.[53] The Cardinals vaulted past Cincinnati and back into 
first place in the NL Central Division by 1½ games. Ryan Ludwick was activated 
from the DL on July 24, after having missed a month due to his calf injury.[54] 
One week later, on July 31, Ludwick was traded at the non-waiver deadline 
to the San Diego Padres as part of a three-way deal. The Cardinals received 
minor league left-hand pitcher Nick Greenwood from the Padres and coveted 
starting pitcher Jake Westbrook from Cleveland along with cash considerations. 
Minor-league pitcher Corey Kluber went from the Padres to the Indians to 
complete the deal.[55] The Cardinals went 15-11 in July, their best month 
since April, and ended the month at 58-46 and a half-game ahead of the 
persistent Reds in the NL Central. On August 3, David Freese, the everyday 
third baseman who missed more than a month after an ankle injury, re-injured 
the ankle and was sidelined for the rest of the year.[56] More bad news 
came the next day, when key reliever Jason Motte was placed on the DL with 
a right shoulder sprain.[57] Freese underwent reconstructive surgery on 
his right ankle the day after that, and will need six months of rehabilitation, 
leaving him uncertain for spring training in February 2011.[58] On Aug 
6, Adam Wainwright pitched one of the best games of his career, throwing 
a complete game two-hit shutout to beat the Marlins, 7-0. Pujols hit his 
28th home run (a 3-run shot) in the first inning, then added a fourth RBI 
later to grab the NL RBI lead with 82. The victory upped Wainwright's record 
to 16-6 (second in NL), and dropped his ERA to 2.07 (second in NL).[59] 
On August 10, the Cardinals and Reds had a nasty brawl at Great American 
Ball Park in Cincinnati. One day after Reds second baseman Brandon Phillips 
proclaimed "I really hate the Cardinals", Phillips and Yadier Molina had 
an argument at home plate that escalated into a bench-clearing brawl.[60] 
Jason LaRue suffered a severe concussion after being kicked in the face 
by Reds pitcher Johnny Cueto, leading the Cardinals to call up minor-league 
catcher Steven Hill for his big-league debut. Jeff Suppan was placed on 
the DL with groin soreness unrelated to the brawl.[61] The Cardinals swept 
the Reds in three games, dealing Cincinnati its first series loss since 
the All-Star Break[61] and retaking sole possession of first place in the 
NL Central. In the third game, Wainwright held the Reds to two hits over 
seven shutout innings, dropping his ERA to 1.99.[62] LaRue, still suffering 
from his concussion, was sent to the DL on the 13th.[63] Suspensions and 
fines for the brawl were announced on Aug. 12. Managers Dusty Baker and 
Tony La Russa each received two-game suspensions, and the Reds' pitcher 
Johnny Cueto was suspended for seven games, with Molina and Carpenter of 
the Cardinals fined along with the Reds' Brandon Phillips and Russ Springer. 
Bench coach Joe Pettini will be the acting manager.[64] Starting pitcher 
Kyle Lohse came off the DL almost three months after undergoing right forearm 
surgery to pitch the August 15 matchup against the Cubs.[65] He pitched 
as poorly in that game as he did in April and May, and the Cardinals lost 
9-7 to the Cubs.[66] In that same game, Albert Pujols hit his 30th home 
run, extending his own major league record by hitting 30 or more home runs 
in 10 consecutive seasons starting with his rookie year.[67] After Freese's 
season-ending injury and a horrific slump by substitute 3b Felipe López, 
who was batting .165 since July 22,[68] the Cardinals acquired Pedro Feliz 
from the Houston Astros on Aug. 19. The Cardinals also received cash considerations 
while the Astros received minor-league pitcher David Carpenter. Feliz was 
hitting .221 at the time of the trade. To make room on the roster, Jason 
LaRue was moved to the 60-day DL, officially ending his 2010 season except 
for the possibility of post-season play.[69] The team suffered badly after 
their big sweep of Cincinnati (Aug. 9–11) with a season-high five-game 
losing streak that dropped them to 4½ games behind the Reds for the NL 
Central title, and three games behind the Phillies in the wild-card race.[70] 
On August 26, Albert Pujols hit his 400th career home run in Washington, 
becoming the third-youngest player to reach that milestone.[71] Unfortunately, 
it came as part of an agonizing 11-10 extra inning defeat to the Nationals, 
one in which St. Louis blew a 5-3 lead, scored four in the ninth to go 
ahead 10-8, then blew that lead when closer Ryan Franklin gave up a two-run 
homer in the bottom of the 9th. The Cardinals slipped to a ghastly 5-12 
after the sweep of Cincinnati for the remainder of the month, with 11 of 
those losses coming to teams with losing records (the Cubs, Brewers, Pirates, 
Nationals, and Astros).[72] The Cardinals announced on September 1 that 
the team's new broadcasting station in 2011 will be a familiar one: KMOX, 
giving up on KTRS weak 5,000-watt reach for KMOX's 50,000-watt clear channel. 
Missouri native and longtime Chicago White Sox announcer John Rooney joined 
Shannon in the broadcast booth in the inaugural season with the new station.[73] 
The team will presently keep its 50% ownership in KTRS, unless a good offer 
is made. On September 1, the disastrous road trip concluded with a 5-2 
loss at Houston for another losing streak of five games, the second time 
in the past 16 games played, tying their longest losing streak of the season. 
The 2-8 road trip dropped them 8 games behind Cincinnati,[74] and 5 games 
out of the wild card.[75] It was part of a pattern in which the Cardinals, 
who were in first place after sweeping the Reds in August and looking towards 
a schedule filled with bad teams, choked away the Central Division by showing 
an utter inability to beat those bad teams. Between the Cubs series on 
August 13, which immediately followed the sweep of Cincinnati, and a series 
against the Pirates that ended on September 23, St. Louis played eight 
series against teams with losing records, and lost all of them. During 
this stretch the Cardinals also played their last series of the season 
against Cincinnati. St. Louis took two of three at home but the Reds remained 
far ahead in the NL Central. On September 11, Albert Pujols reached 100 
RBIs for the 10th consecutive year and drove in all three runs giving him 
102 for the season, but the team lost in extra innings 6-3 at Atlanta. 
Only Al Simmons has a longer streak at the beginning of a career, 11 years 
(1924–1934). Pujols joins Jimmie Foxx, Lou Gehrig, and Alex Rodriguez in 
having 10 consecutive seasons of 100+ RBIs at any time in their career. 
Only two other players have 10 consecutive years of 30 HRs and 100 RBIs 
at any time in their careers: Foxx and Rodriguez.[76] On September 19, 
catcher Jason LaRue, still suffering from the severe concussion he received 
on August 10 when Cueto kicked him in the head numerous times, announced 
his retirement from baseball effective at the end of the season.[77] Another 
player departed two days later, when infielder Felipe López was given his 
unconditional release. The cited cause was repeated tardiness.[78] On September 
23, catcher Yadier Molina was ruled out for the remainder of the season 
because of continuing soreness in his right knee after an examination in 
St. Louis.[79] Pitcher Jaime García joined Molina on the shelf when the 
Cardinals decided he would sit out the remainder of the season, citing 
his Tommy John arm surgery (in September 2008) and heavy 2010 workload. 
Garcia led all rookie pitchers with 13 wins, and posted the fourth-best 
(2.70) ERA in the NL,[80] One bit of good news penetrated the Cardinals' 
terrible month: Adam Wainwright won his 20th game on September 24.[81] 
After a strained muscle led the Cardinals to sit Wainwright for his last 
scheduled start, he finished at 20-11 with a 2.42 ERA.[82] Four days after 
Wainwright's 20th victory, on September 28, St. Louis was eliminated from 
playoff contention.[83] After it no longer mattered, the Cardinals won 
9 of their last 11 games to finish 86-76. At season's end, Pujols became 
the second player in the last sixty years (the first was Hank Aaron), to 
lead the National League in runs, home runs, and runs batted in, and not 
be named Most Valuable Player.[84] Despite their lower finish in the standings, 
the team drew 3,300,218 fans, the seventh consecutive year over 3 million 
and sixth over 3.3 million. Only three other teams drew more. MLB Standings
