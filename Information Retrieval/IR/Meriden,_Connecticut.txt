Meriden is a city in New Haven County, Connecticut, United States, located 
halfway between the regional cities of New Haven and Hartford. In 2010, 
the population of the city was 60,868.[2] Meriden was originally part of 
Wallingford. It was granted a separate meetinghouse in 1727, became a town 
in 1806 with over 1000 residents, and incorporated as a city in 1867 with 
just under 9000 residents. It was once proposed as the Connecticut state 
capital.[3] It was named for the town of Meriden, West Midlands, England, 
near Birmingham. Popular myth also states that it is named after the Merry 
Den tavern that may have been located near present-day U.S. Route 5.[citation 
needed] The oldest house in town still standing, built by Solomon Goffe 
in 1711, became a museum in 1986, the Solomon Goffe House.[4] The grave 
of Winston Churchill's great-great-great maternal grandfather, Timothy 
Jerome, can be seen today at what is now called "Burying Ground 1720" (Google 
Maps: 41.522877, -72.787707) at the juncture of Dexter Avenue and Lydale 
Place. At the time the location was known as "Buckwheat Hill," and overlooked 
the salt-making estate for which Jerome had received a royal grant.[5] 
Timothy Jerome's son, Samuel, is the great-great grandfather of Jennie 
Jerome, Winston Churchill's mother.[6][7] In the 1800s, Meriden became 
a manufacturing center of note, with several companies forming, or relocating 
to the city, including the Meriden Britannia Company (a predecessor of 
the International Silver Company with corporate HQ in Meriden),[8] C.F. 
Monroe Company (1892–1916),[9] Charles Parker Company, Parker Brothers 
(guns), Manning, Bowman & Co. (1849–1945),[10][11] the Meriden Flint Glass 
Company (1876–92),[12] Edward Miller & Co / Miller Company (1844–present),[13] 
Wilcox and White, Handel Company (lamps),[14] and the Bradley & Hubbard 
Manufacturing Company (1852–1940). Meriden earned the nickname "Silver 
City", due to the large number of cutlery and related products which were 
manufactured there by companies such as International Silver and Meriden 
Cutlery. During this time, several mansions and houses of note were built, 
particularly on Broad Street.[15][16] Charles Parker and his younger brother 
opened their first factory in Meriden in 1832, with a capital outlay of 
$70.00. Over the years they manufactured a wide variety of products‚ from 
steam engines, train wheels and printing presses to piano stools. During 
the Civil War, Parker's Meriden Machine Company was under Union contract 
to produce 10,000 repeating rifles and 15,000 Springfield rifles. Parker 
began producing his own shotgun, referred to as "The Gun of 1866". In 1868, 
Charles and his sons, Wilbur, Charles and Dexter, started the Parker Brothers 
Gun Company, which continued as an independent company until 1934 when 
it was purchased by the Remington Arms Company.[17] On March 7, 1860, Abraham 
Lincoln spoke in Meriden seeking the Republican presidential nomination.[18] 
In 1876, the Meriden Britannia Company made significant efforts at the 
Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia, and won the First Place medal for 
plated wares. According to the Sotheby's auction house, "The publicity 
of the award and the impression the firm made on the fair's 8 million visitors 
was continued by the catalogues and other intensive marketing; by the end 
of the 1870s Meriden Britannia Co. was considered the largest silverware 
company in the world."[21] Meriden also was an important site for graphic 
arts innovation. In 1888, the Meriden Gravure Company (in Meriden 1888–1989) 
was founded by Charles Parker and James F. Allen, and continued a previous 
printing operation by Parker. The company developed an expertise in high 
quality image reproduction, which initially was driven by the needs of 
the silver industry.[22] Hubbard Park in the Hanging Hills was financed 
by Walter Hubbard (of the Bradley & Hubbard company). The design for the 
park was originally conceived by Hubbard in consultation with the Olmsted 
Brothers, sons of Frederick Law Olmsted, America’s foremost landscape architect. 
In 1900, Castle Craig on a peak was dedicated in the park.[23] The Curtis 
Memorial Library opened in 1903. The Meriden Firearms Co. manufactured 
small arms from 1905 to 1918. The stock was owned by Sears, Roebuck & Company.[24] 
From 1937 until 1947, the International Silver Company sponsored the Silver 
Theater, a national radio program broadcast via CBS in Hollywood. The radio 
program featured many Hollywood actors and actresses of the time like Jimmy 
Stewart and Rosalind Russell. Over 200 programs were produced.[25][26] 
In c. 1941, several Hollywood stars endorsed the company's silverware in 
print advertisements in LIFE magazine.[27] After WWII, in 1949/50, The 
Silver Theatre was brought to television and broadcast on CBS, also with 
the International Silver Company as the sponsor. Guest stars included Eva 
Gabor, Kim Hunter, and Burgess Meredith.[28] Many design objects from this 
manufacturing era from Meriden are in leading museums across the United 
States including those in Boston;[29] at the Corning Museum of Glass in 
Corning, New York (28 objects);[30] Chicago;[31][32] Dallas;[33] Los Angeles;[34] 
New York;[15][35][36][37][38][39][40] Philadelphia;[41] Richmond, Virginia;[42] 
Toledo, Ohio;[9] and Washington, DC.[43] Design objects from this era from 
Meriden have also been included in notable exhibitions since at least 1867, 
with Meriden Britannia products on view at the Paris Universal Exhibition.[44] 
Some comparatively recent examples include In pursuit of Beauty: Americans 
and the Aesthetic Movement at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York 
(1986–87),[45] and more recently, Modernism in American Silver: 20th century 
design (2005–06) in Dallas, Miami Beach, and Washington, DC, which highlighted 
downtown Meriden and the area's role as an important center of Modernist 
silver production.[46] In 19th century Modern (2011–12) in Brooklyn, designs 
by the International Silver Company and the Napier Company, another Meriden 
manufacturer, were exhibited alongside iconic designs by Tiffany & Co. 
and the Thonet Brothers.[47] In November 2016-November 2017, the city's 
iconic Napier penguin cocktail shaker will be in an exhibition at the Dallas 
Museum of Art; the Napier penguin is the lead image of the show.[48] With 
this level of attention, some special design objects from the era have 
become sought-after collectors items also at auction, sometimes due to 
their association with the commission or commissioner, or the product designer. 
For example, a painted glass and metal table lamp by Bradley and Hubbard, 
(c. 1920) sold for USD$14,950, doubling its estimate, at Christie's auction 
house in New York in 1999.[49] Later, a 14-inch, International Silver Company 
cocktail shaker (c. 1927) sold for USD$21,600 tripling its estimate, at 
Christie's in New York in 2005.[50] A Parker gun made for a Russian czar 
before WWI, but never delivered, was reported to have been sold for USD$287,500 
in 2007.[51] In 2008, a rare Handel lamp sold for USD$85,000.[52] On March 
5–6, 2014 at Sotheby's in London, "Al Capone's cocktail shaker" made by 
the Meriden International Sterling Company (c. 1932) achieved over 33 times 
its estimate with a sale price of GBP50,000 (USD$83,250 on the day).[53] 
Lastly, in 2014, at Sotheby's New York, a rare Paul Lobel-designed coffee 
service (c. 1934–35) produced by the Wilcox Silver Plate Co. / International 
Silver Company sold for USD$377,000.[54] In 1939, Edwin Howard Armstrong, 
a network radio pioneer who invented FM radio, used West Peak in 1939 for 
the location of one of the first FM radio broadcasts. His original 70-foot-tall 
(21 m) radio mast still stands on the peak.[55] Currently West Peak is 
home to six FM broadcast stations, including WNPR,[56] WWYZ, WKSS, WDRC-FM, 
WMRQ-FM[57] and WHCN. During WWII, factories in Meriden worked three shifts 
(24 hours/day). On March 8, 1944, the War Manpower Commission gave Meriden 
the designation as "National Ideal War Community", and Jimmy Durante and 
Glenn Miller entertained those at the ceremeny.[58] In addition to manufacturers 
that continued operations after WWII, starting in the later 1940s, the 
Miller Company, Burton Tremaine, Sr. and Emily Hall Tremaine firmly put 
Meriden on the international, 20th century art/design map. In December 
1947, Meriden became known once again as a site of design innovation, now 
with Modern art, via the Miller Company Collection of Abstract Art and 
the organization of a Painting toward architecture exhibition which opened 
at Hartford's Wadsworth Atheneum[59] and later travelled to venues in 24 
American cities (1947–52), including the Los Angeles Museum of Art, Houston's 
Contemporary Art Museum, and the Milwaukee Art Institute. The exhibition 
featured and referred to the leading Modernists in American and European 
art and architecture with a connection to then-Miller Company lighting 
designs. Artworks in the Meriden-based collection included those by Picasso, 
Braque, Gris, Mondrian, Jose de Rivera, Rufino Tamayo, and Stuart Davis, 
with photographs on Modern architecture design by Le Corbusier, Walter 
Gropius (Bauhaus), Oscar Niemeyer, Frank Lloyd Wright, and Mies van der 
Rohe. Substantial national media coverage reported on the exhibition, as 
well as regional media outlets when the show was on view. Painting toward 
architecture is considered one of the important art exhibitions of the 
20th century.[60] In the 1950s, the Miller Company Collection of Abstract 
Art was privatized to "Mr & Mrs Burton Tremaine, Meriden, CT" and numerous 
artworks were lent for exhibitions nationally and internationally into 
the 1970s with this designation. One highlight includes two of their artworks 
included in 'Cézanne to Miró' (1968) at the Museum of Modern Art, New York, 
an exhibition that later traveled to Buenos Aires, Santiago, and Caracas.[61] 
In 1965, the Miller Company addition on Center Street was completed. The 
black-and-white Modernist facade was designed by influential American architect 
Philip Johnson.[62][63] On April 27, 1976, Jimmy Carter campaigned at city 
hall and the Latin American Society for the nomination of the Democratic 
Party for President of the United States.[64] In 1987, the Emily Hall Tremaine 
Foundation was founded by the noted art collector that partly worked in 
Meriden, before her passing, with three focus areas: learning disabilities, 
the arts, and the environment.[65] The offices were located in downtown 
Meriden. The foundation is very well-known nationally and frequently mentioned 
in the national American fine art press and exhibition catalogues as a 
funder.[66] In c. 2010, the foundation offices were relocated to New Haven, 
near Yale University.[67] Meriden was a location chosen for the filming 
of the 1989 film Jacknife directed by David Jones starring Robert De Niro, 
Ed Harris and Kathy Baker. De Niro played a Vietnam War veteran suffering 
from post-traumatic stress disorder adjusting to a return to American life. 
The film was adapted by the play, Strange Snow by Stephen Metcalfe, a native 
from the adjacent town of Cheshire, Connecticut. A number of Meriden locations 
can be seen in the film, including a historic house on Linsley Avenue, 
as well as film locations in the greater region.[68] The Franciscan Sisters 
of the Eucharist have their mother house in Meriden, as do the Franciscan 
Brothers of the Eucharist. According to the United States Census Bureau, 
the city has a total area of 24.1 square miles (62.5 km²), of which 23.8 square 
miles (61.5 km²) is land and 0.4 square miles (1.0 km²), or 1.66%, is water. 
Meriden is a showcase for a number of prominent peaks of the Metacomet 
Ridge, a mountainous trap rock ridgeline that stretches from Long Island 
Sound to nearly the Vermont border. Notable peaks in Meriden include the 
Hanging Hills (West Peak, East Peak, South Mountain, and Cathole Mountain); 
Lamentation Mountain, Chauncey Peak, and Besek Mountain. Castle Craig, 
a city landmark for over a century, was constructed among the Hanging Hills 
in Hubbard Park. The Quinnipiac River courses through the southwest quadrant 
of the city, known to area residents as "South Meriden". Here, the river 
cuts through two hills for nearly a mile, resulting in a gorge lined with 
several exposed sandstone and brownstone cliffs. Harbor Brook (originally 
named Pilgrim Harbor Brook) cuts through the town from the northeast to 
the southwest (passing underneath downtown Meriden in a culvert) before 
emptying into Hanover Pond (part of the Quinnipiac River) in South Meriden. 
As of the 2010 census, there were 60,868 people in Meriden, with a population 
density of 2558 persons per square mile. There were 23,922 households (2009–13). 
The average household size was 2.49 and the average family size was 3.10. 
Husband-wife households account for 41% of all households. The population 
under 5 years (2010) was 6.7%, under 18 years (2010) was 23.9%, and 65 
years and over was 12.9%. The female population was 51.6% compared to the 
male population at 48.4% (2010).[71] The racial makeup of the city in 2010 
was 73.5% White, 9.7% Black or African American, 0.5% Native American, 
2.1% Asian, 0.1% Pacific Islander, 10.7% from other races, and 3.5% from 
two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 28.9% of the population. 
In 2009–2013, 9.7% of the population was foreign-born.[2][71] For 2009–13, 
the median household income was $52,590. The per capita income for the 
city was $26,941. The median value of owner-occupied housing units was 
$188,400. The home ownership rate was 61.8%. The high school graduation 
or higher rate was 83.6% (age 25+) and the bachelor's degree or higher 
rate was 19.1% (age 25+). 14.4% of people were below the poverty line.[71] 
The city of Meriden is located on Interstate 91, which provides access 
to Hartford, Springfield, and New Haven. Interstate 691 provides access 
to Interstate 84 and connects to points west like Waterbury. The Wilbur 
Cross Parkway (Connecticut Route 15) travels in a southwestern direction 
connecting to towns and cities like Wallingford, New Haven, and towards 
New York City. The parkway becomes the Berlin Turnpike (also Connecticut 
Route 15) on the northern end of Meriden. U.S. Route 5 passes through the 
city as North and South Broad Street. The city of Meriden is connected 
to the cities of New Haven, Hartford, and Springfield, Massachusetts, by 
regional rail service provided by Amtrak, which runs north-to-south through 
the center of the city. This rail line opened in 1839, and operated for 
many years under the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad. The city 
was also served by the Middletown, Meriden and Waterbury Railroad, which 
provided both freight and passenger service to Waterbury and Middletown 
from 1888 until its abandonment in 1924. Currently, Amtrak runs 16 trains 
through the Meriden station on most weekdays. Additionally, the Connecticut 
Department of Transportation plans to add a new commuter service called 
the Hartford Line in collaboration with Amtrak and the federal government 
that will run between New Haven and Springfield, Massachusetts. As of late 
2015, funding had been secured and the service is scheduled to begin operation 
in early 2018.[73] In the Quinnipiac River Gorge in South Meriden, 1.3 
miles (2.1 km) of the original MW&CR Railroad right of way has been converted 
into a recreational rail trail as the Meriden Linear Trail. Open to the 
public in December 2006, the formal dedication occurred on November 3, 
2007.[74] Beginning in 1784, Meriden had a stop on the New Haven-Hartford 
Stage Coach on Route 5 near the intersection of East Main Street. Years 
later, the same stop served as the bus stop for Greyhound and Peter Pan 
buses. Meriden had four daily departures to/from Hartford/Boston, and four 
daily departures to/from New Haven/New York daily from the 1970s through 
2007, when intercity bus service ceased serving Meriden. Meriden is linked 
to the Connecticut Transit System, Connecticut's extensive public transit 
bus network. Three bus lines loop throughout the city of Meriden once per 
hour. The "B" bus route departs the Meriden railroad station for the southern 
terminus of Kohls Plaza, connecting for New Haven; the "A" bus route departs 
the rail station for the northern terminus of Meriden Square with connections 
to New Britain and Hartford; and the east/west "C" bus travels along East 
Main and West Main streets, with a handful of departures to Middletown 
and Waterbury. Meriden Markham Municipal Airport is the city-owned airport, 
located 3 miles (4.8 km) south of the city center on the border of South 
Meriden and Yalesville, and serves private and charter planes. The Meriden 
Board of Education operates several public schools:[75] Other schools in 
the area include the Catholic high schools Xavier High School (boys) and 
Mercy High School (girls) in neighboring Middletown. The private schools 
Cheshire Academy and Choate Rosemary Hall are in adjacent Cheshire and 
Wallingford respectively. Since 1975, the Meriden Hall of Fame organization 
has issued recognitions. In the Meriden City Hall, plaques pay tribute 
to the inductees.[96] At one time The Meriden Daily Journal served as the 
community newspaper. Currently the Meriden Record Journal serves the communities 
of Meriden, Wallingford, Cheshire, and Southington and is located in downtown
