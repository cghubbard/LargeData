A stolen base is a baseball statistic credited to a baserunner when he 
successfully advances to the next base while the pitcher is throwing the 
ball to home plate. Under Rule 7.01 of the Major League Baseball's (MLB) 
Official Rules, a runner acquires the right to an unoccupied base when 
he touches it before he is out.[1] Stolen bases were more common in baseball's 
dead-ball era, when teams relied more on stolen bases and hit and run plays 
than on home runs.[2] Rickey Henderson currently holds the MLB career stolen 
base record with 1,406.[3] Following Henderson is Lou Brock with 938 stolen 
bases,[3] and Billy Hamilton, who is one stolen base behind Brock with 
937. Ty Cobb (892),[4] credits Cobb with 892 career stolen bases; Baseball 
Reference lists 897 stolen bases for Cobb.[5] Tim Raines (808), Vince Coleman 
(752), Arlie Latham (742),[6] Eddie Collins (741), Max Carey (738), and 
Honus Wagner (723)[7] are the only other players to have stolen at least 
700 bases.[3] Raines is the leader for retired players who are not members 
of the Hall of Fame.[3] Hugh Nicol is the leader for the most stolen bases 
in one season, with 138 stolen bases in 1887.[8] Before Henderson surpassed 
Brock in 1991, Brock had held the record with 938 stolen bases.[8] He had 
held this record from 1977 to 1991. Before Brock, Hamilton held the record 
for eighty one years with 914 stolen bases. Hamilton's record stood from 
1897 to 1977.[8] Before that, Latham held the record from 1887 to 1896. 
Latham was also the first player to collect 300 career stolen bases.[8] 
With Kenny Lofton's retirement in 2007, 2008 was the first season since 
1967 in which no active player had more than 500 career stolen bases.[8] 
From 2008 until 2010, no active player had more than 500 stolen bases. 
Juan Pierre collected his 500th stolen base during the 2010 season. He 
was the leader in stolen bases for active players until his retirement 
at the end of the 2013 season.[8] Ichiro Suzuki currently holds the most
