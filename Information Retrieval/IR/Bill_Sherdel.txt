William Henry Sherdel (August 15, 1896 – November 14, 1968) was a professional 
baseball player. He was a left-handed pitcher over parts of fifteen seasons 
(1918–1932) with the St. Louis Cardinals and Boston Braves. For his career, 
he compiled a 165–146 record in 514 appearances, with an 3.72 earned run 
average and 839 strikeouts. In Cardinals franchise history, Sherdel ranks 
4th all-time in wins (153), 3rd in games pitched (465), 4th in innings 
pitched (2450.7), 5th in games started (242), 8th in complete games (144), 
4th in losses (131), 5th in hit batsmen (51), and 8th in games finished 
(152). Sherdel's 153 wins are the most ever for a Cardinal left-hander. 
Sherdel achieved the unusual distinction of giving up at least 10 runs 
in three consecutive starts during the 1929 season – 10 runs on the 29th 
of June, 13 runs on the 3rd of July and 10 runs on the 6th of July.[1] 
Sherdel was a member of two National League pennant-winning Cardinals teams, 
in 1926 and 1928, winning the World Series in 1926. He faced the New York 
Yankees both times. In World Series play, he compiled an 0–4 record in 
4 appearances, with a 3.26 earned run average and 6 strikeouts. Sherdel 
was born and later died in McSherrystown, Pennsylvania, at the age of 72.
