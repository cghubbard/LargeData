Bright's disease is a historical classification of kidney diseases that 
would be described in modern medicine as acute or chronic nephritis.[1] 
It was characterized by edema, the presence of albumin in the urine and 
was frequently accompanied by high blood pressure (hypertension). The symptoms 
and signs of Bright's disease were first described in 1827 by the English 
physician Richard Bright, after whom the disease was named. In his Reports 
of Medical Cases,[2] he described 25 cases of dropsy (edema) which he attributed 
to kidney disease. Symptoms and sign included: inflammation of serous membranes, 
hemorrhages, apoplexy, convulsions, blindness and coma.[3][4] Many of these 
cases were found to have albumin in their urine (detected by the spoon 
and candle-heat coagulation), and showed striking morbid changes of the 
kidneys at autopsy.[5] The triad of dropsy, albumin in the urine and kidney 
disease came to be regarded as characteristic of Bright's disease.[3] Subsequent 
work by Bright and others indicated an association with cardiac hypertrophy, 
which was attributed by Bright to stimulation of the heart.[4] Subsequent 
work by Mahomed showed that a rise in blood pressure could precede the 
appearance of albumin in the urine, and the rise in blood pressure and 
increased resistance to flow was believed to explain the cardiac hypertrophy.[4] 
It is now known that Bright's disease is due to a wide range of diverse 
kidney diseases;[1][5][6] thus, the term Bright's disease is retained strictly 
for historical application.[7] Bright's disease could be treated with warm 
baths, abstinence from alcohol, cheese and red meat, blood-letting, squill, 
digitalis, mercuric compounds, opium, diuretics, and laxatives.[2][8] The 
disease was diagnosed frequently in diabetic patients.[4] Arnold Ehret 
was diagnosed with Bright's disease and pronounced incurable by 24 of Europe's 
most respected doctors. He finally designed the The Mucusless Diet Healing 
System and cured himself. William Howard Hay, MD suffered from the illness 
and it is claimed cured himself using the Hay diet.[9] Bright's disease 
was a plot element in one of the early Dr. Kildare films (1945, Between 
Two Women). Sally (Marie Blake), the hospital switchboard operator, falls 
ill to a mysterious ailment and, fearing it is cancer, avoids treatment 
until Dr. Randall "Red" Adams (Van Johnson) correctly diagnoses it and 
operates on her kidney.[10] In chapter 11 of Dashiell Hammett's 1929 novel 
Red Harvest, a minor character, Myrtle Jennison, is "in the hospital ...
