As player As manager Edwin Hawley Dyer (October 11, 1899 – April 20, 1964) 
was an American left-handed pitcher, manager and farm system official in 
Major League Baseball for the St. Louis Cardinals from 1922–1944 and 1946–1950. 
In 1946, Dyer's first season at the helm of the Cardinals, the Redbirds 
defeated the Brooklyn Dodgers in a thrilling National League season that 
featured the first postseason playoff in baseball history, then bested 
the favored Boston Red Sox in a seven-game World Series. Edwin Hawley Dyer 
was born October 11, 1899, in Morgan City, Louisiana, the fourth of seven 
children of Joseph M. and Alice Natalie Dyer. Baseball encyclopedias give 
his birth date as 1900, but his son Eddie Jr. says he subtracted a year 
from his age when he entered professional ball. U.S. census and military 
draft records confirm this. .[1] He was an outstanding football, baseball 
and track and field athlete as part of the Morgan City High School, Class 
of 1917. His father owned a general store and a lumber yard and served 
as mayor of Morgan City, but lost it all during a recession before World 
War I and moved his family to Houston, Texas where an oil boom was just 
beginning. Dyer earned an athletic scholarship to Rice Institute and lettered 
in three sports (football, baseball, track), winning the Southwest Conference 
championship in the broad jump and earning a berth on the All-SWC football 
team in 1920. He was the Owl's football captain in 1921. He was also All-SWC 
in each of his three years of varsity baseball (1919, 1920, 1921). He pitched 
a no-hitter against Baylor's Ted Lyons, later a Hall of Fame pitcher for 
the White Sox.[2][3] Dyer left school two credits short of graduation in 
1922 when Branch Rickey gave him a $2,500 bonus to sign with the Cardinals. 
The money paid off his father's debts and put his youngest brother, Sammy, 
through one year of college.[4] In 1936, Dyer completed requirements for 
his bachelor's degree from Rice.[5] The 5 ft 11 in (1.80 m), 168 lb (76 kg) 
Dyer was a versatile player, playing outfield and first base in addition 
to pitching. He made his debut with the Cardinals on the mound on July 
8, 1922 and pitched twice in relief before he was farmed out to Syracuse, 
at the highest minor-league level. The next spring Rickey sent him to Houston, 
then to Wichita Falls, both in the Texas League, to play the outfield. 
When he didn't hit, he became a full-time pitcher. On September 9, 1923, 
in Dyer's first start as pitcher, he pitched a complete game shutout of 
the Chicago Cubs, winning 3-0.[6] In 1924 he stuck with the Cardinals, 
but posted a 4.61 ERA and an 8-11 record, dividing his time between starting 
and relieving for the sixth-place club. The next year he lowered his ERA 
to 4.15, pitching primarily in relief. Rickey moved into the front office 
and the Cardinals' star second baseman, Rogers Hornsby, became manager 
in 1925. He and Dyer did not get along. According to one account, Dyer 
told Hornsby, "I'll never play on this club as long as you're the manager." 
That earned him a return ticket to Syracuse in 1926, while the Cardinals 
won their first World Championship. In 1927 Dyer pitched once for St. Louis 
before he headed to Syracuse again. He won six games in a row, but on June 
30 he hurt his arm in his first loss. That finished his pitching career. 
He appeared for the Cardinals in 129 games over all or parts of six seasons 
(1922–1927) — although 1924 and 1925 were his only full seasons in the 
majors — splitting 30 pitching decisions with an earned run average of 
4.78, and batting .223 in 157 at bats with two home runs and 13 runs batted 
in. From 1928 on, Dyer would manage in the Cardinal farm system, continuing 
his playing career as an outfielder through 1933. He completed his Rice 
degree in 1936 and coached freshman football here (during baseball's off-season) 
for several years.[7] In addition, Dyer served as business manager or club 
president of the teams he managed, and in 1938 he supervised all of the 
Cardinal farm teams in the Southern and Southwestern United States. The 
most important of these was Dyer's hometown Houston Buffaloes, the Cardinals’ 
club in the Class A Texas League. He took over as the Buffaloes' manager 
from 1939–1941 and led them to three consecutive first-place finishes and 
one league playoff championship, averaging 102 victories. During much of 
the wartime period that followed, Dyer was director of the entire Cardinals 
farm system, although he left that post in the midst of the 1944 season 
to tend to his oil, real estate and insurance businesses in Houston. At 
the war's end, and with the big league Cardinals in need of a manager upon 
Billy Southworth's departure for the Boston Braves, Dyer returned to baseball 
and his first Major-League managing assignment in 1946. The Cardinals were 
a powerhouse, having won three straight NL pennants from 1942–1944 and 
finished second in 1941 and 1945, but 1946 was an extremely challenging 
season for Dyer and his team. He had to blend returning war veterans and 
young players with Southworth's wartime club, and lost three key players 
— undefeated left-handed pitcher Max Lanier, second baseman Lou Klein and 
relief pitcher Fred Martin — to the marauding Mexican League. Dyer also 
had to deal with the Cards' implacable foes, the Dodgers of Leo Durocher, 
back at full strength after the war. Led by pitchers Howie Pollet and Harry 
Brecheen, and the hitting and leadership of future Hall of Famers Stan 
Musial and Enos Slaughter, the Cardinals made up a five-game All-Star Break 
deficit, won 14 of their 22 regular-season games with the Dodgers, and 
were tied with Brooklyn for the pennant on the season's final day. The 
Cards then swept the Dodgers in a best-of-three playoff behind the pitching 
of Pollet and Murry Dickson. In the 1946 World Series, the Redbirds faced 
what would be the only World Series in which Ted Williams would play. The 
Red Sox had breezed to the American League pennant by 12 games and featured 
20-game winners Dave Ferriss and Tex Hughson. Idle during the NL playoffs, 
Boston played an exhibition game against an AL "all-star" team in an effort 
to tune up for the Fall Classic. Williams was struck on the elbow by a 
pitch, and when the Series began, he was ineffective. Brecheen won three 
games, the Cardinals played inspired baseball, and in the deciding seventh 
game, Slaughter scored from first on a double (often mistakenly remembered 
as a single) by Harry Walker, a shocking feat. His was the winning run 
in the game and the Series. The 1946 world championship was Dyer's high-water 
mark as Cardinal manager. The following season, Brooklyn upset the balance 
of power in the National League by boldly breaking the color line. In May, 
the Cardinals became embroiled in a hotly denied rumor that they planned 
to strike, rather than permit Jackie Robinson on a Major League diamond 
— although Dyer was not implicated in the rumor. More damaging, for the 
next decade, the Cardinals would lag behind most of the other NL clubs 
in signing African-American players. Overall, the Cardinals reverted to 
bridesmaid status, finishing second from 1947–1949, although they trailed 
the Dodgers by only one game in 1949. With the team's legendary farm system 
struggling without its founder — Branch Rickey, the very man who brought 
Robinson to Brooklyn — the Cardinals’ quarter-century of baseball dominance 
was coming to an end. In 1950, they fell to fifth and Dyer stepped down 
as manager at the end of the season.[8] During his five years as St. Louis 
manager, the Cardinals won 446 games and lost 325 for a stellar .578 winning 
percentage. But Dyer preferred to manage his thriving Houston-area businesses 
rather than seek another managing job in baseball. He suffered a stroke 
in January 1963, and died in Houston in April of the following year at
