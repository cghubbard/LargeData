Bright House Field (formerly Bright House Networks Field) is a baseball 
stadium located in Clearwater, Florida, in the United States. The stadium 
was built in 2004 and has a maximum seating capacity of 8,500 people (7,000 
fixed seats with additional grass berm seating for 1,500). The ballpark 
is the spring training home of the Philadelphia Phillies, and their Class 
A affiliate, Clearwater Threshers of the Florida State League. A sculpture 
titled The Ace by artist Kevin Brady stands at the ballpark's west entrance 
plaza.[5] The stadium is named after the regional / national cable company, 
Bright House Networks, whose local head end center is located just to the 
south of the stadium. It was announced on January 20, 2004, that Bright 
House Networks had secured the naming rights for the new ballpark. Under 
the terms of the agreement, Bright House Networks would pay the Phillies 
$1.7 million over 10 years with an option for two 5-year renewals. The 
City of Clearwater receives one-third of the payment.[6] Bright House Field 
is the Phillies' third Clearwater spring-training home. The team moved 
to Clearwater in 1947. They trained and played home games at Clearwater 
Athletic Field from 1947 to 1954. The City of Clearwater opened a new ballpark 
for spring training in 1955 and named it Jack Russell Stadium. (The ballpark 
was renamed Jack Russell Memorial Stadium in 1990.) With the stadium aging, 
the Phillies and the city erected their new spring home adjacent to the 
Phillies' year-round training facility, the Carpenter Complex, four-miles 
east of Jack Russell Memorial Stadium. Ground-breaking of the new stadium 
took place on October 16, 2002.[7] The official ribbon-cutting ceremony 
for the ballpark took place on February 27, 2004 prior to the annual spring-training 
Phan Fest.[5] On June 24, 2012, thanks to the rain bands off Tropical Storm 
Debby, the field was flooded, becoming swimming pool-like.[8] The Phillies 
played their first spring-training game at the park on March 4, 2004. 8,205 
fans watched the Phils beat the New York Yankees 5–1. Vicente Padilla started 
for the Phillies, Marlon Byrd had the park's first hit, and Jimmy Rollins 
hit the first home run.[9] Bright House Field hosted the 44th Florida State 
League All-Star Game on June 18, 2005. A crowd of 5,547 saw the West defeat 
the East 6–4. The Sarasota Reds' Chris Dickerson hit a two-run home run, 
scored two runs, and earned the game's Star of Stars Award. Future major 
league players who appeared in the game included Dickeron, Reggie Abercrombie, 
Carlos Villanueva, and Sean Marshall.[10] Threshers pitcher Julio De La 
Cruz pitched the first no-hitter at the ballpark on August 18, 2006. De 
La Cruz beat the Sarasota Reds 5–0 in front of 5,906 fans on "Pitch for 
Pink Night" in Clearwater. The Threshers wore special pink uniforms to 
raise money for breast cancer research and awareness. It was the first 
no-hitter for Clearwater since 1992.[11] The Big East Conference held its 
championship tournament at Bright House Field in 2006 and from 2008 to 
2013. Notre Dame defeated Louisville 7–0 on May 27, 2006, to win the 2006 
championship.[12] Louisville defeated Cincinnati 6–3 to win the 2008 championship 
on May 24, 2008.[13] In 2009, Louisville again won the tournament.[14] 
In 2010, St. John's won the title, defeating UConn 3–0 in the championship 
game. In 2011, 5th-seeded Seton Hall became the lowest seeded team ever 
to win the Big East Tournament, defeating St. John's 4–2.[15][16] In 2012, 
St. John's defeated South Florida 7–3 in the title game to win the tournament.[17] 
Beginning in 2014, the American Athletic Conference has held its conference 
baseball tournament at Bright House Field. The single-game attendance record 
for the Threshers was set on July 3, 2015, when 9,966 saw Clearwater defeat 
the Tampa Yankees, 3-0.[18] Since 2007, the top 6 of the Threshers top 
10 single-game attendance numbers occurred on July 3rd.[19] The all-time 
attendance record for the field is 11,222, set on March 17, 2016, for a 
spring-training game in which the Phillies hosted the Tampa Bay Rays.[20] 
This game drew 1,650 more fans than the same opponents on the same date 
the year prior.[21] The spring-training attendance mark for Bright House
