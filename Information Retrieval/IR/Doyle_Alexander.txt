Doyle Lafayette Alexander (born September 4, 1950) is a former pitcher 
in Major League Baseball (MLB) who played for the Los Angeles Dodgers, 
Baltimore Orioles, New York Yankees, Texas Rangers, Atlanta Braves, San 
Francisco Giants, Toronto Blue Jays, and Detroit Tigers. After being drafted 
by the Dodgers in 1968, Alexander debuted in the big leagues in 1971 with 
the team. He was traded, along with Bob O'Brien, Sergio Robles and Royle 
Stillman, to the Baltimore Orioles for Frank Robinson and Pete Richert 
in the offseason. He enjoyed his first winning season with the Orioles 
in 1973, when he went 12–8 with a 3.86 ERA. Alexander was traded to the 
New York Yankees in a ten player deal in the middle of the 1976 season 
and went 10–5 to help the Yankees win the American League East division. 
He did not pitch during the American League Championship Series, so he 
was tipped to start Game One of the World Series against the Cincinnati 
Reds, which he lost. Alexander signed with the Texas Rangers as a free 
agent in the offseason and enjoyed one good year before falling apart. 
It would not be until he signed with the Toronto Blue Jays during the 1983 
season, after being released by the New York Yankees, that he would return 
to form. The Blue Jays were on the rise in the mid 1980s, and Alexander 
was an instrumental part of their success, winning 17 games in both 1984 
and 1985, including the division-clinching win over the Yankees in 1985. 
In the ALCS, however, he went 0–1 with an 8.71 earned run average in two 
starts as the Blue Jays fell to the Kansas City Royals in seven games. 
A slow start the next year resulted in his being traded to the Atlanta 
Braves, who dealt him in turn to the contending Detroit Tigers midway through 
the 1987 season for a then unknown minor-leaguer named John Smoltz.[1] 
The Tigers got more than they could have possibly hoped for in Alexander, 
who went 9–0 with a 1.53 ERA to propel the Tigers to the division title. 
However, he struggled again in the ALCS, going 0–2 with a 10.00 ERA, bringing 
his postseason totals to 0–5 with an 8.38 ERA. The following year, Alexander 
went 14–11 with a 4.32 ERA, earning his only All-Star appearance. In 1989, 
his performance declined (6-18, 4.44 ERA) in part due to pitching with
