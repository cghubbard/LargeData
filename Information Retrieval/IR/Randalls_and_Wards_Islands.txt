Randalls Island (also called Randall's Island) and Wards Island are conjoined 
islands, collectively called Randalls and Wards Islands, in the New York 
City borough of Manhattan,[1][2][3] separated from Manhattan by the Harlem 
River, from Queens by the East River and Hell Gate, and from the Bronx 
by the Bronx Kill. The two islands were formerly separate, with the channel 
between them, Little Hell Gate, being filled in by the early 1960s.[4] 
The island had a population of 1,648 living on 2.09 square kilometers (520 
acres) in 2010.[5] Most of the island is parkland, spanning a total of 
432.69 acres (175.10 ha). The parks offer athletic fields, a driving range, 
greenways, playgrounds and picnic grounds. The island also has a history 
of being used for asylums, hospitals, and cemeteries, and is currently 
home to several public facilities, including two psychiatric hospitals, 
a state police station, a fire academy, a wastewater treatment plant, and 
several homeless shelters. The island is crossed by the Triborough and 
Hell Gate bridges. The island can be reached by the Triborough Bridge; 
the Wards Island Bridge, which serves pedestrians and bicyclists and links 
the island to East Harlem in Manhattan; or by the Randalls Island Connector, 
a pedestrian and cycling bridge crossing the Bronx Kill and connecting 
to the Port Morris neighborhood of the Bronx. Native Americans called Wards 
Island Tenkenas which translated to "Wild Lands" or "uninhabited place",[6] 
whereas Randalls Island was called Minnehanonck.[7] The islands were acquired 
by Wouter Van Twiller, Director General of the Dutch colony of New Netherland, 
in July 1637. The island's first European names were Great Barent Island 
(Wards) and Little Barent Island (Randalls) after a Danish cowherd named 
Barent Jansen Blom.[8] Both islands' names changed several times. At times 
Randalls was known as "Buchanan's Island" and "Great Barn Island", both 
of which were likely corruptions of Great Barent Island. John Montresor, 
an engineer with the British army, purchased Randalls Island in 1772. He 
renamed it Montresor's Island and lived on it with his wife until the Revolutionary 
War forced him to deploy. During the Revolutionary War, both islands hosted 
military posts for the British military. The British used his island to 
launch amphibious attacks on Manhattan, and Montresor's house there was 
burned in 1777. He resigned his commission and returned to England in 1778, 
but retained ownership of the island until the British evacuated the city 
in 1783 and it was confiscated. Both islands gained their current names 
from new owners after the war. In November 1784, Jonathan Randell (or Randel) 
bought Randalls Island,[9] while Jaspar Ward and Bartholomew Ward, sons 
of judge Stephen Ward, bought Wards.[10] Although a small population had 
lived on Wards since as early as the 17th century, the Ward brothers developed 
the island more heavily by building a cotton mill and in 1807 building 
the first bridge to cross the East River. The wooden drawbridge connected 
the island with Manhattan at 114th Street, and was paid for by Bartholomew 
Ward and Philip Milledolar. The bridge lasted until 1821, when it was destroyed 
in a storm. After the destruction of the bridge, Wards island was largely 
abandoned until 1840. Jonathan Randel's heirs sold Randalls to the city 
in 1835 for $60,000. In the mid-19th century, both Randalls and Wards Islands, 
like nearby Blackwell's Island became home to a variety of social facilities. 
Randalls housed an orphanage, poor house, burial ground for the poor, "idiot" 
asylum, homeopathic hospital and rest home for Civil War veterans, and 
was also site of the New York House of Refuge, a reform school completed 
in 1854 for juvenile delinquents or juveniles adjudicated as vagrants. 
Between 1840 and 1930, Wards island was used for: In 1984, the point at 
the southeastern tip of the island was officially designated "Negro Point", 
based on the unofficial usage of riverboat workers.[14] The United States 
Geological Survey and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 
used that name. It still appears on charts of the area today. In 2001 the 
Parks Commissioner Henry Stern, upon learning of the name, thought it was 
offensive.[15] He changed the name to "Scylla Point" and paired it with 
Charybdis Playground in Astoria Park; the two features are on opposite 
sides of Hell Gate, just as the mythological monsters of Scylla and Charybdis 
were on opposite sides of the Strait of Messina.[16] Despite the name change 
Negro Point is still used by tug captains and mates as they sail past the 
area. Proposals to add parks to the islands were made as early as 1916, 
but park development was truly kicked off by the 1930 Metropolitan Conference 
of Parks, which recommended transforming them into recreational parks. 
Randalls Island Park is operated by the Randalls Island Park Alliance (RIPA), 
a public-private partnership founded in 1992 as the Island Sports Foundation. 
The Alliance works with the City and local communities to provide sports 
venues, cultural events and environmental exploration. RIPA runs free youth 
programs at the Park, which brings thousands of children to the Park for 
a range sports and environmental education activities. In addition, RIPA 
hosts RIK CAMP, a free six-week-long summer camp for children from East 
Harlem and the South Bronx. The Downing Stadium was the first stadium built 
on the island, as a WPA project, and upon its opening on July 11, 1936, 
15,000 attendees witnessed Jesse Owens compete at Randalls Island Stadium 
in the Men's Olympic Trials.[17][18] Downing Stadium also hosted the Women's 
Olympic Trials in 1964.[19] It was the site of an international soccer 
friendly in which England defeated the USA, 10–0, on May 27, 1964.[20] 
In 1960, the owners of Ebbets Field donated 500 stadium lights to Downing 
Stadium. The lights came from the old stadium, which was being torn down.[21] 
Downing Stadium was torn down in 2002 and replaced by a newer complex, 
Icahn Stadium, which opened in April, 2005.[22] It was designed by architect 
Ricardo Zurita, who was also involved with the master planning of the park 
development.[23] On May 31, 2008, Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt broke the 
world record for the men's 100-meter dash at the Fourth Annual Reebok Grand 
Prix with a "lightning" speed time of 9.72 seconds.[24] A renovated golf 
center opened in 2008. The new 25-acre (100,000 m2) $500,000 renovation 
has a two-tier indoor/outdoor, 82-stall driving range, 320 yards (290 m) 
of landing area, a 36-hole mini-golf course, grass tees, a short game area 
with sand bunker, PGA instructors, and 9 batting cages. Then, a tennis 
center opened in Randalls Island Park in July 2009. It features 20 courts, 
10 har-tru and 10 rubberized hard (5 indoor), along with a cafe, pro shop, 
fitness facilities and locker rooms. From May–October, 10 courts are reserved 
for NYC Parks Tennis Permit holders during the daylight hours. In the winter, 
all 15 outdoor courts are bubbled for use by club members. The center is 
also the home to the John McEnroe Tennis Academy and was home to the New 
York Sportimes of World TeamTennis until the team relocated to San Diego 
in 2014. Finally, in May 2010, RIPA and the New York City Department of 
Parks and Recreation completed the construction of over 60 athletic fields 
to support a greater variety of sports, including football, lacrosse, field 
hockey, and rugby amongst the sports already played at the Park, soccer, 
baseball and softball. Randalls Island Park has the most athletic fields 
of any New York City park. Two natural environments, a salt marsh and a 
freshwater wetland, have been established on the island. Through the process 
of excavating over 20,000 cubic yards (15,000 m3) of debris, installing 
clean sand, and planting native marsh grasses, 4 acres (16,000 m2) of salt 
marsh has been created surrounding the Little Hell Gate Inlet on the western 
edge of the Island. Just across from the salt marsh, 4 acres (16,000 m2) 
of freshwater wetlands were also restored.[25] After the removal of almost 
15,000 cubic yards (11,000 m3) of debris and fill, the freshwater wetland 
site was planted with native herbaceous, shrub, and tree species, such 
as switchgrass, aster, dogwood, and oak. In addition, the restoration projects 
play a crucial role in an park-wide filtration system that collects storm 
water from the adjacent sports fields, pathways and paved areas and channels 
it through the Wetlands, where the new plants naturally filter pollutants 
before reaching the East River.[25] The island has almost 5 miles of waterfront 
pathways, and a greenway under the Hell Gate Viaduct is almost completed. 
By 2015 a connection to the South Bronx Greenway will be completed, and 
will have additional waterfront pathway sections, a naturalized "living 
shoreline," and further environmental restoration.[26] Greenway segments 
are part of the East Coast Greenway, a 3,000 mile long trail system connecting 
Maine to Florida. The New York City Department of Parks and Recreation 
approved a $1 million contract with Natural Currents Energy Services to 
generate renewable energy in the park. The project expected to produce 
200 kW of solar, wind, and tidal energy to power the island's facilities. 
The project will include a solar-powered marine research and information 
kiosk open to visitors of the island, expected to be completed in September 
2012.[27] Little Hell Gate passed between Randalls and Wards Islands. The 
east end of Little Hell Gate used to open into the Hell Gate passage, of 
the East River, opposite Astoria, Queens. The west end met the Harlem River 
across from East 116th Street, Manhattan.[28] After the Triborough Bridge 
opened in 1936, it spurred the conversion of both islands to parkland. 
Soon thereafter the city began filling in the passage between the two, 
to expand and connect the parks on each island.[4] Few traces of Little 
Hell Gate still exist. Only indentations in the shoreline of the joined 
island in the East River indicate the former entrances to the waterway. 
Today, parkland and part of the New York City Fire Department Academy (see 
below) occupy its former location.[4] In 1917, the Hell Gate Bridge was 
built across both islands, running from Queens to the Bronx. The bridge 
had been conceived in the early 1900s to link New York and the Pennsylvania 
Railroad with New England and the New Haven Railroad. The bridge is supposedly 
extremely sturdy; it would be the last New York City bridge to collapse 
if humans disappeared, taking at least a millennium to do so, according 
to the February 2005 issue of Discover magazine, while most other bridges 
would fall in about 300 years.[33] In 1936, the islands were connected 
to the rest of the city by the Triborough Bridge, the hub of which crossed 
the islands. The American Society of Civil Engineers designated the Triborough 
Bridge Project as a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark in 1986.[34] 
On November 19, 2008, the Triborough Bridge was officially renamed after 
Robert F. Kennedy at the request of the Kennedy family.[35] To manage the 
bridge (and eventually all tolled New York City water crossings), the Triborough 
Bridge and Tunnel Authority erected an art deco head building, the former 
base of Robert Moses; the building still stands on the island. In 1937, 
the islands were connected by a bridge over Little Hell Gate, obviating 
the need for a ferry to Wards Island.[36] In fact, there were two bridges 
that appear to have been known as Little Hell Gate Bridge – an early 20th-century 
rail bridge on the approach to Hell Gate Bridge, and a later, lower steel 
arch road bridge across Little Hell Gate. The northern approach viaduct 
to the Hell Gate Bridge included an inverted bowstring truss bridge, with 
four 300-foot (91 m) long spans, across Little Hell Gate.[37] Although 
Little Hell Gate has been filled, this bridge still exists.[note 1] Some 
time after the rail bridge was built, a 1,000-foot (300 m) long, 3 span, 
steel arch road bridge, designed by George Washington Bridge-engineer Othmar 
Ammann, was also built across Little Hell Gate, just a short distance to 
the north west of the rail bridge.[note 2] Around this time, Little Hell 
Gate began to be narrowed with infill, and the islands were connected by 
the early 1960s.[4][38] This bridge was rendered obsolete when the Little 
Hell Gate was filled, and a service road was built alongside the deteriorating 
bridge. Efforts were made in the mid-1990s to preserve the bridge in the 
face of plans by the New York City Department of Transportation to demolish 
it.[39] They were unsuccessful. Plans to construct a separate pedestrian 
bridge to provide Manhattan residents better access to the new Wards Island's 
Park were developed by Robert Moses in 1937, but construction of the Wards 
Island Bridge did not begin until 1949.[40][41] Designed by Othmar Hermann 
Ammann and built by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers,[42] the footbridge 
was originally known as the Harlem River Pedestrian Bridge.[43] The Wards 
Island Bridge opened to pedestrians on May 18, 1951 and was completed at 
a cost of $2.1 million.[44] It gives access to Wards Island Park from East 
Harlem, which has few public green spaces. A second footbridge over the 
Bronx Kill called the Randalls Island Connector, linking the island to 
the Bronx, opened November 2015 .[45] Construction of this bridge was proposed 
in 2006 but did not begin until 2013.[46] In May 1974 The headquarters
