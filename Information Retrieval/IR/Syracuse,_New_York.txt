Syracuse (local /ˈsɛrəkjuːs/) is a city in, and the county seat of, Onondaga 
County, New York, in the United States. It is the largest U.S. city with 
the name "Syracuse", and is the fourth most populous metropolitan city 
in the state of New York.[1] At the 2010 census, the city population was 
145,170, and its metropolitan area had a population of 732,117. It is the 
economic and educational hub of Central New York, a region with over a 
million inhabitants. Syracuse is also well-provided with convention sites, 
with a downtown convention complex. Syracuse was named after the original 
Greek city Syracuse (Siracusa in Italian), a city on the eastern coast 
of the Italian island of Sicily. The city has functioned as a major crossroads 
over the last two centuries, first between the Erie Canal and its branch 
canals, then of the railway network. Today, Syracuse is located at the 
intersection of Interstates 81 and 90, and its airport is the largest in 
the region. Syracuse is home to Syracuse University, a major research university, 
as well as several smaller colleges and professional schools. In 2010, 
Forbes rated Syracuse 4th in the top 10 places in the U.S. to raise a family.[2] 
The Syracuse area was first seen by Europeans when French missionaries 
came to the area in the 1600s. At the invitation of the Onondaga Nation, 
one of the five constituent members of the Iroquois confederacy, a group 
of Jesuit priests, soldiers, and coureurs des bois (including Pierre Esprit 
Radisson) set up a mission, known as Sainte Marie among the Iroquois, or 
Ste. Marie de Gannentaha, on the northeast shore of Onondaga Lake. Jesuit 
missionaries visiting the Syracuse region in the mid 1600s reported salty 
brine springs around the southern end of "Salt Lake", known today as Onondaga 
Lake. The 1788 Treaty of Fort Stanwix, and the subsequent designation of 
the area by the state of New York as the Onondaga Salt Springs Reservation 
provided the basis for commercial salt production from the late 1700s through 
the early 1900s; brine from wells that tapped into halite (common salt) 
beds in the Salina shale near Tully, New York, 15 miles south of the city 
were developed in the 19th century.[3][4] It is the north flowing brine 
from Tully that is the source of salt for the "salty springs" found along 
the shoreline of Onondaga lake. The rapid development of this industry 
in the 18th and 19th centuries led to the nicknaming of Syracuse as "The 
Salt City". In 1847, the city was officially named after Syracuse, Sicily, 
which at the time was also famous for its salt mining industry. The first 
Solvay Process Company plant in the United States was erected on the southwestern 
shore of Onondaga Lake in 1884 and the village was given the name Solvay, 
New York to commemorate its inventor, Ernest Solvay. In 1861, he developed 
the ammonia-soda process for the manufacture of soda ash (anhydrous sodium 
carbonate, a rare chemical called natrite, to distinguish it from natural 
natron of antiquity) from brine wells dug in the southern end of Tully 
valley (as a source of sodium chloride) and limestone (as a source of calcium 
carbonate). The process was an improvement over the earlier Leblanc process. 
The Syracuse Solvay plant was the incubator for a large chemical industry 
complex owned by Allied Signal in Syracuse, the result of which made Onondaga 
Lake the most polluted in the nation. The salt industry declined after 
the Civil War, but a new manufacturing industry arose in its place. Throughout 
the late 1800s and early 1900s, numerous businesses and stores were established, 
including the Franklin Automobile Company, which produced the first air-cooled 
engine in the world; the Century Motor Vehicle Company; and the Craftsman 
Workshops, the center of Gustav Stickley's handmade furniture empire. The 
Geneva Medical College was founded in 1834. It is now known as Upstate 
Medical University, one of only four medical colleges in the State University 
of New York system, and one of only five medical schools in the state north 
of New York City. The first New York State Fair was held in Syracuse in 
1841.[5] Between 1842 and 1889 the Fair traveled among 11 New York cities 
before finding a permanent home in Syracuse, where it has been an annual 
event except between 1942 and 1947, when the grounds became a military 
base during World War II.[5] World War II sparked significant industrial 
expansion in the area: specialty steel, fasteners, custom machining. After 
the war, two of the Big Three automobile manufacturers (General Motors 
& Chrysler) had major operations in the area. Syracuse was headquarters 
for Carrier Corporation, Crouse-Hinds traffic signal manufacturing, and 
General Electric had its main television manufacturing plant at Electronics 
Parkway in Syracuse. The manufacturing industry in Syracuse began to falter 
in the 1970s. Many small businesses failed during this time, which contributed 
to an already increasing unemployment rate. Rockwell International moved 
their factory outside New York state. General Electric moved its television 
manufacturing operations to Suffolk, Virginia and later to Singapore. The 
Carrier Corporation moved its headquarters out of Syracuse and outsourced 
manufacturing to Asian locations. Nevertheless, although city population 
has declined since 1950, the Syracuse metropolitan area population has 
remained fairly stable, even growing by 2.5 percent since 1970. While this 
growth rate is greater than much of Upstate New York, it is far below the 
national average during that period. Syracuse is located at 43°2′49″N 76°8′40″W﻿ 
/ ﻿43.04694°N 76.14444°W﻿ / 43.04694; -76.14444 (43.046899, -76.144423).[6] 
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area 
of 25.6 square miles (66 square kilometres), of which 25.1 square miles 
(65 square kilometres) is land and 0.6 square miles (1.6 square kilometres) 
(2.15%) water. The city stands at the northeast corner of the Finger Lakes 
region. The city has many neighborhoods which were originally various villages 
that joined the city over the years. Although the central part of Syracuse 
is flat, many of its neighborhoods are located on small hills such as University 
Hill and Tipperary Hill. Land to the north of Syracuse is generally flat 
while land to the south is hilly. About 27 percent of Syracuse's land area 
is covered by 890,000 trees — a higher percentage than in Albany, Rochester 
or Buffalo. This is despite the Labor Day Storm of 1998, a derecho which 
destroyed approximately 30,000 trees. The sugar maple accounts for 14.2 
percent of Syracuse's trees, followed by the Northern white cedar (9.8 
percent) and the European buckthorn (6.8 percent). The most common street 
tree is the Norway maple (24.3 percent) followed by the honey locust (9.3 
percent). The densest tree cover in Syracuse is in the two Valley neighborhoods, 
with 46.6 percent of their land covered by trees. The lowest tree cover 
percentage is found downtown, which consists of only 4.6 percent trees.[7] 
Syracuse's main water source is Skaneateles Lake, one of the country's 
cleanest lakes[citation needed], located 15 miles (24 kilometres) southwest 
of the city. Water from nearby Onondaga Lake is not drinkable due to industrial 
dumping that spanned many decades, leaving the lake heavily polluted.[8] 
Incoming water is left unfiltered[citation needed], and chlorine is added 
to prevent bacterial growth. Most of the lake cleanup is scheduled to be 
completed by 2016; the county is scheduled to finish its work by 2018.[9] 
For periods of drought, there is also a backup line which uses water from 
Lake Ontario.[10] Onondaga Creek, a waterway that runs through downtown, 
flows northward through the city. There is a creek walk and plans that 
will connect the Lakefront and Inner Harbor to Franklin Square, Armory 
Square, The Valley, and ultimately the Onondaga Nation. The creek is navigable, 
yet can be quite a challenge as its channelized nature speeds up its flow, 
particularly in the spring, when it may be dangerous. Drownings of youngsters 
resulted in fencing of the creek through some residential areas. Syracuse 
has a humid continental climate and is known for its snowfall. Boasting 
115.6 inches (294 centimetres) on average,[11] Syracuse receives the most 
annual average snow of any metropolitan area in the United States.[12][13] 
Syracuse usually wins the Golden Snowball Award, among Upstate cities. 
Its record so far is 192.1 inches (488 centimetres).[14] The high snowfall 
is a result of the fact that the city receives both lake effect from nearby 
Lake Ontario and nor'easter snow. Snow most often falls in small (about 
1–3 inches or 2.5–7.6 centimetres), almost daily doses, over a period of 
several days. Larger snowfalls do occur occasionally, and even more so 
in the northern suburbs. One notable blizzard was the Blizzard of 1993, 
during which 42.9 inches (109 centimetres) fell on the city within 48 hours, 
with 35.6 inches (90 centimetres) falling within the first 24 hours. Syracuse 
received more snow than any other city in the country during this storm, 
which shattered a total of eight local records, including the most snow 
in a single snowstorm.[15] A second notable snowfall was the Blizzard of 
1966, with 42.3 inches (107 cm). The Blizzard of '58 occurred in February 
(16-17th) across Oswego and Onondaga counties. This storm was an actual 
blizzard due to the high winds, blowing snow and cold. 26.1 inches (66 cm) 
of snow was measured at Syracuse and drifts reached 20 feet (600 cm) in 
Oswego County. (See Thirtieth Publication of the Oswego County Historical 
Society, (1969) and The Climate and Snow Climatology of Oswego N.Y., (1971)) 
February 1958 was the snowiest month ever in Syracuse, with a record 72.6 
inches (184 cm) recorded in 28 days. Syracuse shivered under a white blanket 
that averaged 4 feet (120 cm) on February 19. Syracuse declared a snow 
emergency under a new law that allowed municipalities to demand that streets 
be cleared of vehicles to help with plowing operations.[16] Syracuse receives 
an annual rainfall of 41.54 inches (105.51 centimeters).[17] Syracuse's 
hottest month is historically July, with an average high temperature of 
82 °F (28 °C), while its coldest month is historically January, with an 
average high temperature of 31 °F (−1 °C). The record high of 102 °F (39 °C) 
was recorded on July 9, 1936, and the record low of −26 °F (−32 °C) has 
occurred three times since 1922, the last being February 18, 1979.[18] 
While the average high during summer is around the low 80s, when adding 
humidity, the apparent temperature highs extend upward in the range of 
mid-80s to mid-90s in the city. Days just shy of 100 °F (38 °C), such as 
96 or 97 °F (36 °C), are not uncommon in and around the city with the humidity 
factored in. However, days above 100 °F (38 °C) are more rare, even with 
humidity taken into account. A few recent summers in Syracuse have been 
warmer than previous ones in the city and, like in some other places in 
the nation, previous records have been broken. For example, the summers 
of 2005 and 2012 are, respectively, the hottest and fourth-hottest summers 
on record.[19] As of the census of 2010,[26] there were 145,170 people, 
57,355 households, and 28,455 families residing in the city. The racial 
makeup of the city was 56.0% White, 29.5% African American, 1.1% Native 
American, 5.5% Asian, 0.03% Pacific Islander, 2.7% from other races, and 
5.1% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 8.3% of 
the population. The largest ancestries include Irish (12.4%), Italian (12.3%), 
German (9.6%), English (4.5%), and Polish (3.6%).[27] Non-Hispanic Whites 
were 52.8% of the population in 2010,[28] down from 87.2% in 1970.[29] 
There were 57,355 households out of which 29% had children under the age 
of 18 living with them, 9.3% were married couples living together, 20.8% 
had a female householder with no husband present, and 50.4% were non-families. 
38.4% of all households were made up of individuals and 10.4% had someone 
living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size 
was 2.31 and the average family size was 3.14. In the city, the population 
was spread out with 19% under the age of 15, 23% from 15 to 24, 25.6% from 
25 to 44, 21.7% from 45 to 64, and 10.5% who were 65 years of age or older. 
The median age was 29.6 years. For every 100 females there were 91 males. 
For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 87.89 males. According 
to the 2014 estimates from the American Community Survey, the median income 
for a household in the city was $31,566, and the median income for a family 
was $38,794. Males had a median income of $39,537 versus $33,983 for females. 
The per capita income for the city was $19,283. About 28.2% of families 
and 35.1% of the population were below the poverty line, including 50% 
of those under age 18 and 16.7% of those age 65 and over. As of July 2015, 
the United States Census Bureau indicated an estimated population of 144,142. 
According to the 2010 United States Census, the population ages 16 and 
older commuted to work as follows: Syracuse currently ranks 50th in the 
United States for high transit ridership and 12th for most pedestrian commuters. 
Each day, 38,332 people commute into Onondaga County from the four adjoining 
counties (2006).[30] Work Area Profile Report[31] Worker Age Earnings Christianity: 
Syracuse has two cathedrals, the Roman Catholic Cathedral of the Immaculate 
Conception and the Episcopal St. Paul's Cathedral. Both are located at 
Columbus Circle. Both are home to their respective dioceses, the Diocese 
of Syracuse (Roman Catholic) and the Diocese of Central New York (Episcopal). 
The Assembly of God, the Southern Baptist Convention and the United Church 
of Christ have their state offices in the Greater Syracuse area. Syracuse 
is also home to the novitiate center of the Jesuit New York Province, as 
well as the Basilica of the Sacred Heart of Jesus (Roman Catholic, with 
Mass offered in English and Polish). In addition there are dozens of churches 
in Syracuse of nearly every Christian denomination, including Eastern Orthodox, 
Jehovah's Witness, Christian Science, Reformed Presbyterian and Metaphysical 
Christian. Buddhism: Buddhism has its presence in Syracuse too with the 
Zen Center of Syracuse on the Seneca Turnpike; as well as a center on Park 
Street, on the city's north side. Hinduism: Hindu houses of worship include 
the Hindu Mandir of Central New York in Liverpool. Islam: Islam also has 
a presence in Syracuse, with the Islamic Society of Central New York Mosque 
on Comstock Avenue and Muhammad's Study Group on West Kennedy Street. Judaism: 
There are several synagogues in the Syracuse metropolitan area, including 
Beth Shalom-Chevra Chas, Temple Adath Yeshurun, and the Temple Society 
of Concord, which is considered to be the ninth oldest Jewish House of 
Worship in the United States. Sikhism: Sikh The house of worship, or Gurdawara, 
is the Sikh Foundation of Syracuse, in Liverpool. Unitarian Universalism: 
There are two Unitarian Universalist Societies in Syracuse including May 
Memorial Unitarian Society and First Unitarian Universalist Society of 
Syracuse. Syracuse's economy has faced challenges over the past decades 
as industrial jobs have left the area. The number of local and state government 
jobs also has been declining for several years. Syracuse's top employers 
are now primarily in education and the service industry. University Hill 
is Syracuse's fastest growing neighborhood, fueled by expansions by Syracuse 
University and Upstate Medical University (a division of the State University 
of New York), as well as dozens of small medical office complexes. The 
top employers in the Syracuse region and the size of their workforce, as 
of January 1, 2008:[33] Bristol-Myers Squibb, founded by alumni of nearby 
Hamilton College, has a complex in East Syracuse.[34] Time Warner Cable 
has based one of its divisions in Syracuse.[35] Today the Syracuse area 
has few extremely large employers, but rather many smaller ones, which 
provides for a certain amount of stability. Additionally, eight of the 
area's top eleven employers are in education or the service industry, which 
tend to be much more stable than the manufacturing industry. Throughout 
2006, the area gained jobs over the previous year's figures. During February 
and March 2006, the area's job growth rate tied with New York City for 
the highest in the state.[36] Syracuse's unemployment rate in July 2016 
was 4.7 percent, comparable to the national rate of 5.1.[37] Since 1927 
the State Tower Building has been the tallest in Syracuse. The City of 
Syracuse officially recognizes 26 neighborhoods within its boundaries. 
Some of these have small additional neighborhoods and districts inside 
of them. In addition, Syracuse also owns and operates Syracuse Hancock 
International Airport, located on the territory of four towns north of 
the city. Syracuse's neighborhoods reflect the historically ethnic and 
multicultural population. Traditionally, Irish, Polish and Ukrainian Americans 
settled on its westside; Jewish Americans on its eastside; German and Italian 
Americans on the northside; and African-Americans on its southside. In 
addition to the dominant Destiny USA shopping mall in the Syracuse's Lakefront 
neighborhood, many of the city's more traditional neighborhoods continue 
to have active business districts: Eastwood Armory Square Tipperary Hill 
Strathmore Clinton Square Hanover Square University Hill Westcott Franklin 
Square Marshall Street Destiny USA Inner Harbor Residents are assigned 
to schools in the Syracuse City School District.[38] Syracuse City School 
District consists of 34 schools and 4 alternative education programs.[39] 
In the 2014-2015 school year, the K-12 enrollment was 20,084.[5] 15% of 
students were classified as English Language Learners, 20% as students 
with disabilities, and 77% as economically disadvantaged.[5] The drop-out 
rate was 6%.[5] Syracuse City School District is currently collaborating 
with Say Yes to Education with the goal of every public school student 
graduating high school with the preparation and support to attain, afford, 
and complete a college or other postsecondary education.[40] They are also 
one of the "Big 5," which consists of the five New York State School districts 
with populations over 125,000.[41] "Big 5" school budgets are approved 
by annually by the Board of Education and city government as opposed to 
voters in an annual vote.[41] One of Syracuse's major research universities 
is Syracuse University, located on University Hill. It had an enrollment 
of 15,097 for the 2013–2014 academic year.[42] Immediately adjacent to 
Syracuse University are two doctoral-degree granting State University (SUNY) 
schools, the SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry and SUNY 
Upstate Medical University. Both institutions have long-standing ties to 
Syracuse University. SUNY Upstate Medical University is also one of Syracuse's 
major research universities and is one of only about 125 academic medical 
centers in the country. It is the region's largest employer.[43] Also serving 
Syracuse are Le Moyne College on the city's eastern border, and Onondaga 
Community College, which has its main campus in the adjacent Town of Onondaga 
and has two smaller campuses downtown and in Liverpool. A branch of SUNY's 
Empire State College is located in downtown Syracuse, along with a campus 
of the nationwide Bryant & Stratton College. A campus of ITT Technical 
Institute also calls the Syracuse metropolitan area home, also located 
in Liverpool. There are also the Pomeroy College of Nursing at Crouse Hospital 
and St. Joseph's College of Nursing. Other colleges and universities in 
the area include Cornell University and Ithaca College in Ithaca, Hamilton 
College in Clinton, Oswego State College in Oswego, SUNY Cortland in Cortland, 
Morrisville State College in Morrisville, Colgate University in Hamilton, 
Cazenovia College in Cazenovia, Wells College in Aurora, and both Utica 
College and SUNY Institute of Technology in Utica. Onondaga County Public 
Library (OCPL) operates Syracuse's public libraries.[44] Including the 
Central Library, ten city libraries, and 21 independent libraries in suburban 
Onondaga County.[45] A library card from any OCPL library will work at 
any of the other OCPL libraries.[46] City libraries [47] Subrurban libraries 
[48] Live jazz music is the centerpiece of two annual outdoor festivals 
in Syracuse, the Syracuse Jazz Festival, Polish Festival as well as the 
CNY Jazz Arts Foundation's Jazz In The Square Festival. Performers in the 
last five years have included Chuck Mangione, Joshua Redman, Smokey Robinson, 
Branford Marsalis, The Bad Plus, Randy Brecker, Stanley Clarke, Jimmy Heath, 
Terrence Blanchard, Slide Hampton, Bobby Watson, Dr. John, and Aretha Franklin. 
The Polish Festival hosted Grammy winners Jimmy Sturr and his Orchestra, 
Polish music legend Stan Borys and Irena Jarocka, Grammy nominee Lenny 
Goumulka, LynnMarie, Dennis Polisky & The Maestro's Men, Jerry Darlak and 
the Buffalo Touch & The John Gora Band. Syracuse was home to the 75-member 
Syracuse Symphony Orchestra (SSO), founded in 1961. The SSO's former Music 
Directors include Daniel Hege, Frederik Prausnitz and Kazuyoshi Akiyama. 
The orchestra performed over 200 concerts annually for an audience of over 
250,000. The SSO filed for Chapter 7 Bankruptcy in 2011 and was replaced 
by the Syracuse Symphoria in 2013.[49] The Clinton String Quartet has been 
active for over 15 years and is based in the Syracuse area. All four members 
were also members of the Syracuse Symphony Orchestra. The Syracuse Friends 
of Chamber Music for more than a half century have presented a series of 
concerts by various chamber ensembles. The Society for New Music, founded 
in 1982, is the oldest new music organization in the state outside of New 
York City, and the only year-round new music group in upstate New York. 
The Society commissions at least one new work each year from a regional 
composer, awards the annual Brian Israel Prize to a promising composer 
under 30 years of age, and produces the weekly "Fresh Ink" radio broadcast 
for WCNY-FM. The Syracuse Opera Company is a professional company that 
generally performs three operas each season. It was founded in 1963 as 
the Opera Chorus of the Syracuse Symphony Orchestra and became independent 
in 1973. In addition to full performances, it offers several free outdoor 
concerts each year in Armory Square, Thornden Park, and elsewhere. The 
company has an annual budget of US$1 million and is the only professional 
opera company in upstate New York. The Syracuse Shakespeare Festival is 
a charitable, educational, not-for-profit corporation dedicated to performing 
the works of William Shakespeare. It was founded in 2002 and is best known 
for its annual free Shakespeare-in-the-Park program at the Thornden Park 
Amphitheatre that has attracted more than 12,000 people since its inception. 
Syracuse Stage presents experimental and creative theater; a number of 
its productions have been world premieres and have moved to Broadway[citation 
needed]. The venue was designed by its most famous former artistic director 
Arthur Storch. Its current artistic director is Robert Hupp. The Red House 
Arts Center, which opened in 2004, is a small theatre housed in a converted 
hotel that offers performances by local, national, and international artists, 
and hosts regular exhibits in its art gallery, and screenings of independent 
films. Syracuse is also known for a large contemporary music scene, particularly 
in the heavy metal, hardcore, ska, and punk rock genres.[citation needed] 
The City of Syracuse maintains over 170 parks, fields, and recreation areas, 
totaling over 1,000 acres (4.0 km2).[50] Burnet Park includes the first 
public golf course in the United States (1901) and Rosamond Gifford Zoo. 
Other major parks include Thornden Park, Schiller Park, Sunnycrest Park, 
Onondaga Park and Kirk Park. There are 12 public pools, two public ice 
rinks, and two public nine-hole golf courses in the city. Right outside 
the city proper, along the east side and north end of Onondaga Lake, is 
Onondaga Lake Park. The adjacent Onondaga Lake Parkway is closed to vehicular 
traffic several hours on Sundays during the summer months, so it can be 
used for walking, running, biking, and rollerblading. During the holiday 
season, the park hosts Lights on the Lake, a two-mile (3.2 km) drive-through 
light show. Syracuse is served by the Central New York Regional Transportation 
Authority, or Centro. Centro operates bus service in Syracuse and its suburbs, 
as well as to outlying metropolitan area cities such as Auburn, Fulton, 
and Oswego. Proposed public transit projects In 2005, local millionaire 
Tom McDonald proposed an aerial tramway system, called Salt City Aerial 
Transit (S.C.A.T.), to link the university to the transportation center. 
The first segment from Syracuse University to downtown was estimated to 
cost $5 million, which McDonald planned to raise himself. Due perceived 
low operating costs, the system was envisioned as running continuously.[51] 
The Pyramid Companies have also proposed a monorail linking Syracuse University 
to Hancock International Airport, via downtown, (Downtown Syracuse), their 
proposed Destiny USA, the William F. Walsh Regional Transportation Center, 
and their proposed Destiny Technology Park. The cost of such a line has 
been estimated at $750 million.[52] The city lies on Amtrak's Empire Service, 
Lake Shore Limited, and Maple Leaf lines. Amtrak's station is part of the 
William F. Walsh Regional Transportation Center. The Empire Service runs 
several times daily from Niagara Falls to New York Penn Station, with major 
stops in Buffalo, Rochester, Syracuse, Utica, and Albany along the way. 
The Lake Shore Limited connects Syracuse to the same cities as above (except 
Niagara Falls), but continues westward from Buffalo to Chicago via Cleveland 
and Toledo, and eastward to Boston. This train completes one roundtrip 
daily. Also completing one roundtrip a day, the Maple Leaf follows the 
path of the Empire Service train, but continues to Toronto, Canada. A regional 
commuter rail service, OnTrack, was active from 1994 until it was discontinued 
in 2007 due to low ridership. Its sole route connected the Carousel Center 
to southern Syracuse, often extending to Jamesville in the summer. Greyhound 
Lines and Trailways provide long-distance bus service. Both also use the 
William F. Walsh Regional Transportation Center located in the northern 
area of the city. Syracuse is served by the Syracuse Hancock International 
Airport in nearby Salina, near Mattydale. The airport is served by 6 major 
airlines, which provide non-stop flights to destinations as far away as 
Minneapolis, as well as several daily flights to other important airline 
hubs and business centers such as Atlanta, Boston, Charlotte, Chicago, 
Detroit, Ft. Lauderdale, New York City, Orlando, Philadelphia, Tampa, Washington, 
DC, Toronto, and 147 foreign cites from 87 different countries, not including 
USA. Cargo carriers FedEx and UPS also serve the airport. New York City 
can be reached in under an hour flight. Four Interstate Highways run through 
the Syracuse area: Two US Highways run through the Syracuse area: New York 
State Route Expressways: Public services such as garbage pickup, street 
plowing, sewage, street and park maintenance, and traffic maintenance are 
provided by the Department of Public Works (DPW).[54] The Syracuse water 
system was one of the few water systems that was built and operated before 
federal funding. The water system was constructed mainly to support the 
industries around Syracuse, New York. Construction of Syracuse's water 
system began in 1868.[55] In 2015, the city experienced an average of at 
least one water main break per day. Between 2005 and 2015, the city suffered 
2,000 water main breaks. Mayor Stephanie Miner estimated of the cost to 
fix the city's water infrastructure at $1 billion over a 10-15 year period.[56] 
On February 25, 2015, Miner testified before a joint hearing of the state 
Assembly Ways and Means Committee and state Senate Finance Committee. Miner 
testified that the 2014 polar vortex contributed to the increase in Syracuse's 
water main break.[57] On March 3, the 100th water main break in Syracuse 
in 2015 occurred on James Street, Syracuse. After the James Street break, 
Miner lobbied the state for funding help. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo 
declined to help and told the city that it should be responsible for fixing 
its own water pipes.[58] The city is headed by an elected mayor who is 
limited to two four-year terms. The previous mayor until the end of 2009 
was former Syracuse Common Council President Matthew J. Driscoll,[59] who 
first assumed the position in 2001 after the former mayor, Roy Bernardi, 
resigned upon his appointment by President George W. Bush to a position 
in the Department of Housing and Urban Development. After serving the remaining 
term, Driscoll was re-elected that year, and again in 2005. Driscoll is 
a member of the Mayors Against Illegal Guns Coalition,[60] a bi-partisan 
group with a stated goal of "making the public safer by getting illegal 
guns off the streets." The Coalition is co-chaired by Boston Mayor Thomas 
Menino and New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. On November 3, 2009, 
Common Councilor At Large Stephanie Miner was elected Mayor. She began 
to serve in this capacity in January 2010. She is the first female mayor 
of Syracuse. The legislative branch of Syracuse is the Syracuse Common 
Council. It consists of a president and nine members, currently:[61] The 
Onondaga County Supreme and County Court is the trial court of general 
jurisdiction for Syracuse. It is also the administrative court for the 
Fifth District of the New York State Unified Court System. Judges for these 
courts are elected at-large. The U.S. District Court for the Northern District 
of New York also holds court in downtown Syracuse at the James Hanley Federal 
Building. The Syracuse Police Department, commonly referred to as the Syracuse 
Police, or simply SPD, is the principal law enforcement agency of the city 
of Syracuse, New York.[62] Police headquarters is located in the John C. 
Dillon Public Safety Building at 511 South State Street.[63] As of 2014[update], 
the Chief of Police is Frank L. Fowler.[64] The 2015–2016 budget for the 
police department was $47.4 million[65] Established in 2011, SPD operates 
a network of 91 surveillance cameras called the Criminal Observation and 
Protection System (COPS).[66][67] Between 2011 and 2014 more than 40 utility 
pole mounted cameras were installed, mainly in the Southwest and Northeast 
neighborhoods.[68] The cameras were funded by federal, state, and private 
grants. In Summer 2014, 10 cameras were approved for installation in Downtown 
Syracuse, the first area not targeted because of high levels of violent 
crime.[69] Live monitoring of Clinton Square for suspicious people during 
events and festivals was planned, although police agreed to a prohibition 
on the use of cameras to monitor protests.[70] Twenty-five additional cameras 
were planned to be installed in 2016.[67] The Syracuse Fire Department, 
or SFD, protects the city of Syracuse from fires and other dangers. The 
Department's Chief is Paul Linnertz.[71] Syracuse has one major daily morning 
newspaper, The Post-Standard. Until 2001, Syracuse also had an evening 
paper, The Herald-Journal. Besides a Syracuse/Onondaga County edition, 
The Post-Standard publishes three additional editions: Cayuga, Madison, 
and Oswego for the other three counties of the metropolitan area, plus 
an additional edition on Sundays. It has six news bureaus throughout Central 
New York, as well as one in Albany (state capital) and Washington, DC. 
Before the merger with the evening paper, the Post-Standard was named among 
the "10 best newspapers in America with a circulation of under 100,000" 
by Al Neuharth of USA Today (run by a competing organization). Since the 
merger, circulation has increased to over 120,000. Even outside of its 
four-county delivery area, the paper is available in many convenience stores 
and supermarkets from the Canada–US border to the New York–Pennsylvania 
border. The newspaper partly caters to this audience as well, covering 
many stories from the Ithaca, Utica, and Watertown areas. Since opening 
a new printing press in 2002, the paper calls itself "America's Most Colorful 
Newspaper," as almost every page contains color. Syracuse New Times is 
a weekly, free, arts and entertainment newspaper. The publication is released 
every Wednesday, with over 137,600 readers, and is distributed to over 
950 locations in Central New York. Launched in 1969, it is one of the oldest 
alternative weekly newspapers in the country. It is owned by Bill Brod, 
who purchased the business from long-time owner Arthur Zimmer in 2010. 
The Daily Orange, the newspaper of Syracuse University and SUNY ESF students, 
is read by over 20,000 people daily, and is widely distributed in the University 
Hill neighborhood and Armory Square. The Dolphin, the weekly student newspaper 
of Le Moyne College is also available, but read mainly by Le Moyne students. 
There are other popular free newspapers, including Eagle Newspaper's downtown 
edition, the City Eagle, and Table Hopping, which focuses on the restaurant 
and entertainment scene. Additionally, there's a weekly newspaper, CNY 
Vision, that publishes news and information focusing on the local African 
American community. Syracuse has eight full-power broadcast television

part of its regular and digital offerings, provides a 24-hour local news 
channel (Spectrum News Central New York), local sports channel, public 
access channel, and an additional PBS channel. Dish Network and DirecTV 
also provide local satellite television subscribers with local broadcast
