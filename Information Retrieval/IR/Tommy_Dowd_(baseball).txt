As Player As Manager Thomas Jefferson Dowd (April 20, 1869 – July 2, 1933), 
nicknamed "Buttermilk Tommy", was an American Major League Baseball outfielder 
and second baseman from Holyoke, Massachusetts, who played for six teams 
during his ten-season career. Dowd played college baseball at Brown University, 
and according to an article in the Brown Alumni Magazine: Nineteenth-century 
baseball authority Tim Murnane of the Boston Globe proclaimed Dowd the 
best center fielder he'd ever seen, especially for his skill at sprinting 
back on a ball over his head and then turning left or right for the catch. 
For years Dowd held the unofficial record time for circling the bases. 
Dowd made his major-league debut on April 8, 1891 for the Boston Reds of 
the American Association. He later played with the Washington Senators, 
St. Louis Browns, Philadelphia Phillies and Cleveland Spiders in the National 
League and the Boston Americans in the American League. He was a right-handed 
batter with a career batting average of .271, and stole 366 bases in his 
major league career. His final game was September 28, 1901. During the 
1891 and 1892 off-seasons, Dowd was the head football coach at Georgetown 
University. After his career, he coached at Amherst College and Williams 
College, and managed in several minor and independent leagues. In 1908 
he was managing at Hartford, and signed Chick Evans to a contract. Dowd 
also studied law at Georgetown University. He was given credit for discovering 
Rabbit Maranville. In 1905, Dowd coached the football team at St. Louis 
University,[1] leading the Blue and White to a 7–2 record.[2] Dowd died 
at the age of 64 in his hometown of Holyoke of accidental drowning. His 
body was found in the Connecticut River. He is interred at the Calvary
