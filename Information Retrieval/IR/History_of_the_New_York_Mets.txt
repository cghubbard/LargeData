The history of the New York Mets began in 1962 when the team was introduced 
as part of the National League's first expansion of the 20th century. The 
team's history includes two World Series championships and five National 
League pennants. In 1957, the Brooklyn Dodgers and New York Giants relocated 
from New York to California, leaving the largest city in the United States 
with no National League franchises. Two years later, on July 27, 1959, 
attorney William Shea announced the formation of a third major baseball 
league, the Continental League.[1] He tried to get several existing clubs 
to move, including the Philadelphia Phillies and the Cincinnati Reds, but 
no National League club was interested.[2][3] One of the Continental League's 
five charter members was a team in New York City.[1] Majority interest 
was held by Joan Whitney Payson and Charles Shipman Payson, former minority 
owners of the Giants. The second largest stake was held by George Herbert 
Walker, Jr. (uncle of the future President George H. W. Bush), who served 
as vice president and treasurer until 1977.[4] Former Giants director M. 
Donald Grant became chairman of the board. Grant and Joan Payson had been 
the only members of the Giants' board to oppose the team's move west. The 
existing leagues, which had considerably more autonomy at the time, responded 
with plans to add four new teams, two in each league. One of the new National 
League teams was to be in New York. The NL offered this new franchise to 
the CL's New York group, provided that they commit to building a new park. 
Shea told New York Mayor Robert F. Wagner, Jr. that he had to personally 
cable every National League owner and guarantee that the city would build 
a new facility. The new team required a new name, and many were suggested. 
Among the finalists were "Bees", "Burros", "Continentals", "Skyscrapers", 
"Skyliners", and "Jets", as well as the eventual runner-ups, "Empires" 
and "Islanders."[5][6] Although Payson had admitted a preference for "Meadowlarks", 
the owners ultimately selected "Mets,"[7] because it was closely related 
to the club's already-existing corporate name, "New York Metropolitan Baseball 
Club, Inc.", it hearkened back to "Metropolitans", a name used by an earlier 
New York team in the American Association from 1880 to 1887,[7] and because 
its brevity would naturally fit in newspaper headlines.[5] The name was 
received with broad approval among fans and the press.[6] From the beginning, 
the Mets sought to appeal to the large contingent of former Giants and 
Dodgers fans. The Mets' team colors reflect this: orange (and, more recently, 
black) from the Giants, blue from the Dodgers. Coincidentally, orange and 
blue are also New York City's official colors.[6] Thus two rival fan-bases 
with 19th-century origins were largely united in support of the new club. 
For the first two years of its existence, the team played its home games 
at the historic Polo Grounds in Upper Manhattan,[8] which it shared with 
the New York Jets. In 1964, both teams moved into newly constructed Shea 
Stadium in Flushing Meadows, Queens, where the Mets stayed through the 
2008 season. In 2009, the club moved into Citi Field, located adjacent 
to the former site of Shea Stadium. During their history, the Mets have 
won two World Series titles (1969 and 1986), five National League pennants 
(1969, 1973, 1986, 2000, 2015), and six National League East titles (1969, 
1973, 1986, 1988, 2006, 2015). The Mets also qualified for the postseason 
as the National League Wild Card team in 1999 and 2000. The Mets have appeared 
in more World Series — five — than any other expansion team in Major League 
Baseball history. Their two championships equal the tally of the Toronto 
Blue Jays, Florida Marlins and Kansas City Royals for the most titles among 
expansion teams. The Mets are the only expansion team to have won two World 
Series championships at home, as the Blue Jays and Marlins each won one 
on the road. (Blue Jays in 1992 and Marlins in 2003) The Mets held the 
New York baseball attendance record for 29 years. They broke the Yankees' 
1948 record by drawing nearly 2.7 million in 1970. The Mets broke their 
own record five times before the Yankees took it back in 1999.[9][10] No 
Met pitcher had ever thrown a no-hitter until June 1, 2012 when Johan Santana 
no-hit the Cardinals. The franchise's hurlers had gone more than 7,800 
games without pitching one — longer than any other Major League franchise. 
On several occasions, potential no-hitters by Met pitchers have been broken 
up in the late innings. Tom Seaver twice pitched 8 1⁄3 innings without 
allowing a hit for the Mets — in one of those games, against Chicago in 
1969, Seaver only needed two more outs for a perfect game before Jimmy 
Qualls singled[11] – while in recent years Tom Glavine, Pedro Martínez, 
John Maine, Mike Pelfrey, R.A. Dickey, Matt Harvey, Jacob DeGrom and Steven 
Matz all lost their no-hit bids in the 7th or 8th inning. In October 1961, 
the National League held an expansion draft to stock the rosters of the 
Mets and the Houston Colt .45s with players from other clubs. Twenty-two 
players were selected by the Mets, including some with notable previous 
success such as Roger Craig, Al Jackson, Frank Thomas, and Richie Ashburn. 
But rather than select talented young players with future potential, Mets 
management preferred to sign faded stars of the Dodgers and Giants to appeal 
to fans' nostalgia. Legendary Yankees manager Casey Stengel was hired out 
of retirement to lead the team,[3] but his managerial acumen wasn't enough 
to overcome the severe deficiency of talent among the players. The Mets 
took the field for the first time on April 11, 1962 against the St. Louis 
Cardinals (the first game, scheduled for April 10, was delayed due to rain.).[12][13] 
One apocryphal legend has it that in the first game, pitcher Roger Craig 
went into his windup with the Cardinals' Bill White on third—and dropped 
the ball. Craig was charged with a balk, scoring White from third with 
the first run ever against the Mets.[13] Despite Gil Hodges hitting the 
first home run in New York Mets history that day, the Mets went on to lose 
that game.[13] It would be the first of nine straight losses to start the 
season en route to a 40–120 record. Their .250 winning percentage was the 
fourth worst in major-league history, and the third-worst of the modern 
era (since 1901). Throughout major league history only the 1899 Cleveland 
Spiders (20–134) lost more games in a single season than the 1962 Mets.[14] 
It wasn't until 2003 that the record would be threatened by the Detroit 
Tigers, who finished the season at 43–119.[15][16] The ineptitude of the 
Mets during their first year is chronicled in colorful fashion in the 1963 
book Can't Anybody Here Play This Game?, written by New York columnist 
Jimmy Breslin. Beloved by New York fans despite—or perhaps because of—their 
losing ways, the Mets of the early 1960s became famous for their ineptitude. 
Journeyman players like the ironically nicknamed "Marvelous Marv" Throneberry 
became icons of athletic incompetence. Ex-Dodger and Giant pitcher Billy 
Loes, who was acquired by the Mets after the 1961 expansion draft, was 
credited with the ungrammatical "The Mets is a good thing. They give everybody 
jobs. Just like the WPA." Even the Mets proved to have standards, however. 
In 1962, Cleveland Indians catcher Harry Chiti was purchased by the Mets 
for a player to be named later in the season. After only 15 games and a 
.195 batting average, the Mets sent him back to the Indians; he never played 
another major league game. Chiti was the first player ever to be sent back 
to his original team in a trade in Major League history. The 1963 Mets 
featured a pitcher, Carlton Willey, who was having a great year, pitching 
four shut-outs, when he incurred an injury and finished with a 9–14 win-loss 
record. On May 26, 1964, in Chicago, they played like champions (at least 
for one game) and pummeled the Chicago Cubs, 19–1. According to legend, 
later that day a fan called a New York newspaper to get the score. He was 
told: "They scored 19 runs." There was a long silence, then the fan asked: 
"Did they win?"[17] Also in 1964, the Mets, who played their first two 
seasons in the old Polo Grounds, the former home of the Giants, moved to 
the newly constructed Shea Stadium, a 55,300-seat multipurpose facility 
built in the Flushing neighborhood of the Borough of Queens, adjacent to 
the site of the 1939 and 1964 New York World's Fairs. One high point of 
Shea Stadium's first season came on Father's Day, when Philadelphia Phillies 
pitcher Jim Bunning threw a perfect game against the Mets, the first in 
the National League since 1880. For perhaps the only time in the stadium's 
history, the Shea faithful found themselves rooting for the visitors, caught 
up in the rare achievement, and roaring for Bunning on every pitch in the 
ninth inning.[18] His strikeout of John Stephenson capped the performance. 
Another high point was Shea Stadium's hosting of the All-Star Game. Unexpectedly 
thrust into the spotlight in the final hectic weekend of the 1964 season, 
the Mets relished the role of spoiler, beating the Cardinals in St. Louis 
on Friday and Saturday (keeping alive the hopes of the Phillies, Giants, 
and Reds) before succumbing to the eventual National League and World Series 
champions on Sunday. The Mets' image as lovable losers was wearing a little 
thin as the decade progressed, but things began to change slowly in the 
late 1960s. In 1966, the Mets chose catcher Steve Chilcott as the first 
overall selection in the amateur draft. He became the first number one 
draft pick to retire without reaching the major leagues. The second pick 
that year was Hall of Famer Reggie Jackson. That year, the Mets went 66-95, 
the first season they did not finish with 100+ losses. The Mets acquired 
top pitching prospect Tom Seaver in a lottery and he became the league's 
Rookie of the Year in 1967. Even though the Mets remained in last place, 
Tom Seaver was a sign of good fortune to come. He was originally signed 
by the Atlanta Braves in February 1966 out of the University of Southern 
California, but his contract was voided by Commissioner William Eckert 
on the basis that the USC season had already started when Seaver signed. 
In order to resolve this issue, the Mets, Indians, and Phillies were all 
placed in a hat since they were the only teams willing to match the Braves 
offer, and the Mets were fortunate enough to win the drawing. In addition 
to Seaver, two other young players were catcher Jerry Grote and shortstop 
Bud Harrelson. This trio of youth formed a new, determined clubhouse nucleus 
that had no interest in losing, lovably or otherwise. By the 1968 season, 
Wes Westrum would be replaced as manager by Gil Hodges. Pitcher Jerry Koosman 
joined the staff and had a spectacular rookie season in 1968, winning 19 
games. Left fielder Cleon Jones developed as a batter and exciting center 
fielder Tommie Agee came over in a trade. But although much improved, the 
1968 team still finished the season in 9th place. The Mets began the 1969 
season in a mediocre way: an opening day home loss of 11–10 to the expansion 
Montreal Expos was followed by a record of 21–23 through the end of May. 
On April 10, 1969 Tommie Agee became the only player ever to hit a home 
run to the small area of fair territory in the upper level of Shea Stadium. 
A painted sign on the stands nearby commemorated the spot at Shea. By mid-August, 
the favored Chicago Cubs seemed safely on their way to winning the first 
ever National League East Division title (and their first postseason appearance 
of any kind since 1945). The Mets sat in third place, ten games behind; 
but Chicago went 8–17 in September, while the Mets, with outstanding pitching 
from their young staff, piled up victory after victory, winning 38 of their 
last 49 games. They took first place for good on September 10, and finished 
in first place with a 100–62 record for the season, their first winning 
year ever, a full eight games over the Cubs. The Mets finished with a team 
ERA of 2.99, and a league leading 28 shutouts thrown. Tom Seaver led the 
way with a 25–7 record, with lefty Jerry Koosman behind him at 17–9 record, 
while Cleon Jones finished with a .340 batting average. Seaver's best game 
occurred on July 9, at Shea Stadium, where he came within two outs of a 
perfect game, but gave up a one-out, ninth-inning single to the Cubs' Jimmy 
Qualls for the only hit in the Mets' 4–0 victory. The "Miracle Mets" or 
"Amazin Mets", as they became known by the press, went on to win a three-game 
sweep of the strong Atlanta Braves, led by legend Henry "Hank" Aaron, in 
the very first National League Championship Series. The Mets were considered 
underdogs in this series despite the fact that they had a better record 
than the Braves, the first place team in the National League West. The 
Mets were given very little chance in the 1969 World Series, facing a powerful 
Baltimore Orioles team that had gone 109–53 in the regular season and included 
Frank Robinson, Brooks Robinson, and Jim Palmer as well as future Mets 
manager Davey Johnson, who would make the final out of the Series. Before 
the series began, pundits predicted Tom Seaver might win the opening game, 
but that the Mets would have trouble winning again in the World Series. 
As it turned out, just the opposite occurred; Seaver was roughed up, allowing 
four runs in the opener, which he lost — but the Mets' pitching shut down 
the Orioles after that, holding them to just five runs over the next four 
games, to win the World Series 4 games to 1. Seaver got his revenge in 
game four, pitching all 10 innings of a 2–1 victory. For longtime Mets 
announcer Ralph Kiner and many fans, the turning point in the team's season, 
came in the third inning of the second game of a July 30 doubleheader against 
the Houston Astros. When left fielder Cleon Jones failed to hustle after 
a ball hit to the outfield, Mets manager Gil Hodges removed him from the 
game — but rather than simply signal from the dugout for Jones to come 
out, or delegate the job to one of his coaches, Hodges left the dugout 
and slowly, deliberately, walked all the way out to left field to Jones, 
and walked him back to the bench. For the rest of that season, Jones never 
failed to hustle. The Miracle Mets magic wore off as the 1970s began. In 
subsequent years, Mets pitchers generally excelled but received lackluster 
support from the hitters with mediocre finishes the result. Efforts to 
improve the offense backfired with blunders such as trading Amos Otis for 
troubled infielder Joe Foy after the 1969 season as well as young pitcher 
Nolan Ryan for infielder Jim Fregosi after the 1971 season. Once out of 
the glaring New York spotlight, Ryan became one of the best pitchers in 
history, spending 22 more years in the majors and entering the Baseball 
Hall of Fame in 1999 as a Texas Ranger. Fregosi battled injuries and played 
just 146 games for the Mets over a season and a half. Meanwhile, Otis became 
a star with the Kansas City Royals while Foy lasted only one season in 
New York. The team was thrown into confusion and shock prior to the 1972 
season, when Manager Gil Hodges, who had led the team to the World Series 
victory in 1969, suffered a sudden heart attack at the end of spring training 
and died. Coach Yogi Berra succeeded Hodges. Berra's Mets found themselves 
in last place with a 61–71 record at the end of August 1973, but they recovered 
behind relief pitcher Tug McGraw and his "Ya gotta believe!" rallying cry 
(the team has since trademarked the phrase), winning 21 of their last 29 
games. Berra also coined his most famous Yogiism that year: "It ain't over 
till it's over!" Their final record of only 82–79 was good enough to win 
the division while five better teams missed the postseason. Despite the 
second-worst winning percentage ever by a division winner (until the 2005 
San Diego Padres), the Mets then shocked the heavily favored Cincinnati 
Reds "Big Red Machine" in the NLCS. Their record remains the worst of any 
pennant-winning team but they managed to push the defending World Series 
Champion Oakland Athletics to a seventh game. Their near-miracle season 
ended with a loss to Ken Holtzman in the final contest. This was the only 
NL East title between 1970 and 1980 that wasn't won by either the Philadelphia 
Phillies or the Pittsburgh Pirates.[19][20] Those two teams reigned exclusively 
as NL East champions during that span (Pirates from 1970–1972 and won the 
1971 World Series, 1974, 1975, and winning the 1979 World Series, Phillies 
from 1976–1978 and winning the 1980 World Series).[19][20] As the 1975 
season ended, owner Joan Payson died, leaving the team to her husband Charles. 
While Joan Payson had been the driving force behind the Mets, her survivors 
did not share her enthusiasm. Charles delegated his authority to his three 
daughters, who left control over baseball matters to club chairman Grant. 
Contract disputes with star pitcher Tom Seaver and slugger Dave Kingman 
erupted in 1977. Both players were traded on June 15, the trading deadline, 
in what New York tabloids dubbed "The Midnight Massacre." The Mets received 
six players in the two deals, but none had any lasting impact. Attendance 
fell, to the point where Shea Stadium was nicknamed "Grant's Tomb."[21] 
Coincidentally, the Yankees began their resurgence at roughly the same 
time, further eroding the Mets' fan base. The team finished in last place 
yet again in 1978. By this time, it was obvious that Grant had mismanaged 
the team and failed to invest in its future. Charles Payson himself fired 
Grant at the end of the season. The Mets continued to struggle, and did 
not become a competitive team again until the mid-1980s, marking the first 
time that both New York teams were competitive at the same time, both on 
the field and at the box office. In January 1980, the Payson heirs sold 
the Mets franchise to the Doubleday publishing company for $21.1 million. 
Nelson Doubleday, Jr. was named chairman of the board while minority shareholder 
Fred Wilpon took the role of club president. Wilpon quickly hired longtime 
Baltimore Orioles executive Frank Cashen as general manager to begin the 
process of rebuilding the Mets. Cashen's positive impact on the organization 
took some time to be felt at the major league level. He began by selecting 
slugging high school phenomenon Darryl Strawberry as the number one overall 
pick in the 1980 amateur draft. Two years later, hard-throwing hurler Dwight 
Gooden was taken as the fifth overall selection in the 1982 draft. The 
pair rose quickly through the minors, winning successive Rookie of the 
Year awards (Strawberry in 1983, Gooden in 1984). Cashen's mid-season 1983 
trade for former MVP Keith Hernandez helped spark the Mets' return to competitive 
contention. In 1984, new manager Davey Johnson was promoted from the helm 
of the AAA Tidewater Tides and led the Mets to a 90–72 record, their first 
winning season since 1976. In 1985, the Mets acquired catcher Gary Carter 
from the Montreal Expos and won 98 games, but lost the division title to 
the St. Louis Cardinals in the final days of the season in a memorable 
series. The Mets began the series three games behind St. Louis and won 
the first two, but faltered in the third game, allowing St. Louis to remain 
in first place. Before the 1986 season, Doubleday sold his publishing company 
to Bertelsmann AG, and used the proceeds to buy the Mets in his own name. 
He then sold a half-stake to Wilpon, making them full partners. Unlike 
the league champion Mets of 1969 or 1973, the 1986 Mets broke away from 
the rest of the division early and dominated throughout the entire year. 
They won 20 of their first 24 games, clinched the East Division title on 
September 17, and finished the year 108–54, which tied with the 1975 Cincinnati 
Reds for the third highest win total in National League history, behind 
the 1906 Chicago Cubs (116) and the 1909 Pittsburgh Pirates (110). The 
relative lack of excitement during the regular season was more than compensated 
for by the spectacularly suspenseful and dramatic post-season series. In 
the National League Championship Series, the Mets faced their fellow 1962 
expansion team, the Houston Astros. Unlike the Mets, the Astros had yet 
to win a pennant, but had former Mets pitchers Mike Scott, the league's 
Cy Young Award winner, and fireballer Nolan Ryan leading their pitching 
staff. The Mets took a two-games-to-one lead with a come-from-behind walk-off 
home run by Lenny Dykstra. In Game 6, the Mets turned a 3–0 ninth-inning 
deficit into a sixteen-inning marathon victory to clinch the National League 
pennant and earn their third World Series appearance. The Astros would 
have to wait until 2005 to finally win their first pennant. In the World 
Series against the Boston Red Sox, the Mets faced elimination leading into 
Game 6. The Red Sox scored two runs in the tenth inning and twice came 
within one strike of winning their first World Series since 1918. However, 
the Mets rallied and would come back in typical Amazin' Mets fashion, as 
the game became one of the most famous games in baseball history as the 
Curse of the Bambino appeared to be alive and well. In fact, it was in 
this series that talk of this curse began.[22][23][24] With two outs and 
down two runs, three consecutive singles brought the Mets within 90 feet 
(27 m) of knotting the score. Hitter Mookie Wilson ran the count to 2–1, 
then fouled off 3 consecutive pitches. With the count 2–2, pitcher Bob 
Stanley threw a wild pitch that Wilson had to leap out of the way of. Boston 
catcher Rich Gedman made a wild stab for the ball but it went to the backstop. 
Pinch hitter Kevin Mitchell scored from third base, tying the game. Now 
facing a full count, Wilson fouled off two more pitches. On NBC, Vin Scully 
then called a play that would quickly become an iconic one to baseball 
fans, with the normally calm Scully growing increasingly excited: Scully 
then remained silent for more than three minutes, letting the pictures 
and the crowd noise tell the story. Scully resumed with: The Mets went 
on to win their second World Series title by taking Game 7, also in dramatic 
fashion, overcoming a 3 run deficit while scoring a total of 8 runs during 
the final 3 innings. The final score was 8–5 with Mets' pitcher Jesse Orosco 
ending the game by striking out Marty Barrett. Orosco then threw his glove 
high in the air and dropped to his knees while catcher Gary Carter ran 
to the mound to embrace him. This scene was captured on film and would 
become an iconic image, taken by Mets photographer George Kalinsky, in 
Mets baseball history and in all of baseball. The Mets remained the only 
team to come within one strike of losing a World Series before recovering 
to become World Champions, until the St. Louis Cardinals did it in 2011. 
The Mets winning this World Series is the highest-rated single World Series 
game to date. The Mets were also the first team to win a World Series in 
a potential clinching game delayed by rain, as Game 7 was postponed by 
one day.[25] While the team around the 1986 championship was strong, they 
also became infamous for off-the-field controversy. Both Strawberry and 
Gooden were youngsters who wound up burning out long before their time 
because of various substance abuse and personal problems. Hernandez's cocaine 
abuse was the subject of persistent rumors even before he joined the Mets, 
but he publicly acknowledged his addiction in 1985 and made a successful 
recovery. Lenny Dykstra's reputation was recently tainted by allegations 
of steroid use and gambling problems.[26] Instead of putting together a 
winning dynasty, the problems caused the Mets to soon fall apart.[27] Despite 
Darryl Strawberry's numerous off-the-field mishaps, he remains the Mets' 
all-time leader in home runs and runs batted in. This World Series championship 
by the Mets had a strange twist: Lou Gorman, the general manager of the 
Red Sox, was vice president, player personnel, of the Mets from 1980 to 
1983. Working under Mets' GM Frank Cashen, with whom Gorman served with 
the Orioles, he helped lay the foundation for the Mets' championship. After 
winning the World Series in 1986 the Mets declined to re-sign World Series 
MVP Ray Knight, who then signed with the Baltimore Orioles. Also, they 
traded the flexible Kevin Mitchell to the Padres for long-ball threat Kevin 
McReynolds. But the biggest shock since the Midnight Massacre of 1977 was 
when Mets' ace Dwight Gooden was admitted to a drug clinic after testing 
positive for cocaine. But after struggling in the first few months of the 
1987 season, "Dr. K" would come back, and so would the Mets. It was during 
the tough times that the Mets made a great long-term deal, trading Ed Hearn 
to the Kansas City Royals for pitcher David Cone. They would surge to battle 
St. Louis for the division title. They would have two tough losses to the 
Cardinals. The first came on Seat Cushion Night where Tom Herr hit a walk-off 
grand slam. But the worst loss came on September 11 in a game against St. 
Louis, 3rd baseman Terry Pendleton hit a homer to give the Cardinals a 
lead, and eventually the NL East title. One highlight of the year was Darryl 
Strawberry and Howard Johnson becoming the first teammates' ever to hit 
30 homers and steal 30 bases in the same season. After missing the playoffs 
in 1987, the 1988 Mets again won the division. Thanks to some stellar pitching 
from Gooden, Ron Darling, and David Cone as well as offense from McReynolds, 
Strawberry, and Howard Johnson, the Mets won 100 games for the 2nd time 
in 3 campaigns. In addition, Strawberry and McReynolds both lost the MVP 
to Kirk Gibson as they finished 2nd and 3rd in the voting, respectively. 
Despite this, however, the clubhouse was distracted by the presence of 
a young Gregg Jefferies who was just called up. The veteran players took 
a dislike to Jefferies, who had a habit of excessive bragging, prompting 
his teammates to saw his custom-made bats in half as a form of hazing.[28] 
The Mets played the Los Angeles Dodgers in the 1988 National League Championship 
Series in a season where they beat them 10 out of 11 times but, led by 
Orel Hershiser, the Dodgers continued their Cinderella story season by 
beating the Mets in seven games. The Mets would get off to a slow start, 
thanks to an infamous Picture Day brawl between Darryl Strawberry and Keith 
Hernandez, apparently because Hernandez told reporters that Kevin McReynolds 
should win the 1988 NL MVP over Strawberry (although Los Angeles' Kirk 
Gibson would beat both Mets for the award). Eventually, the Mets (as well 
as the Montreal Expos) would battle the Cubs for the division title in 
1989, but Chicago would prevail, despite a career year by Howard Johnson 
and a deadline trade with Minnesota for 1988 AL Cy Young winner Frank Viola. 
Those high points were tempered by injuries to Gooden, Hernandez and Carter 
as well as an ill-fated trade[29] that sent Dykstra and Roger McDowell 
to Philadelphia in exchange for Juan Samuel. After the season, Samuel, 
who hit .235 that season, would be traded to the Dodgers for Mike Marshall, 
who would hit .239 in 53 games for the Mets before being traded to Boston. 
Dykstra, however, would become an All-Star in Philadelphia and help lead 
his team to a pennant in 1993. That offseason, the Mets had a mix of triumph 
and tragedy. They would receive All-Star closer and native New Yorker John 
Franco in a trade with the Cincinnati Reds, and Strawberry, in legal trouble 
as well, would check into an alcohol rehabilitation center and miss the 
start of the season. They would also lose key veterans Gary Carter and 
Keith Hernandez as they left for the Giants and Indians, respectively. 
The next season, the Mets would surge again to battle the Pittsburgh Pirates, 
but Pittsburgh's "B-B Guns" (which included Barry Bonds, Bobby Bonilla, 
Jay Bell and Wally Backman) led the Pirates to their first NLCS since 1979. 
In that campaign, general manager Frank Cashen fired Johnson from his managerial 
job and replaced him with former shortstop Bud Harrelson. Although he led 
them to a good finish in 1990 (Strawberry's last with the Mets, as he went 
on to sign with the Dodgers in the offseason), the Mets fell to 5th place 
in 1991. Before the 1991 season the Mets signed Vince Coleman to a $2 million 
contract after failing to sign defending batting champion Willie McGee. 
This was the first of what would lead to many bad free agent signings and 
trades that would doom the Mets during the mid-1990s. During the 1991 season, 
the Mets were actually in contention for most of the first half of the 
season, closing to within 2.5 games of the front-running Pirates at one 
point. However, during the second half, the bottom completely fell out 
and Harrelson was fired with a week left to go in the season, replaced 
by third base coach Mike Cubbage for the final games. Jefferies was once 
again a distraction as he released a controversial statement to be read 
on WFAN radio: "When a pitcher is having trouble getting players out, when 
a hitter is having trouble hitting, or when a player makes an error, I 
try to support them in whatever way I can. I don't run to the media to 
belittle them or to draw more attention to their difficult times. I can 
only hope that one day those teammates who have found it convenient to 
criticize me will realize that we are all in this together. If only we 
can concentrate more on the games, rather than complaining and bickering 
and pointing fingers, we would all be better off."[30] This was seen as 
the end for Jefferies in New York as he would be traded to the Kansas City 
Royals in the offseason. The season ended on a high note, however, as David 
Cone pitched a one-hit shutout against the Phillies at Veterans Stadium, 
in which he struck out 19 batters, tying the National League regulation 
game record (first set by former Met Tom Seaver). With all of the personal 
problems swirling around the Mets after the 1986 championship, the Mets 
tried to rebuild using experienced superstars. They picked up Eddie Murray 
for over $3 million, Bobby Bonilla for over $6 million. They also traded 
McReynolds and Jeffries for one-time World Series hero Bret Saberhagen 
and his $3 million contract, along with signing veteran free agent pitcher 
Frank Tanana for $1.5 million. The rebuilding was supported by the slogan, 
"Hardball Is Back".[31] The experiment of building a team via free agency 
quickly flopped as Saberhagen and Coleman were soon injured and spent more 
time on the disabled list than on the field, and Bonilla exhibited unprofessional 
behavior towards members of the press, once threatening a reporter by saying, 
"I'll show you The Bronx" [1]. At the beginning of the 1991 season, Coleman, 
Gooden and outfielder Daryl Boston were named in an alleged sexual abuse 
incident against a woman near the Mets' spring training facility; charges 
were later dropped. Meanwhile, popular pitcher David Cone was dealt to 
the Toronto Blue Jays during the 1992 season for Ryan Thompson and Jeff 
Kent. While the move was widely criticized by fans of both teams, the Jays 
went on to win the 1992 World Series. Their descent was chronicled by the 
book The Worst Team Money Could Buy: The Collapse Of The New York Mets 
(ISBN 0-8032-7822-5) by Mets beat writers Bob Klapisch and John Harper. 
The lowest point of the experiment was the 1993 season when the Mets lost 
103 games. In April of that year, Coleman accidentally hit Gooden's shoulder 
with a golf club while practicing his swing. In July, Saberhagen threw 
a firecracker under a table near reporters. Their young pitching prospect 
Anthony Young started the '93 season at 0–13 and his overall streak of 
27 straight losses over two years set a new record. After Young's record-setting 
loss, Coleman threw a firecracker out of the team bus window and injured 
three people resulting in felony charges that effectively ended his Mets 
career; the Mets placed him on paid administrative leave for the remainder 
of the season, and announced less than a month before the end of the season 
that he would never play for them again. Only a few days later, Saberhagen 
was in trouble again, this time for spraying bleach at three reporters. 
The meltdown season resulted in the worst record for a Mets team since 
1965. In addition, two of the three remaining links to the '86 team, Howard 
Johnson and Sid Fernandez, departed after the season via free agency. The 
following season was filled with some bright spots, but there was still 
trouble for the franchise, and for the team's franchise player. Gooden, 
who had a 3–4 record with a 6.31 ERA in the final year of his contract 
with the team, shocked not only New York sports fans, but baseball fans 
around the country by testing positive for cocaine and was suspended by 
Major League Baseball for 60 days. Shortly after he began serving his suspension 
for the positive drug test, it was announced that he had again tested positive 
for cocaine and was now being suspended by Major League Baseball for one 
year, thus ending his Mets career and nearly his life. The day after receiving 
the second suspension, Gooden's then-wife, Monica, found him in his bedroom 
with a loaded gun to his head. Still, the 1994 season saw some promise 
for the troubled Mets, as first baseman Rico Brogna and second baseman 
Jeff Kent became fan favorites with their solid glove work and potential 
20–25 home run power, Bonilla started to become the player the Mets expected, 
and a healthy Saberhagen, along with promising young starter Bobby Jones 
and John Franco, helped the Mets pitching staff along. In the strike-shortened 
1994 season the Mets were in 3rd place behind first-place Montreal and 
Atlanta when the season ended on August 12. When the strike finally ended 
in 1995, the Mets finally showed some promise again, finishing in 2nd place 
(but still 6 games under .500) behind eventual World Series champion Atlanta. 
The 1995 season marked the emergence of pitchers Bill Pulsipher, Jason 
Isringhausen, and Paul Wilson. The trio were dubbed Generation K, a group 
of talented young hurlers who were destined to bring the Mets into greatness, 
much like Tom Seaver, Jerry Koosman and Nolan Ryan did in the 1960s. However, 
all three players succumbed to injury, preventing them from reaching their 
full potential. Of the three of them, only Isringhausen would accomplish 
much of significance in the majors, but as a reliever, eventually reaching 
300 career saves. The Mets dismal 1996 season was highlighted by the play 
of switch hitting catcher Todd Hundley breaking the Major League Baseball 
single season record for home runs hit by catcher with 41. Center fielder 
Lance Johnson set single-season franchise records in hits (227), triples 
(21), at bats (682), runs scored (117). Johnson's 21 triples also led the 
National League, the highest amount by an NL player since 1930. In the 
off season, the Mets acquired first baseman John Olerud from the Toronto 
Blue Jays for pitcher Robert Person. In 1997, they missed the playoffs 
by only four games, and improved by 17 wins from 1996. On June 16, the 
Mets beat the New York Yankees at Yankee Stadium in the first ever regular-season 
game played between the crosstown rivals 6–0.[32] Mets starter Dave Mlicki 
pitched a complete game shutout to pick up the win.[32] In 1997, Hundley's 
great season was derailed by a devastating elbow injury and required Tommy 
John surgery. Also, during the season, on April 15, the Mets hosted ceremonies 
marking the 50th anniversary of Jackie Robinson's first game with the Brooklyn 
Dodgers before their game against the Los Angeles Dodgers at Shea Stadium.[33] 
During the ceremonies, Robinson's jersey number, 42, was retired by Major 
League Baseball.[33] The Mets won the game 5-0.[34] The Mets season in 
1998 began with an unforgettable opening day game at Shea Stadium on March 
31 against their division rival Philadelphia Phillies, marking the first 
time that a regular season baseball game was played in New York in March.[35] 
Both of them were involved in the longest scoreless opening day game in 
the National League and the longest one in the MLB since 1926 when the 
Washington Senators beat the Philadelphia Athletics 1-0 in 15 innings.[36][37] 
The Mets won the game 1-0 in 14 innings when backup catcher Alberto Castillo 
delivered a full-count, two-out, pinch-hit single to right with the bases 
loaded off Philadelphia closer Ricky Bottalico.[37] During the season, 
the Mets acquired Mike Piazza in a blockbuster trade that immediately brought 
star power and credibility to the Mets that had been lacking in recent 
years. After the Piazza trade, the Mets played well, but missed the 1998 
postseason by only one game. With five games left in the season, the Mets 
could not win a single game against both the Montreal Expos at home and 
the Atlanta Braves on the road.[38] Following the 1998 season the Mets 
re-signed Mike Piazza to a seven-year, $91 million contract, the Mets traded 
Todd Hundley to the Los Angeles Dodgers.[39] Trades netted the Mets Roger 
Cedeño, Armando Benítez, and the Mets signed free agents Robin Ventura, 
Rickey Henderson, and Bobby Bonilla. The Mets started the 1999 season well, 
going 17–9, but after an eight-game losing streak, including the last two 
to the New York Yankees, the Mets fired their entire coaching staff except 
for manager Bobby Valentine. The Mets, in front of a national audience 
on Sunday Night Baseball, beat the New York Yankees 7–2 in the turning 
point of the 1999 season. Both Mike Piazza and Robin Ventura had MVP-type 
seasons and Benny Agbayani emerged as an important role player. It was 
a breakout year for Mets second baseman Edgardo Alfonzo and Roger Cedeño, 
who broke the single season steals record for the Mets. After the regular 
season ended, the Mets played a one-game playoff against the Cincinnati 
Reds, Al Leiter pitched the best game of his Met career as he hurled a 
two-hit complete-game shutout to advance the Mets to the playoffs. In the 
NLDS, the Mets defeated the Arizona Diamondbacks 3 games to 1. The series-clinching 
victory included a walk-off home run by backup catcher Todd Pratt. The 
Mets would lose however in the 1999 National League Championship Series 
to the Atlanta Braves, in six exciting games which included the famous 
Grand Slam Single by Robin Ventura to win game 5 for the Mets.[38] The 
Mets were at one point down 3–0 in the series. In the 1999 offseason, the 
Mets traded Roger Cedeño and Octavio Dotel to the Houston Astros for Derek 
Bell and Mike Hampton. Todd Zeile was signed to play first base, replacing 
departing free agent John Olerud. The 2000 season began well for the Mets 
as Derek Bell became the best hitter on the team for the first month. The 
highlight of the season came on June 30 when the Mets beat the rival Atlanta 
Braves in a memorable game at Shea Stadium on Fireworks Night. With the 
Mets losing 8–1 to begin the bottom of the eighth, they rallied back with 
two outs to tie the game, capping the 10-run inning with Mike Piazza's 
three run home run to put the Mets up 11–8, giving them the lead and eventually 
the win. The Mets easily made the playoffs winning the National League 
wild card. In the playoffs, the Mets beat the San Francisco Giants in the 
first round and the St. Louis Cardinals in the 2000 National League Championship 
Series to win their fourth NL pennant. Mike Hampton was named the NLCS 
MVP for his two scoreless starts in the series as the Mets headed to the 
2000 World Series to face their crosstown rivals, the New York Yankees. 
The Mets were defeated in the much-hyped "Subway Series." This marked the 
first all-New York World Series since 1956, when the Yankees defeated the 
Brooklyn Dodgers. With the Cardinals sweeping the Braves in their NLDS 
series, it made the Mets' run to the World Series much easier, given that 
the Braves eliminated the Mets from the playoffs and/or playoff contention 
in 1998 and 1999.[38][40] The most memorable moment of the 2000 World Series 
occurred during the first inning of Game 2 at Yankee Stadium. Piazza fouled 
off a pitch which shattered his bat, sending a piece of the barrel toward 
the pitcher's mound. Pitcher Roger Clemens seized the piece and hurled 
it in the direction of Piazza as the catcher trotted to first base, benches 
briefly cleared before the game was resumed with no ejections. In July 
2000, Clemens had knocked Piazza unconscious with a fastball to the helmet, 
Piazza had previously enjoyed great success against Clemens, with 3 crucial 
home runs in previous encounters. In 2001, the Mets finished with a record 
of 82–80. After the September 11th terrorist attacks Shea Stadium was used 
as a relief center and then saw the first sporting event in New York City 
since the attacks, in a game vs. the Atlanta Braves on September 21. Before 
the game the FDNY, EMT, NYPD, and all rescue workers were honored, Diana 
Ross sang "God Bless America", the two teams shook hands to show that they 
were united in the face of tragedy, and Liza Minnelli sang "New York, New 
York" during the 7th inning stretch. In the bottom of the 8th inning the 
Mets were trailing 2–1 when Mike Piazza came to bat with a runner on first. 
Piazza dramatically sent Shea into a frenzy by crushing a home run to give 
the Mets a 3–2 lead and the eventual win. The game is considered to be 
one of the greatest moments in the history of the franchise. After the 
September 11, 2001 attacks, the Mets, as well as other teams in the league, 
wore Red Cross, FDNY,NYPD and PAPD hats. Unlike the other teams, the Mets 
wore these for the rest of the year, despite threats of fines by Major 
League Baseball. In the following seasons, the Mets struggled mightily 
as the result of several poor player acquisitions, including Mo Vaughn, 
Roberto Alomar, and re-acquiring former Mets Roger Cedeño and Jeromy Burnitz. 
These acquisitions were made by then-general manager Steve Phillips, who 
was fired during the 2003 season. Phillips was credited with building the 
2000 World Series team, but also blamed for the demise of the Mets' farm 
system and the poor play of the acquired players. The Mets did have a few 
bright spots in 2002. Al Leiter became the first major league pitcher to 
defeat all thirty major league teams with a victory over the Arizona Diamondbacks. 
However, the Mets posted a 75–86 record, last in the NL East. The team's 
2002 difficulties reached off the field as co-owners Wilpon and Doubleday 
became embroiled in a bitter legal dispute over Wilpon's attempt to buy 
Doubleday's half of the team. Doubleday alleged that Major League Baseball 
attached an unrealistically low value to the team, thereby lowering the 
amount of money he would receive from Wilpon in the buyout. Wilpon sued 
Doubleday in federal court to force the sale. The purchase was finally 
settled and Wilpon became sole owner of the Mets on August 23, 2002.[41] 
Wilpon, the founder of Sterling Equities, Inc., manages the Mets through 
his limited partnership firm, Sterling Mets.[42] The Mets' record in 2003 
(66–95) was the fourth worst in baseball, and Piazza had missed two-thirds 
of the season with a torn groin muscle. His steady decline around that 
time mirrored the Mets' fortunes for the first half of the decade. José 
Reyes also made his debut on June 10, 2003. In 2004, the Mets made more 
poor player acquisitions including signing Japanese shortstop Kazuo Matsui, 
who never lived up to his potential in two-and-a-half years with the Mets. 
General manager Jim Duquette acquired pitcher Kris Benson for third baseman 
Ty Wigginton at the trade deadline just before one of the worst trades 
in franchise history, sending highly touted pitching prospect Scott Kazmir 
to the Tampa Bay Devil Rays for the disappointing Víctor Zambrano. On July 
21, 2004, the Mets brought up third baseman David Wright. Since then, Wright 
and Jose Reyes have become the most outstanding products of the Mets' farm 
system since Darryl Strawberry and Dwight Gooden. Nonetheless, The Mets 
finished 71–91 in 2004. After the 2004 season, Mets ownership made significant 
changes to their management strategy. With their television contract with 
the Cablevision expiring at the end of 2005, they announced plans to establish 
their own cable network to broadcast Mets games. This investment in what 
became known as SportsNet New York was coupled with an aggressive plan 
to upgrade the performance of the team on the field. Jim Duquette was replaced 
as general manager by former Expos GM Omar Minaya. Minaya, an ex-Mets assistant 
GM, had achieved notable success in Montreal by making bold player moves 
on a limited budget. With the Mets, Minaya was given substantial financial 
resources to develop a winning team. Minaya began by hiring Yankee bench 
coach Willie Randolph as manager, then signed two of that year's most sought-after 
free agents — Pedro Martínez and Carlos Beltrán — to large multi-year deals. 
Despite an 0–5 start to the season, the team finished 83–79, finishing 
above the .500 mark for the first time since 2001. The 2005 season was 
also the last by Mike Piazza in a Mets uniform. During the 2005 offseason 
star first baseman Carlos Delgado and catcher Paul Lo Duca were acquired 
via trade and the Mets signed free agent closer Billy Wagner. In 2006, 
led by a franchise record six All-Stars (Beltran, Lo Duca, Reyes, Wright, 
Tom Glavine, and Martínez), the Mets won the division title, their first 
in 18 years. In a runaway similar to 1986, the Mets led the division from 
April 6 on, and only spent one day out of first the whole season. The Mets 
finished the season 12 games ahead of the Phillies, and with the best record 
in the National League. The turning point for the season was a 9–1 June 
road trip. The 2006 season was also the first time that the Mets and Yankees 
each won their respective divisions in the same year and both teams tied 
for the best record in baseball. The Mets swept the Los Angeles Dodgers 
in the 2006 National League Division Series. In the 2006 National League 
Championship Series, the Mets lost in seven games to the St. Louis Cardinals, 
the eventual 2006 World Series champions. Game 7 featured one of the most 
spectacular plays in postseason history when left fielder Endy Chávez leaped 
over the 8-foot (2.4 m)-high left field wall in the top of the sixth inning 
and caught the ball with the tip of his glove to rob Cardinals third baseman 
Scott Rolen of a two-run home run. Chávez then threw to the cutoff man 
second baseman José Valentín, who threw to Carlos Delgado at first base, 
doubling off center fielder Jim Edmonds for an inning-ending double play. 
Chávez's effort was in vain, however, as Yadier Molina's two-run home run 
in the ninth off of Aaron Heilman gave the Cardinals a 3-1 lead and Carlos 
Beltrán took a curve ball from Cardinals closer Adam Wainwright for a called 
third strike with the bases loaded on a full count in the bottom of the 
9th inning to end the Mets season. After their success in 2006, there were 
high expectations for the Mets in 2007, and they started the season strong. 
The Mets then had a 7-game lead in the division with 17 games to go. The 
Mets, however, would lose 12 of their final 17 games enabling the Philadelphia 
Phillies to win the NL East by one game. The Mets were eliminated on the 
final day of the season as Tom Glavine allowed 7 runs to the Florida Marlins 
and only got through 1/3 of an inning in his final start as a Met. The 
Mets became the first team in baseball history to blow a lead of seven 
or more games with only 17 games to play.[43] In the 2007 offseason the 
team acquired two-time Cy Young Award-winning pitcher Johan Santana from 
the Minnesota Twins for outfielder Carlos Gómez and minor-league pitchers 
Philip Humber, Deolis Guerra and Kevin Mulvey.[44] The 2008 season marked 
the final season at Shea Stadium, the team's home for 45 years. Throughout 
the first half of the season, the Mets struggled, playing .500. On June 
16, Omar Minaya fired Willie Randolph, Rick Peterson, and Tom Nieto. Jerry 
Manuel was named interim manager.[45] The Mets improved under Manuel, highlighted 
by a 10-game winning streak in July. In September the Mets had 3.5 game 
divisional lead over the Philadelphia Phillies with 17 games left to play. 
However, the Mets lost 10 of their final 17 games. The Phillies went 13–4 
during the same stretch and won the division (the Phillies went on to win 
the World Series). The Mets still remained in the NL Wild Card with the 
Milwaukee Brewers but on September 28, the final game played at Shea Stadium, 
the Mets were eliminated from playoff contention by losing to the Florida 
Marlins on the season's final day for the second straight season. To improve 
the bullpen for the 2009 season, which was arguably the reason the Mets 
missed the playoffs in 2007 and 2008, the Mets signed free agent closer 
Francisco Rodríguez, who established a single-season major league record 
for saves (62) as a member of the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim in 2008. 
They also acquired setup man J. J. Putz from the Seattle Mariners in exchange 
for several players. The 2009 season was the Mets' first season at Citi 
Field, a retropark following current architectural trends in stadium design. 
It follows the brick and steel-truss trend begun by the Orioles at Oriole 
Park at Camden Yards in 1992. The exterior facade resembles Ebbets Field, 
former home of the Brooklyn Dodgers. The Mets' first exhibition game at 
Citi Field was played on April 3, 2009 against the Boston Red Sox. The 
first regular season home game was on April 13, 2009 against the San Diego 
Padres, who spoiled the opener with a 6–5 win against the Mets. In that 
game, Jody Gerut of the Padres became the first player to open a new ballpark 
with a leadoff home run. On April 17, Gary Sheffield, who just days earlier 
was signed by the Mets as a free agent, hit his 500th home run against 
the Milwaukee Brewers. Sheffield became the first pinch hitter to reach 
this milestone, as well as the first to do it in a Mets uniform. The 2009 
season for the Mets was marred by numerous injuries suffered by its players, 
with 20 of them having been on the disabled list at one point or another 
during the season and losing star (and also replacement) players like J. 
J. Putz, John Maine, Óliver Pérez, José Reyes, Carlos Beltrán, David Wright, 
Carlos Delgado, Johan Santana, and Gary Sheffield. As a result, the Mets 
finished in fourth place, with a record of 70–92 and failed to qualify 
for the playoffs for the third straight season. Mets players spent more 
than 1,480 days in the disabled list in 2009, more than any other team 
in the majors.[46] However, second-half turnarounds of Jeff Francoeur and 
Daniel Murphy helped the Mets finish the season with the best batting average 
in the National League, tied with the Los Angeles Dodgers.[47] Coming into 
2010, the Mets were looking for a comeback after a sluggish 2009 season 
full of injuries. In their biggest acquisition of the offseason, the Mets 
signed outfielder Jason Bay to a four-year, $66 million deal with a vesting 
option for a fifth year. David Wright came into training camp heavier because 
of muscle he built up during the winter. The Mets brought in Gary Matthews, 
Jr. to start in place of Carlos Beltrán because of Beltran's surgery in 
February 2010. The team won their first game of the season, beating the 
Florida Marlins by a score of 7-1 on April 5. On April 17, 2010, the Mets 
beat the St. Louis Cardinals 2–1 in 20 innings. This was the fourth game 
of at least 20 innings in Mets history, but their first win. On April 28, 
the Mets defeated the Los Angeles Dodgers 7-3 to complete a 9-1 homestand, 
tying a franchise record reached by the 1969 and 1988 teams. The Mets had 
two eight-game winning streaks in the first half of the season, but started 
the second half with a 2-9 West Coast road trip. They would never recover, 
finishing the season at 79-83, losing the final game of the season 2-1 
to the Washington Nationals when Óliver Pérez hit one batter, then walked 
the next three to force home the winning run in the top of the 14th inning. 
After the 2010 season, the Mets announced that they declined to exercise 
an option on manager Jerry Manuel and relieved Omar Minaya of his duties.[48] 
The Mets hired former Oakland Athletics and San Diego Padres executive 
Sandy Alderson to be their new general manager and was formally introduced 
on Friday, October 29, 2010.[49] On November 23, 2010, Alderson hired Terry 
Collins to replace Manuel as manager. In 2011, the Mets had their third 
straight losing season at 77–85. During the season, the Mets made history 
in 2011 when Jason Isringhausen converted his 300th save with the team, 
the third player in franchise history to reach the milestone while with 
the organization behind John Franco and Billy Wagner. Also, José Reyes 
became the first Met in franchise history to win a National League batting 
title with .337 batting average, winning it on the final day of the season 
after a bunt single and Ryan Braun of the Milwaukee Brewers going 0 for 
4.[50] Prior to the July trade deadline reliever Francisco Rodríguez was 
sent to Milwaukee on July 12 while outfielder Carlos Beltrán was dealt 
to San Francisco on July 27. In December they lost Jose Reyes in free agency 
to division rival the newly christened Miami Marlins. Coming into 2012 
the Mets were 1 of 2 franchises (the other being the San Diego Padres) 
to have never thrown a no-hitter. However, on June 1 Johan Santana changed 
that after throwing a no-hitter against St. Louis in a 8-0 victory. This 
game was also notable for Carlos Beltrán's return to Citi Field as a member 
of the Cardinals. They ended the season with a 4th place 74-88 finish. 
New York pitcher R.A. Dickey would win the National League Cy Young Award. 
Despite the award it would be Dickey's final season with the Mets as he 
was traded to the Toronto Blue Jays in the offseason. Through the trade 
of R.A. Dickey, the Mets received many new prospects including Travis D'Arnaud 
and Noah Syndergaard. After losing the rights to the Buffalo Bisons, the 
Mets claimed the Las Vegas 51s as their Triple A affiliate for 2013-15. 
Citi Field was the host for the 2013 Major League Baseball All-Star Game 
which took place on July 16, 2013. Matt Harvey was the primary pitcher 
for the team and was the starter for the National League All-Stars. During 
the season, Harvey received the nickname "The Dark Knight of Gotham" from 
Sports Illustrated. The Mets finished the season 74-88, the same record 
as the previous season. However, for the first time in the history of the 
franchise, the Mets swept their cross-town rivals the Yankees in the Subway 
Series.[51] Mets ace Matt Harvey was out for the entirety of the 2014 season. 
During the offseason, the Mets signed former Yankees Curtis Granderson 
and Bartolo Colón, the latter of which was used to bolster the pitching 
rotation. The Mets finished their season 79-83 and along with the Atlanta 
Braves tied for second place in the National League East Division for the 
first time since the 2008 season. The most notable player of the season 
was rookie Jacob deGrom who received the 2014 National League Rookie of 
the Year Award. In the offseason, the Mets have signed Michael Cuddyer 
and John Mayberry, Jr.. At 13-3, the Mets are off to their best start in 
franchise history (tied with 1986). As of April 24, they have won 11 in 
a row for the first time since 1990, and swept a 10-game homestand.[52] 
The Mets played .500 ball until the trade deadline. On July 31 the Mets 
acquired all star outfielder Yoenis Céspedes who has provided the Mets 
with an undeniable spark. Since the deadline the team has won 11 of 13, 
including a sweep of the then first place Nationals. The Mets won the National 
League East for the first time since 2006 after a 10-2 win in Cincinnati 
on September 26. They advanced to the National League Division Series to 
face the Los Angeles Dodgers. They beat the Dodgers in five games led by 
their ace Jacob deGrom in game 5. They moved on to the National League 
Championship Series where they swept the Cubs to return to the World Series 
for the first time since the 2000 World Series. In the 2015 World Series,
