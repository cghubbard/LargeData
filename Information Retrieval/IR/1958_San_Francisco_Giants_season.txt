The 1958 San Francisco Giants season was the franchise's inaugural season 
in San Francisco, California and 76th season overall. The Giants' home 
ballpark was Seals Stadium. The team had a record of 80–74 team finishing 
in third place in the National League standings, twelve games behind the 
NL Champion Milwaukee Braves. The Giants and the now-Los Angeles Dodgers, 
arch-rivals for 68 years in New York, faced each other in their respective 
first-ever game on the West Coast. On Tuesday afternoon, April 15, 1958, 
at Seals Stadium, the Giants' temporary home park, San Francisco blanked 
Los Angeles, 8–0, behind Rubén Gómez' complete game, six-hit shutout. Gómez 
fanned six, issued no bases on balls, and went two for four at the plate. 
Daryl Spencer hit the first home run in San Francisco's MLB history with 
a solo shot in the fourth inning, and rookie Orlando Cepeda followed with 
another solo blast one inning later. Willie Mays had two runs batted in. 
Don Drysdale took the loss for the Dodgers. Attendance at the longtime 
minor league stadium was a sellout, 23,448.[8] Infielders Coaches Note:
