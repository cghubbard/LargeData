The 1983 Philadelphia Phillies season involved the Phillies winning the 
National League East Division title with a record of 90–72, by a margin 
of six games over the Pittsburgh Pirates. As the Phillies were celebrating 
their centennial season, they defeated the Los Angeles Dodgers, three games 
to one in the National League Championship Series, before losing the World 
Series to the Baltimore Orioles, four games to one. The Phils were managed 
by Pat Corrales (43–42) and Paul Owens (47–30), as they played their home 
games at Veterans Stadium. The 1983 Phillies were nicknamed the "Wheeze 
Kids" because of the numerous veteran players on the team. The 1950 National 
League pennant winning Phillies had been nicknamed the "Whiz Kids" due 
to their youth; stars Richie Ashburn, Robin Roberts, Willie Jones, Del 
Ennis, and Granny Hamner were all 25 years old or younger. Prior to the 
1983 season, the Phillies acquired Morgan, age 39 and Tony Pérez, age 40, 
to compliment Pete Rose, age 41, and as Morgan told Sports Illustrated 
in March 1983, "...help win them a world championship." [7] At the time, 
the Phillies also had Ron Reed, 40, Bill Robinson, 39, Steve Carlton, 38, 
and Tug McGraw, 38. Philadelphia Daily News sportswriter Stan Hochman gave 
them the Wheeze Kids nickname[8] and it was quickly adopted and used by 
Phillies president Bill Giles. By the 1983 World Series, the moniker was 
commonly used to refer to the team. Infielders Other batters Coaches Note:
