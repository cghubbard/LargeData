Peter "Pete" Joseph Incaviglia (born April 2, 1964) is a retired Major 
League Baseball (MLB) outfielder. He was drafted in the first round (eighth 
overall pick) by the Montreal Expos in the 1985 amateur draft out of Oklahoma 
State University, but was traded later the same year to the Texas Rangers. 
He debuted in the major leagues on April 8, 1986, without having spent 
any time in the minor leagues. Incaviglia played for 12 seasons from 1986 
to 1998 with six different teams. His last game was on September 27, 1998. 
He was noted for his power, but also for his tendency to strike out. He 
led the majors in strikeouts by a hitter in 1986 and 1988. He struck out 
1,277 times in his career. He owns the single-season National Collegiate 
Athletic Association (NCAA) home run record, with 48, and run batted in 
record, with 143. At Oklahoma State, Incaviglia became one of the greatest 
power hitters in College Baseball history. In three seasons he amassed 
100 home runs (in 213 games) and had a career slugging percentage of .915. 
In his junior season, he hit 48 home runs and finished the year with an 
NCAA record 1.140 slugging percentage.[1] He also led Oklahoma State to 
the College World Series in each of his three seasons. He is still the 
NCAA Division I baseball all-time leader in home runs in a career and home 
runs in a season. He was elected to the College Baseball Hall of Fame in 
2007.[2] Incaviglia's rookie season came in 1986. Drafted by the Montreal 
Expos, he refused to play a day in the minor leagues. He was traded to 
the Texas Rangers who would grant the request and make him the 15th player 
in Major League history to debut in the majors without ever playing minor 
league ball since the amateur draft began in 1965.[1] He had the tenth 
most home runs in the league (30) and set a Rangers club record, but also 
struck out the most times in 1986, and currently holds eighth place on 
the single-season strikeout record. His rookie season set a standard that 
he would be unable to match the rest of his career. In 1987, his home run 
output decreased by three, but his batting average climbed 21 points, he 
had a better slugging percentage, and he cut down his strikeouts by 17. 
Incaviglia hit at least 20 home runs in his first five seasons, all with 
Texas. His playing time and production dropped thereafter in single seasons 
with Detroit and Houston, but his career received a boost when he was signed 
by the Philadelphia Phillies before the 1993 season. He and fellow outfielder 
Jim Eisenreich were key acquisitions for the team that would go on to win 
the division and reach the World Series (one year after finishing in last 
place). In just 368 at-bats, Incaviglia hit 24 home runs and drove in a 
career-best 89 runs. He also posted career highs in OPS (.848) and WAR 
(2.9). As a result of the Expos trading Incaviglia immediately after signing 
him, Major League Baseball instituted a rule whereby a team cannot trade 
a drafted player until he has been under contract to the club for at least 
one year. This was known as the Pete Incaviglia Rule.[3] The rule was changed 
during the 2015 season, allowing teams to trade drafted players the day 
after the World Series concludes.[4] Incaviglia was the hitting coach for 
the Erie Seawolves, the Detroit Tigers Class AA affiliate in the Eastern 
League, for the three seasons, but was dismissed at the end of the 2006 
season.[5] Incaviglia was announced as the first manager of the Grand Prairie 
AirHogs on October 24, 2007. The AirHogs began play in May 2008 in the 
American Association of Independent Professional Baseball and reached the 
Southern Division playoffs in his first season as their manager.[6] As 
of 2014, he is the team manager of the Laredo Lemurs.[7] On December 20, 
2007 Incaviglia was named in Jason Grimsley's unsealed affidavit as an
