the professional ranks, winning the NIAA Class 4A state championship in 
2005. Carter was drafted by the Chicago White Sox in the 15th round of 
the 2005 Major League Baseball Draft. Carter began his professional career 
with the Short-Season Bristol White Sox in 2005. He hit 10 home runs and 
had 37 runs batted in. He played for two teams in the 2006 season. The

25 home runs and had 93 runs batted in. During the 2007 offseason, Carter 
was traded to the Arizona Diamondbacks for Carlos Quentin.[1] Two weeks 
after he was traded to Arizona, Carter was traded to the Oakland Athletics 
as part of the package to bring Dan Haren to Arizona.[2] He played for 
the Stockton Ports in the 2008 season where he hit 39 home runs and had 
104 runs batted in. Carter was named the California League Rookie of the 
Year for the 2008 season.[3] In 2009, Carter split time between Double-A 
Midland and Triple-A Sacramento, putting a .329 batting average (a 70-point 
increase from 2008), 28 homers and 115 RBIs combined. In 2008 and 2009, 
Baseball America ranked Carter as one of the top 10 prospects in the Athletics' 
organization.[4] Also in 2008 and 2009, Carter was the Oakland Athletics' 
Minor League Player of Year.[5] Carter was placed on the A's 40-man roster 
on November 20, 2009.[6] In 2009, he was named the This Year in Minor League 
Baseball Awards "Overall Hitter of The Year".[5] On August 9, 2010, Carter 
was promoted to Oakland and went 0–3 in his first game. On August 16, Carter 
was demoted to Triple-A Sacramento after starting his career 0–19 with 
12 strikeouts. After the AAA season ended, Carter was recalled to Oakland. 
On September 20, he snapped his 0–33 streak with a single in the sixth 
inning. On September 22, 2010 Carter hit his first major league home run 
against the Chicago White Sox. Carter finished the 2010 season with a .186 
batting average across 78 plate appearances and 24 games.[7] He played

and the minor leagues, hitting .239 with 16 home runs and 39 RBI in 67 
games.[9] After the 2012 season, the Athletics traded Carter to the Houston 
Astros with Brad Peacock, and Max Stassi for Jed Lowrie and Fernando Rodriguez.[10] 
During the 2013 season, Carter played 148 games batting .223 with 29 home 
runs, 82 RBI, and struck out an MLB-leading 212 times.[7] He became only 
the fourth player to join the 200-strikeout club and his number of strikeouts 
set a new American League record for a right-handed hitter. The 2014 season 
started out even slower for Carter, as he batted only .153 throughout the 
entire month of April. Carter would turn his fortunes around after the 
All-Star break though, as finished with a .227 batting average and career 
highs of 37 home runs and 88 RBI.[7] On January 14, 2015, Carter and the 
Astros agreed to a one-year contract worth $4.175 million, avoiding arbitration.[11] 
Carter had a disappointing 2015 season for the Astros; Carter was the team's 
starting first baseman, but hit only .199 in 129 games. However, he still 
managed to hit 24 home runs, and then hit .294 with a home run against 
the Kansas City Royals during the ALDS. At the conclusion of the 2015 season 
Carter was non tendered by the Astros and he became a free agent.[12] On 
January 6, 2016, Carter signed a one-year, $2.5 million contract with the 
Milwaukee Brewers. He became an everyday force in the lineup, posting a 
.321 On-Base Percentage and clubbing 41 homers, leading the National League
