Negro League Baseball William S. Monroe (c. 1877 – March 16, 1915) was 
an American infielder in baseball's Negro leagues. He was also known by 
the nickname of "Money." During a 19-year career from 1896 to 1914, he 
played on many of the greatest teams in black baseball. He was a good hitter 
and slick fielding third base and second baseman who was compared to major 
league star Jimmy Collins.[4] Monroe played all four infield positions, 
but spent his prime seasons at third base and second base. Monroe was known 
for his showmanship, and entertained crowds with feats such as catching 
"Texas Leaguers" behind his back and kicking ground balls to make them 
bounce into his hands. In a 1952 Pittsburgh Courier newspaper poll to select 
the greatest Negro League ballplayers of history, Monroe was named as the 
third-team second baseman behind Jackie Robinson and Bingo DeMoss.[5] He 
was one of 94 Negro League candidates initially recommended by the National 
Baseball Hall of Fame's screening committee for the 2006 Hall of Fame election 
by the Committee on African American Baseball, though he did not make the 
list of 39 names that ultimately appeared on the ballot. Monroe was born 
in Tennessee; his father was a minister. As a youth he developed a reputation 
throughout the South as an outstanding athlete and baseball player.[6] 
By 1896 he was playing professionally, and in 1899 he joined the Chicago 
Unions as a shortstop.[6][7] In 1900–1901 Monroe played for the Cuban X-Giants—John 
Holway reports that he played second base, and Clark and Lester report 
that he played shortstop.[7][8] From 1903 to 1905 he played for the Philadelphia 
Giants, which were perhaps the top team of that period. Clark and Lester 
show him playing shortstop in 1903 and 1904, and third base in 1905, while 
Holway lists him at first base in 1903, shortstop in 1904, and utility 
in 1905. Statistics are scarce during this period; Holway gives statistics 
for a 1903 playoff between the Philadelphia Giants and the Cuban X-Giants, 
where Monroe batted 3 for 11 (.273), which was the second highest average 
on his team. In a 3-game playoff with the X-Giants in 1904, Monroe went 
0 for 7(.000), and in a 3-game playoff with the Brooklyn Royal Giants in 
1905, he went 2 for 8 (.250). Philadelphia won the championships in 1904 
and 1905.[7][8] James Riley tells a story that Hall of Famer Joe McGinnity 
was once paid $500 by a semi-professional team to pitch against the Philadelphia 
Giants. After seven scoreless innings, Monroe came to bat and pointed his 
bat at McGinnity, taunting him. McGinnity knocked Monroe down with his 
next pitch, but Monroe kept up the taunting. He then bet McGinnity $500 
that he'd hit a home run. The pitcher accepted the bet and fired a fastball, 
which Monroe hit for a home run which would ultimately win the game for 
the Giants. Monroe continued his taunting by running the bases backward.[4] 
In 1906, Monroe played part of the season for the Philadelphia Giants, 
then moved to the Brooklyn Royal Giants, where he played third base until 
1908 and second base from 1909 to 1910. Holway lists his 1906 batting average 
as .500, but without indicating how many at bats were recorded; his 1909 
his batting record was listed as 6 for 8 (.750), and in 1910 it was .171. 
The Royal Giants were the eastern champions in 1910.[7] A somewhat more 
complete statistical record comes during this period from his play in the 
Cuban League during the winters of 1906–1907 and 1907–1908, and from series 
played in Cuba in the fall of 1908. During 1906–1907, in 14 games he hit 
18 for 51 (.353) with a triple and a home run (.451 slugging percentage) 
and 4 walks and 3 times hit by pitch (.431 on-base percentage).[9] The 
following winter, he played 16 games and went 23 for 72 (.319) with two 
doubles and a triple (.375 slugging).[10] Then, in the fall of 1908 the 
Royal Giants toured Cuba, playing against Habana and Almendares, the top 
teams in Cuba. Monroe played 15 games and went 13 for 56 (.232) with one 
triple and three walks.[11] During the same tour, he participated in a 
series against the major league Cincinnati Reds. In two games he went 3 
for 8 (.375) with three runs scored and one walk.[12] Sportswriter Harry 
Daniels named Monroe to his 1909 "All American Team" saying "the great, 
fastest man in base ball, and the most wonderful base runner for the past 
ten years; also strong at bat."[13] In 1911, Monroe moved to the Chicago 
American Giants, which were the preeminent team of that era and one of 
the great Negro league teams of all time. His first season, he played second 
base and hit cleanup behind Pete Hill.[4] According to Holway, in 1911 
Monroe hit .297, in 1912 he hit .208, in 1913 he hit .268, and in 1914 
he .239.[7] A popular player, he was called the "king of second basemen," 
"idol of all the ladies," and "the most sensational player on the American 
Giants' team." In 1914 the American Giants easily won the western title 
and swept the eastern champion Brooklyn Royal Giants in four straight games, 
with Monroe hitting fifth.[4] Although still a good player in 1914, Monroe 
did not live to see the next baseball season. On March 16, 1915 he died 
of tuberculosis at his parent's home in Chattanooga, Tennessee at the age 
of 38.[6][14] His obituary reported that Hall of Fame manager John McGraw 
had once said, "Monroe was the greatest infielder he had ever seen," but
