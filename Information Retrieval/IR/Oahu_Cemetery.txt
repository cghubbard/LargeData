The Oʻahu Cemetery[1] is the resting place of many notable early residents 
of the Honolulu area. They range from missionaries and politicians to sports 
pioneers and philosophers. Over time it was expanded to become an area 
known as the Nuʻuanu Cemetery.[2] It was the first public cemetery in Honolulu, 
founded in November 1844. Due to the growth in the whaling industry, discussion 
had started in 1836 on the need for a new burial ground that was not associated 
with a specific church. The 4.38 acres (1.77 ha) site was purchased for 
$300 and $350 granted for a house. The money was raised by selling subscriptions 
on 59 plots of $12 each. Later another 3 acres (12,000 m2) were purchased 
from Gerrit P. Judd to expand in 1860. Rev. Samuel C. Damon served on the 
cemetery association in the early days. The first recorded burial was American 
sailor H. Wolley, for $2.50.[3] In 1906, the first public crematory in 
the Hawaiian Islands, designed by architect Oliver G. Traphagen opened 
at the cemetery.[4][5] After the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, all paper 
currency on the islands was withdrawn and replaced with Hawaii overprint 
notes, in case the Japanese invaded. Faced with the task of quickly destroying 
$200 million of cash, the crematory at the cemetery was used to burn it, 
instead of risking transport to the mainland.[6][7] However, progress was 
too slow, so the larger furnace at the Aiea sugar mill was also used.[8][9][10][a] 
An area called the Seamen's Lot contains many unmarked graves for sailors, 
provided by the Honolulu Sailor's Home. Another plot is dedicated to firefighters, 
marked by a monument 15 feet (4.6 m) high. Two dozen were killed by strafing 
in the December 7, 1941 attack.[11] Oʻahu Cemetery is located at 2162 Nuʻuanu 
Avenue, at the base of the Nuʻuanu Valley at coordinates 21°19′27″N 157°51′1″W﻿

King Kamehameha IV built the Royal Mausoleum of Hawaii across the street 
for the Hawaiian royal family. In Punchbowl Crater (to the south) the National 
Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific was founded in 1948. Just north of the 
Royal Mausoleum, the "Nuʻuanu Memorial Park" was added in 1949, with its 
own funeral home.[13][14] In 1958 a Japanese cemetery was added on adjacent 
land called "Honolulu Memorial Park".[15] In 1964, two Columbaria (buildings 
to store cremated remains) called the Kyoto Gardens were constructed. One 
of the buildings is a replica of a Buddhist temple. They are listed on 
the National Register of Historic Places.[16] Strictly speaking, the original 
1844 cemetery is called "Oʻahu Cemetery", although the extended area is 
often called "Nuʻuanu Cemetery"[17][18] after the area.[19] In 1989 a funeral 
for Ferdinand Marcos was planned at the mortuary,[20] but instead the body 
was kept refrigerated at the Byodo-In Temple until it was flown back to
