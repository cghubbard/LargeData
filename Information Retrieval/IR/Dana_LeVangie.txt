Dana Alan LeVangie (born August 11, 1969) is an American professional baseball 
coach, and a former professional player (as a catcher) and scout. He is 
currently the bullpen coach for the Boston Red Sox of Major League Baseball. 
A native of Whitman, Massachusetts, LeVangie batted and threw right-handed, 
stood 5 feet 10 inches (1.78 m) tall and weighed 185 pounds (84 kg) as 
an active player. He was the Red Sox' 14th-round draft pick in 1991 out 
of American International College in Springfield, Massachusetts. He had 
graduated from Cape Cod Community College in 1989, before going on to AIC. 
He was a catcher on the AIC baseball team for two seasons (1990–1991), 
and, as a senior, he compiled a .462 batting average with 13 home runs 
and 75 runs batted in en route to garnering Division II All-America and 
Northeast-10 Player of the Year honors. That season, AIC went 32–12 and 
advanced to the Division II College World Series for the first time in 
school history. As of 2008, LeVangie holds the school record for career 
batting average with a .410 mark among players with at least 100 hits.[1] 
After being signed by Boston, LeVangie languished in the minor leagues 
for six seasons. He eventually reached Triple-A Pawtucket for eight games 
in 1995–1996. He was a .196 hitter (207-for-1,186) with seven home runs 
and 78 RBI in 351 career minor-league games, including 76 runs, 28 doubles, 
three triples and five stolen bases.[2] Following a surgery on his left 
hand, LeVangie was offered the job of bullpen catcher by minor league coordinator 
Bob Schaefer and reached the Major Leagues in 1997 as the Red Sox' bullpen 
catcher. He served in that role for eight seasons, including the 2004 World 
Series Championship campaign. After the season, he joined the professional 
scouting and then the advance scouting staff of the organization.[3] In 
September 2007, LeVangie was assigned to follow the Los Angeles Angels 
in anticipation of the postseason, and eventually saw the Colorado Rockies, 
too. During Game 2 of the 2007 World Series, Red Sox bench coach Brad Mills, 
armed with information assembled by the Sox scouting report, correctly 
anticipated that Matt Holliday would attempt to steal on Jonathan Papelbon's 
first pitch with two outs in the eighth inning and the Rockies down by 
a run. Mills signaled for a pickoff, and Papelbon, who had not picked off 
a runner since breaking into the majors, nailed Holliday with ease. Boston 
won the game and completed a four-game sweep of the Rockies in the Series.[4] 
When Gary Tuck resigned as the Red Sox' MLB bullpen coach prior to the 
2013 season, LeVangie was named his successor and earned a third World 
Series ring when Boston won the 2013 World Series. He served as interim 
bench coach of the Red Sox from August 16, 2015, through the end of that 
season, part of a chain reaction of temporary coaching reassignments caused 
by manager John Farrell's medical leave of absence for the successful treatment 
of lymphoma. Entering spring training in 2016, LeVangie had resumed his 
former role as the Red Sox' bullpen coach and catching instructor. He gained
