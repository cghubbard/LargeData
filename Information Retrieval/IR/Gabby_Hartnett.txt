As player As manager Charles Leo "Gabby" Hartnett (December 20, 1900 – 
December 20, 1972) was an American professional baseball player and manager.[1] 
He played almost his entire career in Major League Baseball as a catcher 
for the Chicago Cubs from 1922 to 1940. He spent the final season of his 
career as a player-coach for the New York Giants in 1941. After his playing 
career, he continued his involvement in baseball as a coach and as a minor 
league manager. Hartnett was an all-around player, performing well both 
offensively and defensively.[2] Known for his strong and accurate throwing 
arm, he routinely led the National League's catchers in caught stealing 
percentage and was the first major league catcher to hit more than 20 home 
runs in a season.[2] During the course of his career, he took part of some 
of the most memorable events in Major League Baseball history including; 
Babe Ruth's Called Shot during the 1932 World Series, Carl Hubbell's strike-out 
performance in the 1934 All-Star Game and Dizzy Dean's career-altering 
injury during the 1937 All-Star Game.[3] But the greatest moment of Hartnett's 
career came with one week left in the 1938 season, when he hit a game-winning 
home run in the bottom of the ninth inning to put the Cubs in first place. 
The event, which occurred as darkness descended onto Wrigley Field, became 
immortalized as the Homer in the Gloamin'. Prior to Johnny Bench, Hartnett 
was considered the greatest catcher in the history of the National League.[4][5] 
A six-time All-Star, he appeared in four World Series during his playing 
career. At the time of his retirement, Hartnett held the career records 
for catchers in home runs, runs batted in, hits, doubles and in most games 
played as a catcher. Hartnett was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame 
in 1955.[6] Hartnett was born in Woonsocket, Rhode Island as the oldest 
of 14 children.[4] He began his professional baseball career at the age 
of 20 with the Worcester Boosters of the Eastern League in 1921.[7] New 
York Giants manager John McGraw sent scout Jesse Burkett to appraise Hartnett's 
talent as a player.[8] Burkett reported back to McGraw that Hartnett's 
hands were too small for a major league catcher.[8] The Giants' loss would 
prove to be the Chicago Cubs' gain. Hartnett joined the Cubs in 1922, serving 
as a backup catcher to Bob O'Farrell.[1] He was given his ironic nickname 
of "Gabby" as a rookie due to his shy, reticient nature.[9] On July 22, 
O'Farrell suffered a fractured skull during a game against the Boston Braves 
and Hartnett took over as the Cubs starting catcher, posting a .299 batting 
average along with 16 home runs and 67 runs batted in.[1][10] After the 
retirement of catcher Bill Killefer, Hartnett became the favorite catcher 
of Baseball Hall of Fame pitcher Grover Cleveland Alexander and caught 
Alexander's 300th career win on September 20, 1924.[11] Hartnett played 
well enough during O'Farrell's absence that the Cubs decided to keep him 
as their starting catcher, trading O'Farrell to the St. Louis Cardinals 
in May 1925.[12][13] Hartnett hit 24 home runs in 1925, breaking the single-season 
home run record for catchers set by Jack Clements in 1893.[14] He finished 
second overall in the National League behind the 39 home runs hit by Rogers 
Hornsby.[15] Although he led National League catchers in errors, he also 
led in range factor and in putouts, while his strong throwing arm helped 
him lead the league in assists and caught stealing percentage.[16] Leo 
Durocher, who played against Hartnett and was a National League manager 
during Johnny Bench's career, stated that the two catchers had similarly 
strong throwing arms.[17] During the major league baseball winter meetings 
in December 1925, it was rumored that Hartnett might be traded to the New 
York Giants for catcher Frank Snyder and outfielder Irish Meusel; however, 
Cubs president Bill Veeck, Sr., squelched the rumors saying that Hartnett 
would not be traded for anybody.[18] The young catcher had a disappointing 
year in 1926 as his batting average dropped to .275 with only 41 runs batted 
in. His offensive statistics rebounded in 1927, producing a .294 batting 
average with 10 home runs and 80 runs batted in. Although he led the league's 
catchers in putouts, assists and in baserunners caught stealing, his inexperience 
showed as he also led the league in errors and in passed balls. He finished 
tenth in the balloting for the 1927 National League Most Valuable Player 
Award.[19] In 1928, Hartnett would hit above .300 for the first time, posting 
a .302 batting average with 14 home runs.[1] He also surpassed Jack Clements' 
major league record of 72 career home runs by a catcher.[14] Hartnett also 
led National League catchers in assists, caught stealing percentage and 
in fielding percentage.[20] As he matured as a player, he became more disciplined 
on the field and committed fewer errors.[2] He threw the baseball around 
the infield in a fearless manner, throwing out baserunners with a high 
degree of accuracy. Between 1928 and 1938, Hartnett would lead the league's 
catchers in fielding percentage seven times.[2] In 1929, a mysterious arm 
ailment limited him to one game behind the plate and 24 games as a pinch 
hitter as the Cubs won the National League pennant.[21] Hartnett struck 
out in all three of his at bats in the 1929 World Series against the Philadelphia 
Athletics.[9][22] He rebounded with his best season in 1930, hitting for 
a .339 batting average with career highs of 122 runs batted in, a .630 
slugging percentage and 37 home runs, breaking his own single-season home 
run record for catchers.[1][14] He led all National League catchers in 
putouts, assists, fielding percentage and in baserunners caught stealing.[23] 
His single-season home run record for catchers would stand for 23 years, 
until Roy Campanella hit 40 home runs in 1953.[24] During an exhibition 
game against the Chicago White Sox on September 9, 1931, Hartnett was photographed 
while signing an autograph for gangster Al Capone.[25] After the photograph 
was published in newspapers across the United States, Hartnett received 
a telegram from Baseball Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis instructing 
him not to have his photograph taken with Capone in the future.[25] Hartnett 
replied with a telegram to the Commissioner whimsically stating, "OK, but 
if you don't want me to have my picture taken with Al Capone, you tell 
him."[25] In 1932, Hartnett guided the Cubs' pitching staff to the lowest 
team earned run average in the league, as the Cubs clinched the National 
League pennant by 4 games over the Pittsburgh Pirates.[26] Hartnett was 
the Cubs' catcher on October 1, in Game 3 of the 1932 World Series against 
the New York Yankees when Babe Ruth hit his debated "called shot."[17] 
Although he hit for a .313 batting average with 1 home run, the Yankees 
went on to win the series in a four-game sweep.[27] In 1933, Hartnett was 
selected to be a reserve catcher for the National League team in the inaugural 
Major League Baseball All-Star Game held on July 6, 1933.[28] It would 
mark the first of six consecutive All-Star game selections for Hartnett.[1] 
At the mid-season point of the 1934 season, Hartnett was hitting for a 
.336 batting average with 13 home runs to earn the starting catcher's role 
for the National League team in the 1934 All-Star Game.[29][30] Hartnett 
was calling the pitches for Carl Hubbell in the 1934 All-Star Game when 
the Giants pitcher set a record by striking out future Hall of Fame members 
Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Jimmie Foxx, Al Simmons, and Joe Cronin in succession.[17] 
He ended the 1934 season with another strong offensive performance, hitting 
for a .299 batting average with 22 home runs and 90 runs batted in.[1] 
He dominated the defensive statistics, leading the league's catchers in 
assists, putouts, baserunners caught stealing, caught stealing percentage, 
range factor and in fielding percentage.[31] Hartnett had another impressive 
season in 1935 when he produced a .344 batting average, third-highest in 
the league and led the league's catchers in assists, double plays, and 
fielding percentage.[1][32] He also led the Cubs pitching staff to the 
lowest earned run average in the league as they won the National League 
pennant by 4 games over the St. Louis Cardinals.[33] For his performance, 
Hartnett was named the recipient of the 1935 National League Most Valuable 
Player Award.[34] The Cubs would eventually lose to the Detroit Tigers 
led by Mickey Cochrane in the 1935 World Series.[35] The Cubs fell to third 
place in 1936, as Hartnett had a sub-standard year for him, hitting only 
7 home runs with 64 runs batted in, although he still hit above .300 with 
a .307 average, and earned his fourth consecutive All-Star selection.[9][36] 
Defensively, he led the league's catchers in fielding percentage, and his 
pitch-calling skills helped the Cubs pitching staff lead the league with 
18 shutouts.[37] In the 1937 All-Star Game, pitcher Dizzy Dean kept shaking 
off Hartnett's signs for a curve ball resulting in a hit by Joe DiMaggio, 
a home run by Lou Gehrig and finally, a line drive off the bat of Earl 
Averill that struck Dean on his toe.[38] Dean had been one of the preeminent 
pitchers in the National League until the injury to his toe eventually 
led to the end of his baseball playing career.[17] Hartnett ended the 1937 
season with a career-high .354 batting average and finished second to Joe 
Medwick in voting for the National League Most Valuable Player Award.[1][39] 
His .354 batting average in 1937 was the highest batting average by a major 
league catcher for 60 years until 1997, when Mike Piazza posted a .362 
average.[40][41] On July 20, 1938, Cubs owner Philip K. Wrigley named the 
37-year-old Hartnett as the team's player-manager, replacing Charlie Grimm.[42] 
When Hartnett took over as manager, the Cubs had been in third place, six 
games behind the first place Pittsburgh Pirates led by Pie Traynor.[43] 
By September 27, with one week left in the season, the Cubs had battled 
back to within a game and a half game of the Pirates in the National League 
standings as the two teams met for a crucial three-game series.[43] The 
Cubs won the first game of the series with a 2 to 1 victory by Cubs pitcher 
Dizzy Dean, cutting the Pirates' lead to a half game and setting the stage 
for one of baseball's most memorable moments.[44] On September 28, 1938, 
the two teams met for the second game of the series, where Hartnett experienced 
the highlight of his career. With darkness descending on the lightless 
Wrigley Field and the score tied at 5 runs apiece, the umpires ruled that 
the ninth inning would be the last to be played. The entire game would 
have to be replayed the following day if the score remained tied. Hartnett 
came to bat with two out in the bottom of the ninth inning. With a count 
of 0 balls and 2 strikes, Hartnett connected on a Mace Brown pitch, launching 
the ball into the darkness, before it eventually landed in the left-center 
field bleachers. The stadium erupted into pandemonium as players and fans 
stormed the field to escort Hartnett around the bases.[45] Hartnett's walk-off 
home run became immortalized as the Homer in the Gloamin'.[44] The Cubs 
were now in first place, culminating an impressive 19-3-1 record in September, 
and the pennant would be clinched three days later.[43] Hartnett once again 
led the Cubs pitching staff to the lowest earned run average in the league 
and led National League catchers with a .995 fielding percentage.[46][47] 
However, the Cubs were swept in the 1938 World Series by the New York Yankees, 
their fourth Series loss in ten years.[48] Hartnett felt the strain of 
managing a team during the 1939 season as he faced player discontent over 
the pampering of Dizzy Dean while pitcher Larry French went over his head 
to complain to owner Philip Wrigley about his lack of pitching assignments.[49] 
French felt he was being punished for requesting to have Gus Mancuso as 
his catcher.[49] In addition, Hartnett was forced to catch more games due 
to the lack of hitting from the other Cubs catchers.[49] On August 28, 
1939, he broke Ray Schalk's Major League record of 1,727 career games as 
a catcher.[50] His record for longevity was surpassed by Al López during 
the 1945 season.[51] After two disappointing seasons, Hartnett was dismissed 
by the Cubs on November 13, 1940, after 19 years with the club.[52] On 
December 3, he signed a contract with the New York Giants to be a player-coach.[53] 
Hartnett hit for a .300 average in 64 games as a backup catcher to Harry 
Danning in the 1941 season.[1] He played his final game on September 24, 
1941, retiring as a player at the age of 40.[1] In a 20-year major league 
career, Hartnett played in 1,990 games, accumulating 1,912 hits in 6,432 
at bats for a .297 career batting average along with a .489 slugging percentage, 
236 home runs, 1,179 runs batted in and an on-base percentage of .370.[1] 
He retired with a .984 career fielding percentage.[1] Hartnett caught 100 
or more games for a league record 12 times, including a record eight seasons 
in a row.[54] He led the National League in putouts four times and in assists 
and fielding percentage six times.[1] He led the league seven times in 
double plays and set a National league record with 163 career double plays.[55] 
Hartnett set a since-broken major league record for catchers of 452 consecutive 
chances without committing an error.[56] At the time of his retirement, 
Hartnett's 236 home runs, 1,179 runs batted in, 1,912 hits, and 396 doubles 
were all records for catchers.[14] Bill Dickey surpassed his records for 
most runs batted in and hits in 1943, while his career home run record 
for catchers was broken by Yogi Berra in 1956.[14] His career mark for 
doubles stood until 1983 when it was broken by Ted Simmons.[57] Hartnett 
also finished among the National League's top ten in slugging percentage 
seven times in his career.[1] A six-time All-Star, he was the recipient 
of one Most Valuable Player Award and played on four pennant-winning teams.[1] 
Hartnett's .370 career on-base percentage was higher than the .342 posted 
by Johnny Bench and the .348 posted by Yogi Berra.[58][59] His 56.11% career 
caught stealing percentage ranks second only to Roy Campanella among major 
league catchers.[60] Hartnett's bat and catcher's mask were the first artifacts 
sent to the newly constructed Baseball Hall of Fame in 1938.[21] In his 
book, The Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract, baseball historian Bill 
James ranked Hartnett 9th all-time among major league catchers.[61] Afterwards, 
he managed in the minor leagues for five seasons, retiring to Lincolnwood, 
Illinois in 1946.[62] On January 26, 1955, Hartnett was elected to the 
Baseball Hall of Fame along with Joe DiMaggio, Ted Lyons and Dazzy Vance.[63] 
In 1981, Lawrence Ritter and Donald Honig included Hartnett in their book 
The 100 Greatest Baseball Players of All Time. In 1999, he was named as 
a finalist to the Major League Baseball All-Century Team.[64] In his last 
job in the majors Hartnett worked as a coach and scout for the Kansas City 
Athletics for two years in the mid-1960s. Hartnett died of cirrhosis in 
Park Ridge, Illinois on his 72nd birthday in 1972, and is interred in All
