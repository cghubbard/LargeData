Billy Leo Williams (born June 15, 1938) is a retired American Major League 
Baseball (MLB) left fielder who played sixteen seasons for the Chicago 
Cubs and two seasons for the Oakland Athletics. Williams was inducted into 
the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1987.[1] In 1999, he was named a 
finalist for the Major League Baseball All-Century Team. Williams was one 
of the best Cubs players. He was the 1961 NL Rookie of the Year and was 
a National League (NL) and Cubs All-Star for six seasons. In 1970, he had 
a .322 batting average with 42 home runs and 129 runs batted in (RBI), 
led the NL with 205 hits, and was the NL Most Valuable Player runner-up. 
In 1972, he won the NL batting title hitting .333. Williams hit over 400 
home runs in his career including 30 or more for five seasons. He also 
hit over .300 for five seasons and had over 100 RBI for ten seasons. Williams 
was a highly competitive player on Chicago Cubs teams that never reached 
the post-season. When he finally played in the post-season during the next 
to final year of his career with the Oakland Athletics, the "A's" did not 
play in the World Series. In 1999, he was selected as a member of the Cubs 
All-Century Team. Williams was born in Whistler, Alabama. His father Frank 
was a stevedore who had also played first base for the semipro Whistler 
Stars.[2] Williams grew up in a segregated neighborhood.[3] He attended 
Whistler High School.[4] Entering professional baseball in 1956, Williams 
started his minor league career with the Ponca City Cubs of the Sooner 
State League. After returning to Ponca City in 1957 and hitting 17 home 
runs, Williams split 1958 between the Burlington Bees and Pueblo Bruins.[5] 
In his autobiography, Williams recalled that had never experienced overt 
racial discrimination until his 1959 promotion to the Class AA San Antonio 
Missions in San Antonio, Texas. He was so discouraged that he left the 
team and went home. Buck O'Neil, the Cubs scout who had originally discovered 
Williams, was dispatched to Whistler and he persuaded Williams to return 
to the team.[6] During the 1959 season, he advanced to the Class AAA Fort 
Worth Cats and even played 18 games for the Cubs.[4][5] In 1960, he hit 
26 home runs for the Class AAA Houston Buffs and played in 12 major league 
games.[4][5] Williams joined a Chicago Cubs team that would feature stars 
such as Ernie Banks, Ferguson Jenkins, and Ron Santo by the early 1960s. 
Rogers Hornsby (seven NL batting titles), who by 1960 was serving as a 
scout and coach in the Cubs organization, predicted Williams would someday 
win a batting title. Williams debuted with the Cubs late in the 1959 season, 
and played in a total of 30 games in both the 1959 and 1960 seasons. In 
1961, he played in 146 games and was selected as the NL Rookie of the Year. 
That year he hit 25 home runs and drove in 86 runs. In 1962, 1964 and 1965, 
he was named was a NL All-Star.[4] He won the NL Player of the Month Award 
in May 1964 with a .455 average, 8 HR, and 22 RBI. Williams struggled defensively 
in the first few years of his career, leading NL outfielders in errors 
as a rookie. By the mid-1960s, his defense was no longer seen as a serious 
weakness.[2] He would return to the All-Star Game in 1968, 1972, and 1973.[4] 
From 1961 to 1973, Williams annually hit at least twenty home runs and 
was responsible for eighty-four or more RBIs. His batting swing was smooth 
and efficient, with quick wrist action that allowed him to hit for both 
average and power despite his slender frame. Early in his career, this 
earned him the nickname "Sweet-Swinging Billy Williams", sometimes shortened 
to "Sweet Williams" or "Sweet Billy" (perhaps suggested by the flowers 
known as sweet williams). His nickname was later referenced in the subtitle 
of his autobiography. He was also nicknamed "Sweet-Swinging Billy from 
Whistler", suggesting his birthplace in Alabama. His home run feats included 
hitting 20 or more home runs for 11 straight seasons, hammering three homers 
in one game and five in two consecutive games. Twice in one season, Williams 
belted four extra-base hits in a game. In 1970, Williams batted .322 with 
42 homers and 129 RBIs and finished second in National League Most Valuable 
Player voting; surprisingly, despite batting .319 with 26 HR and 80 RBI 
at the All Star break, he was left off the All Star team. Williams set 
a National League record for consecutive games played with 1,117 in 1962–71 
(eclipsed by Steve Garvey in 1975–83 with 1,207). As his consecutive games 
streak began to accumulate, he was dubbed "Iron Man" by some writers.[7] 
He co-authored a 1970 book called Iron Man.[4] In 1972, he was the National 
League batting champion and named the major league Player of the Year by 
The Sporting News.[8] He paced the league in batting average with a .333 
mark, also posting a .606 slugging percentage while collecting 37 home 
runs and 122 runs batted in (RBI). He finished second for the second time 
in the MVP selection, behind Johnny Bench (he would never win the award, 
or finish above 29th again). He won his second and final NL Player of the 
Month Award in August (.438, 9 HR, 29 RBI) Williams was traded to the American 
League's Oakland Athletics after the 1974 season for second baseman Manny 
Trillo and two pitchers.[9] He helped lead Oakland get to the 1975 American 
League West championship as a designated hitter, hitting 23 homers with 
81 RBI. In 1976, Williams played in only 120 games and hit only .211.[4] 
He retired that year. Williams accumulated a lifetime .290 batting average 
with 426 home runs and 1475 RBI. Williams credited a grade school teacher 
with encouraging him to always try to improve, citing the old saying, "Good, 
better, best / Never let it rest / Until the good is better / And the better 
is best."[10] Williams was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1987. 
On August 13, 1987, Williams' uniform number 26 was retired at Wrigley 
Field. His was the second number to be retired by the Cubs, the first being 
Ernie Banks' number 14. Following his departure from the Cubs, the number 
was reassigned to other players from time to time, most notably Larry Biittner, 
although Williams reclaimed it during several intervals of coaching with 
the Cubs after his playing days had ended. In 1999, he was selected to 
the Cubs All-Century Team and was named as one of the one hundred finalists 
to the Major League Baseball All-Century Team. During the 2010 season, 
the Cubs honored Williams with a statue outside of Wrigley Field in Chicago. 
The statue was unveiled in a pre-game ceremony before their home game on 
September 7 against the Houston Astros.[11] In 2011, Williams was appointed 
as a member of the National Baseball Hall of Fame's 16-member Golden Era 
Committee (replaced the Veterans Committee) which considers ten Golden 
Era candidates every three years for the Hall of Fame. The ten candidates 
from the 1947 to 1972 era are first identified by the Baseball Writers' 
Association of America (BBWAA) appointed Historical Overview Committee 
(10-12 BBWAA members) every three years. Former Cubs third baseman Ron 
Santo was the only Golden Era candidate elected to the Hall of Fame by 
"The Committee" (includes 8 members of the Hall of Fame) during their winter
