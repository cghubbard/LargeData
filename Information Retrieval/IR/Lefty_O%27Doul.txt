Francis Joseph "Lefty" O'Doul (March 4, 1897 – December 7, 1969) was an 
American Major League Baseball player who went on to become an extraordinarily 
successful manager in the minor leagues, and also a vital figure in the 
establishment of professional baseball in Japan. Born in San Francisco, 
California, O'Doul began his professional career as a left-handed pitcher 
with the minor-league San Francisco Seals of the Triple-A Pacific Coast 
League. He had some major-league success with the New York Yankees and 
Boston Red Sox from 1919 to 1923 as a reliever.[1] He pitched in one notable 
game on July 7, 1923 that would go down in the record books. Relieving 
for starter Curt Fullerton, O'Doul gave up 16 runs over 3 innings of relief, 
with 14 of those runs coming in the 6th inning alone. Although errors committed 
by Red Sox fielders meant that only 3 of the 16 runs were earned, O'Doul 
set the major league record for most runs allowed by a reliever in one 
appearance,[2] a record later equaled by St Louis Cardinals pitcher Johnny 
Stuart in 1925 and Philadelphia Phillies pitcher Dutch Schesler in 1931 
(although both needed 8 innings to allow 16 runs).[3] Following the season, 
O'Doul developed a sore arm, which forced him to give up pitching. After 
the 1923 season, the New York Giants returned O'Doul to the Pacific Coast 
League, where he was converted to a power-hitting outfielder. In 1927 he 
became one of what are today four Pacific Coast League hitters to have 
had a 30 home runs, 30 stolen bases season, along with Joc Pederson (2014), 
Frank Demaree (1934), and Hall of Famer Tony Lazzeri (1925).[4] O'Doul 
returned to the majors in 1928, where he batted .319 as a platoon player. 
In 1929, he was traded to the Philadelphia Phillies and, teaming up with 
Chuck Klein, had one of the best offensive years in baseball history, leading 
the league in batting at .398 with 254 hits, 32 home runs, 122 runs batted 
in, and 152 runs scored. His hit total broke the previous National League 
record of 250 by Rogers Hornsby of the 1922 St. Louis Cardinals. The record 
was tied by Bill Terry in 1930, but was not broken until 2004 by Ichiro 
Suzuki. After batting .383 with 22 homers during the 1930 season, O'Doul 
was traded to the Brooklyn Robins (now the Los Angeles Dodgers). In 1932, 
he batted .368 for Brooklyn to win another league batting title. After 
a slow start in 1933, when he batted just .252 through 43 games, O'Doul 
was again traded, this time back to the Giants. He rallied to hit .306 
the rest of the way that season, but played just one more year before ending 
his career in 1934. O'Doul then returned to the Pacific Coast League as 
manager of the San Francisco Seals from 1935 to 1951, later managing several 
other teams in the circuit and becoming the most successful manager in 
PCL history. One of his outstanding accomplishments while managing the 
Seals was developing the young Joe DiMaggio, who went on to a Hall of Fame 
career with the New York Yankees. O'Doul refused to take credit for DiMaggio's 
success, saying "I was just smart enough to leave him alone."[5] O'Doul 
was instrumental in spreading baseball's popularity in Japan, serving as 
the sport's goodwill ambassador before and after World War II. The Tokyo 
Giants, sometimes considered "Japan's Baseball Team", were named by him 
in 1935 in honor of his longtime association with the New York Giants; 
the logo and uniform of the Giants in Japan strongly resemble their North 
American counterparts. O'Doul was inducted into the San Francisco Bay Area 
Sports Hall of Fame in 1981 and the Japanese Baseball Hall of Fame in 2002. 
He has the highest career batting average of any player eligible for the 
National Baseball Hall of Fame who is not enshrined. His relatively short 
career as a full-time batter and the fact that his statistics were accumulated 
during a period of historically high offensive production in the major 
leagues are factors mitigating against his selection to the Hall of Fame. 
O'Doul's fame and popularity live on in his hometown of San Francisco and 
are enhanced by the fact that his former team now thrives as the San Francisco 
Giants. The popular restaurant and bar he founded still operates as Lefty 
O'Doul's Restaurant and Cocktail Lounge on Geary Boulevard and still serves 
his original recipe for Bloody Mary[6] (although one news account says 
it was modified in the 1960s by O'Doul's bartender Chuck Davis).[7] A bridge 
over McCovey Cove, near the Giants' home field of AT&T Park, is named the 
Lefty O'Doul Bridge in his honor.[6] Accordingly, the ballpark plaza and
