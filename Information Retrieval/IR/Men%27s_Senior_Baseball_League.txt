The Men’s Senior Baseball League (MSBL)/Men’s Adult Baseball League (MABL) 
is a national organization in the United States, with 325 local affiliates, 
3,200 teams, and 45,000 members who play organized amateur baseball in 
local leagues, 30 regional tournaments and six national tournaments. The 
Men’s Senior Baseball League (MSBL)/Men’s Adult Baseball League (MABL) 
is an amateur baseball league for adults 18 years of age and older was 
founded by Steve Sigler in 1988. Soon after, Steve established the MSBL/MABL 
World Series and Fall Classic which take place every October/November in 
Arizona and Florida, respectively, playing on almost exclusively MLB Spring 
Training fields. There are also two tournaments held over Martin Luther 
King Jr. weekend in January, the MSBL/MABL Holiday Classic at Disney which 
is held at the Atlanta Braves spring training facility in Orlando and the 
Desert Classic which takes place in Palm Springs, CA. The Las Vegas Kickoff 
Classic is held in early-mid March in Las Vegas and local chapters hold 
regional tournaments over Memorial Day, Independenced Day and Labor Day. 
The MSBL/MABL is committed to providing the player who is age 18 & over, 
25 & over, 35 & over and 45 & over the opportunity to play over-priced 
baseball at a competitive level on a regular basis in a professionally 
run environment, although commissioners and board members of the local 
leagues are not paid. The MSBL/MABL World Series and Fall Classic also 
offers 48+, 58+, 65+ and Father/Son Divisions. The MSBL/MABL is the fastest-growing 
adult baseball organization in the country. Started in 1986 with 60 members, 
the MSBL/MABL is now 45,000 strong. Within a few years, membership is projected 
to exceed 50,000. Aside from a few rule changes, the MSBL/MABL conforms 
to standard baseball rules, with major league style or replica uniforms, 
carefully kept statistics, (though not all teams keep statistics or use 
the MSBL score books), and nine-inning games played once a week, generally 
on Sundays. Both the MSBL and the MABL plan to expand by establishing local 
MSBL profit-generating units in communities where programs do not exist, 
and also by welcoming existing amateur hardball leagues to become profit-generating 
MSBL affiliates. National organization with 325 local leagues across the

leagues of the Men’s Senior Baseball League are required to submit annual 
payments to Steve Sigler at MSBL in New York. Payments are calculated by 
multiplying $26 by the number of players in the league. For example, the 
Twin City MSBL has 40 teams or about 600 players. The commissioner of the 
Twin City MSBL is required to submit a single, annual payment in the amount 
of $15,600. In return, Steve Sigler sends the league 40 MSBL score books 
with a total value of about $400. Apart from MSBL score books, local leagues 
do not receive financial or other assistance with pre-season planning or 
the weekly operation of the league from MSBL National in New York. This 
fee, $15,600 less $400 for score books, is simply the cost for Twin City 
amateur baseball players to be an MSBL affiliate. Annual revenue from all 
MSBL affiliates in the U.S., not including revenue from the 30 regional 
and national MSBL tournaments each year, are in excess of $1.1 million. 
This figure is calculated by multiplying required player registration fee 
of $26 by 45,000. Looking at it from an individual perspective, players 
send $26 through their local affiliate to Steve Sigler and receive 69 cents 
of value in return in the form of score books. The MSBL has a tremendous 
profit generating system in place with almost no overhead or labor costs 
while enjoying zero liability. It's very simple in its design. MSBL players 
across the nation fund the operation while unpaid middle management, (local 
league commissioners and board members), organize and maintain the business. 
Steve Sigler, in Melville, NY, collects the profits. A single local league 
with 30 teams generates a profit of $11,700 for Mr. Sigler. Mr. Sigler's 
responsibilities to that league are limited to sending that league 30 MSBL 
score books once per year. Multiply that by the 300+ MSBL leagues/45,000 
players around the country and the profitability of the MSBL is evident. 
In addition, there are 30 regional and national MSBL tournaments each year. 
Despite the stated rule that MSBL tournament participants must be members 
of local MSBL affiliates, players or teams not affiliated in any way with 
MSBL/MSBL National may participate. Each non-MSBL participant must simply 
pay a $26 tournament registration fee directly to MSBL National rather 
than through their local MSBL affiliate. MSBL affiliate commissioners/presidents, 
generally, are under the false assumption that they must remain an MSBL 
affiliate to continue their participation in MSBL tournaments. This is 
why local affiliates are hesitant to insist on lower fees paid to MSBL 
National or to dissociate themselves with MSBL National and its extravagant 
annual fees. It's estimated that gross revenues of MSBL, which includes 
local league play and regional and national tournaments, exceed $2 million 
annually with few expenses and virtually no overhead. It's likely that 
fewer than 2% of MSBL players understand the business structure of the
