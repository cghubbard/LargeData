John W. Abadie (November 4, 1854 â€“ May 17, 1905) was an American professional 
baseball first baseman who played in Major League Baseball during the 1875 
season. He was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Previously to playing 
in the majors, Abadie saw action at first base for a semi-professional 
team in Easton, Pennsylvania, which was the hardest team to beat in exhibition 
games. As a result, this team defeated the Philadelphia Athletics, Philadelphia 
Whites and Brooklyn Atlantics charter teams of the National Association 
in 1874. Then, when the National Association expanded in 1875, Abadie and 
seven of his teammates were drafted because of the Easton team's success.[1] 
Abadie played 12 games with the Philadelphia Centennials and Brooklyn Atlantics 
during the 1875 season, compiling a batting average of .224 (11 for 49) 
with four runs scored and five RBI. Additionally, Abadie became the only 
player to have a unique triple slash line (.224/.224/.224) in a Major League 
career.[2] After the 1875 season, the National Association lost five of 
its teams and was forced to fold. Abadie returned to playing for independent 
teams in the Minor Leagues and never appeared in a major league game again.
