Carlos Ernesto Martínez (born September 21, 1991) is a Dominican professional 
baseball pitcher for the St. Louis Cardinals of Major League Baseball (MLB). 
Originally signed by the Boston Red Sox as an international free agent 
in 2009, MLB voided his contract due to discrepancies over his name and 
date of birth after revelations that he was also known as Carlos Matias. 
However, he was eventually cleared of wrongdoing, as it was found that 
the inconsistencies arose due to poor record-keeping.[1] The St. Louis 
Cardinals signed him in 2010, and he made his MLB debut May 3, 2013. Martínez 
became a consensus top-100 prospect in all of Minor League Baseball, and 
one of the Cardinals' highest-rated prospects. A starter in the minor leagues, 
he performed mainly in relief roles in his first two seasons in the major 
leagues, but earned a spot in the Cardinals' rotation in 2015. During the 
2013 MLB season, fans gave him the nickname "Little Pedro," due to the 
similarities in physique and pitching mechanics to former Cy Young Award 
winner Pedro Martínez. Carlos Martínez was born in Puerto Plata, Dominican 
Republic, in a rural zone called Colinas del Sur, where official record-keeping 
is sometimes poor. Following the death of his mother when he was quite 
young, Martínez was adopted by an uncle with the last name Matias.[2] The 
young Martínez originally had plans to become a priest but changed his 
mind soon after starting to catch the attention of major league scouts.[3] 
Raised with his uncle's last name, some confusion eventually ensued when 
he attempted to secure a work visa to pitch in the United States.[4] When 
the Boston Red Sox first discovered Martínez, he was a 17-year-old who 
threw about 90 miles per hour (140 km/h), topping out at 92 miles per hour 
(148 km/h), with a loose delivery and athletic frame and also sported a 
quality breaking pitch and changeup. Projections were made that his body 
would fill out, and thus, increase the velocity and movement of his pitches, 
including a fastball up to 95 miles per hour (153 km/h). The team considered 
him comparable to first-round talent available in the Major League Baseball 
draft. Thus, the Red Sox moved to sign him while he was still relatively 
unknown, in part to get him for the lowest price possible.[5] He signed 
for $140,000; however, a routine background check by Major League Baseball 
(MLB) officials raised several questions about the veracity of both his 
name and date of birth. As a result, the Red Sox deal was voided, and, 
in March 2009, MLB suspended Martínez for a period of one year.[4] In spite 
of well-known endemic problems documenting the true identity of prospects 
from the Dominican Republic, Craig Shipley, the Red Sox executive in charge 
of international signing remained adamant that the Red Sox no longer pursue 
Martínez. While the visa issues became more public, other teams scouted 
him and quietly lined up to bid for his services – the pitcher started 
to fulfill the projections the Red Sox had for him, such as throwing a 
fastball about 95 MPH and a power curveball. In time, Martínez' name and 
date of birth discrepancies were not considered to be significant issues.[5] 
Once the MLB suspension expired, Martínez signed with the St. Louis Cardinals 
as an international free agent in 2010 and received a reported $1.5 million 
signing bonus.[2] While sorting out other lingering visa issues, he pitched 
in the Dominican Summer League (DSL), where he started 12 games and completed 
59 innings pitched (IP). He topped all Cardinals minor leaguers with a 
0.76 earned run average (ERA), a .144 batting average against (BAA) and 
0.71 walks plus hits per inning pitched (WHIP) and ranked second with 11.9 
strikeouts per nine innings pitched (K/9), third with a 5.57 strikeout-to-walk 
ratio (K/BB) and the fourth toughest to hit a home run against (HR/9, 0.228). 
He led the DSL in ERA, BAA, K/9 and WHIP (tied for first).[6] After impressing 
Cardinal team officials at a minor league mini-camp in February, 2011, 
he bypassed some of the lower level assignments typical to rookies and 
was assigned to the Quad Cities River Bandits of the Class A Midwest League 
in 2011. He split the season between Quad Cities and the Palm Beach Cardinals, 
posting a combined won–loss record (W–L) of 6–5 over 18 games and 84 2⁄3 
IP.[7] He also participated in the 2011 All-Star Futures Game.[8] Returning 
to Palm Beach to commence the 2012 season, shoulder tendonitis began to 
bother him after just seven starts and the Cardinals placed him on the 
disabled list (DL).[9] Despite being on the DL he was advanced to Double-A 
ball in late May with the Springfield Cardinals of the Texas League.[9] 
After returning from the shoulder problems, Martínez posted a 4–3 W–L record 
over 71 IP. He registered 58 SO and ended the season with a 2.90 ERA.[7] 
Work visa issues again became a problem prior to 2013 spring training. 
Unable to secure the proper documents due to lingering confusion as a result 
of his name change when originally signing with the Cardinals, Martínez 
sat out nearly all of the 2013 Cardinals major league spring training.[10] 
Cleared in late March, Martínez reported to Cardinals minor league spring 
training more than six weeks behind schedule, in time only for the last 
few days of camp and requiring an extended spring in Jupiter, Florida.[11] 
While awaiting the visa in the Dominican Republic, Martínez built up his 
readiness in a throwing program.[11] After the extended spring, he was 
reassigned with the Springfield Cardinals. He made just three starts there 
before the Cardinals called him up. Martínez sported a 2.31 ERA in 11 2⁄3 
innings with nine strikeouts.[12] The Cardinals called up Martínez to the 
Major League club, the number-three prospect in their organization, on 
May 3, 2013. He made his major league debut against the Milwaukee Brewers 
at Miller Park that night. In one inning pitched, the seventh, he gave 
up a single, then induced a double play he started on a ground ball hit 
back to him, and then secured the third out with another ground ball.[13][14][15] 
On May 27, the Cardinals sent Martínez down to Triple-A Memphis after seven 
appearances on the mound and eight innings in which he posted a 4.50 ERA 
with nine strikeouts.[16] With the Redbirds in 2013, he made 13 starts. 
In 68 IP, he allowed a 2.51 ERA with 54 hits, three home runs (HR), 27 
bases on balls (BB), while striking out 63.[7] The Cardinals recalled Martínez 
on August 8 after stretching out his innings workload with Memphis to bring 
his endurance back to being sufficient to handle the rigors of starting 
pitching. The next night, Martínez made his first major league start against 
the Los Angeles Dodgers, pitching five innings and giving up four earned 
runs. He earned the distinction of being the first Cardinals starter in 
recent memory to throw over 100 miles per hour (160 km/h) and regularly 
threw 96–98 miles per hour (154–158 km/h).[17] On September 20, 2013, Martínez 
entered a game in the tenth against the Brewers in which the Cardinals 
led 7–6 and closed the game in a 1–2–3 inning. His inning helped make the 
Cardinals victorious and gave him his first major league save.[18] In the 
2013 regular season with the Cardinals, Martínez posted a 5.08 ERA in 28 
1⁄3 innings, striking out 24. He made one start, earned one save, winning 
two games while losing one.[19] The Cardinals played him in the 2013 National 
League Division Series (NLDS) against the Pittsburgh Pirates, where he 
made three total appearances, giving up two runs in two IP. Against the 
Dodgers in the National League Championship Series (NLCS), he appeared 
in four games, giving up no runs while allowing just one hit, one walk, 
and striking out four in 4 2⁄3 IP. In the World Series against the Red 
Sox, he appeared in five games, pitched six innings, giving up five hits, 
three runs and one walk while striking out five. The Red Sox defeated the 
Cardinals 4–2 in that World Series.[19] Between the three series, he appeared 
in 12 games, posted a 3.55 ERA, held opponents to a .167 BAA, and allowed 
three walks with 11 SO in 12 2⁄3 IP.[20] With the fifth starting spot in 
the rotation open in spring training for the 2014 campaign, Martínez started 
the season in the bullpen of the Major League Cardinals.[21] Injury struck 
the rotation in June, and he made his first two starts of the year as spot 
starts. He made his third major league start and won his first on June 
22, pitching five innings and yielding three earned runs in a 5–3 victory 
over the Philadelphia Phillies.[22] In a July 3 start against the San Francisco 
Giants, he reached a breakthrough as a starter. In five innings, he allowed 
just one run on five hits, one walk and struck out six. At the plate, he 
collected a two-run batted in double as the Cardinals won 7–2, and Martínez 
collected his second win of the season.[23][24] He finished the 2014 regular 
season with a 4.03 ERA and 2-4 W–L in 57 games including seven starts.[25] 
In December, Martínez changed his uniform number from 44 to 18 to commemorate 
his friend and teammate, Oscar Taveras, who had died in a car accident 
two weeks after the 2014 NLCS.[26] For the first time in his career in 
2015, Martínez made the Cardinals starting rotation, earning the fifth 
starter spot out of spring training.[25] In his first four starts of the 
season, his ERA was 1.89.[27] However, in consecutive starts against the 
Chicago Cubs on May 4[28] and the Pirates on May 9, he allowed 14 runs 
on 16 hits and 11 walks in two starts covering nine innings. His ERA jumped 
to 4.73 after those two starts.[27] In the May 31 contest against the Dodgers, 
the Cardinals paid an official tribute to Taveras, who had debuted in the 
major leagues exactly one year earlier. The starting pitcher for the Cardinals, 
Martínez picked up the win, struck out eight, and extended his scoreless 
inning streak to 20 1⁄3 innings in a 3–1 outcome.[29] It was the longest 
scoreless-inning streak in the National League (NL) for a starting pitcher 
through that point in the season.[30] Martínez' next start, also against 
the Dodgers, came on June 5. Over seven innings, he gave up just one run 
on three hits and struck out 11, a new career high, in a 2–1 victory. The 
scoreless inning streak stopped at 21 2⁄3, also a career-high.[31] Nominated 
as a contender for the All-Star Final Vote on July 6,[32] Martínez won 
the fan vote four days later, securing his first MLB All-Star selection 
for the game at Great American Ball Park in Cincinnati. Through that point 
in the season, he completed 107 1⁄3 innings and notched a 10–3 record with 
a 2.52 ERA.[33] On July 25 against the Atlanta Braves, he pitched his 11th 
consecutive quality start, tying him with Clayton Kershaw of the Los Angeles 
Dodgers for longest current streak, and the longest for the Cardinals since 
Chris Carpenter in 2010.[34] The quality start streak ended on July 30 
in a contest of angry exchanges with the Colorado Rockies. Martínez allowed 
five runs in five innings and hit DJ LeMahieu with a pitch in the fifth 
inning. When the inning ended, Martínez flashed an obscene gesture on full 
public display toward the visitors' dugout with Rockies players and personnel. 
Corresponding aggressive verbal exchanges ensued, including those between 
Cardinals catcher Yadier Molina and Rockies third baseman Nolan Arenado; 
no brawls started. The umpires issued warnings but no ejections followed. 
The Cardinals eventually won in the bottom of the ninth inning, 9–8.[35][36] 
Martinez' season ended early in a start against the Milwaukee Brewers on 
September 25 in which threw only seven pitches. He also missed the postseason 
as the Cardinals had already clinched a playoff berth. The injury was a 
shoulder strain; however, surgery was not deemed necessary and that he 
would recover in time for the 2016 season.[37] His first season in the 
starting rotation included 14–7 record, a 3.01 ERA and 179 2⁄3 IP.[38] 
He finished in the top ten in the NL in ERA, won–loss percentage, SO/9, 
wins, home runs per nine innings allowed, and wild pitches.[19] His 9.2 
SO/9 was the third-highest single-season average in franchise history.[39] 
Martinez was granted permission to leave the team April 30, 2016, to resolve 
a civil suit filed against him in Miami, Florida. The Cardinals are investigating 
the allegations in the case, which may include domestic violence. MLB has 
not contacted the Cardinals at this time, but there is a domestic violence 
policy in place within the league.[40] Martinez started 31 games in the 
2016 season, ending with a 16-9 record, a 3.04 ERA, and 195.1 innings pitched.[41] 
Standing 6' 0" (72 inches (180 cm)) and weighing 185 pounds (84 kg), Carlos 
Martínez has been commonly compared to former Cy Young winner and Hall 
of Famer Pedro Martínez, due to being right-handed, having a similar physique, 
and deceptive and surprisingly fluid pitching mechanics. Further, they 
both are considered power pitchers with undersized builds featuring explosive 
and electric pitching repertoires. For this, Carlos Martínez has been nicknamed 
"Baby Pedro."[42][43][44] In spite of his stereotypic physical limitations, 
certain attributes such as his natural athleticism cover somewhat for the 
lack of height. Further, a loose frame and naturally quick release also 
play up his skills on the mound. Martínez started his professional career 
throwing three pitches, a fastball, curveball, and a changeup.[45] He has 
since added a sinking fastball and slider.[20] The high-velocity, electric 
fastball that originally caught the attention of Red Sox scouts when Martínez 
was 17 has developed into an elite-level pitch beyond initial expectations. 
His fastball has drawn further comparisons with Pedro Martínez.[43] With 
a wiry and athletic frame, Carlos Martinez' arm generates enormous speed 
that dispenses dynamic velocity and movement, reaching up to 100 miles 
per hour (160 km/h), while situated primarily in the range of 94–96 miles 
per hour (151–154 km/h).[45] Martínez maintains fastball fleetness from 
both the windup and stretch. Because his arm speed generates immense recoil, 
he finishes off-balance, leaving him in an awkward position to field certain 
batted balls. His fastball is graded at 70 on a scale of 80, with a volatile 
life that vaults itself on batters, making it difficult for them to square 
their bats, and thus, hit effectively. His small stature and long recoil 
somewhat limit the command, but that is mitigated with the natural explosiveness 
and movement of the pitch.[45] The sinking version of his fastball can 
get up to 96 MPH, while averaging 92–93 miles per hour (148–150 km/h).[46] 
The curveball Martínez throws is one of his breaking balls, grading at 
a 50 on a scale of 60. It features either an 11-to-5 or 12-to-6 break and 
it is very difficult to hit when in top form.[45][20] The main discrepancy 
with this pitch is when he gets around on it and finishes with a "looping" 
effect. His other breaking pitch, the slider, became a fastball alternative 
go-to pitch in 2013. Also a power pitch, it averages 82.5 miles per hour 
(132.8 km/h) with −2.16 inches (−55 mm) of vertical break, and has proven 
to be effective in garnering swing-and-miss strikes.[20] The changeup was 
Martinez' secondary pitch throughout his rise in minor leagues. It averages 
in the mid- to upper-80s MPH and shows some sink at times, and grades at 
40 on a 50 scale.[45][20] However, he also lacked feel and can throw it 
too firmly.[45] It is especially effective, however, because of his ability 
to throw it with nearly identical arm speed to his fastball.[20] With the 
efficaciousness of the fastball and curveball, the changeup is not required 
in a relief role, but gives a versatile option when starting.[45] Overall, 
throwing strikes needs to improve, especially down in the strike zone, 
according to Baseball Prospect Nation. Nonetheless, this could develop 
into a plus skill. He naturally operates high in the strike zone, so working 
down will shift the hitters' eye levels in addition to the confounding 
movement of the fastball and curveball.[45] Whether there have been any 
concerns about effectiveness related to Martinez' lack of physical stature, 
his career minor league numbers have minimized them through 2013. In 327 2⁄3 
IP, he has allowed just 14 HR for a rate of 0.4 HR/9. He allowed one home 
run in 28 1⁄3 IP with the major league club in 2013. His ground-ball rate 
was above 50 percent in 2012–13, after steadily increasing as he progressed 
through the minor leagues. It was 52.3% for the Cardinals in 2013. His
