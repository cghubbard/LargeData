William Frank Isbell (August 21, 1875 – July 15, 1941) was a Major League 
first baseman, second baseman, and outfielder in the 1910s. Born in Delevan, 
New York, Isbell was nicknamed Bald Eagle due to his receding hairline, 
something he was quite sensitive about. Isbell was a good enough hitter 
to earn a starting spot on some very good White Sox teams, including the 
pennant-winning 1901 team, managed by Clark Griffith, the second-place 
1905 team led by Fielder Jones, and finally the 1906 World Series champion 
White Sox team that included shortstop George Davis and pitchers Doc White 
and Ed Walsh. It was known as one of the worst-hitting teams to ever win 
the World Series, with only Davis and Isbell hitting above .260 (Davis 
hit .277, Isbell .279). He played for the Chicago Cubs in 1898, briefly, 
with 37 hits in 159 at bats (.233 batting average), and pitched as well 
as playing the outfield. Thirteen of his seventeen games pitched came with 
the Cubs. After not being seen in baseball for the next year, Isbell showed 
up again in 1900 playing for the Chicago White Sox as a full-time first 
baseman. The American League was not recognized in the Majors until 1901. 
Isbell played with the Sox until 1909. He batted left-handed and threw 
right-handed. Isbell set many offensive World Series records that year, 
including doubles and extra base hits in a game. However, he was better 
known for his outstanding speed, including his 1901 season when he had 
52 stolen bases and led the Majors. He averaged 37 steals a year and ended 
with 253 for his career. In 1,119 games, Isbell finished with a .250 batting 
average with 13 home runs and 455 RBIs. He had 1,056 career hits in 4,219 
at bats. As a pitcher, he went 4–7 with a 3.59 ERA. Isbell also became 
notable for being manager and owner of many teams in the Western League.
