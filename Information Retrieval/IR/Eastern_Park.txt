-73.90250 Eastern Park was a baseball park in the Brownsville neighborhood 
of Brooklyn, New York in the 1890s. It was bounded by Eastern Parkway (which 
was later renamed Pitkin Avenue when Eastern Parkway was diverted) to the 
north (home plate); the Long Island Rail Road and Vesta Avenue (later renamed 
Van Sinderen Street) to the east (left field); Sutter Avenue to the south 
(center field); and Powell Street to the west (right field). The ballpark 
held 12,000 people.[1] It was originally the home of the Brooklyn Ward's 
Wonders of the Players' League in 1890.[2] After the one-year Players' 
League experiment, the park became the part-time home of the Brooklyn Dodgers 
in 1891 and then full-time during 1892–1897, between their stints at the 
two versions of Washington Park. Some sources erroneously say that it is 
here that the nickname "Trolley Dodgers", later shortened to "Dodgers", 
first arose, due to the need for fans to cross various trolley lines to 
reach the ballpark. Although the Dodgers played at Eastern Park in 1895 
when the name "Trolley Dodgers" was first used, the name was based on the 
dangers of trolleys in Brooklyn, generally, and not trolley lines that 
needed to be crossed to get to the game.[3] There were no trolley lines 
near Eastern Park at the time.[4] Eastern Park was considered difficult 
to reach, and although the team survived there for seven seasons, the venture 
there was a failure. When Charlie Ebbets acquired the Dodgers, he moved 
the team back, to the second version of Washington Park, which was both 
closer to the city center and offered a lower rent. The park also hosted 
numerous college and amateur football games during its heyday, notably 
the Princeton–Yale game of 1890. There was also a track installed, and 
both bicycling and running races were held from time to time. It was also 
the home venue of the short-lived Brooklyn Bridegrooms Soccer Team in 1894. 
This was a spin-off of the Baseball Franchise that took part in an ill-fated 
attempt by six baseball franchises to fill their stadiums in the off season 
by running a soccer league. Brooklyn were top of the league when the uncompleted
