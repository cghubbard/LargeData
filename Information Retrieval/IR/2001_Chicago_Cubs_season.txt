The 2001 Chicago Cubs season was the 130th season of the Chicago Cubs franchise, 
the 126th in the National League and the 86th at Wrigley Field. The Cubs 
finished third in the National League Central with a record of 88–74. During 
a forgettable 2000 season, Jim Hendry sent pitcher Scott Downs to Montreal 
and acquired Rondell White. This laid the groundwork for the 2001 season, 
which saw the North Siders make another drive for the playoffs. Mack Newton 
was brought in by the club to preach "positive mental thought", and it 
paid off. Matt Stairs started the season at first base, but ultimately 
the Cubs made a mid-June trade to acquire All-Star 1B Fred McGriff, though 
McGriff took over a month debating whether or not to approve the deal and 
leave his hometown Tampa Bay Devil Rays, ultimately waiving his no-trade 
clause and allow himself to be dealt to Chicago on July 27. "The Crime 
Dog" hit a respectable .282 with 12 homers in 49 games with the Cubs, hitting 
cleanup behind Sammy Sosa, who had perhaps his best season, hitting 64 
homers with career highs in batting average (.328) and RBI (160) for Don 
Baylor's club. Jon Lieber had a 20 win season, and along with Kevin Tapani 
and Kerry Wood made up a solid rotation. The Cubs led the eventual Wild 
Card winning Cardinals by 2.5 games in early September, but Preston Wilson's 
walk-off homer off of closer Tom "Flash" Gordon took the wind out of the 
team's sails, failing to make another serious charge. The Cubs did manage 
to finish 88–74, only 5 games behind both St. Louis and Houston, who tied 
for first. One of the season's most memorable moments came on September 
27, when Sammy Sosa carried an American flag around the bases after hitting 
a home run in the Cubs first home game since the September 11 attacks.
