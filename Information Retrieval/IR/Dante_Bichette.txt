Alphonse Dante Bichette, Sr. (/ˈdɑːnteɪ bᵻˈʃɛt/; born November 18, 1963) 
is a former professional baseball player. He played in Major League Baseball 
as an outfielder for the California Angels (1988–1990), Milwaukee Brewers 
(1991–1992), Colorado Rockies (1993–1999), Cincinnati Reds (2000), and 
Boston Red Sox (2000–2001). He was also the hitting coach for the Rockies 
in 2013. Bichette was a four-time All-Star as a member of the Rockies. 
He also won the Silver Slugger Award in 1995. Bichette attended Jupiter 
High School in Jupiter, Florida, and Palm Beach Community College. The 
California Angels drafted Bichette in the 17th round of the 1984 Major 
League Baseball draft. Bichette made his MLB debut with the Angels in 1988, 
but was a streaky hitter and was traded to the Milwaukee Brewers in 1991. 
After putting up only average numbers with Milwaukee, he was traded to 
the new expansion team, the Colorado Rockies. On April 7, 1993 he hit the 
first home-run in Rockies history, a solo shot off of New York Mets pitcher 
Bret Saberhagen. Bichette was part of the "Blake Street Bombers" which 
also included sluggers Larry Walker, Andrés Galarraga, and Vinny Castilla. 
He finished the Rockies' first season with 21 home runs and a .310 batting 
average, his personal best for both at the time. Bichette also hit his 
first home run at the newly constructed Coors Field, a fourteenth-inning 
smash against the Mets that secured an opening day victory for the Rockies 
in 1995. Bichette had his best season in 1995, coming very close to the 
Triple Crown with a .340 batting average, 40 home runs and 128 RBIs and 
barely lost the MVP voting to the Cincinnati Reds' Barry Larkin. Bichette 
began having knee problems in 1996, but was still successful as a hitter, 
with a .316 average, 31 home runs and 141 RBIs, plus 31 stolen bases. The 
1996 season was only the second time ever that two players on the same 
team hit at least 30 home runs and collected 30 stolen bases, as Ellis 
Burks accomplished the same feat. Over the next three seasons, Bichette 
hit 26, 22 and 34 home runs for the Rockies. He remains in the top ten 
in many offensive categories for the Rockies.[1] But by the end of the 
1999 season, his production was beginning to drop and the Rockies dealt 
Bichette to the Cincinnati Reds. However, his fielding was suffering tremendously 
and Bichette was eventually traded to the Boston Red Sox[2] for a season 
and a half and then the Los Angeles Dodgers. Bichette retired before ever 
playing a game with the Dodgers on March 22, 2002. In August 2004, Bichette 
rejoined professional baseball as a designated hitter, pitcher and occasional 
outfielder for the Atlantic League's Nashua Pride. Bichette won the Atlantic 
League's Player of the Month award for August (his first full month back). 
He completed the month with a .361 average and 13 homers. On August 28, 
he batted 4-for-5 with two home runs and eight RBIs. On November 13, 2012, 
Bichette was hired to be the Colorado Rockies hitting coach, replacing 
Carney Lansford.[3] He announced on September 24, 2013 that he would not 
return for the 2014 season.[4] In August 2005, Bichette's oldest son Dante 
Jr., participated in the Little League World Series with his Maitland, 
Florida team. Dante Jr. was drafted 51st overall by the New York Yankees 
in 2011.[5] Bichette's younger son, Bo, was selected by the Toronto Blue 
Jays in the 2016 draft. Both Bo and Dante, Jr. played for Brazil at the
