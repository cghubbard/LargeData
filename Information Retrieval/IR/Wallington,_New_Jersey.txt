Wallington were ceded to Garfield in 1898.[21][23][24] The borough is said

in the future borough.[25][26][27] According to the United States Census

up for election each year in a three-year cycle.[5] The Borough form of 
government used by Wallington, the most common system used in the state, 
is a "weak mayor / strong council" government in which council members 
act as the legislative body with the mayor presiding at meetings and voting 
only in the event of a tie. The mayor can veto ordinances subject to an 
override by a two-thirds majority vote of the council. The mayor makes 
committee and liaison assignments for council members, and most appointments 
are made by the mayor with the advice and consent of the council.[45][46]
