On May 17, 1998, David Wells of the New York Yankees pitched the 15th perfect 
game (no opposing batters reach first base) in Major League Baseball history 
and the second in team history. Pitching against the Minnesota Twins at 
Yankee Stadium in The Bronx in front of 49,820 fans in attendance, Wells 
retired all 27 batters he faced.[1] The game took 2 hours and 40 minutes 
to complete, from 1:36 PM ET to 4:16 PM ET. Wells claimed that he threw 
the perfect game while being hung over. Wells' perfect game was the 245th 
no-hitter in MLB history, and the tenth no-hitter in Yankees history. It 
was the first regular-season perfect game pitched by a Yankee; the franchise's 
previous perfect game was thrown by Don Larsen during the 1956 World Series. 
By coincidence, Wells graduated from the same high school as Larsen - Point 
Loma High School in San Diego, California.[2] The previous perfect game 
in MLB history was nearly four years prior, when Kenny Rogers of the Texas 
Rangers pitched a perfect game against the California Angels at Rangers 
Ballpark in Arlington on July 28, 1994. Well's perfect game was the first 
Yankee no-hitter since Dwight Gooden's against the Seattle Mariners in 
May 1996. Wells' performance tied the record for franchises with most perfect 
games. At the time, the Cleveland Indians were the only other team to have 
two perfect games; David Cone would add a third perfect game to Yankees 
history, breaking the record in July 1999. Italics denotes post-season perfect game
