Dwight Eugene "Doc" Gooden (born November 16, 1964), nicknamed "Dr. K", 
is an American former professional baseball pitcher who played 16 seasons 
in Major League Baseball (MLB). Gooden pitched from 1984 to 1994 and from 
1996 to 2000 for the New York Mets, New York Yankees, Cleveland Indians, 
Houston Astros, and Tampa Bay Devil Rays. In a career spanning 430 games, 
he pitched 2,800 2⁄3 innings and posted a win–loss record of 194–112, with 
a 3.51 earned run average (ERA), and 2,293 strikeouts. Gooden made his 
MLB debut in 1984 for the Mets and quickly established himself as one of 
the league's most talented pitchers; as a 19-year-old rookie, he earned 
the first of four All-Star selections, won the National League (NL) Rookie 
of the Year Award, and led the league in strikeouts. In 1985, he won the 
NL Cy Young Award and achieved the pitching Triple Crown, compiling a 24–4 
record and a league-leading 1.53 ERA, 268 strikeouts, and 16 complete games. 
The following season, he helped the Mets win the 1986 World Series. Gooden 
remained an effective pitcher in subsequent years, but his career was ultimately 
derailed by cocaine and alcohol addiction. After posting a losing record 
in each season from 1992–1994, Gooden was suspended for the 1995 season 
after a positive drug test while serving a prior suspension. As a member 
of the Yankees in 1996, Gooden pitched a no-hitter and helped the team 
on its path to a World Series championship. He pitched four additional 
years for as many teams, but never approached the success of his peak years 
with his Mets. In 2010, Gooden was inducted into the New York Mets Hall 
of Fame. Gooden's troubles with addiction continued after his retirement 
from baseball and resulted in several arrests. He was incarcerated for 
seven months in 2006 after violating the terms of his probation. A native 
of Tampa, Florida, Dwight Gooden was drafted in the first round in 1982, 
the fifth player taken overall. He spent one season in the minors, in which 
he led the Class-A Carolina League in wins, strikeouts and ERA while playing 
for the Lynchburg Mets. Gooden had 300 strikeouts in 191 innings, a performance 
which convinced Triple-A Tidewater Tides manager, future Mets skipper Davey 
Johnson, to bring him up for the Tides' post season, believing that Gooden 
was capable of making the leap to the major leagues. Gooden made his major-league 
debut on April 7, 1984 with the New York Mets at the age of 19. He quickly 
developed a reputation with his 98 MPH fastball and sweeping curveball, 
which was given the superlative nickname of "Lord Charles", in contrast 
with "Uncle Charlie", a common nickname for a curveball. He was dubbed 
"Dr. K", (by analogy with basketball's "Dr. J", Julius Erving, and also 
in reference to the letter "K" being the standard abbreviation for strikeout), 
which soon became shortened to "Doc". Gooden soon attracted a rooting section 
at Shea Stadium that called itself "The K Korner", and would hang up cards 
with a red "K" after each of his strikeouts. When he took the mound in 
the fifth inning on July 10, 1984, Gooden became the youngest player to 
appear in an All-Star Game. He complemented this distinction by striking 
out the side, AL batters: Lance Parrish, Chet Lemon, and Alvin Davis. Setting 
up Gooden, NL Pitcher Fernando Valenzuela had already struck out the side 
in the fourth, putting down future Hall of Famers Dave Winfield, Reggie 
Jackson, and George Brett. The two pitchers' combined performance broke 
an All-Star game record, coincidentally on its celebrated 50th Anniversary—Carl 
Hubbell's five consecutive strikeouts in 1934. That season, Gooden won 
17 games, the most by a 19-year-old since Wally Bunker won 19 games in 
1964 and the second most for a Mets rookie, after Jerry Koosman's 19 wins 
in 1968. Gooden won eight of his last nine starts; in his final three starts 
of the 1984 season, he had 41 strikeouts and 1 walk. Gooden led the league 
in strikeouts, his 276 breaking Herb Score's rookie record of 245 in 1955, 
and also set the record for most strikeouts in three consecutive starts 
with 43. As a 19-year-old rookie, Gooden set the then-major league record 
for strikeouts per 9 innings, with 11.39, breaking Sam McDowell's record 
of 10.71 in 1965. He was voted the Rookie of the Year, giving the Mets 
two consecutive winners of that award (Darryl Strawberry had been the recipient 
in 1983). Gooden also became the third Mets pitcher to win the award, joining 
Tom Seaver (1967) and Jon Matlack (1972). Gooden finished second in the 
NL Cy Young Award voting, even though he had more NL wins, strikeouts, 
innings pitched, and a lower ERA than the NL winner Rick Sutcliffe.[1][2][3] 
In 1985, Gooden pitched one of the most statistically dominating single 
seasons in baseball history having the highest WAR in 60 years.[4] Leading 
Major League Baseball with 24 wins, 268 strikeouts, and a 1.53 ERA (the 
second lowest in the live-ball era, trailing only Bob Gibson's 1.12 in 
1968) Gooden earned the major leagues' pitching Triple Crown. He led the 
National League in complete games (16) and innings pitched (276 2⁄3). From 
his second start onward, Gooden's ERA never rose above 2.00.[5] At age 
20, he was the youngest pitcher of the last half-century to have an ERA+ 
above 200. Gooden's ERA+ was 229; 23-year-old Dean Chance (200 ERA+ in 
1964) was the only other pitcher under the age of 25 to do so. From August 
31 through September 16, Gooden threw 31 consecutive scoreless innings 
over four games, and through October 2, threw 49 consecutive innings over 
seven games without allowing an earned run. The highest "quality start" 
percentage for a given season was recorded by Dwight Gooden, who had 33 
of them in 35 games in 1985.[6] Even in the 11 games when Gooden didn't 
earn a win, he was dominant. In September, he pitched back-to-back nine-inning 
games allowing no runs, but received no-decisions in both games. In his 
four losses, Gooden allowed 26 hits and five walks in 28 innings, with 
28 strikeouts and a 2.89 ERA. The Mets finished second in the 1985 NL East, 
and teammates jokingly blamed Gooden for having lost 4 games, thereby mathematically 
costing them the division title. That year, Gooden became one of only 14 
African-American pitchers ever to win 20 games, the most recent of whom 
was CC Sabathia. Gooden became the youngest-ever recipient of the Cy Young 
Award and Pitcher of the Year Award. There was even media speculation about 
Gooden's Hall of Fame prospects. That November, Gooden turned 21. Travelers 
descending the steps of the side entrance to Manhattan's Pennsylvania Station 
were greeted by an enormous photograph of Gooden in mid-motion that recorded 
his season's strikeout totals as the year progressed. Likewise, those strolling 
the streets of Manhattan's West Side could gaze up at a 102 feet tall Sports 
Illustrated mural of Gooden painted on the side of a building at 351 West 
42nd Street in Times Square, whose caption asked "How does it feel to look 
down the barrel of a loaded gun?"[7][8][9][10] While Gooden would be an 
effective pitcher for several more seasons, he never again approached such 
heights. The year 1985 would prove to be the only 20-win season of Gooden's 
16-year career. Many reasons have been offered for his decline: early overuse, 
cocaine addiction, the league's hitters catching on to some of his pitches 
(notably a fastball that rose out of the strike zone, which hitters increasingly 
avoided), or the influence of Mets pitching coach Mel Stottlemyre, who 
convinced Gooden to change his pitching motion in the hopes of prolonging 
his career. However brief, Gooden's period of dominance was memorable. 
In a span of 50 starts from August 11, 1984, to May 6, 1986, Gooden posted 
a record of 37-5 with a 1.38 ERA; he had 412 strikeouts and 90 walks in 
406 innings. In 1986, he compiled a 17–6 record. Gooden's 200 strikeouts 
were fifth in the National League, but more than a hundred behind the league 
leader, Mike Scott of the Houston Astros. In another All-Star record pertaining 
to youth, in 1986 Gooden became the youngest pitcher to start an All-Star 
Game at 21 years, seven months and 30 days of age. Gooden was the Mets 
ace going into the playoffs, and his postseason started promisingly. He 
lost a 1–0 duel with Scott in the NLCS opener, then got a no-decision in 
Game 5, pitching 10 innings of one-run ball. He was substantially worse 
in the World Series against the Boston Red Sox, not getting past the 5th 
inning in either of his two starts. Nevertheless, the Mets won four of 
the five non-Gooden starts and the championship. In an early red flag, 
Gooden failed to attend the team's victory parade. Gooden was arrested 
on December 13, 1986, in Tampa, Florida after fighting with police.[11] 
A report clearing police of misconduct in the arrest helped start the Tampa 
riots of 1987.[12] Rumors of substance abuse began to arise, which were 
confirmed when Gooden tested positive for cocaine during spring training 
in 1987. He entered a rehabilitation center on April 1, 1987, to avoid 
being suspended and did not make his first start of the season until June 
5. Despite missing a third of the season, Gooden won 15 games for the 1987 
Mets. In 1988, Gooden recorded an 18–9 record as the Mets returned to the 
postseason. In the first game of the NLCS against the Los Angeles Dodgers, 
Gooden was matched against Orel Hershiser, who had just finished the regular 
season with a 59-inning scoreless streak. Gooden pitched well, allowing 
just 4 hits and recording 10 strikeouts, but left after seven innings trailing 
2–0. In Game 4, Gooden entered the ninth inning with a 4–2 lead and the 
chance to give his Mets a commanding 3–1 advantage in the series. But he 
allowed a game-tying home run to Mike Scioscia, and the Dodgers eventually 
went on to win the game in 12 innings, and the series as well, 4 games 
to 3. The game remains one of the great disappointments in Mets franchise 
history. The 1980s Mets were considered a dynasty in the making; after 
they underperformed, some looked to this game as perhaps the key moment 
of the dynasty that was not. Gooden suffered a shoulder injury in 1989, 
which reduced him to a 9–4 record in 17 starts. He rebounded in 1990, posting 
a 19–7 season with 223 strikeouts, second only to teammate David Cone's 
233. However, after another injury in 1991, Gooden's career declined significantly. 
Though drug abuse is commonly blamed for Gooden's pitching troubles, some 
analysts point to his early workload. It has been estimated that Gooden 
threw over 10,800 pitches from 1983 to 1985, a period in which he was just 
18 to 20 years old.[13] Gooden hurled 276 innings in his historic 1985 
season; in the 20 years since, only two pitchers have reached that amount 
(Charlie Hough, a knuckleballer, and Roger Clemens, both in 1987). By the 
time he reached his 21st birthday, Gooden had already accumulated 928 strikeouts 
between both the minor and major leagues. Gooden was accused along with 
two other teammates of rape in 1991; however, charges were never pressed. 
The other two players were Vince Coleman and Daryl Boston.[14] 1992 was 
Gooden's first-ever losing season (10-13); it was also the first time he 
had lost as many as 10 decisions. 1993 was no improvement, as Gooden finished 
12–15. During the 1993 season, Sports Illustrated ran a cover story on 
Gooden entitled, "From Phenom to Phantom." During the strike-shortened 
1994 season at age 29, Gooden had a 3–4 record with a 6.31 ERA when he 
tested positive for cocaine use and was suspended for 60 days. He tested 
positive again while serving the suspension, and was further suspended 
for the entire 1995 season. The day after receiving the second suspension, 
Gooden's wife, Monica, found him in his bedroom with a loaded gun to his 
head.[15] In July 1995, the famous longstanding Dwight Gooden Times Square 
mural was replaced with a Charles Oakley mural. The Dwight Gooden mural 
was a part of the NYC landscape for over ten years.[16] Kirk Radomski, 
the New York Mets clubhouse attendant whose allegations are at the base 
of the Mitchell Report later claimed that he took two urine tests for Gooden 
during the 1990s. Gooden denies the allegations.[17] Gooden signed with 
the New York Yankees in 1996 as a free agent. After pitching poorly in 
April and nearly getting released, he was sent down to the minors where 
he worked on his mechanics and soon returned with a shortened wind-up. 
He no-hit the Seattle Mariners 2-0 at Yankee Stadium on May 14.[18] He 
ended the 1996 season at 11–7, his first winning record since 1991, and 
showed flashes of his early form, going 10-2 with a 3.09 ERA from April 
27 through August 12. He proved to be a valuable asset for the Yankees 
that season as David Cone was out until early September with an aneurysm 
in his shoulder. Gooden was left off the 1996 postseason roster due to 
injury and fatigue. In 1997 he posted a respectable 9-5 record with a 4.91 
ERA. He had one start for the Yankees in the 1997 ALDS against the Cleveland 
Indians; coincidentally, he again faced his 1988 postseason nemesis Orel 
Hershiser. Gooden left Game 4 during the sixth inning with a 2–1 lead, 
but the Yankee bullpen faltered in the 8th and Gooden was left with the 
no-decision. Gooden signed with the Cleveland Indians in 1998 and enjoyed 
moderate success, going 8-6 with a 3.76 ERA. He started 2 games for the 
Indians in the 1998 post-season, including one against his former team 
the New York Yankees, both of which ended in no-decisions. He remained 
with the Indians in 1999 but did not match his respectable numbers in 1998, 
going 3-4 with a 6.26 ERA. Gooden began the 2000 season with 2 sub-par 
stints with the Houston Astros and Tampa Bay Devil Rays but found himself 
back with the Yankees mid-season. He would go on to have a respectable 
second stint with the Yankees, going 4-2 with a 3.36 ERA as a spot starter 
and long reliever, including a win against his former team the New York 
Mets on July 8 in the regular-season Subway series. He made one relief 
appearance in each of the first two rounds of the playoffs, both times 
with the Yankees trailing. Gooden did not pitch in the 2000 World Series 
against the Mets, though 2000 would be the 3rd time Gooden received a World 
Series ring in his career. In 1999, Gooden released an autobiography titled 
Heat, in which he discussed his struggles with alcohol and cocaine abuse. 
Gooden failed to win a postseason game, going 0–4 in the course of nine 
postseason starts over eight series.[19] In the 1986 National League Championship 
Series, however, he had an earned run average of only 1.06 after starting 
two games and allowing just two earned runs in 17 innings pitched.[19] 
Gooden retired in 2001 after he was cut by the Yankees in spring training, 
ending his career with a record of 194–112. More than half of those wins 
came before age 25. Gooden appeared on the 2006 Baseball Hall of Fame ballot. 
He was named on only 17, or 3.3 percent, of the 520 voting writers' ballots, 
and, having been named on less than 5 percent of the total ballots, was 
removed from future HOF consideration. After retiring, Gooden took a job 
in the Yankees' front office. He acted as the go-between man during free 
agent contract negotiations between his nephew, Gary Sheffield, and the 
Yankees prior to the 2004 season. In July 2009 he was hired as a vice president 
of community relations for Atlantic League's Newark Bears. He left the 
post in November of the same year.[20] Gooden appeared at the Shea Stadium 
final celebration on September 28, 2008, the first time he had appeared 
at Shea Stadium since 2000. On April 13, 2009, he made an appearance at 
the newly opened Citi Field. Gooden spontaneously signed his name to a 
wall on the inside of the stadium. The Mets initially indicated that they 
would remove the signature, but soon decided instead to move the part of 
the wall with Gooden's writing to a different area of the stadium and acquire 
additional signatures from other popular ex-players. On August 1, 2010, 
he was officially inducted into the Mets Hall of Fame along with Darryl 
Strawberry, Frank Cashen, and Davey Johnson. He also threw out the ceremonial 
first pitch on the same day to Gary Carter. VH1 Network announced June 
11, 2011 that he would be a patient in VH1's fifth season of the reality 
show Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew. On February 20, 2002, Gooden was arrested 
in his native Tampa and charged with driving while intoxicated, having 
an open container of alcohol in his vehicle, and driving with a suspended 
license. He was arrested again in January 2003 for driving with a suspended 
license. On March 12, 2005, Gooden was arrested in Tampa, Florida for punching 
his girlfriend after she threw a telephone at his head. He was released 
two days later on a misdemeanor battery charge. Troubles continued to mount 
for the former star when, on August 23, 2005, he drove away from a traffic 
stop in Tampa, after being pulled over for driving erratically. He gave 
the officer his driver's license, twice refused to leave his car, then 
drove away. The officer remarked in his report that Gooden's eyes were 
glassy and bloodshot, his speech was slurred, and a "strong" odor of alcohol 
was present on him. Three days after the traffic stop, Gooden turned himself 
in to police.[21] Gooden was again arrested in March 2006 for violating 
his probation, after he arrived high on cocaine at a scheduled meeting 
with his probation officer, David R. Stec.[22] He chose prison over extended 
probation, perhaps in the hope that incarceration would separate him from 
the temptations of his addiction.[23] He entered prison on April 17, 2006. 
On May 31, Gooden said in an interview from prison, "I can't come back 
here. [...] I'd rather get shot than come back here. [...] If I don't get 
the message this time, I never will."[24] Gooden was released from prison 
November 9, 2006, after nearly seven months' incarceration, and was not 
placed on further probation.[25] On the morning of March 24, 2010, Gooden 
was arrested in Franklin Lakes, New Jersey near his home there after leaving 
the scene of a traffic accident, having been located nearby and found to 
be under the influence of an undisclosed controlled substance.[26] He was 
charged with DWI with a child passenger, leaving the scene of an accident, 
and other motor vehicle violations.[27] Gooden was also charged with endangering 
the welfare of a child, because a child was with him at the time of the 
accident.[28] He later pleaded guilty to child endangerment, received five 
years probation, and was ordered to undergo outpatient drug treatment.[29]
