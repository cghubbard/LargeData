Malachi Jeddidiah Kittridge [or Kittredge] (October 12, 1869, Clinton, 
Massachusetts – June 23, 1928, Gary, Indiana) was a catcher in Major League 
Baseball who played for the Chicago Colts (1890–97), Louisville Colonels 
(1898–99), Washington Senators (NL) (1899), Boston Beaneaters (1901–03), 
Washington Senators (AL) (1903–06) and Cleveland Naps (1906). Kittridge 
batted and threw right-handed. Kittridge was not a good hitter, but in 
his career, he was regarded as having one of the best throwing arms. In 
1904 he was hired as player-manager of the American League Washington Senators, 
but he started off horrendously, going 1–16 (.059) before being replaced 
by Patsy Donovan. The Senators would finish 38–113 that season. He was 
traded to Cleveland in the middle of the 1906 season, but he would only 
have five more at-bats for the Naps before retiring from baseball. Kittridge
