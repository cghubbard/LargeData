Marilyn Monroe (born Norma Jeane Mortenson; June 1, 1926 – August 5, 1962) 
was an American actress and model. Famous for playing comic "dumb blonde" 
characters, she became one of the most popular sex symbols of the 1950s, 
emblematic of the era's attitudes towards sexuality. Although she was a 
top-billed actress for only a decade, her films grossed $200 million by 
the time of her unexpected death in 1962.[1] She continues to be considered 
a major popular culture icon.[2] Born and raised in Los Angeles, Monroe 
spent most of her childhood in foster homes and an orphanage and married 
for the first time at the age of sixteen. While working in a factory as 
part of the war effort in 1944, she met a photographer and began a successful 
pin-up modeling career. The work led to short-lived film contracts with 
Twentieth Century-Fox (1946–47) and Columbia Pictures (1948). After a series 
of minor film roles, she signed a new contract with Fox in 1951. Over the 
next two years, she became a popular actress with roles in several comedies, 
including As Young as You Feel and Monkey Business, and in the dramas Clash 
by Night and Don't Bother to Knock. Monroe faced a scandal when it was 
revealed that she had posed for nude photos before becoming a star, but 
rather than damaging her career, the story increased interest in her films. 
By 1953, Monroe was one of the most marketable Hollywood stars, with leading 
roles in three films: the noir Niagara, which focused on her sex appeal, 
and the comedies Gentlemen Prefer Blondes and How to Marry a Millionaire, 
which established her star image as a "dumb blonde". Although she played 
a significant role in the creation and management of her public image throughout 
her career, she was disappointed at being typecast and underpaid by the 
studio. She was briefly suspended in early 1954 for refusing a film project, 
but returned to star in one of the biggest box office successes of her 
career, The Seven Year Itch (1955). When the studio was still reluctant 
to change her contract, Monroe founded a film production company in late 
1954, Marilyn Monroe Productions (MMP). She dedicated 1955 to building 
her company and began studying method acting at the Actors Studio. In late 
1955, Fox awarded her a new contract, which gave her more control and a 
larger salary. After a critically acclaimed performance in Bus Stop (1956) 
and acting in the first independent production of MMP, The Prince and the 
Showgirl (1957), she won a Golden Globe for Best Actress for Some Like 
It Hot (1959). Her last completed film was the drama The Misfits (1961). 
Monroe's troubled private life received much attention. She struggled with 
substance abuse, depression, and anxiety. She had two highly publicized 
marriages, to retired baseball player Joe DiMaggio and playwright Arthur 
Miller, which both ended in divorce. She died at the age of 36 on August 
5, 1962 from an overdose of barbiturates at her home in Los Angeles. Although 
the death was ruled a probable suicide, several conspiracy theories have 
been proposed in the decades following her death. Monroe was born Norma 
Jeane Mortenson at the Los Angeles County Hospital on June 1, 1926, as 
the third child of Gladys Pearl Baker (née Monroe, 1902–84).[3] Gladys, 
the daughter of two poor Midwestern migrants to California, was a flapper 
and worked as a film negative cutter at Consolidated Film Industries.[4] 
When she was fifteen, Gladys married a man nine years her senior, John 
Newton Baker, and had two children by him, Robert (1917–33)[5] and Berniece 
(born 1919).[6] She filed for divorce in 1921, and Baker took the children 
with him to his native Kentucky.[7] Monroe was not told that she had a 
sister until she was twelve, and met her for the first time as an adult.[8] 
Gladys married her second husband Martin Edward Mortensen in 1924, but 
they separated before she became pregnant with Monroe; they divorced in 
1928.[9] The identity of Monroe's father is unknown and Baker was most 
often used as her surname.[10][a] Monroe's early childhood was stable and 
happy.[14] While Gladys was mentally and financially unprepared for a child, 
she was able to place Monroe with foster parents Albert and Ida Bolender 
in the rural town of Hawthorne soon after the birth.[15] They raised their 
foster children according to the principles of evangelical Christianity.[14] 
At first, Gladys lived with the Bolenders and commuted to work in Los Angeles, 
until longer work shifts forced her to move back to the city in early 1927.[16] 
She then began visiting her daughter on the weekends, often taking her 
to the cinema and to sightsee in Los Angeles.[14] Although the Bolenders 
wanted to adopt Monroe, by the summer of 1933, Gladys felt stable enough 
for Monroe to move in with her and bought a small house in Hollywood.[17] 
They shared it with lodgers, actors George and Maude Atkinson and their 
daughter, Nellie.[18] Some months later, in January 1934, Gladys had a 
mental breakdown and was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia.[19] After 
several months in a rest home, she was committed to the Metropolitan State 
Hospital.[20] She spent the rest of her life in and out of hospitals, and 
was rarely in contact with Monroe.[21] "When I was five I think, that's 
when I started wanting to be an actress. I loved to play. I didn't like 
the world around me because it was kind of grim, but I loved to play house. 
It was like you could make your own boundaries... When I heard that this 
was acting, I said that's what I want to be... Some of my foster families 
used to send me to the movies to get me out of the house and there I'd 
sit all day and way into the night. Up in front, there with the screen 
so big, a little kid all alone, and I loved it."[22] Monroe was declared 
a ward of the state, and her mother's friend, Grace McKee Goddard, took 
responsibility over her and her mother's affairs.[23] In the following 
four years, she lived with several foster families, and often switched 
schools. For the first sixteen months, she continued living with the Atkinsons; 
she was sexually abused during this time.[24][b] Always a shy girl, she 
now also developed a stutter and became withdrawn.[30] In the summer of 
1935, she briefly stayed with Grace and her husband Erwin "Doc" Goddard 
and two other families,[31] until Grace placed her in the Los Angeles Orphans 
Home in Hollywood in September 1935.[32] While the orphanage was "a model 
institution", and was described in positive terms by her peers, Monroe 
found being placed there traumatizing, as to her "it seemed that no one 
wanted me".[33] Encouraged by the orphanage staff, who thought that Monroe 
would be happier living in a family, Grace became her legal guardian in 
1936, although she was not able to take her out of the orphanage until 
the summer of 1937.[34] Monroe's second stay with the Goddards lasted only 
a few months, as Doc molested her.[35] After staying with various of her 
and Grace's relatives and friends in Los Angeles and Compton,[36] Monroe 
found a more permanent home in September 1938, when she began living with 
Grace's aunt, Ana Atchinson Lower, in the Sawtelle district.[37] She was 
enrolled in Emerson Junior High School and was taken to weekly Christian 
Science services with Lower.[38] While otherwise a mediocre student, Monroe 
excelled in writing and contributed to the school's newspaper.[39] Due 
to the elderly Lower's health issues, Monroe returned to live with the 
Goddards in Van Nuys in either late 1940 or early 1941.[40] After graduating 
from Emerson, she began attending Van Nuys High School.[41] In early 1942, 
the company that Doc Goddard worked for required him to relocate to West 
Virginia.[42] California laws prevented the Goddards from taking Monroe 
out of state, and she faced the possibility of having to return to the 
orphanage.[43] As a solution, she married their neighbors' son, 21-year-old 
factory worker James "Jim" Dougherty, on June 19, 1942, just after her 
16th birthday.[44] Monroe subsequently dropped out of high school and became 
a housewife; she later stated that the "marriage didn't make me sad, but 
it didn't make me happy, either. My husband and I hardly spoke to each 
other. This wasn't because we were angry. We had nothing to say. I was 
dying of boredom."[45] In 1943, Dougherty enlisted in the Merchant Marine.[46] 
He was initially stationed on Catalina Island, where she lived with him 
until he was shipped out to the Pacific in April 1944; he would remain 
there for most of the next two years.[46] After Dougherty's departure, 
Monroe moved in with his parents and began working at the Radioplane Munitions 
Factory to participate in the war effort and to earn her own income.[46] 
In late 1944, Monroe met photographer David Conover, who had been sent 
by the U.S. Army Air Forces' First Motion Picture Unit (FMPU) to the factory 
to shoot morale-boosting pictures of female workers.[47] Although none 
of her pictures were used by the FMPU, she quit working at the factory 
in January 1945 and began modeling for Conover and his friends.[48][49] 
She moved out of her in-laws' home, and defying them and her husband, signed 
a contract with the Blue Book Model Agency in August 1945.[50] She began 
to occasionally use the name Jean Norman when working, and had her curly 
brunette hair straightened and dyed blond to make her more employable.[51] 
As her figure was deemed more suitable for pin-up than fashion modeling, 
she was employed mostly for advertisements and men's magazines.[52] According 
to the agency's owner, Emmeline Snively, Monroe was one of its most ambitious 
and hard-working models; by early 1946, she had appeared on 33 magazine 
covers for publications such as Pageant, U.S. Camera, Laff, and Peek.[53] 
Impressed by her success, Snively arranged a contract for Monroe with an 
acting agency in June 1946.[54] After an unsuccessful interview with producers 
at Paramount Pictures, she was given a screentest by Ben Lyon, a 20th Century-Fox 
executive. Head executive Darryl F. Zanuck was unenthusiastic about it,[55] 
but he was persuaded to give her a standard six-month contract to avoid 
her being signed by rival studio RKO Pictures.[c] Monroe began her contract 
in August 1946, and together with Lyon selected the stage name "Marilyn 
Monroe".[57] The first name was picked by Lyon, who was reminded of Broadway 
star Marilyn Miller; the last was picked by Monroe after her mother's maiden 
name.[58] In September 1946, she divorced Dougherty, who was against her 
having a career.[59] Monroe had no film roles during the first months of 
her contract and instead dedicated her days to acting, singing and dancing 
classes.[60] Eager to learn more about the film industry and to promote 
herself, she also spent time at the studio lot to observe others working.[61] 
Her contract was renewed in February 1947, and she was soon given her first 
two film roles: nine lines of dialogue as a waitress in the drama Dangerous 
Years (1947) and a one-line appearance in the comedy Scudda Hoo! Scudda 
Hay! (1948).[62][d] The studio also enrolled her in the Actors' Laboratory 
Theatre, an acting school teaching the techniques of the Group Theatre; 
she later stated that it was "my first taste of what real acting in a real 
drama could be, and I was hooked".[64] Monroe's contract was not renewed 
in August 1947, and she returned to modeling while also doing occasional 
odd jobs at the studio.[65] Determined to make it as an actress, Monroe 
continued studying at the Actors' Lab, and in October appeared as a blonde 
vamp in the short-lived play Glamour Preferred at the Bliss-Hayden Theater, 
but the production was not reviewed by any major publication.[66] To promote 
herself, she frequented producers' offices, befriended gossip columnist 
Sidney Skolsky, and entertained influential male guests at studio functions, 
a practice she had begun at Fox.[67] She also became a friend and occasional 
sex partner of Fox executive Joseph M. Schenck, who persuaded his friend 
Harry Cohn, the head executive of Columbia Pictures, to sign her in March 
1948.[68] While at Fox her roles had been that of a "girl next door", at 
Columbia she was modeled after Rita Hayworth.[69] Monroe's hairline was 
raised by electrolysis and her hair was bleached even lighter, to platinum 
blond.[70] She also began working with the studio's head drama coach, Natasha 
Lytess, who would remain her mentor until 1955.[70] Her only film at the 
studio was the low-budget musical Ladies of the Chorus (1948), in which 
she had her first starring role as a chorus girl who is courted by a wealthy 
man.[63] During the production, she began an affair with her vocal coach, 
Fred Karger, who paid to have her slight overbite corrected.[71] Despite 
the starring role and a subsequent screen test for the lead role in Born 
Yesterday (1950), Monroe's contract was not renewed.[72] Ladies of the 
Chorus was released in October and was not a success.[73] After leaving 
Columbia in September 1948, Monroe became a protégée of Johnny Hyde, vice 
president of the William Morris Agency. Hyde began representing her and 
their relationship soon became sexual, although she refused his proposals 
of marriage.[74] To advance Monroe's career, he paid for a silicone prosthesis 
to be implanted in her jaw and possibly for a rhinoplasty, and arranged 
a bit part in the Marx Brothers film Love Happy (1950).[75] Monroe also 
continued modeling, and in May 1949 posed for nude photos taken by Tom 
Kelley.[76] Although her role in Love Happy was very small, she was chosen 
to participate in the film's promotional tour in New York that year.[77] 
Monroe appeared in six films released in 1950. She had bit parts in Love 
Happy, A Ticket to Tomahawk, Right Cross and The Fireball, but also made 
minor appearances in two critically acclaimed films: John Huston's crime 
film The Asphalt Jungle and Joseph Mankiewicz's drama All About Eve.[78] 
In the former, Monroe played Angela, the young mistress of an aging criminal.[79] 
Although only on the screen for five minutes, she gained a mention in Photoplay 
and according to Spoto "moved effectively from movie model to serious actress".[79] 
In All About Eve, Monroe played Miss Caswell, a naïve young actress.[80] 
Following Monroe's success in these roles, Hyde negotiated a seven-year 
contract with 20th Century-Fox in December 1950.[81] He died of a heart 
attack only days later, leaving her devastated.[82] Despite her grief, 
1951 became the year in which she gained more visibility. In March, she 
was a presenter at the 23rd Academy Awards, and in September, Collier's 
became the first national magazine to publish a full-length profile of 
her.[83] She had supporting roles in four low-budget films: in the MGM 
drama Home Town Story, and in three moderately successful comedies for 
Fox, As Young as You Feel, Love Nest, and Let's Make It Legal.[84] According 
to Spoto all four films featured her "essentially [as] a sexy ornament", 
but she received some praise from critics: Bosley Crowther of The New York 
Times described her as "superb" in As Young As You Feel and Ezra Goodman 
of the Los Angeles Daily News called her "one of the brightest up-and-coming 
[actresses]" for Love Nest.[85] To further develop her acting skills, Monroe 
began taking classes with Michael Chekhov and mime Lotte Goslar.[86] Her 
popularity with audiences was also growing: she received several thousand 
letters of fan mail a week, and was declared "Miss Cheesecake of 1951" 
by the army newspaper Stars and Stripes, reflecting the preferences of 
soldiers in the Korean War.[87] In her private life, Monroe was in a relationship 
with director Elia Kazan, and also briefly dated several other men, including 
director Nicholas Ray and actors Yul Brynner and Peter Lawford.[88] The 
second year of the Fox contract saw Monroe become a top-billed actress, 
with gossip columnist Florabel Muir naming her the year's "it girl" and 
Hedda Hopper describing her as the "cheesecake queen" turned "box office 
smash".[89][90] In February, she was named the "best young box office personality" 
by the Foreign Press Association of Hollywood,[91] and began a highly publicized 
romance with retired New York Yankee Joe DiMaggio, one of the most famous 
sports personalities of the era.[92] The following month, a scandal broke 
when she revealed in an interview that she had posed for nude pictures 
in 1949, which were featured in calendars.[93] The studio had learned of 
the photographs some weeks earlier, and to contain the potentially disastrous 
effects on her career, they and Monroe had decided to talk about them openly 
while stressing that she had only posed for them in a dire financial situation.[94] 
The strategy succeeded in getting her public sympathy and increased interest 
in her films: the following month, she was featured on the cover of Life 
as "The Talk of Hollywood".[95] Monroe added to her reputation as a new 
sex symbol with other publicity stunts that year, such as wearing a revealing 
dress when acting as Grand Marshal at the Miss America Pageant parade, 
and by stating to gossip columnist Earl Wilson that she usually wore no 
underwear.[96] Regardless of the popularity her sex appeal brought, Monroe 
wished to present more of her acting range, and in the summer of 1952 appeared 
in two commercially successful dramas.[97] The first was Fritz Lang's Clash 
by Night, for which she was loaned to RKO and played a fish cannery worker; 
to prepare, she spent time in a real fish cannery in Monterey.[98] She 
received positive reviews for her performance: The Hollywood Reporter stated 
that "she deserves starring status with her excellent interpretation", 
and Variety wrote that she "has an ease of delivery which makes her a cinch 
for popularity".[99][100] The second film was the thriller Don't Bother 
to Knock, in which she starred as a mentally disturbed babysitter and which 
Zanuck had assigned for her to test her abilities in a heavier dramatic 
role.[101] It received mixed reviews from critics, with Crowther deeming 
her too inexperienced for the difficult role,[102] and Variety blaming 
the script for the film's problems.[103][104] Monroe's three other films 
in 1952 continued her typecasting in comic roles which focused on her sex 
appeal. In We're Not Married!, her starring role as a beauty pageant contestant 
was created solely to "present Marilyn in two bathing suits", according 
to its writer Nunnally Johnson.[105] In Howard Hawks' Monkey Business, 
in which she was featured opposite Cary Grant, she played a secretary who 
is a "dumb, childish blonde, innocently unaware of the havoc her sexiness 
causes around her".[106] In O. Henry's Full House, her final film of the 
year, she had a minor role as a prostitute.[106] During this period Monroe 
gained a reputation for being difficult on film sets, which worsened as 
her career progressed: she was often late or did not show up at all, did 
not remember her lines, and would demand several re-takes before she was 
satisfied with her performance.[107] A dependence on her acting coaches, 
first Natasha Lytess and later Paula Strasberg, also irritated directors.[108] 
Monroe's problems have been attributed to a combination of perfectionism, 
low self-esteem, and stage fright; she disliked the lack of control she 
had on her work on film sets, and never experienced similar problems during 
photo shoots, in which she had more say over her performance and could 
be more spontaneous instead of following a script.[109][110] To alleviate 
her anxiety and chronic insomnia, she began to use barbiturates, amphetamines 
and alcohol, which also exacerbated her problems, although she did not 
become severely addicted until 1956.[111] According to Sarah Churchwell, 
some of Monroe's behavior especially later in her career was also in response 
to the condescension and sexism of her male co-stars and directors.[112] 
Similarly, Lois Banner has stated that she was bullied by many of her directors.[113] 
Monroe starred in three movies released in 1953, emerging as a major sex 
symbol and one of Hollywood's most bankable performers.[114][115] The first 
of these was the Technicolor film noir Niagara, in which she played a femme 
fatale scheming to murder her husband, played by Joseph Cotten.[116] By 
then, Monroe and her make-up artist Allan "Whitey" Snyder had developed 
the make-up look that became associated with her: dark arched brows, pale 
skin, "glistening" red lips and a beauty mark.[117] According to Sarah 
Churchwell, Niagara was one of the most overtly sexual films of Monroe's 
career, and it included scenes in which her body was covered only by a 
sheet or a towel, considered shocking by contemporary audiences.[118] Its 
most famous scene is a 30-second long shot of Monroe shown walking from 
behind with her hips swaying, which was heavily used in the film's marketing.[118] 
Upon Niagara's release in January, women's clubs protested against it as 
immoral, but it proved popular with audiences, grossing $6 million in the 
box office.[119] While Variety deemed it "clichéd" and "morbid", The New 
York Times commented that "the falls and Miss Monroe are something to see", 
as although Monroe may not be "the perfect actress at this point ... she 
can be seductive – even when she walks".[120][121] Monroe continued to 
attract attention with her revealing outfits in publicity events, most 
famously at the Photoplay awards in January 1953, where she won the "Fastest 
Rising Star" award.[122] She wore a skin-tight gold lamé dress, which prompted 
veteran star Joan Crawford to describe her behavior as "unbecoming an actress 
and a lady" to the press.[122] While Niagara made Monroe a sex symbol and 
established her "look", her second film of the year, the satirical musical 
comedy Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, established her screen persona as a "dumb 
blonde".[123] Based on Anita Loos' bestselling novel and its Broadway version, 
the film focuses on two "gold-digging" showgirls, Lorelei Lee and Dorothy 
Shaw, played by Monroe and Jane Russell. The role of Lorelei was originally 
intended for Betty Grable, who had been 20th Century-Fox's most popular 
"blonde bombshell" in the 1940s; Monroe was fast eclipsing her as a star 
who could appeal to both male and female audiences.[124] As part of the 
film's publicity campaign, she and Russell pressed their hand and footprints 
in wet concrete outside Grauman's Chinese Theatre in June.[125] Gentlemen 
Prefer Blondes was released shortly after and became one of the biggest 
box office successes of the year by grossing $5.3 million, more than double 
its production costs.[126] Crowther of The New York Times and William Brogdon 
of Variety both commented favorably on Monroe, especially noting her performance 
of "Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend"; according to the latter, she demonstrated 
the "ability to sex a song as well as point up the eye values of a scene 
by her presence".[127][128] In September, Monroe made her television debut 
in the Jack Benny Show, playing Jack's fantasy woman in the episode "Honolulu 
Trip".[129] Her third movie of the year, How to Marry a Millionaire, co-starred 
Betty Grable and Lauren Bacall and was released in November. It featured 
Monroe in the role of a naïve model who teams up with her friends to find 
rich husbands, repeating the successful formula of Gentlemen Prefer Blondes. 
It was the second film ever released in CinemaScope, a widescreen format 
which Fox hoped would draw audiences back to theaters as television was 
beginning to cause losses to film studios.[130] Despite mixed reviews, 
the film was Monroe's biggest box office success so far, earning $8 million 
in world rentals.[131] Monroe was listed in the annual Top Ten Money Making 
Stars Poll in both 1953 and 1954,[115] and according to Fox historian Aubrey 
Solomon became the studio's "greatest asset" alongside CinemaScope.[132] 
Monroe's position as a leading sex symbol was confirmed in December, when 
Hugh Hefner featured her on the cover and as centerfold in the first issue 
of Playboy.[133] The cover image was a shot of her at the Miss America 
Pageant parade in 1952, and the centerfold featured one of her 1949 nude 
photographs.[133] Although Monroe had become one of 20th Century-Fox's 
biggest stars, her contract had not changed since 1950, meaning that she 
was paid far less than other stars of her stature and could not choose 
her projects or co-workers.[134] She was also tired of being typecast, 
and her attempts to appear in films other than comedies or musicals had 
been thwarted by Zanuck, who had a strong personal dislike of her and did 
not think she would earn the studio as much revenue in dramas.[135] When 
she refused to begin shooting yet another musical comedy, a film version 
of The Girl in Pink Tights, which was to co-star Frank Sinatra, the studio 
suspended her on January 4, 1954.[136] The suspension was front page news 
and Monroe immediately began a publicity campaign to counter any negative 
press and to strengthen her position in the conflict. On January 14, she 
and Joe DiMaggio, whose relationship had been subject to constant media 
attention since 1952, were married at the San Francisco City Hall.[137] 
They then traveled to Japan, combining a honeymoon with his business trip.[138] 
From there, she traveled alone to Korea, where she performed songs from 
her films as part of a USO show for over 60,000 U.S. Marines over a four-day 
period.[139] After returning to Hollywood in February, she was awarded 
Photoplay's "Most Popular Female Star" prize.[140] She reached a settlement 
with the studio in March: it included a new contract to be made later in 
the year, and a starring role in the film version of the Broadway play 
The Seven Year Itch, for which she was to receive a bonus of $100,000.[141] 
The following month saw the release of Otto Preminger's Western River of 
No Return, in which Monroe appeared opposite Robert Mitchum. She called 
it a "Z-grade cowboy movie in which the acting finished second to the scenery 
and the CinemaScope process", although it was popular with audiences.[142] 
The first film she made after returning to Fox was the musical There's 
No Business Like Show Business, which she strongly disliked but the studio 
required her to do in exchange for dropping The Girl in Pink Tights.[141] 
The musical was unsuccessful upon its release in December, and Monroe's 
performance was considered vulgar by many critics.[143] In September 1954, 
Monroe began filming Billy Wilder's comedy The Seven Year Itch, in which 
she starred opposite Tom Ewell as a woman who becomes the object of her 
married neighbor's sexual fantasies. Although the film was shot in Hollywood, 
the studio decided to generate advance publicity by staging the filming 
of one scene on Lexington Avenue in New York.[144] In it, Monroe is standing 
on a subway grate with the air blowing up the skirt of her white dress, 
which became one of the most famous scenes of her career. The shoot lasted 
for several hours and attracted a crowd of nearly 2,000 spectators, including 
professional photographers.[144] While the publicity stunt placed Monroe 
on front pages all over the world, it also marked the end of her marriage 
to DiMaggio, who was furious about it.[145] The union had been troubled 
from the start by his jealousy and controlling attitude; Spoto and Banner 
have also asserted that he was physically abusive.[146] After returning 
to Hollywood, Monroe hired famous attorney Jerry Giesler and announced 
in October 1954 that she was filing for divorce.[147] The Seven Year Itch 
was released the following June, and grossed over $4.5 million at the box 
office, making it one of the biggest commercial successes that year.[148] 
After filming for Itch wrapped in November, Monroe began a new battle for 
control over her career and left Hollywood for the East Coast, where she 
and photographer Milton Greene founded their own production company, Marilyn 
Monroe Productions (MMP)  – an action that has later been called "instrumental" 
in the collapse of the studio system.[149][e] Announcing its foundation 
in a press conference in January 1955, Monroe stated that she was "tired 
of the same old sex roles. I want to do better things. People have scope, 
you know."[151] She asserted that she was no longer under contract to Fox, 
as the studio had not fulfilled its duties, such as paying her the promised 
bonus for The Seven Year Itch.[152] This began a year-long legal battle 
between her and the studio.[153] The press largely ridiculed Monroe for 
her actions and she was parodied in Itch writer George Axelrod's Will Success 
Spoil Rock Hunter? (1955), in which her lookalike Jayne Mansfield played 
a dumb actress who starts her own production company.[154] Monroe dedicated 
1955 to studying her craft. She moved to New York and began taking acting 
classes with Constance Collier and attending workshops on method acting 
at the Actors Studio, run by Lee Strasberg.[155] She sometimes jotted down 
private notes to herself of what she learned on a given day, acknowledging 
that Strasberg's observations about her in particular were important: Why 
did it mean so much to me?... Strasberg makes me feel badly [that I was 
acting out of "fear"]... You must start to do things out of strength... 
by not looking for strength, but only looking and seeking technical ways 
and means.[156][157] She grew close to Strasberg and his wife Paula, receiving 
private lessons at their home due to her shyness, and soon became like 
a family member.[158] She dismissed her old drama coach, Natasha Lytess, 
and replaced her with Paula; the Strasbergs remained an important influence 
for the rest of her career.[159] Monroe also started undergoing psychoanalysis 
at the recommendation of Strasberg, who believed that an actor must confront 
their emotional traumas and use them in their performances.[160][f] In 
her private life, Monroe continued her relationship with DiMaggio despite 
the ongoing divorce proceedings while also dating actor Marlon Brando and 
playwright Arthur Miller.[162] She had first been introduced to Miller 
by Kazan in the early 1950s.[162] The affair between Monroe and Miller 
became increasingly serious after October 1955, when her divorce from DiMaggio 
was finalized, and Miller separated from his wife.[163] The FBI also opened 
a file on her.[163] The studio feared that Monroe would be blacklisted 
and urged her to end the affair, as Miller was being investigated by the 
FBI for allegations of communism and had been subpoenaed by the House Un-American 
Activities Committee.[164][165] Despite the risk to her career, Monroe 
refused to end the relationship, later calling the studio heads "born cowards".[166] 
By the end of the year, Monroe and Fox had come to an agreement about a 
new seven-year contract. It was clear that MMP would not be able to finance 
films alone, and the studio was eager to have Monroe working again.[153] 
The contract required her to make four movies for Fox during the seven 
years.[167] The studio would pay her $100,000 for each movie, and granted 
her the right to choose her own projects, directors and cinematographers.[167] 
She would also be free to make one film with MMP per each completed film 
for Fox.[167] Monroe began 1956 by announcing her win over 20th Century-Fox; 
the press, which had previously derided her, now wrote favorably about 
her decision to fight the studio.[168] Time called her a "shrewd businesswoman"[169] 
and Look predicted that the win would be "an example of the individual 
against the herd for years to come".[168] She also officially changed her 
name to Marilyn Monroe in March.[170] Her relationship with Miller prompted 
some negative comments from the press, including Walter Winchell's statement 
that "America's best-known blonde moving picture star is now the darling 
of the left-wing intelligentsia."[171] Monroe and Miller were married at 
the Westchester County Court in White Plains, New York on June 29, and 
two days later had a Jewish ceremony at his agent's house at Waccabuc, 
New York.[172][173] Monroe converted to Judaism with the marriage, which 
led Egypt to ban all of her films.[174][g] The media saw the union as mismatched 
given her star image as a sex symbol and his position as an intellectual, 
as demonstrated by Variety's headline "Egghead Weds Hourglass".[176] The 
first film that Monroe chose to make under the new contract was the drama 
Bus Stop, released in August 1956. She played Chérie, a saloon singer whose 
dreams of stardom are complicated by a naïve cowboy who falls in love with 
her. For the role, she learnt an Ozark accent, chose costumes and make-up 
that lacked the glamour of her earlier films, and provided deliberately 
mediocre singing and dancing.[177] Broadway director Joshua Logan agreed 
to direct, despite initially doubting her acting abilities and knowing 
of her reputation for being difficult.[178] The filming took place in Idaho 
and Arizona in early 1956, with Monroe "technically in charge" as the head 
of MMP, occasionally making decisions on cinematography and with Logan 
adapting to her chronic lateness and perfectionism.[179] The experience 
changed Logan's opinion of Monroe, and he later compared her to Charlie 
Chaplin in her ability to blend comedy and tragedy.[180] Bus Stop became 
a box office success, grossing $4.25 million, and received mainly favorable 
reviews.[181] The Saturday Review of Literature wrote that Monroe's performance 
"effectively dispels once and for all the notion that she is merely a glamour 
personality" and Crowther proclaimed: "Hold on to your chairs, everybody, 
and get set for a rattling surprise. Marilyn Monroe has finally proved 
herself an actress."[182] She received a Golden Globe for Best Actress 
nomination for her performance.[91] In August 1956, Monroe began filming 
MMP's first independent production, The Prince and the Showgirl, at Pinewood 
Studios in England.[183] It was based on Terence Rattigan's The Sleeping 
Prince, a play about an affair between a showgirl and a prince in the 1910s. 
The main roles had first been played on stage by Laurence Olivier and Vivien 
Leigh; he reprised his role and directed and co-produced the film.[169] 
The production was complicated by conflicts between him and Monroe.[184] 
He angered her with the patronizing statement "All you have to do is be 
sexy", and by wanting her to replicate Leigh's interpretation.[185] He 
also disliked the constant presence of Paula Strasberg, Monroe's acting 
coach, on set.[186] In retaliation to what she considered Olivier's "condescending" 
behavior, Monroe started arriving late and became uncooperative, stating 
later that "if you don't respect your artists, they can't work well."[184] 
Her drug use increased and, according to Spoto, she became pregnant and 
miscarried during the production.[187] She also had arguments with Greene 
over how MMP should be run, including whether Miller should join the company.[187] 
Despite the difficulties, the film was completed on schedule by the end 
of the year.[188] It was released in June 1957 to mixed reviews, and proved 
unpopular with American audiences.[189] It was better received in Europe, 
where she was awarded the Italian David di Donatello and the French Crystal 
Star awards, and was nominated for a BAFTA.[190] After returning to the 
United States, Monroe took an 18-month hiatus from work to concentrate 
on married life on the East Coast. She and Miller split their time between 
their apartment in New York and an eighteenth-century farmhouse they purchased 
in Roxbury, Connecticut, and spent the summer in Amagansett, Long Island.[191] 
She became pregnant in mid-1957, but it was ectopic and had to be terminated.[192] 
She suffered a miscarriage a year later.[193] Her gynecological problems 
were largely caused by endometriosis, a disease from which she suffered 
throughout her adult life.[194][h] Monroe was also briefly hospitalized 
during this time due to a barbiturate overdose.[197] During the hiatus, 
she dismissed Greene from MMP and bought his share of the company as they 
could not settle their disagreements and she had begun to suspect that 
he was embezzling money from the company.[198] Monroe returned to Hollywood 
in July 1958 to act opposite Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis in Billy Wilder's 
comedy on gender roles, Some Like It Hot.[199] Although she considered 
the role of Sugar Kane another "dumb blonde", she accepted it due to Miller's 
encouragement and the offer of receiving ten percent of the film's profits 
in addition to her standard pay.[200] The difficulties of the film's production 
have since become "legendary".[201] Monroe would demand dozens of re-takes, 
and could not remember her lines or act as directed – Curtis famously stated 
that kissing her was "like kissing Hitler" due to the number of re-takes.[202] 
Monroe herself privately likened the production to a sinking ship and commented 
on her co-stars and director saying "[but] why should I worry, I have no 
phallic symbol to lose."[203] Many of the problems stemmed from a conflict 
between her and Wilder, who also had a reputation for being difficult, 
on how she should play the character.[204] Monroe made Wilder angry by 
asking him to alter many of her scenes, which in turn made her stage fright 
worse, and it is suggested that she deliberately ruined several scenes 
to act them her way.[204] In the end, Wilder was happy with Monroe's performance, 
stating: "Anyone can remember lines, but it takes a real artist to come 
on the set and not know her lines and yet give the performance she did!"[205] 
Despite the difficulties of its production, when Some Like It Hot was released 
in March 1959, it became a critical and commercial success.[206] Monroe's 
performance earned her a Golden Globe for Best Actress, and prompted Variety 
to call her "a comedienne with that combination of sex appeal and timing 
that just can't be beat".[190][207] It has been voted one of the best films 
ever made in polls by the American Film Institute and Sight & Sound.[208][209] 
After Some Like It Hot, Monroe took another hiatus until late 1959, when 
she returned to Hollywood to star in the musical comedy Let's Make Love, 
about an actress and a millionaire who fall in love when performing in 
a satirical play.[210] She chose George Cukor to direct and Miller re-wrote 
portions of the script, which she considered weak; she accepted the part 
solely because she was behind on her contract with Fox, having only made 
one of four promised films.[211] Its production was delayed by her frequent 
absences from set.[210] She had an affair with Yves Montand, her co-star, 
which was widely reported by the press and used in the film's publicity 
campaign.[212] Let's Make Love was unsuccessful upon its release in September 
1960;[213] Crowther described Monroe as appearing "rather untidy" and "lacking 
... the old Monroe dynamism",[214] and Hedda Hopper called the film "the 
most vulgar picture she's ever done".[215] Truman Capote lobbied for her 
to play Holly Golightly in a film adaptation of Breakfast at Tiffany's, 
but the role went to Audrey Hepburn as its producers feared that Monroe 
would complicate the production.[216] The last film that Monroe completed 
was John Huston's The Misfits, which Miller had written to provide her 
with a dramatic role.[217] She played Roslyn, a recently divorced woman 
who becomes friends with three aging cowboys, played by Clark Gable, Eli 
Wallach and Montgomery Clift. Its filming in the Nevada desert between 
July and November 1960 was again difficult.[218] Monroe and Miller's four-year 
marriage was effectively over, and he began a new relationship.[217] Monroe 
disliked that he had based her role partly on her life, and thought it 
inferior to the male roles; she also struggled with Miller's habit of re-writing 
scenes the night before filming.[219] Her health was also failing: she 
was in pain from gallstones, and her drug addiction was so severe that 
her make-up usually had to be applied while she was still asleep under 
the influence of barbiturates.[220] In August, filming was halted for her 
to spend a week detoxing in a Los Angeles hospital.[220] Despite her problems, 
Huston stated that when Monroe was playing Roslyn, she "was not pretending 
to an emotion. It was the real thing. She would go deep down within herself 
and find it and bring it up into consciousness."[221] Monroe and Miller 
separated after filming wrapped, and she was granted a quick divorce in 
Mexico in January 1961.[222] The Misfits was released the following month, 
failing at the box office.[223] Its reviews were mixed,[223] with Variety 
complaining of frequently "choppy" character development,[224] and Bosley 
Crowther calling Monroe "completely blank and unfathomable" and stating 
that "unfortunately for the film's structure, everything turns upon her".[225] 
Despite the film's initial failure, it has received more favorable reviews 
from critics and film scholars in the twenty-first century. Geoff Andrew 
of the British Film Institute has called it a classic,[226] Huston scholar 
Tony Tracy has described Monroe's performance the "most mature interpretation 
of her career",[227] and Geoffrey McNab of The Independent has praised 
her for being "extraordinary" in portraying Roslyn.[228] Monroe was next 
to star in a television adaptation of W. Somerset Maugham's short story 
Rain for NBC, but the project fell through as the network did not want 
to hire her choice of director, Lee Strasberg.[229] Instead of working, 
she spent the first six months of 1961 preoccupied by health problems, 
undergoing surgery for her endometriosis and a cholecystectomy, and spending 
four weeks in hospital care – including a brief stint in a mental ward 
– for depression.[230][i] She was helped by her ex-husband Joe DiMaggio, 
with whom she now rekindled a friendship.[232] In spring 1961, Monroe also 
moved back to California after six years on the East Coast.[233] She dated 
Frank Sinatra for several months, and in early 1962 purchased a house in 
Brentwood, Los Angeles.[233] Monroe returned to the public eye in spring 
1962: she received a "World Film Favorite" Golden Globe award and began 
to shoot a new film for 20th Century-Fox, Something's Got to Give, a re-make 
of My Favorite Wife (1940).[234] It was to be co-produced by MMP, directed 
by George Cukor and to co-star Dean Martin and Cyd Charisse.[235] Days 
before filming began, Monroe caught sinusitis; despite medical advice to 
postpone the production, Fox began it as planned in late April.[236] Monroe 
was too ill to work for the majority of the next six weeks, but despite 
confirmations by multiple doctors, the studio tried to put pressure on 
her by alleging publicly that she was faking it.[236] On May 19, she took 
a break to sing "Happy Birthday" on stage at President John F. Kennedy's 
birthday celebration at Madison Square Garden in New York.[237] She drew 
attention with her costume: a beige, skintight dress covered in rhinestones, 
which made her appear nude.[237][j] Monroe's trip to New York caused even 
more irritation for Fox executives, who had wanted her to cancel it.[239] 
Monroe next filmed a scene for Something's Got to Give in which she swam 
naked in a swimming pool.[240] To generate advance publicity, the press 
were invited to take photographs of the scene, which were later published 
in Life; this was the first time that a major star had posed nude while 
at the height of their career.[241] When she was again on sick leave for 
several days, Fox decided that it could not afford to have another film 
running behind schedule when it was already struggling to cover the rising 
costs of Cleopatra (1963).[242] On June 7, Monroe was fired and sued for 
$750,000 in damages.[243] She was replaced by Lee Remick, but after Martin 
refused to make the film with anyone other than Monroe, Fox sued him as 
well and shut down the production.[244] The studio blamed Monroe for the 
film's demise and began spreading negative publicity about her, even alleging 
that she was mentally disturbed.[243] Fox soon regretted its decision, 
and re-opened negotiations with Monroe later in June; a settlement about 
a new contract, including re-commencing Something's Got to Give and a starring 
role in the black comedy What a Way to Go! (1964), was reached later that 
summer.[245] To repair her public image, Monroe engaged in several publicity 
ventures, including interviews for Life and Cosmopolitan and her first 
photo shoot for Vogue.[246] For Vogue, she and photographer Bert Stern 
collaborated for two series of photographs, one a standard fashion editorial 
and another of her posing nude, which were both later published posthumously 
with the title The Last Sitting.[247] In the last weeks of her life, she 
was also planning on starring in a biopic of Jean Harlow.[248] Monroe was 
found dead in the bedroom of her Brentwood home by her psychiatrist, Dr. 
Ralph Greenson, in the early morning hours of August 5, 1962. Greenson 
had been called there by her housekeeper Eunice Murray, who was staying 
overnight and had awoken at 3:00 a.m. "sensing that something was wrong". 
Murray had seen light from under Monroe's bedroom door, but had not been 
able to get a response and found the door locked.[249] The death was officially 
confirmed by Monroe's physician, Dr. Hyman Engelberg, who arrived at the 
house at around 3:50 a.m.[249] At 4:25 a.m., they notified the Los Angeles 
Police Department.[249] The Los Angeles County Coroners Office was assisted 
in their investigation by experts from the Los Angeles Suicide Prevention 
Team.[250] It was estimated that Monroe had died between 8:30 and 10:30 p.m.,[251] 
and the toxicological analysis concluded that the cause of death was acute 
barbiturate poisoning, as she had 8 mg% of chloral hydrate and 4.5 mg% 
of pentobarbital (Nembutal) in her blood, and a further 13 mg% of pentobarbital 
in her liver.[252] Empty bottles containing these medicines were found 
next to her bed.[250] The possibility of Monroe having accidentally overdosed 
was ruled out as the dosages found in her body were several times over 
the lethal limit.[253] Her doctors and psychiatrists stated that she had 
been prone to "severe fears and frequent depressions" with "abrupt and 
unpredictable" mood changes, and had overdosed several times in the past, 
possibly intentionally.[253][254] Due to these facts and the lack of any 
indication of foul play, her death was classified a probable suicide.[255] 
Monroe's unexpected death was front-page news in the United States and 
Europe.[256] According to Lois Banner, "it's said that the suicide rate 
in Los Angeles doubled the month after she died; the circulation rate of 
most newspapers expanded that month",[256] and the Chicago Tribune reported 
that they had received hundreds of phone calls from members of the public 
requesting information about her death.[257] French artist Jean Cocteau 
commented that her death "should serve as a terrible lesson to all those, 
whose chief occupation consists of spying on and tormenting film stars", 
her former co-star Laurence Olivier deemed her "the complete victim of 
ballyhoo and sensation", and Bus Stop director Joshua Logan stated that 
she was "one of the most unappreciated people in the world".[258] Her funeral, 
held at the Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery on August 8, was private 
and attended by only her closest associates.[259] It was arranged by Joe 
DiMaggio and her business manager Inez Melson.[259] Hundreds of spectators 
crowded the streets around the cemetery.[259] Monroe was later interred 
at crypt No. 24 at the Corridor of Memories.[260] Several conspiracy theories 
about Monroe's death have been proposed in the decades afterwards, including 
murder and accidental overdose.[261] The murder speculations first gained 
mainstream attention with the publication of Norman Mailer's Marilyn: A 
Biography in 1973, and in the following years became widespread enough 
for the Los Angeles County District Attorney John Van de Kamp to conduct 
a "threshold investigation" in 1982 to see whether a criminal investigation 
should be opened.[262] No evidence of foul play was found.[263] "I never 
quite understood it, this sex symbol. I always thought symbols were those 
things you clash together! That's the trouble, a sex symbol becomes a thing. 
I just hate to be a thing. But if I'm going to be a symbol of something 
I'd rather have it sex than some other things they've got symbols of."[264] 
When beginning to develop her star image, 20th Century-Fox wanted Monroe 
to replace the aging Betty Grable, their most popular "blonde bombshell" 
of the 1940s.[265] While the 1940s had been the heyday of actresses perceived 
as tough and smart, such as Katharine Hepburn and Barbara Stanwyck, who 
appealed to women-dominated audiences, the studio wanted Monroe to be a 
star of the new decade that would draw men to movie theaters.[265] She 
played a significant part in the creation of her public image from the 
beginning, and towards the end of her career exerted almost full control 
over it.[266][267] Monroe devised many of her publicity strategies, cultivated 
friendships with gossip columnists such as Sidney Skolsky and Louella Parsons, 
and controlled the use of her images.[268] Besides Grable, she was often 
compared to another iconic blonde, 1930s film star Jean Harlow.[269] The 
comparison was partly prompted by Monroe, who named Harlow as her childhood 
idol, wanted to play her in a biopic, and even employed Harlow's hair stylist 
to color her hair.[270] Monroe's screen persona centered on her blond hair, 
and the stereotypes associated with it, especially dumbness, naïveté, sexual 
availability and artificiality.[271] She often used a breathy, childish 
voice in her films, and in interviews gave the impression that everything 
she said was "utterly innocent and uncalculated", parodying herself with 
double entendres that came to be known as "Monroeisms".[272] For example, 
when she was asked what she had on in the 1949 nude photo shoot, she replied, 
"I had the radio on".[273] Having begun her career as a pin-up model, Monroe's 
hourglass figure was one of her most often noted features.[274] Film scholar 
Richard Dyer has written that Monroe was often positioned so that her curvy 
silhouette was on display, and in her publicity photos often posed like 
a pin-up.[274] Her distinctive, hip-swinging walk also drew attention to 
her body, earning her the nickname "the girl with the horizontal walk".[106] 
Clothing played an important part in Monroe's star image. She often wore 
white to emphasize her blondness, and drew attention by wearing revealing 
outfits that showed off her figure.[275] Her publicity stunts often revolved 
around her clothing exposing large amounts of her body or even malfunctioning, 
such as when one of the shoulder straps of her dress suddenly snapped during 
a press conference.[276] In press stories, Monroe was portrayed as the 
embodiment of the American Dream, as a girl who had risen from a miserable 
childhood to Hollywood stardom.[277] Stories of her time spent in foster 
families and an orphanage were exaggerated and even partly fabricated in 
her studio biographies.[278] Although Monroe's screen persona as a dim-witted 
but sexually attractive blonde was a carefully crafted act, audiences and 
film critics believed it to be her real personality and that she was not 
acting in her comedies. This became an obstacle in her later career, when 
she wanted to change her public image and pursue other kinds of roles, 
or to be respected as a businesswoman.[279] Academic Sarah Churchwell, 
who has studied narratives about Monroe, has stated: The biggest myth is 
that she was dumb. The second is that she was fragile. The third is that 
she couldn't act. She was far from dumb, although she was not formally 
educated, and she was very sensitive about that. But she was very smart 
indeed – and very tough. She had to be both to beat the Hollywood studio 
system in the 1950s. [...] The dumb blonde was a role – she was an actress, 
for heaven's sake! Such a good actress that no one now believes she was 
anything but what she portrayed on screen.[280] Lois Banner has written 
that she often subtly parodied her status as a sex symbol in her films 
and public appearances.[281] Monroe stated that she was influenced by Mae 
West, saying that she "learned a few tricks from her – that impression 
of laughing at, or mocking, her own sexuality".[282] In the 1950s, she 
also studied comedy in classes given by mime and dancer Lotte Goslar, famous 
for her comic stage performances, and had her accompany her on film sets 
to instruct her.[283] In Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, one of the films in 
which she played an archetypal dumb blonde, Monroe had the sentence "I 
can be smart when it's important, but most men don't like it" added to 
her character's lines in the script.[284] Dyer has stated Monroe's star 
image was created mainly for the male gaze and that she usually played 
"the girl", who is defined solely by her gender, in her films.[285] Her 
roles were almost always chorus girls, secretaries, or models; occupations 
where "the woman is on show, there for the pleasure of men."[285] Film 
scholar Thomas Harris, who analyzed Monroe's public image in 1957, wrote 
that her working class roots and lack of family made her appear more sexually 
available, "the ideal playmate", in contrast to her contemporary Grace 
Kelly, who was also marketed as an attractive blonde, but due to her upper-class 
background came to be seen as a sophisticated actress, unattainable for 
the majority of male viewers.[286] According to Dyer, Monroe became "virtually 
a household name for sex" in the 1950s and "her image has to be situated 
in the flux of ideas about morality and sexuality that characterised the 
fifties in America", such as Freudian ideas about sex, the Kinsey report 
(1953), and Betty Friedan's The Feminine Mystique (1963).[287] By appearing 
vulnerable and unaware of her sex appeal, Monroe was the first sex symbol 
to present sex as natural and without danger, in contrast to the 1940s 
femme fatales.[288] Spoto likewise describes her as the embodiment of "the 
postwar ideal of the American girl, soft, transparently needy, worshipful 
of men, naïve, offering sex without demands", which is echoed in Molly 
Haskell's statement that "she was the fifties fiction, the lie that a woman 
had no sexual needs, that she is there to cater to, or enhance, a man's 
needs."[289] Monroe's contemporary Norman Mailer wrote that "Marilyn suggested 
sex might be difficult and dangerous with others, but ice cream with her", 
while Groucho Marx characterized her as "Mae West, Theda Bara, and Bo Peep 
all rolled into one".[290] According to Haskell, due to her status as a 
sex symbol, Monroe was less popular with women than with men, as they "couldn't 
identify with her and didn't support her", although this would change after 
her death.[291] Dyer has also argued that platinum blonde hair became such 
a defining feature of Monroe because it made her "racially unambiguous" 
and exclusively white just as the Civil Rights Movement was beginning, 
and that she should be seen as emblematic of racism in twentieth-century 
popular culture.[292] Banner agrees that it may not be a coincidence that 
Monroe launched a trend of platinum blonde actresses during the Civil Rights 
Movement, but has also criticized Dyer, pointing out that in her highly 
publicized private life Monroe associated with people who were seen as 
"white ethnics", such as Joe DiMaggio (Italian-American) and Arthur Miller 
(Jewish).[293] According to Banner, she sometimes challenged prevailing 
racial norms in her publicity photographs; for example, in an image featured 
in Look in 1951, she was shown in revealing clothes while practicing with 
African-American singing coach Phil Moore.[294] Monroe was perceived as 
a specifically American star, "a national institution as well known as 
hot dogs, apple pie, or baseball" according to Photoplay.[295] Banner calls 
her the symbol of populuxe, a star whose joyful and glamorous public image 
"helped the nation cope with its paranoia in the 1950s about the Cold War, 
the atom bomb, and the totalitarian communist Soviet Union".[296] Historian 
Fiona Handyside writes that the French female audiences associated whiteness/blondness 
with American modernity and cleanliness, and so Monroe came to symbolize 
a modern, "liberated" woman whose life takes place in the public sphere.[297] 
Film historian Laura Mulvey has written of her as an endorsement for American 
consumer culture: If America was to export the democracy of glamour into 
post-war, impoverished Europe, the movies could be its shop window ... 
Marilyn Monroe, with her all American attributes and streamlined sexuality, 
came to epitomise in a single image this complex interface of the economic, 
the political, and the erotic. By the mid 1950s, she stood for a brand 
of classless glamour, available to anyone using American cosmetics, nylons 
and peroxide.[298] To profit from Monroe's popularity, 20th Century-Fox 
cultivated several lookalike actresses, including Jayne Mansfield and Sheree 
North.[299] Other studios also attempted to create their own Monroes: Universal 
Pictures with Mamie Van Doren,[300] Columbia Pictures with Kim Novak,[301] 
and Rank Organisation with Diana Dors.[302] According to The Guide to United 
States Popular Culture, "as an icon of American popular culture, Monroe's 
few rivals in popularity include Elvis Presley and Mickey Mouse ... no 
other star has ever inspired such a wide range of emotions – from lust 
to pity, from envy to remorse."[303] Art historian Gail Levin has stated 
that Monroe may have been "the most photographed person of the 20th century",[304] 
and The American Film Institute has named her the sixth greatest female 
screen legend in American film history. The Smithsonian Institution has 
included her on their list of "100 Most Significant Americans of All Time",[305] 
and both Variety and VH1 have placed her in the top ten in their rankings 
of the greatest popular culture icons of the twentieth century.[306][307] 
Hundreds of books have been written about Monroe, she has been the subject 
of films, plays, operas, and songs, and has influenced artists and entertainers 
such as Andy Warhol and Madonna.[308][309] She also remains a valuable 
brand:[310] her image and name have been licensed for hundreds of products, 
and she has been featured in advertising for multinational corporations 
and brands such as Max Factor, Chanel, Mercedes-Benz, and Absolut Vodka.[311][312] 
Monroe's enduring popularity is linked to her conflicted public image.[313] 
On the one hand, she remains a sex symbol, beauty icon and one of the most 
famous stars of classical Hollywood cinema.[314][315][316] On the other, 
she is also remembered for her troubled private life, unstable childhood, 
struggle for professional respect, and her death and the conspiracy theories 
surrounding it.[317] She has been written about by scholars and journalists 
interested in gender and feminism,[318] such as Gloria Steinem, Jacqueline 
Rose,[319] Molly Haskell,[320] Sarah Churchwell,[312] and Lois Banner.[321] 
Some, such as Steinem, have viewed her as a victim of the studio system.[318][322] 
Others, such as Haskell,[323] Rose,[319] and Churchwell,[312] have instead 
stressed Monroe's proactive role in her career and her participation in 
the creation of her public persona. Due to the contrast between her stardom 
and troubled private life, Monroe is closely linked to broader discussions 
about modern phenomena such as mass media, fame, and consumer culture.[324] 
According to academic Susanne Hamscha, because of her continued relevance 
to ongoing discussions about modern society, Monroe is "never completely 
situated in one time or place" but has become "a surface on which narratives 
of American culture can be (re-)constructed", and "functions as a cultural 
type that can be reproduced, transformed, translated into new contexts, 
and enacted by other people".[324] Similarly, Banner has called Monroe 
the "eternal shapeshifter" who is re-created by "each generation, even
