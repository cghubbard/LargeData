Freehold Township is a township in Monmouth County, New Jersey, United 
States. As of the 2010 United States Census, the township's population 
was 36,184,[9][10][11] reflecting an increase of 4,647 (+14.7%) from the 
31,537 counted in the 2000 Census, which had in turn increased by 6,827 
(+27.6%) from the 24,710 counted in the 1990 Census.[20] Freehold Township 
was first formed on October 31, 1693, and was incorporated as a township 
by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on February 21, 1798. Portions 
of Freehold Township were taken to form Upper Freehold Township (c. 1731), 
so some wills and official records following the split referred to "Lower 
Freehold Township" although the official name has always been Freehold 
Township.[21][22] Additional portions formed Millstone Township (February 
28, 1844), Jackson Township (March 6, 1844), Atlantic Township (February 
18, 1847; now Colts Neck Township), Marlboro Township (February 17, 1848) 
and Manalapan Township (March 9, 1848). Freehold town was formed within 
the township on March 25, 1869, and formally separated when it was reconstituted 
as a borough on April 15, 1919, including additional portions of the township.[23] 
The Battle of Monmouth was fought in June 1778 in what has been preserved 
as Monmouth Battlefield State Park, which is in Freehold Township and Manalapan 
Township.[24] The Lenni Lenape were the earliest known people to live in 
the area that became Freehold.[25] The Lenape were a hunter-gatherer society. 
They were largely sedentary, changing campsites seasonally. They were prolific 
hunters of small game and birds. They were also skilled fisherman, and 
were known to harvest vast amounts of clams from the bays and inlets on 
the Jersey Shore. They also practiced some agriculture to augment their 
food supply. During this time, an important crossroad of two major Lenape 
trails was located in the area of Freehold.[26] In 1498, John Cabot became 
the first European to sight this land.[25] The Dutch were the first to 
settle and develop the area. By the 17th Century, the English had taken 
over the area. In 1664, the Duke of York (later James II & VII) granted 
a patent to Sir George Carteret to develop the area. In 1685, Scottish 
immigrants, fleeing religious persecution at home, became the first to 
settle the area.[25] In 1693, Along with Middletown and Shrewsbury, Freehold 
was established by act of legislature as one of the three original towns 
in Monmouth County.[27] The name of the township comes from the word Freehold, 
an English legal term describing fee simple property ownership.[28] In 
1714, when the colonial government was deciding where to locate the county 
seat and courthouse, Freeholder John Reid, the first Surveyor General of 
East Jersey, wanted the county seat located in Freehold. Reid sold the 
property to the Board of Chosen Freeholders at a bargain price, and this 
may have been the deciding factor why Freehold was selected over Middletown 
and Shrewsbury. In return for the heavily discounted price, Reid placed 
a restrictive covenant in the deed that, should the property ever cease 
being used as a courthouse, ownership would revert to the Reid family. 
Direct descendants of John Reid still reside in Freehold Township.[29] 
Freehold was officially designated as the seat of the Monmouth County government, 
and a court house was commissioned to be built on the land purchased from 
John Reid. The Monmouth Courthouse opened in 1715.[30] A small village 
quickly began to develop around the courthouse. At first, the village was 
called Monmouth Courthouse. Overtime, other government buildings opened 
near the courthouse, including a sheriff's office, a prison, and a post 
office. A number of homes and commercial businesses also sprang up in the 
village, including a blacksmith, a general store, a bank, a hotel, and 
saloon.[31] In the area surrounding Monmouth Courthouse, many successful 
farms began to appear. The farms in Freehold were particularly well known 
for the production of potatoes, beans, and rye, which were sold in the 
markets of nearby cities. Freehold also became known for its excellent 
horse farms.[26] The differences within Freehold between the growing village 
around the courthouse and the surrounding farmland were the seeds for the 
eventually division of Freehold into two separate municipalities in the 
early 20th century. As of 1745, the majority of families in Freehold were 
still Scottish immigrants.[32] In modern Freehold today, many important 
streets bear the name of early colonial families, including Barkalow, Applegate, 
Rhea, Throckmorton, and Schanck.[32] Freehold was deeply impacted by the 
American Revolution. By the early 1770s, the Sons of Liberty were actively 
recruiting local members in Freehold, and were agitating the relationship 
between the British government and the colonists.[33] In 1775, immediately 
after the Battles of Lexington and Concord, Capt. Elias Longstreet recruited 
the first company of Freeholders to join the Continental Army.[34] Freehold 
was a known center of patriot activity. The Declaration of Independence 
was publicly proclaimed, read aloud, from the steps of the Monmouth Courthouse 
just a few days after being signed in Philadelphia.[32] However, after 
British success at the Battle of Long Island, Freehold and all of Monmouth 
County fell under the control of Loyalists.[35] The British government 
continued to operate the Monmouth Courthouse, and several people involved 
in revolutionary activities were arrested and tried for treason at the 
courthouse.[35] The success of the Continental Army at the Battle of Trenton 
helped to weaken loyalist control of Freehold.[36] In June 1778, the British 
Army began a major strategic evacuation of the city of Philadelphia. They 
attempted to protect a long, slow moving column of loyalist families, equipment, 
and other supplies seized in Philadelphia, as they moved towards ships 
in New York Harbor. On June 28, 1778, the Continental Army intercepted 
the column in Freehold.[37] The Battle of Monmouth was one of the largest 
battles of the Revolutionary War, involving over 25,000 soldiers combined 
in Continental, British, and Hessian forces. The Continental Army was able 
to repel the British forces, and held their ground on the battlefield. 
However, British forces were successful in completing their primary goal, 
the evacuation of Philadelphia. Both sides claimed victory in the battle.[37] 
Several famous figures from the Revolutionary War fought at the Battle 
of Monmouth. British forces were commanded by Sir Henry Clinton and Charles 
Cornwallis. The Continental Army was commanded by George Washington and 
Charles Lee. Charles Lee was later court martialed by the Continental Army 
for his actions at the Battle of Monmouth. Nathanael Greene, Alexander 
Hamilton, "Mad" Anthony Wayne, the Marquis de Lafayette and Friedrich Wilhelm 
von Steuben also fought at the Battle of Monmouth for the Continental Army.[38] 
Another famous figure at the Battle of Monmouth was Molly Pitcher, who 
manned a cannon during the battle after her husband was wounded.[38] In 
the aftermath of the Battle of Monmouth, Loyalist control of Freehold faltered. 
The town ceased to have a functioning municipal government, and the courthouse 
was closed until the end of the war. Minor clashes between loyalists and 
continentals flared up in town, with the violence peaking around 1780.[39] 
Colonel Tye, was an escaped slave formerly named Titus, and the leader 
of a prominent loyalist guerilla force, which conducted several raids in 
and around Freehold. In one famous incident Joshua Huddy was captured and 
hung by British Loyalists under the direction of Richard Lippincott and 
Colonel Tye. Colonel Tye later died from injuries sustained during that 
raid.[40] Patriots later cut down Huddy's body hanging from the gallows 
and buried it in Freehold, at Old Tennent Church.[41] At the end of the 
war, the community was deeply divided, and nearly 120 loyalist families 
left Freehold, fearing persecution from their neighbors. Most of these 
families re-settled in Canada.[42] During the early 1800s, Freehold steadily 
grew in size. The village around the courthouse was now called Freehold, 
along with the surrounding farmland.[43] In 1852, when long distance railroad 
systems were first being developed, a railroad station, with trains making 
regular stops, was built near the courthouse in Freehold. Freehold soon 
had public sewers in the village and in some of the outlying farmland. 
By 1883, there was an electrical grid and a telephone switchboard, at a 
time when these inventions were still brand new.[43] These public advancements 
caused rapid economic growth in Freehold. The village of Freehold became 
an important commercial and industrial hub in central New Jersey. The farms 
in the rest of Freehold benefitted greatly by being able to sell their 
products more easily in New York and Philadelphia.[44] Both the village 
and the farms prospered together, however the public policies sought by 
the two different communities continued to grow further apart. The municipal 
government was increasingly divided between the villagers and farmers. 
In 1824, the American Hotel opened on Main Street in Freehold. It is still 
standing today, and is one of the oldest buildings in Freehold. In 1853, 
the Freehold Raceway opened. Though the original grandstand burned down 
in a fire, the racetrack is still open today, and is one of the oldest 
harness racetracks in America. The Great Fire of Freehold happened on October 
30, 1873. The fire reportedly began in a commercial building on Main Street. 
It soon spread to engulf a large section of the village, and many wooden 
buildings, including Monmouth Courthouse, were burned down.[45] Freehold 
also has a relatively forgotten but important place in the history of the 
bicycle. Cycling champion Arthur Augustus Zimmerman resided in the town 
during his racing career in the 1880s and 1890s, and from 1896–1899 operated 
the Zimmerman Bicycle Co.; the company's bicycles were known as the "Zimmy." 
Today, Freehold Borough is home to the Metz Bicycle Museum, where the only 
extant "Zimmy" can be seen.[46] At the beginning of the 20th Century, Freehold 
was an increasingly divided community. The issue of local tax dollars, 
used as funding for public works and infrastructure projects, was the primary 
point of contention.[47] The Freeholders living in the downtown area, around 
the courthouse had very different ideas about how to spend public money 
compared to the Freeholders living in the surrounding farmland. Tension 
within the community increased greatly in 1916 when a severe polio epidemic 
swept through Freehold.[48] After contentious public debate, a referendum 
was held to on the future of Freehold, and voters overwhelmingly decided 
to split the town into two separate municipalities. On April 15, 1919, 
Freehold Borough formally separated from Freehold Township.[23] Freeholders 
generally refer to the different municipalities simply as the Borough and 
the Township. The Borough, the downtown area around the courthouse, retained 
all the existing government buildings around Court Street and Main Street. 
The Borough also kept the designation as county seat.[49] Freehold Township, 
the farming communities that surrounded the courthouse, set up a new town 
hall complex on Schanck Road. The Township completely encircles the Borough. 
On September 7, 1926, Freehold Borough annexed additional territory from 
the Township.[49] In the early 20th century, the farms in Freehold Township 
continued to be prosperous and successful, and the area steadily grew in 
population. However, after World War II, the Township experienced rapid 
growth. By this time, transportation systems had increased to a point to 
allow workers to commute daily to jobs in larger cities, such as Newark, 
Philadelphia, and New York City. Highways, including U.S. Route 9 and Route 
33 helped to make it possible for commuters to live in Freehold and work 
in nearby cities. The township quickly developed large neighborhoods of 
suburban single family homes. Soon, the Township began to grow commercial 
and industrial businesses that rivalled the Borough. Among the corporations 
that opened production factories in Freehold include Nestlé in 1948[50] 
and 3M in 1957.[51] In 1971, a major medical complex, originally called 
Freehold Area Hospital, and today called CentraState Medical Center, opened 
in the Township.[50] Not all industrial developments in the Township were 
positive. In 1983, the United States government designated the Lone Pine 
Chemical Site in the Township as a Superfund site, one of the worst environmental 
disasters in the country.[52] In 1990, with the opening of Freehold Raceway 
Mall, the second-largest mall in the state, the Township become a primary 
commercial center for Central New Jersey.[53] As the Township grew, Route 
33 which ran through the heart of Freehold, become increasingly congested, 
and study suggested construction of a new freeway. After several years, 
the new freeway was downsized to merely a bypass of Freehold. Construction 
from near Sweetmans Lane (CR 527) to U.S. Route 9 was finished in 1972. 
Eventually construction began again and the bypass was extended to Halls 
Mill Road in 1989. For decades traffic was detoured, and congestion just 
kept getting worse. The delay was lengthened when an endangered species 
was found in the path of the proposed roadway. Finally, after 32 years 
of waiting, the bypass was fully completed in January 2003, reducing congestion 
on Route 33 and Route 33 Business.[54][55] The Township has thousands of 
jobs located within the municipality, along with a growing numbers of commuters 
who work in neighboring cities such as New York City, Newark, Trenton, 
and Philadelphia. Five residents of the Township were killed in the September 
11, 2001, terrorist attack on the World Trade Center and are listed on 
the county's 9/11 memorial.[56] According to the United States Census Bureau, 
the township had a total area of 38.727 square miles (100.303 km2), including 
38.503 square miles (99.723 km2) of land and 0.224 square miles (0.580 km2) 
of water (0.58%).[1][2] The township borders Colts Neck Township, Howell 
Township, Manalapan Township, Marlboro Township and Millstone Township 
in Monmouth County, and Jackson Township in Ocean County; It also completely 
surrounds the borough of Freehold.[57] The municipality of Upper Freehold 
Township is not connected, geographically or politically, to Freehold Township.
