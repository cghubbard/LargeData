or /kəˈlɒmbiə/ kə-LOM-biə; Spanish: [koˈlombja] ( listen)), officially 
the Republic of Colombia (Spanish:  República de Colombia (help·info)),[Note 
1] is a transcontinental country largely situated in the northwest of South 
America, with territories in Central America. Colombia shares a border 
to the northwest with Panama, to the east with Venezuela and Brazil, to 
the south with Ecuador and Peru.[11] It shares its maritime limits with 
Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Honduras, Jamaica, the Dominican Republic, and Haiti.[12] 
It is a unitary, constitutional republic comprising thirty-two departments. 
The territory of what is now Colombia was originally inhabited by indigenous 
peoples including the Muisca, Quimbaya, and Tairona. The Spanish arrived 
in 1499 and initiated a period of conquest and colonization ultimately 
creating the Viceroyalty of New Granada, with its capital at Bogotá. Independence 
from Spain was won in 1819, but by 1830 the "Gran Colombia" Federation 
was dissolved. What is now Colombia and Panama emerged as the Republic 
of New Granada. The new nation experimented with federalism as the Granadine 
Confederation (1858), and then the United States of Colombia (1863), before 
the Republic of Colombia was finally declared in 1886. Panama seceded in 
1903. Since the 1960s, the country has suffered from an asymmetric low-intensity 
armed conflict, which escalated in the 1990s, but then decreased from 2005 
onward.[13] Colombia is one of the most ethnically and linguistically diverse 
countries in the world giving rise to a rich cultural heritage. This has 
also been influenced by Colombia's varied geography, and the imposing landscape 
of the country has resulted in the development of very strong regional 
identities. The urban centres are mostly located in the highlands of the 
Andes mountains. Colombian territory also encompasses Amazon rainforest, 
tropical grassland and both Caribbean and Pacific coastlines. Ecologically, 
it is one of the world's 17 megadiverse countries, and the most densely 
biodiverse of these per square kilometer.[14] Colombia is a middle power 
and a regional actor with the fourth largest economy in Latin America,[4] 
is part of the CIVETS group of six leading emerging markets and is an accessing 
member to the OECD.[15] Colombia has a diversified economy with macroeconomic 
stability and favorable growth prospects in the long run.[16][17] The name 
"Colombia" is derived from the last name of Christopher Columbus (Italian: 
Cristoforo Colombo, Spanish: Cristóbal Colón). It was conceived by the 
Venezuelan revolutionary Francisco de Miranda as a reference to all the 
New World, but especially to those portions under Spanish and Portuguese 
rule. The name was later adopted by the Republic of Colombia of 1819, formed 
from the territories of the old Viceroyalty of New Granada (modern-day 
Colombia, Panama, Venezuela, Ecuador, and northwest Brazil).[18] When Venezuela, 
Ecuador and Cundinamarca came to exist as independent states, the former 
Department of Cundinamarca adopted the name "Republic of New Granada". 
In 1858, New Granada officially changed its name to the Granadine Confederation. 
In 1863, the name was again changed, this time to United States of Colombia, 
before finally adopting its present name – the Republic of Colombia – in 
1886.[18] To refer to this country, the Colombian government uses the terms 
Colombia and República de Colombia. Due to its location, the present territory 
of Colombia was a corridor of early human migration from Mesoamerica and 
the Caribbean to the Andes and Amazon. The oldest archaeological finds 
are from the Pubenza and El Totumo sites in the Magdalena Valley 100 km 
southwest of Bogotá.[19] These sites date from the Paleoindian period (18,000–8000 BCE). 
At Puerto Hormiga and other sites, traces from the Archaic Period (~8000–2000 BCE) 
have been found. Vestiges indicate that there was also early occupation 
in the regions of El Abra and Tequendama in Cundinamarca. The oldest pottery 
discovered in the Americas, found at San Jacinto, dates to 5000–4000 BCE.[20] 
Aboriginal people inhabited the territory that is now Colombia by 10,500 BCE. 
Nomadic hunter-gatherer tribes at the El Abra and Tequendama sites near 
present-day Bogotá traded with one another and with other cultures from 
the Magdalena River Valley.[21] Between 5000 and 1000 BCE, hunter-gatherer 
tribes transitioned to agrarian societies; fixed settlements were established, 
and pottery appeared. Beginning in the 1st millennium BCE, groups of Amerindians 
including the Muisca, Quimbaya, and Tairona developed the political system 
of cacicazgos with a pyramidal structure of power headed by caciques. The 
Muisca inhabited mainly the area of what is now the Departments of Boyacá 
and Cundinamarca high plateau (Altiplano Cundiboyacense) where they formed 
the Muisca Confederation. They farmed maize, potato, quinoa and cotton, 
and traded gold, emeralds, blankets, ceramic handicrafts, coca and salt 
with neighboring nations. The Taironas inhabited northern Colombia in the 
isolated Andes mountain range of Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta.[22] The 
Quimbayas inhabited regions of the Cauca River Valley between the Occidental 
and Central cordilleras.[23] Most of the Amerindians practiced agriculture 
and the social structure of each indigenous community was different. Some 
groups of indigenous people as the Caribs lived in a state of permanent 
war, but others had less bellicose attitudes.[24] The Incas expanded their 
empire on the southwest part of the country.[25] Alonso de Ojeda (who had 
sailed with Columbus) reached the Guajira Peninsula in 1499.[26][27] Spanish 
explorers, led by Rodrigo de Bastidas, made the first exploration of the 
Caribbean littoral in 1500.[28] Christopher Columbus navigated near the 
Caribbean in 1502.[29] In 1508, Vasco Núñez de Balboa accompanied an expedition 
to the territory through the region of Gulf of Urabá and they founded the 
town of Santa María la Antigua del Darién in 1510, the first stable settlement 
on the continent. [Note 2][30] Santa Marta was founded in 1525,[31] and 
Cartagena in 1533.[32] Spanish conquistador Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada 
led an expedition to the interior in April, 1536, and christened the districts 
through which he passed "New Kingdom of Granada". In August, 1538, he founded 
provisionally its capital near the Muisca cacicazgo of Bacatá, and named 
it "Santa Fe". The name soon acquired a suffix and was called Santa Fe 
de Bogotá.[33][34] Two other notable journeys by early conquistadors to 
the interior took place in the same period. Sebastián de Belalcázar, conqueror 
of Quito, traveled north and founded Cali, in 1536, and Popayán, in 1537;[35] 
from 1536 to 1539, German conquistador Nikolaus Federmann crossed the Llanos 
Orientales and went over the Cordillera Oriental in a search for El Dorado, 
the "city of gold".[36][37] The legend and the gold would play a pivotal 
role in luring the Spanish and other Europeans to New Granada during the 
16th and 17th centuries.[38] In 1542, the region of New Granada, along 
with all other Spanish possessions in South America, became part of the 
Viceroyalty of Peru, with its capital at Lima.[39] In 1547, New Granada 
became the Captaincy-General of New Granada within the viceroyalty. In 
1549, the Royal Audiencia was created by a royal decree, and New Granada 
was ruled by the Royal Audience of Santa Fe de Bogotá, which at that time 
comprised the provinces of Santa Marta, Rio de San Juan, Popayán, Guayana 
and Cartagena.[40] But important decisions were taken from the colony to 
Spain by the Council of the Indies.[41][42] Indigenous groups were loyal 
only to their own communities and for this reason the conquistadors made 
frequent alliances with different groups of indigenous peoples, these alliances 
would be key to defeating other groups of Amerindians.[43] Indigenous peoples 
in New Granada experienced a decline in population due to conquest as well 
as Eurasian diseases, such as smallpox, to which they had no immunity.[44][45] 
With the risk that the land was deserted, the Spanish Crown sold properties 
to the governors, conquerors and their descendants creating large farms 
and possession of mines.[46] In the 16th century, Europeans began to bring 
slaves from Africa. The Spanish empire didn't engage in the slave trade 
directly, the Spanish empire relied on the asiento system, awarding merchants 
(mostly from other countries) the license to trade enslaved people to their 
colonies and the majority of these traders were Portuguese, French, English 
and Dutch.[47][48] Also there were people who defended human rights and 
freedom of oppressed peoples.[Note 3][Note 4] The indigenous peoples could 
not be enslaved because they were legally subjects of the Spanish Crown 
[53] and to protect the indigenous peoples, several forms of land ownership 
and regulation were established: resguardos, encomiendas and haciendas. 
Repopulation was achieved by allowing colonization by farmers and their 
families who came from Spain.[46][54][55] In the 16th century, the nautical 
science in Spain reached a great development thanks to numerous scientific 
figures and nautical science was a key pillar of the Iberian expansion.[57] 
In 1717 the Viceroyalty of New Granada was originally created, and then 
it was temporarily removed, to finally be reestablished in 1739. The Viceroyalty 
had Santa Fé de Bogotá as its capital. This Viceroyalty included some other 
provinces of northwestern South America which had previously been under 
the jurisdiction of the Viceroyalties of New Spain or Peru and correspond 
mainly to today's Venezuela, Ecuador and Panama. So, Bogotá became one 
of the principal administrative centers of the Spanish possessions in the 
New World, along with Lima and Mexico City, though it remained somewhat 
backward compared to those two cities in several economic and logistical 
ways.[58][59] After Great Britain declared war on Spain in 1739, Cartagena 
quickly became the British forces’ top target but an upset Spanish victory 
during the War of Jenkins’ Ear, a war with Great Britain for economic control 
of the Caribbean cemented Spanish dominance in the Caribbean until the 
Seven Years’ War.[56][60] The 18th-century priest, botanist and mathematician 
José Celestino Mutis was delegated by Viceroy Antonio Caballero y Góngora 
to conduct an inventory of the nature of the New Granada. Started in 1783, 
this became known as the Royal Botanical Expedition to New Granada which 
classified plants, wildlife and founded the first astronomical observatory 
in the city of Santa Fe de Bogotá.[61] In July 1801 the Prussian scientist 
Alexander von Humboldt reached Santa Fe de Bogotá where he met with Mutis. 
In addition, historical figures in the process of independence in New Granada 
emerged from the expedition as the astronomer Francisco José de Caldas, 
the scientist Francisco Antonio Zea, the zoologist Jorge Tadeo Lozano and 
the painter Salvador Rizo.[62][63] Since the beginning of the periods of 
conquest and colonization, there were several rebel movements against Spanish 
rule, but most were either crushed or remained too weak to change the overall 
situation. The last one that sought outright independence from Spain sprang 
up around 1810, following the independence of St. Domingue (present-day 
Haiti) in 1804, which provided some support to the eventual leaders of 
this rebellion: Simón Bolívar and Francisco de Paula Santander.[64][65] 
A movement was initiated by Antonio Nariño, who opposed Spanish centralism 
and led the opposition against the viceroyalty.[66] Cartagena became independent 
in November 1811.[67] Took place the formation of two independent governments 
which fought a civil war – a period known as the Foolish Fatherland.[68] 
In 1811 the United Provinces of New Granada were proclaimed, headed by 
Camilo Torres Tenorio.[69][70] Despite the successes of the rebellion, 
the emergence of two distinct ideological currents among the liberators 
(federalism and centralism) gave rise to an internal clash which contributed 
to the reconquest of territory by the Spanish. The viceroyalty was restored 
under the command of Juan Sámano, whose regime punished those who participated 
in the uprisings. The retribution stoked renewed rebellion, which, combined 
with a weakened Spain, made possible a successful rebellion led by the 
Venezuelan-born Simón Bolívar, who finally proclaimed independence in 1819.[71][72] 
The pro-Spanish resistance was defeated in 1822 in the present territory 
of Colombia and in 1823 in Venezuela.[73][74][75] The territory of the 
Viceroyalty of New Granada became the Republic of Colombia, organized as 
a union of the current territories of Colombia, Panama, Ecuador, Venezuela, 
parts of Guyana and Brazil and north of Marañón River.[76] The Congress 
of Cúcuta in 1821 adopted a constitution for the new Republic.[77][78] 
Simón Bolívar became the first President of Colombia, and Francisco de 
Paula Santander was made Vice President.[79] However, the new republic 
was unstable and three countries emerged from the collapse of Gran Colombia 
in 1830 (New Granada, Ecuador and Venezuela).[80][81] Colombia was the 
first constitutional government in South America,[82] and the Liberal and 
Conservative parties, founded in 1848 and 1849 respectively, are two of 
the oldest surviving political parties in the Americas.[83] Slavery was 
abolished in the country in 1851.[84][85] Internal political and territorial 
divisions led to the dissolution of Gran Colombia in 1830.[80][81] The 
so-called "Department of Cundinamarca" adopted the name "New Granada", 
which it kept until 1858 when it became the "Confederación Granadina" (Granadine 
Confederation). After a two-year civil war in 1863, the "United States 
of Colombia" was created, lasting until 1886, when the country finally 
became known as the Republic of Colombia.[82][86] Internal divisions remained 
between the bipartisan political forces, occasionally igniting very bloody 
civil wars, the most significant being the Thousand Days' War (1899–1902).[87] 
The United States of America's intentions to influence the area (especially 
the Panama Canal construction and control) led to the separation of the 
Department of Panama in 1903 and the establishment of it as a nation.[88] 
The United States paid Colombia $25,000,000 in 1921, seven years after 
completion of the canal, for redress of President Roosevelt's role in the 
creation of Panama, and Colombia recognized Panama under the terms of the 
Thomson–Urrutia Treaty.[89] Colombia was engulfed in the war with Peru 
over a territorial dispute involving the Amazonas department and its capital 
Leticia.[90] Soon after, Colombia achieved some degree of political stability, 
which was interrupted by a bloody conflict that took place between the 
late 1940s and the early 1950s, a period known as La Violencia ("The Violence"). 
Its cause was mainly mounting tensions between the two leading political 
parties, which subsequently ignited after the assassination of the Liberal 
presidential candidate Jorge Eliécer Gaitán on 9 April 1948.[91][92] The 
ensuing riots in Bogotá, known as El Bogotazo, spread throughout the country 
and claimed the lives of at least 180,000 Colombians.[93] Colombia entered 
the Korean War when Laureano Gómez was elected as President. It was the 
only Latin American country to join the war in a direct military role as 
an ally of the United States. Particularly important was the resistance 
of the Colombian troops at Old Baldy.[94] From 1953 to 1964 the violence 
between the two political parties decreased first when Gustavo Rojas deposed 
the President of Colombia in a coup d'état and negotiated with the guerrillas, 
and then under the military junta of General Gabriel París Gordillo. After 
Rojas' deposition, the Colombian Conservative Party and Colombian Liberal 
Party agreed to create the "National Front", a coalition which would jointly 
govern the country. Under the deal, the presidency would alternate between 
conservatives and liberals every 4 years for 16 years; the two parties 
would have parity in all other elective offices. The National Front ended 
"La Violencia", and National Front administrations attempted to institute 
far-reaching social and economic reforms in cooperation with the Alliance 
for Progress. In the end, the contradictions between each successive Liberal 
and Conservative administration made the results decidedly mixed. Despite 
the progress in certain sectors, many social and political problems continued, 
and guerrilla groups were formally created such as the FARC, ELN, EPL, 
MAQL, PRT, CRS and M-19 to fight the government and political apparatus. 
Since the 1960s, the country has suffered from an asymmetric low-intensity 
armed conflict between the government forces, left-wing guerrilla groups 
and right-wing paramilitaries.[95] The conflict escalated in the 1990s,[96] 
mainly in remote rural areas.[97] Since the beginning of the armed conflict, 
human rights defenders have staged heroic acts that shows us the importance 
of standing up against injustice and fight for the respect for human rights, 
despite staggering opposition.[Note 5][Note 6] Five out of the seven guerrilla 
groups decided to demobilize after peace negotiations in 1989–1994.[13] 
The United States has been heavily involved in the conflict since its beginnings, 
when in the early 1960s the U.S. government encouraged the Colombian military 
to attack leftist militias in rural Colombia. This was part of the U.S. 
fight against communism.[101] On 4 July 1991, a new Constitution was promulgated. 
The changes generated by the new constitution are viewed as positive by 
Colombian society.[102][103] The administration of President Álvaro Uribe 
(2002–10), adopted the democratic security policy which included an integrated 
counter-terrorism and counter-insurgency campaign.[104] The Government 
economic plan also promoted confidence in investors.[105] As part of a 
controversial peace process the AUC (right-wing paramilitaries) as a formal 
organization had ceased to function.[106] In February 2008, millions of 
Colombians demonstrated against FARC and other outlawed groups.[107] In 
2012 the administration of President Juan Manuel Santos (2010–present), 
began a dialogue in Havana, Cuba between the Government of Colombia and 
guerrilla of FARC-EP with the aim to find a political solution to the armed 
conflict. After almost four years of peace negotiations, the Colombian 
state and the FARC announced consensus on a 6-point plan towards peace 
and reconciliation.[108] The Government also began a process of assistance 
and reparation for victims of conflict.[109][110] In October 2016, President 
Santos was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his resolute efforts to bring 
the country's more than 50-year-long war to an end,[111] despite the fact 
that the pact was rejected with 50.2% voting against it and 49.8% voting 
in favor, on a 37.4% turnout.[112][113] Colombia shows modest progress 
in the struggle to defend human rights, as expressed by HRW.[114] In terms 
of international relations, Colombia has moved from a period of tension 
and animosity with Venezuela, towards a positive outlook and a spirit of 
cooperation. Colombia has also won a seat on the Security Council of the 
UN.[115] The geography of Colombia is characterized by its six main natural 
regions that present their own unique characteristics, from the Andes mountain 
range region shared with Ecuador and Venezuela; the Pacific coastal region 
shared with Panama and Ecuador; the Caribbean coastal region shared with 
Venezuela and Panama; the Llanos (plains) shared with Venezuela; the Amazon 
Rainforest region shared with Venezuela, Brazil, Peru and Ecuador; to the 
insular area, comprising islands in both the Atlantic and Pacific oceans.[116] 
Colombia is bordered to the northwest by Panama; to the east by Venezuela 
and Brazil; to the south by Ecuador and Peru;[11] it established its maritime 
boundaries with neighboring countries through seven agreements on the Caribbean 
Sea and three on the Pacific Ocean.[12] It lies between latitudes 12°N 
and 4°S, and longitudes 67° and 79°W. Part of the Ring of Fire, a region 
of the world subject to earthquakes and volcanic eruptions,[117] Colombia 
is dominated by the Andes (which contain the majority of the country's 
urban centres). Beyond the Colombian Massif (in the south-western departments 
of Cauca and Nariño) these are divided into three branches known as cordilleras 
(mountain ranges): the Cordillera Occidental, running adjacent to the Pacific 
coast and including the city of Cali; the Cordillera Central, running between 
the Cauca and Magdalena River valleys (to the west and east respectively) 
and including the cities of Medellín, Manizales, Pereira and Armenia; and 
the Cordillera Oriental, extending north east to the Guajira Peninsula 
and including Bogotá, Bucaramanga and Cúcuta.[116][118][119] Peaks in the 
Cordillera Occidental exceed 4,700 m (15,420 ft), and in the Cordillera 
Central and Cordillera Oriental they reach 5,000 m (16,404 ft). At 2,600 m 
(8,530 ft), Bogotá is the highest city of its size in the world.[116] East 
of the Andes lies the savanna of the Llanos, part of the Orinoco River 
basin, and, in the far south east, the jungle of the Amazon rainforest. 
Together these lowlands comprise over half Colombia's territory, but they 
contain less than 6% of the population. To the north the Caribbean coast, 
home to 21.9% of the population and the location of the major port cities 
of Barranquilla and Cartagena, generally consists of low-lying plains, 
but it also contains the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta mountain range, which 
includes the country's tallest peaks (Pico Cristóbal Colón and Pico Simón 
Bolívar), and the La Guajira Desert. By contrast the narrow and discontinuous 
Pacific coastal lowlands, backed by the Serranía de Baudó mountains, are 
sparsely populated and covered in dense vegetation. The principal Pacific 
port is Buenaventura.[116][118][119] The main rivers of Colombia are Magdalena, 
Cauca, Guaviare, Atrato, Meta, Putumayo and Caquetá. Colombia has four 
main drainage systems: the Pacific drain, the Caribbean drain, the Orinoco 
Basin and the Amazon Basin. The Orinoco and Amazon Rivers mark limits with 
Colombia to Venezuela and Peru respectively.[120] Protected areas and the 
"National Park System" cover an area of about 14,268,224 hectares (142,682.24 km2) 
and account for 12.77% of the Colombian territory.[121] Compared to neighboring 
countries, rates of deforestation in Colombia are still relatively low.[122] 
Colombia is the sixth country in the world by magnitude of total renewable 
freshwater supply, and still has large reserves of freshwater.[123] Colombians 
customarily describe their country in terms of the climatic zones. Below 
1,000 meters (3,281 ft) in elevation is the tierra caliente (hot land), 
where temperatures are above 24 °C (75.2 °F). About 82.5% of the country's 
total area lies in the tierra caliente.[124] The majority of the population 
can be found in the tierra templada (temperate land, between 1,001 and 
2,000 meters (3,284 and 6,562 ft)), where temperatures vary between 17 
and 24 °C (62.6 and 75.2 °F) and the tierra fría (cold land, 2,001 and 
3,000 meters (6,565 and 9,843 ft)). In the tierra fría mean temperatures 
range between 12 and 17 °C (53.6 and 62.6 °F). Beyond the tierra fría lie 
the alpine conditions of the forested zone and then the treeless grasslands 
of the páramos. Above 4,000 meters (13,123 ft), where temperatures are 
below freezing, is the tierra helada, a zone of permanent snow and ice.[124]

ranking first in bird species.[127] As for plants, the country has between 
40,000 and 45,000 plant species, equivalent to 10 or 20% of total global 
species, this is even more remarkable given that Colombia is considered 
a country of intermediate size.[128] Colombia is the second most biodiverse 
country in the world, lagging only after Brazil which is approximately 
7 times bigger.[14][129] Colombia is the country in the planet more characterized 
by a high biodiversity, with the highest rate of species by area unit worldwide 
and it has the largest number of endemisms (species that are not found 
naturally anywhere else) of any country. About 10% of the species of the 
Earth live in Colombia, including over 1,900 species of bird, more than 
in Europe and North America combined, Colombia has 10% of the world’s mammals 
species, 14% of the amphibian species and 18% of the bird species of the 
world.[130] Colombia has about 2,000 species of marine fish and is the 
second most diverse country in freshwater fish. Colombia is the country 
with more endemic species of butterflies, number 1 in terms of orchid species 
and approximately 7,000 species of beetles. Colombia is second in the number 
of amphibian species and is the third most diverse country in reptiles 
and palms. There are about 2,900 species of mollusks and according to estimates 
there are about 300,000 species of invertebrates in the country. In Colombia 
there are 32 terrestrial biomes and 314 types of ecosystems.[131] The government 
of Colombia takes place within the framework of a presidential participatory 
democratic republic as established in the Constitution of 1991.[103] In 
accordance with the principle of separation of powers, government is divided 
into three branches: the executive branch, the legislative branch and the 
judicial branch.[132] As the head of the executive branch, the President 
of Colombia serves as both head of state and head of government, followed 
by the Vice President and the Council of Ministers. The president is elected 
by popular vote to serve four-year term (In 2015 the Colombia’s Congress 
approved the repeal of a 2004 constitutional amendment that eliminated 
the one-term limit for presidents).[133] At the provincial level executive 
power is vested in department governors, municipal mayors and local administrators 
for smaller administrative subdivisions, such as corregimientos or comunas.[134] 
All regional elections are held one year and five months after the presidential 
election.[135][136] The legislative branch of government is represented 
nationally by the Congress, a bicameral institution comprising a 166-seat 
Chamber of Representatives and a 102-seat Senate.[137][138] The Senate 
is elected nationally and the Chamber of Representatives is elected in 
electoral districts.[139] Members of both houses are elected to serve four-year 
terms two months before the president, also by popular vote.[140] The judicial 
branch is headed by four high courts,[141] consisting of the Supreme Court 
which deals with penal and civil matters, the Council of State, which has 
special responsibility for administrative law and also provides legal advice 
to the executive, the Constitutional Court, responsible for assuring the 
integrity of the Colombian constitution, and the Superior Council of Judicature, 
responsible for auditing the judicial branch.[142] Colombia operates a 
system of civil law, which since 2005 has been applied through an adversarial 
system. Despite a number of controversies, the democratic security policy 
has ensured that former President Uribe remained popular among Colombian 
people, with his approval rating peaking at 76%, according to a poll in 
2009.[143] However, having served two terms, he was constitutionally barred 
from seeking re-election in 2010.[144] In the run-off elections on 20 June 
2010 the former Minister of defense Juan Manuel Santos won with 69% of 
the vote against the second most popular candidate, Antanas Mockus. A second 
round was required since no candidate received over the 50% winning threshold 
of votes.[145] Santos won nearly 51% of the vote in second-round elections 
on 15 June 2014, beating right-wing rival Óscar Iván Zuluaga, who won 45%. 
His term as Colombia's president runs for four years beginning 7 August 
2014.[146] The foreign affairs of Colombia are headed by the President, 
as head of state, and managed by the Minister of Foreign Affairs.[147] 
Colombia has diplomatic missions in all continents.[148] Colombia was one 
of the 4 founding members of the Pacific Alliance, which is a political, 
economic and co-operative integration mechanism that promotes the free 
circulation of goods, services, capital and persons between the members, 
as well as a common stock exchange and joint embassies in several countries.[149] 
Colombia is also a member of the United Nations, the Organization of American 
States, the Organization of Ibero-American States, the Union of South American 
Nations and the Andean Community of Nations. The executive branch of government 
is responsible for managing the defense of Colombia, with the President 
commander-in-chief of the armed forces. The Ministry of Defence exercises 
day-to-day control of the military and the Colombian National Police. Colombia 
has 466,713 active military personnel. And in 2014 3.1% of the country's 
GDP went towards military expenditure, placing it 18th in the world. Colombia's 
armed forces are the largest in Latin America, and it is the second largest 
spender on its military after Brazil.[150][151] The Colombian military 
is divided into three branches: the National Army of Colombia; the Colombian 
Air Force; and the Colombian Navy. The National Police functions as a gendarmerie, 
operating independently from the military as the law enforcement agency 
for the entire country. Each of these operates with their own intelligence 
apparatus separate from the national intelligence agency (ANIC, in Spanish).[152] 
The National Army is formed by divisions, brigades, special brigades and 
special units;[153] the Colombian Navy by the Naval Infantry, the Naval 
Force of the Caribbean, the Naval Force of the Pacific, the Naval Force 
of the South, the Naval Force of the East, Colombia Coast Guards, Naval 
Aviation and the Specific Command of San Andres y Providencia;[154] and 
the Air Force by 15 air units.[155] The National Police has a presence 
in all municipalities. Colombia is divided into 32 departments and one 
capital district, which is treated as a department (Bogotá also serves 
as the capital of the department of Cundinamarca). Departments are subdivided 
into municipalities, each of which is assigned a municipal seat, and municipalities 
are in turn subdivided into corregimientos in rural areas and into comunas 
in urban areas. Each department has a local government with a governor 
and assembly directly elected to four-year terms, and each municipality 
is headed by a mayor and council. There is a popularly elected local administrative 
board in each of the corregimientos or comunas.[156][157][158][159] In 
addition to the capital four other cities have been designated districts 
(in effect special municipalities), on the basis of special distinguishing 
features. These are Barranquilla, Cartagena, Santa Marta and Buenaventura. 
Some departments have local administrative subdivisions, where towns have 
a large concentration of population and municipalities are near each other 
(for example in Antioquia and Cundinamarca). Where departments have a low 
population (for example Amazonas, Vaupés and Vichada), special administrative 
divisions are employed, such as "department corregimientos", which are 
a hybrid of a municipality and a corregimiento.[156][157] Click on a department

Colombia urbanised rapidly in the 20th century, by the end of which just 
17% of the workforce were employed in agriculture, generating just 6.1% 
of GDP; 21% of the workforce were employed in industry and 62% in services, 
responsible for 37.3% and 56.6% of GDP respectively.[16][106][160][161] 
Colombia's market economy grew steadily in the latter part of the 20th 
century, with gross domestic product (GDP) increasing at an average rate 
of over 4% per year between 1970 and 1998. The country suffered a recession 
in 1999 (the first full year of negative growth since the Great Depression), 
and the recovery from that recession was long and painful. However, in 
recent years growth has been impressive, reaching 6.9% in 2007, one of 
the highest rates of growth in Latin America.[162] According to International 
Monetary Fund estimates, in 2012 Colombia's GDP (PPP) was US$500 billion 
(28th in the world and third in South America). Total government expenditures 
account for 28.3 percent of the domestic economy. Public debt equals 32 
percent of gross domestic product. A strong fiscal climate was reaffirmed 
by a boost in bond ratings.[163] Annual inflation closed 2015 at 6.77% 
YoY (vs. 3.66% YoY in 2014).[164] The average national unemployment rate 
in 2015 was 8.9%,[165] although the informality is the biggest problem 
facing the labour market (the income of formal workers climbed 24.8% in 
5 years while labor incomes of informal workers rose only 9%).[166] Colombia 
has Free trade Zone (FTZ),[167] such as Zona Franca del Pacifico, located 
in the Valle del Cauca, one of the most striking areas for foreign investment.[168] 
Colombia is rich in natural resources, and its main exports include mineral 
fuels, oils, distillation products, precious stones, forest products, pulp 
and paper, coffee, meat, cereals and vegetable oils, cotton, oilseed, sugars 
and sugar confectionery, fruit and other agricultural products, food processing, 
processed fish products, beverages, machinery, electronics, military products, 
aircraft, ships, motor vehicles, metal products, ferro-alloys, home and 
office material, chemicals and health related products, petrochemicals, 
agrochemicals, inorganic salts and acids, perfumery and cosmetics, medicaments, 
plastics, animal fibers, textile and fabrics, clothing and footwear, leather, 
construction equipment and materials, cement, software, among others.[170] 
Colombia is also known as an important global source of emeralds,[171] 
and over 70% of cut flowers imported by the United States are Colombian.[172] 
Non-traditional exports have boosted the growth of Colombian foreign sales 
as well as the diversification of destinations of export thanks to new 
free trade agreements.[173] Principal trading partners are the United States, 
China, the European Union and some Latin American countries.[174][175] 
The electricity production in Colombia comes mainly from renewable energy 
sources. 70.35% is obtained from the hydroelectric generation.[176] Colombia's 
commitment to renewable energy was recognized in the 2014 Global Green 
Economy Index (GGEI), ranking among the top 10 nations in the world in 
terms of greening efficiency sectors.[177] The financial sector has grown 
favorably due to good liquidity in the economy, the growth of credit and 
in general to the positive performance of the Colombian economy.[17][178][179] 
The Colombian Stock Exchange through the Latin American Integrated Market 
(MILA) offers a regional market to trade equities.[180][181] Colombia is 
now one of only three economies with a perfect score on the strength of 
legal rights index, according to the World Bank.[182] In 2015, the National 
Administrative Department of Statistics (DANE) reported that 27.8% of the 
population were living below the poverty line, of which 7.9% in "extreme 
poverty". 171,000 people have been lifted out of poverty.[5] The Government 
has also been developing a process of financial inclusion within the country's 
most vulnerable population.[183] Recent economic growth has led to a considerable 
increase of new millionaires, including the new entrepreneurs, Colombians 
with a net worth exceeding US $1 billion.[184][185] Tourism in Colombia 
is an important sector in the country's economy. Foreign tourist visits 
were predicted to have risen from 0.6 million in 2007 to 2.98 million in 
2015.[186][187] Colombia has more than 3,950 research groups in science 
and technology.[188] iNNpulsa, a government body that promotes entrepreneurship 
and innovation in the country, provides grants to startups, in addition 
to other services it and institutions like Apps.co provide. Co-working 
spaces have arisen to serve as communities for startups large and small.[189][190] 
Organizations such as the Corporation for biological research for the support 
of young people interested in scientific work has been successfully developed 
in Colombia.[191] The International Center for Tropical Agriculture based 
in Colombia investigates the increasing challenge of global warming and 
food security.[192] Important inventions related to the medicine have been 
made in Colombia, such as the first external artificial pacemaker with 
internal electrodes, invented by the electronics engineer Jorge Reynolds 
Pombo, invention of great importance for those who suffer from heart failure. 
Also invented in Colombia were the microkeratome and keratomileusis technique, 
which form the fundamental basis of what now is known as LASIK (one of 
the most important techniques for the correction of refractive errors of 
vision) and the Hakim valve for the treatment of Hydrocephalus, among others.[193] 
Colombia has begun to innovate in military technology for its army and 
other armies of the world; especially in the design and creation of personal 
ballistic protection products, military hardware, military robots, bombs, 
simulators and radar.[194][195][196][197][198][199][200][201] Some leading 
Colombian scientists are Joseph M. Tohme, researcher recognized for his 
work on the genetic diversity of food, Manuel Elkin Patarroyo who is known 
for his groundbreaking work on synthetic vaccines for malaria, Francisco 
Lopera who discovered the "Paisa Mutation" or a type of early-onset Alzheimer's,[202] 
Rodolfo Llinás known for his study of the intrinsic neurons properties 
and the theory of a syndrome that had changed the way of understanding 
the functioning of the brain, Jairo Quiroga Puello recognized for his studies 
on the characterization of synthetic substances which can be used to fight 
fungus, tumors, tuberculosis and even some viruses and Ángela Restrepo 
who established accurate diagnoses and treatments to combat the effects 
of a disease caused by the Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, among other scientists.[203][204][205] 
Transportation in Colombia is regulated within the functions of the Ministry 
of Transport [206] and entities such as the National Roads Institute (INVÍAS) 
responsible for the Highways in Colombia (13,000 km),[207] the Aerocivil, 
responsible for civil aviation and airports,[208] the National Infrastructure 
Agency, in charge of concessions through public–private partnerships, for 
the design, construction, maintenance, operation, and administration of 
the transport infrastructure,[209] the General Maritime Directorate (Dimar) 
has the responsibility of coordinating maritime traffic control along with 
the Colombian Navy,[210] among others and under the supervision of the 
Superintendency of Ports and Transport.[211] The target of Colombia’s government 
is to build 7,000 km of roads for the 2016–2020 period and reduce travel 
times by 30 per cent and transport costs by 20 per cent. A toll road concession 
programme will comprise 40 projects, and is part of a larger strategic 
goal to invest nearly $50bn in transport infrastructure, including: railway 
systems; making the Magdalena river navigable again; improving port facilities; 
as well as an expansion of Bogotá’s airport.[212] With an estimated 48 million 
people in 2015, Colombia is the third-most populous country in Latin America, 
after Brazil and Mexico.[3] It is also home to the third-largest number 
of Spanish speakers in the world after Mexico and the United States.[213] 
At the beginning of the 20th century, Colombia's population was approximately 
4 million.[214] The birth rate remained at high levels until the early 
1970s, but since then, Colombia has experienced steady declines in its 
fertility, mortality, and population growth rates.[215] Colombia is projected 
to have a population of 50.2 million by 2020 and 55.3 million by 2050.[216] 
These trends are reflected in the country's age profile. In 2005 over 30% 
of the population was under 15 years old, compared to just 6.3% aged 65 
and over.[217] The total fertility rate was 1.9 births per woman in 2014.[218] 
The population is concentrated in the Andean highlands and along the Caribbean 
coast, also the population densities are generally higher in the Andean 
region. The nine eastern lowland departments, comprising about 54% of Colombia's 
area, have less than 6% of the population.[118][119] Traditionally a rural 
society, movement to urban areas was very heavy in the mid-20th century, 
and Colombia is now one of the most urbanized countries in Latin America. 
The urban population increased from 31% of the total in 1938 to nearly 
60% in 1973, and by 2014 the figure stood at 76%.[219][220] The population 
of Bogotá alone has increased from just over 300,000 in 1938 to approximately 
8 million today.[221] In total seventy-two cities now have populations 
of 100,000 or more (2015).[222] As of 2012[update] Colombia has the world's 
largest populations of internally displaced persons (IDPs), estimated to 
be up to 4.9 million people.[223] The life expectancy is 74.8 years in 
2015 and infant mortality is 13.6 per thousand in 2015.[224][225] In 2013, 
93.6% of adults and 98.2% of youth are literate and the government spends 
about 4.9% of its GDP in education.[226] Colombia is ranked third in the 
world in the Happy Planet Index. More than 99.2% of Colombians speak Spanish, 
also called Castilian; 65 Amerindian languages, two Creole languages, the 
Romani language and Colombian Sign Language are also spoken in the country. 
English has official status in the archipelago of San Andrés, Providencia 
and Santa Catalina.[8][227][228][229] Including Spanish, a total of 101 
languages are listed for Colombia in the Ethnologue database. The specific 
number of spoken languages varies slightly since some authors consider 
as different languages what others consider to be varieties or dialects 
of the same language. Best estimates recorded 71 languages that are spoken 
in-country today—most of which belong to the Chibchan, Tucanoan, Bora–Witoto, 
Guajiboan, Arawakan, Cariban, Barbacoan, and Saliban language families. 
There are currently about 850,000 speakers of native languages.[230][231] 
Colombia is ethnically diverse, its people descending from the original 
native inhabitants, Spanish colonists, Africans originally brought to the 
country as slaves, and 20th-century immigrants from Europe and the Middle 
East, all contributing to a diverse cultural heritage.[232] The demographic 
distribution reflects a pattern that is influenced by colonial history.[233] 
Whites tend to live mainly in urban centers, like Bogotá, Medellín or Cali, 
and the burgeoning highland cities. The populations of the major cities 
also include mestizos. Mestizo campesinos (people living in rural areas) 
also live in the Andean highlands where some Spanish conquerors mixed with 
the women of Amerindian chiefdoms. Mestizos include artisans and small 
tradesmen that have played a major part in the urban expansion of recent 
decades.[234] The 2005 census reported that the "non-ethnic population", 
consisting of whites and mestizos (those of mixed white European and Amerindian 
ancestry), constituted 86% of the national population. 10.6% is of African 
ancestry. Indigenous Amerindians comprise 3.4% of the population. 0.01% 
of the population are Roma. An extraofficial estimate considers that the 
49% of the Colombian population is Mestizo or of mixed European and Amerindian 
ancestry, and that approximately 37% is White, mainly of Spanish lineage, 
but there is also a large population of Middle East descent; among the 
upper class there is a considerable input of Italian and German ancestry.[2] 
Many of the Indigenous peoples experienced a reduction in population during 
the Spanish rule [235] and many others were absorbed into the mestizo population, 
but the remainder currently represents over eighty distinct cultures. Reserves 
(resguardos) established for indigenous peoples occupy 30,571,640 hectares 
(305,716.4 km2) (27% of the country's total) and are inhabited by more 
than 800,000 people.[236] Some of the largest indigenous groups are the 
Wayuu,[237] the Paez, the Pastos, the Emberá and the Zenú.[238] The departments 
of La Guajira, Cauca, Nariño, Córdoba and Sucre have the largest indigenous 
populations.[1] The Organización Nacional Indígena de Colombia (ONIC), 
founded at the first National Indigenous Congress in 1982, is an organization 
representing the indigenous peoples of Colombia. In 1991, Colombia signed 
and ratified the current international law concerning indigenous peoples, 
Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention, 1989.[239] Black Africans were 
brought as slaves, mostly to the coastal lowlands, beginning early in the 
16th century and continuing into the 19th century. Large Afro-Colombian 
communities are found today on the Caribbean and Pacific coasts. The population 
of the department of Chocó, running along the northern portion of Colombia's 
Pacific coast, is over 80% black.[240] British and Jamaicans migrated mainly 
to the islands of San Andres and Providencia. A number of other Europeans 
and North Americans migrated to the country in the late 19th and early 
20th centuries, including people from the former USSR during and after 
the Second World War.[241][242] Many immigrant communities have settled 
on the Caribbean coast, in particular recent immigrants from the Middle 
East. Barranquilla (the largest city of the Colombian Caribbean) and other 
Caribbean cities have the largest populations of Lebanese, Palestinian, 
and other Arabs.[243] There are also important communities of Chinese, 
Japanese, Romanis and Jews.[232] There is a major migration trend of Venezuelans, 
due to the political and economic situation in Venezuela.[244][245] The 
National Administrative Department of Statistics (DANE) does not collect 
religious statistics, and accurate reports are difficult to obtain. However, 
based on various studies and a survey, about 90% of the population adheres 
to Christianity, the majority of which (70.9%) are Roman Catholic, while 
a significant minority (16.7%) adhere to Protestantism (primarily Evangelicalism). 
Some 4.7% of the population is atheist or agnostic, while 3.5% claim to 
believe in God but do not follow a specific religion. 1.8% of Colombians 
adhere to Jehovah's Witnesses and Adventism and less than 1% adhere to 
other religions, such as Islam, Judaism, Buddhism, Mormonism, Hinduism, 
Indigenous religions, Hare Krishna movement, Rastafari movement, Orthodox 
Catholic Church, and spiritual studies. The remaining people either did 
not respond or replied that they did not know. In addition to the above 
statistics, 35.9% of Colombians reported that they did not practice their 
faith actively.[246][247][248] While Colombia remains a mostly Roman Catholic 
country by baptism numbers, the 1991 Colombian constitution guarantees 
freedom of religion and all religious faiths and churches are equally free 
before the law.[249] Colombia lies at the crossroads of Latin America and 
the broader American continent, and as such has been hit by a wide range 
of cultural influences. Native American, Spanish and other European, African, 
American, Caribbean, and Middle Eastern influences, as well as other Latin 
American cultural influences, are all present in Colombia's modern culture. 
Urban migration, industrialization, globalization, and other political, 
social and economic changes have also left an impression. Many national 
symbols, both objects and themes, have arisen from Colombia's diverse cultural 
traditions and aim to represent what Colombia, and the Colombian people, 
have in common. Cultural expressions in Colombia are promoted by the government 
through the Ministry of Culture. Colombian literature dates back to pre-Columbian 
era; a notable example of the period is the epic poem known as the Legend 
of Yurupary.[250] In Spanish colonial times notable writers include Hernando 
Domínguez Camargo and his epic poem to San Ignacio de Loyola, Juan Rodríguez 
Freyle (The Sheep) [251] and the nun Francisca Josefa de Castillo, representative 
of mysticism. Post-independence literature linked to Romanticism highlighted 
Antonio Nariño, José Fernández Madrid, Camilo Torres Tenorio and Francisco 
Antonio Zea.[252] In the second half of the nineteenth century and early 
twentieth century the literary genre known as costumbrismo became popular; 
great writers of this period were Tomás Carrasquilla, Jorge Isaacs and 
Rafael Pombo (the latter of whom wrote notable works of children's literature). 
Within that period, authors such as José Asunción Silva, José Eustasio 
Rivera, León de Greiff, Porfirio Barba-Jacob and José María Vargas Vila 
developed the modernist movement.[253][254] In 1872, Colombia established 
the Colombian Academy of Language, the first Spanish language academy in 
the Americas.[255] Candelario Obeso wrote the groundbreaking Cantos Populares 
de mi Tierra (1877), the first book of poetry by an Afro-Colombian author.[256][257] 
Between 1939 and 1940 seven books of poetry were published under the name 
Stone and Sky in the city of Bogotá that significantly impacted the country; 
they were edited by the poet Jorge Rojas.[258] In the following decade, 
Gonzalo Arango founded the movement of "nothingness" in response to the 
violence of the time;[259] he was influenced by nihilism, existentialism, 
and the thought of another great Colombian writer: Fernando González Ochoa. 
During the boom in Latin American literature, successful writers emerged, 
led by Nobel laureate Gabriel García Márquez and his magnum opus, One Hundred 
Years of Solitude, Eduardo Caballero Calderón, Manuel Mejía Vallejo, and 
Álvaro Mutis, a writer who was awarded the Cervantes Prize and the Prince 
of Asturias Award for Letters. Other leading contemporary authors are Fernando 
Vallejo (Rómulo Gallegos Prize) and Germán Castro Caycedo, the best-selling 
writer in Colombia after García Márquez.[260] Colombian art has over 3,000 
years of history. Colombian artists have captured the country's changing 
political and cultural backdrop using a range of styles and mediums. There 
is archeological evidence of ceramics being produced earlier in Colombia 
than anywhere else in the Americas, dating as early as 3,000 BCE.[261][262] 
The earliest examples of gold craftsmanship have been attributed to the 
Tumaco people [263] of the Pacific coast and date to around 325 BCE. Roughly 
between 200 BCE and 800 CE, the San Agustín culture, masters of stonecutting, 
entered its “classical period". They erected raised ceremonial centres, 
sarcophagi, and large stone monoliths depicting anthropomorphic and zoomorphhic 
forms out of stone.[262][264] Colombian art has followed the trends of 
the time, so during the 16th to 18th centuries, Spanish Catholicism had 
a huge influence on Colombian art, and the popular baroque style was replaced 
with rococo when the Bourbons ascended to the Spanish crown.[265][266] 
More recently, Colombian artists Pedro Nel Gómez and Santiago Martínez 
Delgado started the Colombian Murial Movement in the 1940s, featuring the 
neoclassical features of Art Deco.[261][262][267][268] Since the 1950s, 
the Colombian art started to have a distinctive point of view, reinventing 
traditional elements under the concepts of the 20th century. Examples of 
this are the Greiff portraits by Ignacio Gómez Jaramillo, showing what 
the Colombian art could do with the new techniques applied to typical Colombian 
themes. Carlos Correa, with his paradigmatic “Naturaleza muerta en silencio” 
(silent dead nature), combines geometrical abstraction and cubism. Alejandro 
Obregón is often considered as the father of modern Colombian painting, 
and one of the most influential artist in this period, due to his originality, 
the painting of Colombian landscapes with symbolic and expressionist use 
of animals, (specially the Andean condor).[262][269][270] Fernando Botero, 
Omar Rayo and Oscar Murillo are some of the Colombian artists featured 
at the international level.[261][271] [272][273] The Colombian sculpture 
from the sixteenth to 18th centuries was mostly devoted to religious depictions 
of ecclesiastic art, strongly influenced by the Spanish schools of sacred 
sculpture. During the early period of the Colombian republic, the national 
artists were focused in the production of sculptural portraits of politicians 
and public figures, in a plain neoclassicist trend.[274] During the 20th 
century, the Colombian sculpture began to develop a bold and innovative 
work with the aim of reaching a better understanding of national sensitivity.[262][275] 
Photography in Colombia began with the arrival in the country of the Daguerreotype 
that was brought by the Baron Gros in 1841. The Piloto public library has 
Latin America’s largest archive of negatives, containing 1.7 million antique 
photographs covering Colombia 1848 until 2005.[276][277] The Colombian 
press has promoted the work of the cartoonists. In recent decades, fanzines, 
internet and independent publishers have been fundamental to the growth 
of the comic in Colombia.[278][279][280] Throughout the times, there have 
been a variety of architectural styles, from those of indigenous peoples 
to contemporary ones, passing through colonial (military and religious), 
Republican, transition and modern styles.[281] Ancient habitation areas, 
longhouses, crop terraces, pathways, cemeteries, hypogeums and necropolises 
are all part of the architectural heritage of indigenous peoples.[282] 
Some prominent indigenous structures are the preceramic and ceramic archaeological 
site of Tequendama,[283] Tierradentro (a park that contains the largest 
concentration of pre-Columbian monumental shaft tombs with side chambers),[284] 
the largest collection of religious monuments and megalithic sculptures 
in South America, located in San Agustín, Huila.[264][285] Lost city (an 
archaeological site with a series of terraces carved into the mountainside, 
a net of tiled roads and several circular plazas) and also stand out the 
large villages mainly built with stone, wood, cane and mud.[286] Architecture 
during the period of conquest and colonization is mainly derived of adapting 
European styles to local conditions, and Spanish influence, especially 
Andalusian and Extremaduran, can be easily seen.[287] When Europeans founded 
cities two things were making simultaneously: the dimensioning of geometrical 
space (town square, street), and the location of a tangible point of orientation.[288] 
The construction of forts was common throughout the Caribbean and in some 
cities of the interior, because of the dangers that represented the hostile 
indigenous groups and the pirates who roamed the seas.[289] Churches, chapels, 
schools, and hospitals belonging to religious orders cause a great urban 
impact.[290] Baroque architecture is used in military buildings and public 
spaces.[291] Marcelino Arroyo, Francisco José de Caldas and Domingo de 
Petrés were great representatives of neo-classical architecture.[290] The 
National Capitol is a great representative of romanticism.[292] Wood is 
extensively used in doors, windows, railings and ceilings during the colonization 
of Antioquia. The Caribbean architecture acquires a strong Arabic influence.[293] 
The Teatro Colón in Bogotá is a lavish example of architecture from the 
19th century.[294] The quintas houses with innovations in the volumetric 
conception are some of the best examples of the Republican architecture; 
the Republican action in the city focused on the design of three types 
of spaces: parks with forests, small urban parks and avenues and the Gothic 
style was most commonly used for the design of churches.[295] Deco style, 
modern neoclassicism, eclecticism folklorist and art deco ornamental resources 
significantly influenced the architecture of Colombia, especially during 
the transition period.[296] Modernism contributed with new construction 
technologies and new materials (steel, reinforced concrete, glass and synthetic 
materials) and the topology architecture and lightened slabs system also 
have a great influence.[297] The most influential architects of the modern 
movement were Rogelio Salmona and Fernando Martínez Sanabria.[298] The 
contemporary architecture of Colombia is designed to give greater importance 
to the materials, this architecture takes into account the specific natural 
and artificial geographies and is also an architecture that appeals to 
the senses.[299] The conservation of the architectural and urban heritage 
of Colombia has been promoted in recent years.[300] Colombian music blends 
European-influenced guitar and song structure with large gaita flutes and 
percussion instruments from the indigenous population, while its percussion 
structure and dance forms come from Africa. Colombia has a diverse and 
dynamic musical environment.[301] Many musicians, composers, music producers 
and singers Colombians are recognized internationally such as Shakira, 
Juanes or Carlos Vives.[302] Caribbean music has many vibrant rhythms, 
such as cumbia (it is played by the maracas, the drums, the gaitas and 
guacharaca), porro (it is a monotonous but joyful rhythm), mapalé (with 
its fast rhythm and constant clapping) and the "vallenato", which originated 
in the northern part of the Caribbean coast (the rhythm is mainly played 
by the caja, the guacharaca, and accordion).[303][304][305][306][307] The 
music from the Pacific coast, such as the currulao is characterized by 
its strong use of drums (instruments such as the native marimba, the conunos, 
the bass drum, the side drum and the cuatro guasas or tubular rattle). 
An important rhythm of the south region of the Pacific coast is the contradanza 
(it is used in dance shows, as a result of the striking colours of the 
costumes).[303][308][309] Marimba music, traditional chants and dances 
from the Colombia South Pacific region are on UNESCO's Representative List 
of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.[310][311][312] Important 
musical rhythms of the Andean Region are the danza (dance of Andean folklore 
arising from the transformation of the European contredance), the bambuco 
(it is played with guitar, tiple[313] and mandolin, the rhythm is danced 
by couples), the pasillo (a rhythm inspired by the Austrian waltz and the 
Colombian "danza", the lyrics have been composed by well-known poets), 
the rajaleña (it is performed by people that play the queco flute, the 
tiple, the carangano and the drum), the sanjuanero (it originated in Tolima 
and Huila Departments, the rhythm is joyful and fast).[314][315][316][317][318] 
Apart from these traditional rhythms, salsa music has spread throughout 
the country, and the city of Cali is considered by many salsa singers to 
be 'The New Salsa Capital of the World'.[303][319][320] The instruments 
that distinguish the music of the Eastern Plains are the harp, the cuatro 
(a type of four-stringed guitar) and maracas. Important rhythms of this 
region are the joropo (a fast rhythm and there is also tapping as a result 
of its flamenco ancestry) and the galeron (it is heard a lot while cowboys 
are working).[303][321][322][323] The music of the Amazon region is strongly 
influenced by the indigenous religious practices. Some of the musical instruments 
used are the manguaré (a musical instrument of ceremonial type, consisting 
of a pair of large cylindrical drums), the quena (melodic instrument), 
the rondador, the congas, bells, and different types of flutes.[324][325][326] 
The music of the Archipelago of San Andrés, Providencia and Santa Catalina 
is usually accompanied by a mandolin, a tub-bass, a jawbone, a guitar and 
maracas. Some popular archipelago rhythms are the Schottische, the Calypso, 
the Polka and the Mento.[327][328] Theater was introduced in Colombia during 
the Spanish colonization in 1550 through zarzuela companies. Colombian 
theater is supported by the Ministry of Culture and a number of private 
and state owned organizations. The Ibero-American Theater Festival of Bogotá 
is the cultural event of the highest importance in Colombia and one of 
the biggest theater festivals in the world.[329] Other important theater 
events are: The Festival of Puppet The Fanfare (Medellín), The Manizales 
Theater Festival, The Caribbean Theatre Festival (Santa Marta) and The 
Art Festival of Popular Culture "Cultural Invasion" (Bogotá).[330][331][332] 
Although the Colombian cinema is young as an industry, more recently the 
film industry was growing with support from the Film Act passed in 2003.[334] 
Many film festivals take place in Colombia, but the two most important 
are the Cartagena Film Festival, which is the oldest film festival in Latin 
America, and the Bogotá Film Festival.[333][335][336] Some important national 
circulation newspapers are El Tiempo and El Espectador. Television in Colombia 
has two privately owned TV networks and three state-owned TV networks with 
national coverage, as well as six regional TV networks and dozens of local 
TV stations. Private channels, RCN and Caracol are the highest-rated. The 
regional channels and regional newspapers cover a department or more and 
its content is made in these particular areas.[337][338][339] Colombia 
has three major national radio networks: Radiodifusora Nacional de Colombia, 
a state-run national radio; Caracol Radio and RCN Radio, privately owned 
networks with hundreds of affiliates. There are other national networks, 
including Cadena Super, Todelar, and Colmundo. Many hundreds of radio stations 
are registered with the Ministry of Information Technology and Communications.[340] 
Colombia's varied cuisine is influenced by its diverse fauna and flora 
as well as the cultural traditions of the ethnic groups. Colombian dishes 
and ingredients vary widely by region. Some of the most common ingredients 
are: cereals such as rice and maize; tubers such as potato and cassava; 
assorted legumes; meats, including beef, chicken, pork and goat; fish; 
and seafood.[341] Colombia cuisine also features a variety of tropical 
fruits such as cape gooseberry, feijoa, arazá, dragon fruit, mangostino, 
granadilla, papaya, guava, mora (blackberry), lulo, soursop and passionfruit.[342][343][344] 
Among the most representative appetizers and soups are patacones (fried 
green plantains), sancocho de gallina (chicken soup with root vegetables) 
and ajiaco (potato and corn soup). Representative snacks and breads are 
pandebono, arepas (corn cakes), aborrajados (fried sweet plantains with 
cheese), torta de choclo, empanadas and almojábanas. Representative main 
courses are bandeja paisa, lechona tolimense, mamona, tamales and fish 
dishes (such as arroz de lisa), especially in coastal regions where kibbeh, 
suero, costeño cheese and carimañolas are also eaten. Representative side 
dishes are papas criollas al horno (roasted Andean potatoes), papas chorreadas 
(potatoes with cheese) and arroz con coco (coconut rice). Organic food 
is a current trend in big cities, although in general across the country 
the fruits and veggies are very natural and fresh.[345] Representative 
desserts are buñuelos, natillas, Maria Luisa cake, bocadillo made of guayaba 
(guava jelly), cocadas (coconut balls), casquitos de guayaba (candied guava 
peels), torta de natas, obleas, flan de arequipe, roscón, milhoja, and 
the tres leches cake (a sponge cake soaked in milk, covered in whipped 
cream, then served with condensed milk). Typical sauces (salsas) are hogao 
(tomato and onion sauce) and Colombian-style ají.[346] Some representative 
beverages are coffee (Tinto), champús, cholado, lulada, avena colombiana, 
sugarcane juice, aguapanela, aguardiente, hot chocolate and fresh fruit 
juices (often made with sugar and water or milk).[347] Tejo is Colombia’s 
national sport and is a team sport that involves launching projectiles 
to hit a target.[348] But of all sports in Colombia, football is the most 
popular. Colombia was the champion of the 2001 Copa América, in which they 
set a new record of being undefeated, conceding no goals and winning each 
match. Interestingly, Colombia has been awarded “mover of the year” twice.[349] 
Colombia is a mecca for roller skaters. The national team is a perennial 
powerhouse at the World Roller Speed Skating Championships.[350] Colombia 
has traditionally been very good in cycling and a large number of Colombian 
cyclists have triumphed in major competitions of cycling.[351] In baseball, 
another sport rooted in the Caribbean Coast, Colombia was world amateur 
champion in 1947 and 1965. Baseball is popular in the Caribbean, mainly 
in the cities Cartagena, Barranquilla and Santa Marta. Of those cities 
have come good players like: Orlando Cabrera, Edgar Rentería[352] who was 
champion of the World Series in 1997 and 2010, and others who have played 
in Major League Baseball.[353] Boxing is one of the sports that more world 
champions has produced for Colombia.[354][355] Motorsports also occupies 
an important place in the sporting preferences of Colombians; Juan Pablo 
Montoya is a race car driver known for winning 7 Formula One events. Colombia 
also has excelled in sports such as BMX, judo, shooting sport, taekwondo, 
wrestling, high diving and athletics, also has a long tradition in weightlifting 
and bowling.[356][357][358] Life expectancy at birth in 2000 was 70.99 
years; the life expectancy increased to 74.8 years by 2015.[224] Health 
standards in Colombia have improved very much since the 1980s, healthcare 
reforms have led to the massive improvements in the healthcare systems 
of the country. Although this new system has widened population coverage 
by the social and health security system from 21% (pre-1993) to 96% in 
2012,[360] health disparities persist, with the poor continuing to suffer 
less attention in their medical procedures. Through health tourism, many 
people from over the world travel from their places of residence to other 
countries in search of medical treatment and the attractions in the countries 
visited. Colombia is projected as one of Latin America’s main destinations 
in terms of health tourism due to the quality of its health care professionals, 
a good number of institutions devoted to health, and an immense inventory 
of natural and architectural sites. Cities such as Bogotá, Cali, Medellín 
and Bucaramanga are the most visited in cardiology procedures, neurology, 
dental treatments, stem cell therapy, ENT, ophthalmology and joint replacements 
among others for the medical services of high quality.[361] A study conducted 
by América Economía magazine ranked 22 Colombian health care institutions 
among the top 43 in Latin America, amounting to 51 percent of the total.[359] 
The educational experience of many Colombian children begins with attendance 
at a preschool academy until age five (Educación preescolar). Basic education 
(Educación básica) is compulsory by law.[362] It has two stages: Primary 
basic education (Educación básica primaria) which goes from first to fifth 
grade – children from six to ten years old, and Secondary basic education 
(Educación básica secundaria), which goes from sixth to ninth grade. Basic 
education is followed by Middle vocational education (Educación media vocacional) 
that comprises the tenth and eleventh grades. It may have different vocational 
training modalities or specialties (academic, technical, business, and 
so on.) according to the curriculum adopted by each school.[363] After 
the successful completion of all the basic and middle education years, 
a high-school diploma is awarded. The high-school graduate is known as 
a bachiller, because secondary basic school and middle education are traditionally 
considered together as a unit called bachillerato (sixth to eleventh grade). 
Students in their final year of middle education take the ICFES test (now 
renamed Saber 11) in order to gain access to higher education (Educación 
superior). This higher education includes undergraduate professional studies, 
technical, technological and intermediate professional education, and post-graduate 
studies. Technical professional institutions of Higher Education are also 
opened to students holder of a qualification in Arts and Business. This 
qualification is usually awarded by the SENA after a two years curriculum.[364] 
Bachilleres (high-school graduates) may enter into a professional undergraduate 
career program offered by a university; these programs last up to five 
years (or less for technical, technological and intermediate professional 
education, and post-graduate studies), even as much to six to seven years 
for some careers, such as medicine. In Colombia, there is not an institution 
such as college; students go directly into a career program at a university 
or any other educational institution to obtain a professional, technical 
or technological title. Once graduated from the university, people are 
granted a (professional, technical or technological) diploma and licensed 
(if required) to practice the career they have chosen. For some professional 
career programs, students are required to take the Saber-Pro test, in their 
final year of undergraduate academic education.[363] Public spending on 
education as a proportion of gross domestic product in 2013 was 4.9%. This 
represented 16.9% of total government expenditure. The primary and secondary 
gross enrolment ratios stood at 114.9% and 93% respectively. School-life 
expectancy was 13.5 years. A total of 93.6% of the population aged 15 and 
older were recorded as literate, including 98.2% of those aged 15–24.[226]
