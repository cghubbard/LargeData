The Sacramento River Cats are a Minor League Baseball team based in West 
Sacramento, California. The team plays in the Pacific Coast League (PCL) 
and is the Triple-A affiliate of Major League Baseball's San Francisco 
Giants. Through the 2014 season, they were the top affiliate of the Oakland 
Athletics. Since moving to California in 2000, the River Cats have played 
at Raley Field in West Sacramento. The team began play 38 years ago in 
British Columbia in 1978 as the Vancouver Canadians, and played their home 
games at Nat Bailey Stadium through the 1999 season, their first with Oakland 
since 1978. Following that 1999 season, in which the Canadians won the 
Triple-A World Series, the team was purchased by a group led by Art Savage 
and moved south to West Sacramento and became the River Cats for the 2000 
season. Savage was the majority owner of the team until his death at age 
58 in November 2009. His widow, Susan Savage, became majority owner upon 
her husband's death.[1] Sacramento led the minor leagues in attendance 
during each of its first eight seasons at Raley Field. The team averaged 
9,338 per game during the 2015 regular season, for a season total of 672,354, 
under its first year with the Giants.[2] Forbes listed the River Cats as 
the most valuable minor league franchise in 2012 and again in 2016.[3][4] 
The PCL franchise in Sacramento for many years was the Solons, a charter 
member of the PCL which was founded in 1903. Three different versions of 
the Solons represented California's capital city in 1903, 1905, from 1909 
through 1914, from 1918 through 1960, and from 1974 through 1976. Sacramento 
is the only charter city that presently hosts a PCL team. In 2016, Mike 
Piazza became the first and only former River Cats player to be inducted 
into the Baseball Hall of Fame, after earning an 83% vote by the committee. 
Other notable players from the River Cats currently in the MLB include 
Josh Donaldson, Sonny Gray, and Carlos Gonzales. Since the arrival of the 
River Cats at Raley Field, they have led all the minors in attendance during 
each of its first eight seasons.[5] In 2015, the team drew 672,354 fans 
in 72 home games, leading the minor leagues in total attendance. In 2015, 
they also drew the second highest attendance per game in the minors with 
an average of 9,338 fans per game. [6] The River Cats won four Pacific 
Coast League Pacific South Division titles in five years, from 2000 through 
2004, and back-to-back league championships in 2003 and 2004. In 2007 they 
won the Pacific South Division and league championships again and defeated 
the Richmond Braves in that year's Bricktown Showdown on September 18 by 
a score of 7–1. The River Cats repeated as division, league, and class 
champions in 2008. They have won the last six Pacific South Division titles 
and won 11 division titles in their first 14 years in Sacramento. The River 
Cats moved to the North division in 2014. Pitchers Catchers Infielders
