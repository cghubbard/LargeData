Randall Kirk Myers (born September 19, 1962) is an American former Major 
League Baseball relief pitcher. During a 14-year baseball career, he pitched 
from 1985–1998 for the New York Mets, Cincinnati Reds, San Diego Padres, 
Chicago Cubs, Baltimore Orioles, and Toronto Blue Jays. Randy Myers grew 
up in Vancouver, Washington. His father was an auto mechanic and a machinist.[1] 
He is a graduate of Evergreen High School and Clark College. He also attended 
Eastern Illinois University. Myers was drafted in the first round (ninth 
overall) of the 1982 amateur draft.[2] Myers began his Major League career 
with the New York Mets in 1985 under the management of Davey Johnson, and 
was a member of the Mets 1986 World Series-winning team. Myers became a 
closer in 1988 as he platooned with Roger McDowell after Jesse Orosco left 
for the Los Angeles Dodgers. Myers was traded to the Reds in 1990 for closer 
John Franco, and became one of the league's elite closers and the most 
successful member of the Nasty Boys trio, which also included Rob Dibble 
and Norm Charlton, while being selected as an All-Star in 1990. In 1990 
Myers won his second World Series ring as the Reds swept the Oakland Athletics. 
In 1991, the Reds experimented with Myers as a starter, a move that proved 
highly unsuccessful as he posted a record of 6 wins and 13 losses.[2] In 
1992, Myers became the closer for the Padres. After only one season in 
San Diego, Myers was a Cub in 1993 where he posted his best statistical 
season with a then National League record 53 saves. In a September 28, 
1995 game vs. the Padres, Myers was attacked by a fan at Wrigley Field 
after giving up a home run.[3] In 1994 and 1995, Myers earned his second 
and third All-Star selections. After the 1995 season, Myers became a member 
of the Orioles where he had two more solid seasons, highlighted by an All-Star 
selection in 1997, when he saved 45 games. Myers had 28 saves for the Blue 
Jays in his final season, 1998, before being traded back to the Padres 
after being claimed on waivers. Though he was under contract for both 1999 
and 2000, he did not pitch in the Major Leagues after 1998. In a 14-year 
Major League career, Myers compiled a 3.19 ERA, 347 saves, 44 wins, 63 
losses and struck out 884 batters in 884.2 innings. Going into the 2008 
season, Myers ranked seventh on the all-time Major League career saves 
list. He has since been passed by Billy Wagner of the New York Mets and 
Troy Percival of the Tampa Bay Rays. In 2000, Myers earned a salary of 
US$6,916,667.00 while unable to pitch due to a damaged shoulder. Most of 
his 1999 and 2000 seasons were spent receiving treatment after undergoing 
rotator cuff surgery in 1999; his injury resulted in a legal dispute between 
the Padres and their insurance carrier after the carrier denied an $8 million 
claim due to Myers' inability to play.[4] The Padres' 1998 waiver claim 
of Myers is considered one of the biggest blunders in the history of the 
waiver wire. The Padres did not want Myers, mostly because of the $12 million 
and two additional years remaining on his contract as well as the fact 
that they already had an established closer in Trevor Hoffman, but placed 
a waiver claim in order to prevent him from going to the rival Atlanta 
Braves. They expected the Blue Jays to rescind their waiver claim, but 
the Blue Jays instead allowed the waiver claim to go through, leaving them 
responsible for the rest of his contract.[5] In October 1990, Myers was 
featured on the 18-ounce box of Wheaties breakfast cereal along with fellow 
Cincinnati Reds 1990 World Series champions Eric Davis, José Rijo, Barry 
Larkin, Chris Sabo, and Hal Morris.[6] For many years during his pro baseball 
career he assisted in coaching the women's basketball team at his alma 
mater, Clark Community College. He is widely involved in charities in Vancouver 
through his Randy Myers Foundation. He also has a lifelong involvement 
in martial arts.[1] Clark College did not field a baseball team after the 
1992 season, but by 2011, thanks in large part of Myers' efforts fundraising 
and spearheading the program's revival, Clark again started playing baseball
