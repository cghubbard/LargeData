Colton is a city in San Bernardino County, California, United States. The 
city is located in the Inland Empire region of the state and is approximately 
57 miles east of Los Angeles. The population of Colton is 52,154 according 
to the 2010 census, up from 47,662 at the 2000 census. Colton is the site 
of Colton Crossing, which was one of the busiest at-grade railroad crossings 
in the United States. The crossing was installed in 1882 by the California 
Southern Railroad to cross the Southern Pacific Railroad tracks while building 
northward from San Diego. As a result of railroad acquisitions and mergers, 
this became the point at which the Burlington Northern Santa Fe's "Southern 
Transcontinental Route" crossed the Union Pacific's "Sunset Route". As 
traffic on each line began to soar in the mid-1990s, fueled largely by 
the vast increase in imports passing through the ports of Los Angeles and 
Long Beach, the primitive crossing became a serious bottleneck. On August 
28, 2013, the at-grade crossing was officially replaced by a fly-over that 
raises the east–west UP tracks over the north–south BNSF tracks. Colton

before its establishment, it was inhabited by the Serrano, Guachama, and 
San Gorgonio Indians.[15] During the Mission Era the Mission San Gabriel 
established a Spanish settlement Politana in 1810, just northeast of what 
is now Colton.[16] By 1840, Colton was part of two private ranchos, Jurupa 
and San Bernardino Rancho.[15] From southwest area of modern-day Colton 
was known as "Agua Mansa" (Gentle Waters). It had been settled by New Mexico 
pioneers in 1842.[15] What is currently known as Cooley Ranch was known 
as Indian Knolls for nearly 100 years. This is because the Indians living 
in what is now the San Bernardino Valley found refuge on the knolls of 
the property during the flood of 1862.[15] The original owner of the property 
was George Cooley of Kent, England who had moved to Colton in 1853 and 
who purchased 200 acres at $3.50 an acre along the Santa Ana River the 
next year.[15] Cooley was chairman of the San Bernardino County Board of 
Supervisors in San Bernardino County.[15] By 1873, the property had mushroomed 
into a 400-acre property. Eventually, when property taxes had increased, 
the property was sold to Villelli Enterprises of La Habra.[15] The city 
was named after David Douty Colton, who had been a Brigadier General of 
the California State Militia in 1855, prior to the Civil War.[17] He was 
later the Vice President of the Southern Pacific Railroad Company.[15] 
Colton was created in its modern form when the Southern Pacific Railway 
was built heading east from Los Angeles in 1875.[15] Virgil Earp lived 
in Colton at 528 West “H” Street[18] where he was the town’s first marshal.[19]
