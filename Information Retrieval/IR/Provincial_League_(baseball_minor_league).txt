The Provincial League, sometimes known as the Quebec Provincial League, 
was a minor league baseball league based in the Canadian province of Quebec. 
It went through a number of incarnations during the 20th century, spending 
time as both an independent baseball league (1922–23, 1935–39, 1948–49, 
and 1958–71) and as a member of the National Association of Professional 
Baseball Leagues (1924, 1940, and 1950–55). It is notable as a successful 
independent league at a time when few existed, and was a haven for black 
and Indian players excluded from organized baseball. The Provincial League 
was part of a long history of Quebec-based minor leagues. The first iterations 
played in 1894 and 1900. Later, the Ontario–Quebec–Vermont League played 
from 1922 to 1924, spending two years as an independent league before joining 
the National Association of Professional Baseball Leagues, the governing 
body of minor league baseball, in its last season. Like later incarnations 
of the league, it was the product of Canadian Pacific Railway sports promoter 
Joseph Page and retired Major League Baseball pitcher Jean Dubuc, who labored 
extensively to set up teams in towns with Canadian Pacific stops.[1] The 
Provincial League concept was relaunched in 1935. The league spent five 
seasons as an independent circuit before joining the NAPBL as a Class B 
league in 1940.[1] Throughout this time, the most successful clubs were 
Quebec City and Trois-Rivières. The Provincial League took a hiatus during 
World War II, and returned afterward as an independent league with inconsistent 
levels of success. By 1948 it was again a fully professional six-team league, 
though outside the purview of the NAPBL. In 1950 it rejoined the NAPBL 
as a Class C circuit, following a similar pattern to earlier successful 
independent organizations. It lasted until 1955 before folding.[2] In 1958 
the final iteration of the Provincial League launched; it lasted until 
1971 as an independent organization.[3] The Provincial League has drawn 
some scholarly attention as a professional independent circuit during a 
time when very few such leagues existed.[2] Especially in the late 1930s, 
it was known as safe haven for black and Indian players who were excluded 
from the organized leagues. During this time, the opportunities it offered 
drew black players from across North America, and it even once included 
a team representing the Caughnawaga Mohawk reservation. Other notable players 
included Maurice Richard, Pete Gray, Adrián Zabala, Roland Gladu, and a
