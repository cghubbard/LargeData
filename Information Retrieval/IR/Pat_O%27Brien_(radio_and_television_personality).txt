Pat O'Brien grew up in Sioux Falls and attended Axtell Park Middle school 
then graduated from Washington High School in 1966.[citation needed] He 
is a 1970 graduate of the University of South Dakota in Vermillion, where 
he was a Government major. He was also a member of the Delta Tau Delta

H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University 
in Washington, D.C.[3] O'Brien was a member of Sioux Falls area rock and 
roll band Dale Gregory and the Shouters, from 1964 to 1967 for which he 
was inducted into the South Dakota Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on April

in the local band Those of Us, a compilation of the Shouters and the X-Men. 
O'Brien started his career working for KSOO TV-Radio in his hometown of 
Sioux Falls.[citation needed] After graduating from college in 1970, he 
worked as a researcher at NBC News in Washington, D.C.[5] and was a production 
assistant for The Huntley-Brinkley Report.[6] He then served as an anchor 
and reporter for WMAQ-TV in Chicago. In 1977 he moved to KNXT-TV (now KCBS-TV) 
in Los Angeles, where he earned four local Emmy Awards.[5] Pat O'Brien 
is perhaps best known for his sixteen-year association with CBS Sports, 
which he joined in 1981. While at CBS, O'Brien covered the Super Bowl, 
World Series, NBA Draft, NBA Finals, Winter Olympic Games, the NCAA Men's 
Basketball Tournament, NCAA Football Championship and the Final Four. While 
at CBS he hosted the short-lived (3 weeks) late night talk show Overtime...With 
Pat O'Brien. He has also hosted VH1's Fairway to Heaven and Lift Ticket 
to Ride. In 1990, he was a regular on The NFL Today with Greg Gumbel, Terry 
Bradshaw and Lesley Visser. From 1997 to 2004 he was the co-host of Access 
Hollywood. His cohosts included Giselle Fernandez until 1999, and then 
Nancy O'Dell through 2004. He became the lead host of the Entertainment 
Tonight spin-off The Insider from its inception in 2004 until 2008. On 
August 18, 2010, O'Brien joined Steve Hartman and Vic "The Brick" Jacobs 
on the Loose Cannons show. Subsequently, Vic left the show and it was renamed 
Primetime on Fox Sports Radio, which could be heard from 3 p.m. to 7 p.m. 
E.S.T. Throughout O'Brien's show, he was often condescending about a Los 
Angeles-based newspaper sports writer, Tom Hoffarth. A memo sent to some 
people at Sherman Oaks-based Fox Sports Radio with a new lineup for early 
2014, left Pat Oâ€™Brien and Steve Hartman without a show. [7] In 2000, O'Brien 
returned to the sports world when he covered the Summer Olympic Games in 
Sydney for NBC, appearing on the CNBC channel. He also covered the 2002 
Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, Utah appearing on MSNBC. He also anchored 
the 2004 Games in Athens, Greece for NBC, this time appearing on both the 
Network and MSNBC, and in 2012 anchors the tennis tournament coverage which 
will be carried on Bravo. In addition to the Olympics, he also hosted the 
late night edition of the 2006 U.S. Open Tennis Championships for CBS Sports 
which was his return to CBS after a 9-year hiatus.[8] In 2001, O'Brien 
had a cameo appearance in P. Diddy's Bad Boy For Life music video. In early 
2003, Pat O'Brien filled in for Casey Kasem three times on Kasem's radio 
programs American Top 40 and American Top 20, once in January, once in 
February, and once in March when Kasem took vacation time. O'Brien also 
voice-acted in an episode of The Twilight Zone entitled Mr. Motivation. 
His voice is used for a doll named "Mr. Motivation." O'Brien has been parodied 
or targeted on shows like The Simpsons, Home Movies, The Howard Stern Show, 
South Park, The Soup, Late Night with Conan O'Brien, Best Week Ever, The 
Adam Carolla Show, The Opie and Anthony Show, The Boondocks, Cheap Seats, 
The Showbiz Show with David Spade, and by Jimmy Fallon on Saturday Night 
Live. He was also the subject of a TV Funhouse cartoon by Robert Smigel. 
In 2005, O'Brien appeared on the Adult Swim program Robot Chicken, lampooning 
himself and his hosting of The Insider. He is currently featured on the 
Adult Swim show Hot Package. O'Brien made a cameo appearance in the 1998 
comedy BASEketball as himself. In August 2004, O'Brien filed for divorce 
from Linda, his wife of three decades. They have a son named Sean.[9] In 
July 2008, O'Brien announced his engagement to his girlfriend of five years, 
Betsy Hoyt Stephens,[10] a clothing and accessories designer.[9][11] O'Brien 
is currently enrolled at the University of California, Los Angeles for 
addiction studies.[12] On March 20, 2005, O'Brien issued a written statement 
announcing that he had been admitted to a rehabilitation facility for alcoholism. 
Around the announcement of O'Brien entering rehabilitation, a string of 
sexually graphic voice-mail messages that contained O'Brien's voice started 
to make the rounds, particularly within the Internet community and radio 
programs The Bubba the Love Sponge Show, The Wendy Williams Experience, 
The Howard Stern Show and The Opie and Anthony Show. The drunk dialing 
incident consisted primarily of O'Brien, in a state of arousal, repeatedly 
recording sexually graphic messages, complete with suggestions of drug 
use, on the cellular vocal mail-box of a woman who continues to remain 
anonymous. On May 4, 2005, O'Brien was interviewed by talk show therapist 
Phil McGraw, which was featured during a prime time special on CBS. He 
disclosed the reasons behind his alcohol and drug abuse since the 1960s, 
as well as his experiences during rehabilitation. O'Brien also expressed 
remorse for the voice-mail incident and apologized for what his substance 
abuse did to his family. O'Brien returned to The Insider the next day, 
and reports from newsblues.com said that O'Brien had been signed to a new 
deal as host of the show. On February 8, 2008, it was reported that O'Brien 
reentered rehabilitation and Donny Osmond would be "filling in" as the 
cohost of The Insider[13] alongside Lara Spencer. On March 5, 2008, it 
was reported that O'Brien had been removed from The Insider, with Osmond 
taking his place[14] However, a month later O'Brien resumed his hosting 
duties after Osmond declined to take a permanent hosting role. On September 
18, 2008, O'Brien was officially fired from The Insider for writing a controversial 
e-mail to coworkers which insulted Lara Spencer, his replacement as news
