Tetsuto Yamada (山田 哲人, Yamada Tetsuto?, born July 16, 1992 in Toyooka, 
Hyōgo Prefecture, Japan) is a professional Japanese baseball player. He 
plays infielder for the Tokyo Yakult Swallows.[1] Yamada was named Central 
League MVP in 2015 after leading the league in home runs (38), doubles 
(38), runs scored (119), and stolen bases (34). This marked the first time 
any NPB player led the league in home runs and stolen bases in the same

In assessing his MVP season in October of 2015, the Japan Times wrote, 
"Yamada had a 2015 the likes of which is seldom seen in Japanese baseball."[3]
