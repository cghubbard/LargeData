Francisco ("Paquito") Montaner García[note 1] (August 16, 1894 – April 
5, 1945) was a Puerto Rican pitcher from Ponce. He was the first baseball 
player to throw a "no-hitter" in Puerto Rican baseball,[5][6] an event 
that took place on 10 December 1911.[7] He is honored with the name of 
one of the largest stadiums in Puerto Rico, the professional baseball league's 
Francisco Montaner Stadium in Ponce. In 1955, he was inducted into the 
Puerto Rico Sports Hall of Fame[8] and, in 1983, into the Galeria de los 
Inmortales del Deporte Ponceño (Ponce's Gallery of the Inmortals of Ponce 
Sports).[9] Francisco "Paquito" Alfonso Montaner García was born in Ponce, 
Puerto Rico, on August 16, 1894,[10] to Francisco Montaner Colón[11] and 
Eugenia García Colón.[12] His parents separated when he was young and Montaner 
was raised by his mother, together with his two sisters, Mercedes and Amanda.[13] 
His father was a member of the local chapter of the Unionist party.[14] 
Montaner García was a graduate of Ponce High School.[15] Montaner García 
predated professional baseball in Puerto Rico, which was not organized 
until 1926.[16][17] He was one of the greatest Puerto Rican pitchers of 
all times.[18][19] He also played ball performing brilliantly as an infielder. 
Prior to this, he was responsible for raising the name of his alma mater 
Ponce High School to the summit of Puerto Rican sports.[20] On one occasion 
Montaner García pitched two games on the same day without allowing the 
opposing team, Santurce's Central High School, to score a single run. On 
another occasion Montaner scored all strikeouts against 15 batters in succession 
and, in 1914, Montaner eliminated the All-American team as he threw a no-hitter 
against a team made up exclusively of American players belonging mostly 
to major league teams. After this game, the All-American team extended 
Montaner an offer to play for their team. Montaner's parents refused, however, 
given that Montaner was still a very young man. "Had the contract materialized, 
Montaner would have been the first Puerto Rican ever to have played in 
the major leagues with the New York Yankees, then known as the All-American 
team".[21][22][23] On January 22, 1912, while playing for Ponce's Liga 
del Castillo, Montaner García threw another no-hitter against San Juan's 
Capital Pope team.[24] Montaner García was a right-hand pitcher.[25] Montaner 
García and his team, the Ponce Baseball Club, played at the Campo Atlético 
Charles H. Terry located on Calle Lolita Tizol in Ponce. Among the players 
in his team were Vicente Laborde, Octavio Rodriguez, "Ciqui" Faberlle, 
Carlos Bonet, Angel Pou, Cayetano Pou, Cosme Beitia, "Pellin" Alicea, Leopoldo 
Martinez and Lorenzo Roque.[26] Montaner García retired from baseball in 
1923 when he hurt his right arm.[27] As professional leagues had not yet 
formed in Puerto Rico at the time Montaner played, he made his living outside 
the baseball field. Montaner García came from a family of shopkeepers. 
His father, Francisco Montaner Colón (b. 1872- d.?)[28] owned a cigar and 
liquor shop in Ponce, located near the center of town at the corner of 
Arenas and Intendente Ramirez streets, in Barrio Sexto (Cantera).[29] Montaner 
Garcia loved music and in the 1930s he recorded two 78 rpm records with 
Jose Piñeiro in New Jersey, United States. The recordings consisted of 
danzas by Manuel Gregorio Tavárez and Juan Morel Campos.[30] "He loved 
music, playing the guitar and singing."[31] Montaner García married Sarah 
Bigay and had four children: Carmen Maria, Francisco (Paquito) (1925–2009), 
Victor Manuel, and Ausberto (Boty).[32][33] Montaner García spent his last 
few retirement years playing dominoes.[34] He died in Ponce on April 5, 
1945, after suffering from leucemia for some time.[35] He was 50 years 
old at the time of his death.[36] Montaner García was the first major figure 
in Ponce baseball. His death in 1945 prompted the city of Ponce to honor 
him by naming the local baseball stadium after him. The stadium broke ground 
two years after Montaner García's death and opened two years after that,
