The 2015 Philadelphia Phillies season was the 133rd season in the history 
of the franchise, and its twelfth season at Citizens Bank Park. The team 
finished the season with a record of 63–99 (.389), the worst record in 
the majors, and missed the playoffs for a fourth consecutive season. Players 
becoming free agents Trades and signings After only one season, Jamie Moyer 
departed the Phillies' broadcast booth. Comcast SportsNet hired Ben Davis, 
previously a pre-game and post-game analyst, to replace Moyer as a game 
analyst, working with Matt Stairs (another analyst), Tom McCarthy (play-by-play), 
Gregg Murphy (field reporter), and Mike Schmidt (analyst for weekend home 
games).[5][6] All players who made an appearance for the Phillies during 
2015 are included.[11] Infielders Coaches The Phillies entered spring training 
with rather low expectations for the upcoming season; in fact, Baseball 
Prospectus projected the Phillies would go 69–93, which would be the worst 
record in baseball.[12] Even Phillies' front office personnel conceded 
that the Phillies were unlikely to be particularly competitive, although 
eventually, acting team president Pat Gillick suggested the team could 
hover around .500, depending on whether the team stays healthy, and whether 
it trades some of its better players such as Cole Hamels, Cliff Lee, or 
Jonathan Papelbon.[13] Nevertheless, manager Ryne Sandberg expressed optimism 
at the team's chances, noting they might "surprise some people" in what 
he called a "transition" season rather than a "rebuilding" one.[14] Among 
those transitions was at shortstop, where Freddy Galvis was expected to 
replace all-time Phillies' hits leader Jimmy Rollins.[15] Also, the Phillies 
sought to piece together an outfield. Domonic Brown moved from left field 
to right field in the offseason, and Ben Revere was the presumptive starter 
in center field, which left several players vying for playing time as reserves 
and situational players.[16] However, at one point Revere spent time in 
left field while Odubel Herrera played center field; Sandberg commented 
that Revere's arm may be a better fit in left, and that he was using spring 
training to experiment.[17] "Darin Ruf could be a surprise guy for me. 
Cody Asche and Sizemore might be guys who can chip in. Who knows how many 
home runs they can hit? If we're just thinking about solid contact and 
more contact and cutting down strikeouts from the type of team we had last 
year, I think that will go a long way with us. Driving balls into the gaps 
and some of those doubles turning into home runs." During spring training, 
the Phillies did not hit many home runs, which prompted Sandberg to note 
that throughout the season, the Phillies would play small ball to manufacture 
runs, especially via bunting and hit and run.[18] As part of that strategy, 
Sandberg announced that both Revere and Herrera would make the opening 
day roster, with Revere playing left field and Herrera playing center.[19] 
Another key storyline for the Phillies was completing their starting rotation. 
Hamels, Lee, Aaron Harang, and Jerome Williams comprised the presumed first 
four in the rotation, but there was significant competition for the fifth 
starter spot.[20] Among the leading candidates was David Buchanan, who 
looked to improve after a rookie campaign during which he posted a 6–8 
record with a 3.75 earned run average (ERA), and struggled with surrendering 
home runs.[21] Other candidates included Cuban import Miguel Alfredo Gonzalez, 
who had failed to live up to expectations after the Phillies signed him 
as an international free agent due to injuries, among other factors, and 
Chad Billingsley, who was still recovering from two right elbow surgeries.[20] 
Late in spring training, after it became clear that Lee was going to miss 
significant time, the Phillies announced that Hamels, Harang, Williams, 
and Buchanan were their first four starters, and that there were both internal 
and external candidates to be the fifth starter. Hamels would start on 
opening day.[22] On the last day of spring training, the Phillies signed 
relief pitcher Dustin McGowan who, despite a track record as a reliever, 
could potentially start if the Phillies needed him to while they awaited 
the return of Billingsley from the disabled list.[23][24] Ultimately, 12 
pitchers, two catchers, seven infielders, and four outfielders comprised 
the Phillies opening day roster.[24] After a "drubbing" on opening day 
in which the Phillies surrendered five home runs to lose 8–0 – their worst 
opening day shutout in team history – they rebounded to beat the Boston 
Red Sox in the series' second game behind a strong start from Aaron Harang 
that "closely emulated [the opening day starts] of the pitcher who made 
five consecutive opening-day starts for the Reds" before a loss in the 
rubber match during which David Buchanan pitched only three innings, allowing 
six runs, and snapping a streak of 16 starts in which Buchanan allowed 
three or fewer earned runs.[25][26][27] Against the NL East favorite Washington 
Nationals, the Phillies won two of three, including a 10-inning bout in 
which Darin Ruf hit a home run, and Cody Asche had three hits.[28][29] 
The Phillies' third series of the year was against the New York Mets; both 
squads entered the series with a 3–3 record.[30] Despite one game in which 
Chase Utley homered twice and another in which Odubel Herrera notched three 
extra-base hits, the Mets swept the Phillies.[31][32][33] The team continued 
a road trip in Washington, and opened a four-game set with the Nationals 
by losing two, extending their losing streak to six games before beating 
the Nationals 5–3 thanks to strong offensive efforts from Herrera and Freddy 
Galvis, and a quality start from Harang.[34] Unable to build momentum, 
the Phillies lost the series finale to drop their record to 4–9 on the 
season.[35] The Phillies entered their next series with the Marlins averaging 
only 2.46 runs per game, among the worst in the major leagues. However, 
they did win the first game of the series 7–3 thanks to home runs from 
Galvis and Ryan Howard, and a two-RBI triple from Ben Revere.[35] The woeful 
offense manifested itself during the remainder of the series, as the squad 
mustered only two total runs, losing both games.[36][37] The homestand 
continued with a series against the Atlanta Braves. After winning the first 
game 1–0 thanks to a strong start from Harang and a late-inning error by 
Freddie Freeman and losing the second game 5–2 with Buchanan's fourth loss 
of the season, the Phillies took the rubber match when Howard hit his second 
home run of the series (third of the season).[38][39] The team's final 
series of the month was a four-game set in St. Louis to face the Cardinals. 
Notwithstanding heating trade rumors including a potential deal to the 
Cardinals, Hamels picked up his first win of the season, leading the Phillies 
to a 4–1 victory.[40] The next evening, Panamanian rookie Severino González 
made his major league debut, but was unsuccessful, relinquishing seven 
runs in 2 2⁄3 innings as the Phillies lost 11–5.[41] The Phillies also 
lost the final two games, and finished the month of April with an 8–15 
record, their worst April record since 2002.[42] The team's .223 batting 
average was also the worst in the National League; they also ranked last 
or tied for last in the NL in runs, runs per game, and home runs. The bullpen 
was markedly better than the starting rotation; the former ranked fourth 
in the NL in ERA, while the latter ranked 13th.[43] As of the end of the 
month, Chase Utley had a .114 batting average, the worst in the major leagues.[44] 
Meanwhile, Harang posted a rotation-leading 2.51 ERA in 32 1⁄3 innings 
pitched during the month, and was even mentioned as a potential candidate 
to be traded to a contending team.[45][46] The Phillies began the month 
by reshuffling their pitching staff, optioning David Buchanan (0–5, 8.76 
ERA in April) to Triple-A Lehigh Valley, recalling Elvis Araújo (who conspicuously 
had similar struggles in the minor leagues), and preparing to add Chad 
Billingsley to the starting rotation.[47] Through August 25, 2015 Note:
