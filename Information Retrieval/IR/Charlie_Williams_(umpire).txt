Charles Herman Williams (December 20, 1943 – September 10, 2005) was an 
American baseball umpire who officiated in the National League from 1978 
to 1999, and in both leagues in 2000. In 1993 he became the first African 
American umpire to work behind home plate in a World Series game. He wore 
uniform number 25. Williams was born in Denver, Colorado, attended George 
Washington High School, and became an All-America football player at Long 
Beach City College, later attending California State University, Los Angeles. 
In his rookie season, Williams umpired third base for Tom Seaver's only 
no-hitter on June 16, 1978.[1] Williams was the home plate umpire for the 
longest game in World Series history, Game 4 of the 1993 World Series between 
the Philadelphia Phillies and Toronto Blue Jays, which lasted 4 hours and 
14 minutes and ended with a 15-14 Toronto victory and a 3–1 Series lead 
for the Blue Jays. He was the first base umpire on June 3, 1995 when Pedro 
Martínez pitched 9 perfect innings before giving up a hit in the 10th. 
He also worked the All-Star games in 1985 and 1995, the 1989 National League 
Championship Series between the San Francisco Giants and the Chicago Cubs, 
the 1997 NLCS between the Florida Marlins and the Atlanta Braves, and the 
1999 National League Division Series. He ejected San Diego Padres first 
baseman Steve Garvey from a June, 1986 game between the Padres and the 
Atlanta Braves, the only ejection of Garvey's career, then ejected Padres 
manager Steve Boros the next day when Boros tried to present a videotape 
of the call Williams ejected Garvey over. He was also an umpire on September 
28, 1988 when Orel Hershiser set the Major League record for consecutive 
scoreless innings pitched.[2] He remained an umpire until his retirement 
in 2000 due to health problems, and died at age 61 in Chicago, Illinois
