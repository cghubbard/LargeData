Duane Fredrick Maas (January 31, 1929 – December 7, 1976) is a former professional 
baseball player. He was a pitcher over parts of 7 seasons (1955–1961) with 
the Detroit Tigers, Kansas City Athletics and New York Yankees. Maas was 
a member of the 1958 World Series champion Yankees. He saw action in one 
game, relieving Bob Turley during the first inning of Game 2 when the Milwaukee 
Braves scored seven runs. After making his big-league debut in 1955 with 
Detroit and then struggling through an 0-7 season in 1956, Maas put together 
a 10-win season in '57. In a midseason transaction the following June, 
he and fellow pitcher Virgil Trucks were traded to the Yankees for outfielder 
Harry "Suitcase" Simpson and pitcher Bob Grim. Maas got seven wins for 
New York in the second half of that pennant-winning season, then went 14-8 
for them in 1959. He also pitched two innings of relief for the Yankees 
in the 1960 World Series against the Pittsburgh Pirates. He was chosen 
by the Los Angeles Angels in the American League expansion draft prior 
to the 1961 season, but never played for them in a regular season game 
before being traded back to the Yankees, with whom he concluded his career. 
For his career, he compiled a 45–44 record with a 4.19 earned run average 
and 356 strikeouts in 195 appearances. Maas was born in Utica, Michigan, 
and later died in Mt. Clemens, Michigan, at the age of 47 from complications
