Eddie Gene Fisher (born July 16, 1936) was an American professional baseball 
player. He played in Major League Baseball as a relief pitcher for the 
San Francisco Giants (1959–61), Chicago White Sox (1962–66 and 1972–73), 
Baltimore Orioles (1966–67), Cleveland Indians (1968), California Angels 
(1969–72) and St. Louis Cardinals (1973). Fisher led Pacific Coast League 
pitchers with 239 innings while playing for the Tacoma Giants in 1960. 
His minor league record from 1958 to 1961 was 47-28 (.627) with a 3.23 
ERA in 93 games (632 innings pitched). Fisher's best pitch was the knuckleball, 
and in 1963-1966 he worked out the White Sox bullpen with fellow flutterball 
specialist Hoyt Wilhelm. Fisher started just 63 out of the 690 games he 
appeared in, and completed 7 of those, two for shutouts. He is better-known, 
however, for his effective relief work. In Fisher's 15-year career, 1965 
stands out as his best season. He was named to the American League All-Star 
team and finished 4th in the MVP voting.[1] He pitched the final two innings 
of the 1965 All-Star Game for the AL, holding the National League scoreless 
on one hit. He retired Hank Aaron, Roberto Clemente and Ron Santo in order 
in the top of the ninth. Fisher led the league that season in WHIP (0.974), 
games pitched (82), and games finished (60), and was second in earned run 
average (2.40) and saves (24). His 15-7 record gave him a winning percentage 
of .682, which ranked fourth. The White Sox finished in second place that 
year with a record of 95-67. He was traded to the Baltimore Orioles on 
June 13, 1966 and helped them win the American League pennant. In 44 appearances 
for the O's he was 5-3 with 13 saves and a 2.64 ERA in 71.2 innings. Baltimore 
won the 1966 World Series, but Fisher did not appear in any of the four 
games against the Los Angeles Dodgers. Jim Palmer, Wally Bunker, and Dave 
McNally all pitched complete games, and the team needed only one relief 
appearance, provided by Moe Drabowsky. Career totals include a record of 
85-70 with 81 saves. In 1538.2 innings pitched he had 812 strikeouts, an 
ERA of 3.41, and a low 1.193 WHIP. He had a lifetime batting average of 
just .122 (30-for-246), but did once have three hits in a game, on September 
19, 1960 vs. the Chicago Cubs. He currently ranks 92nd on the MLB All-Time 
Games Pitched List (690) and 72nd on the MLB All-Time Games Finished List
