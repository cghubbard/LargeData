The Detroit Tigers' 2000 season was a season in American baseball. It was 
their first season at Comerica Park, after playing at Tiger Stadium since 
1912, at the corner of Michigan Avenue and Trumbull Avenue (also site of 
their previous stadiums since 1896). Heinie Manush OF: 1923-27 Sam Crawford 
OF: 1903-17 Groundbreaking for a new ballpark to replace Tiger Stadium 
for the Detroit Tigers was held on October 29, 1997 and the new stadium 
was opened to the public in 2000. At the time of construction, the scoreboard 
in left field was the largest in Major League Baseball.[1] In December 
1998, Comerica Bank agreed to pay US$66 million over 30 years for the naming 
rights for the new ballpark. Upon its opening, there was some effort to 
try to find a nickname for the park, with the abbreviation CoPa suggested 
by many [2], but that nickname has not gained widespread acceptance. The 
first game at Comerica Park was held on Tuesday, April 11, 2000 with 39,168 
spectators attending, on a cold snowy afternoon. Grounds people had to 
clear snow off the field from the night before. The Tigers defeated the 
Seattle Mariners by a score of 5-2. The winning pitcher, like in the final 
game at Tiger Stadium was Brian Moehler. Infielders Other batters Coaches
