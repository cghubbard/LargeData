no-hitter in 2001, and for Mark Buehrle's no-hitter against the Texas Rangers 
on April 18, 2007.[3] He was also behind the plate for Buehrle's subsequent 
perfect game thrown in 2009. Cooper joined Ed Vargo as umpires who had

Cooper was the third base umpire in the last game played at the old Yankee

a brief pause.[4] Rodriguez would break the record before the end of the 
season.[5] Cooper lives in his native Iowa. He is married to Tara Cooper 
and has two children. Cooper graduated from Iowa State University with 
a degree in transportation logistics.[2] List of Major League Baseball
