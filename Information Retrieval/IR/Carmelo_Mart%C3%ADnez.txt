Carmelo Martínez Salgado (born July 28, 1960) is a former professional 
baseball player. He played all or part of nine seasons in Major League 
Baseball, primarily as a first baseman and outfielder, from 1983 to 1991. 
He also played one season in Japan for the Orix BlueWave in 1992. He is 
the cousin of Edgar Martínez. On August 22, 1983, Martinez hit a home run 
in his very first major league at-bat for the Cubs. The homer came off 
Cincinnati's Frank Pastore in the 5th inning at Wrigley Field. On December 
7, 1983, Martinez was traded by the Cubs along with Craig Lefferts and 
Fritz Connally to the San Diego Padres for pitcher Scott Sanderson. He 
and Kevin McReynolds were dubbed the M&M Boys on the 1984 San Diego Padres 
team that reached the first World Series in franchise history.[1][2][3] 
Martinez had 66 RBIs, while McReynolds shared the team lead with 20 home 
runs.[4] On July 25, 2008, Martinez was involved in a minor league brawl 
while serving as interim manager of the Chicago Cubs' Single-A affiliate 
Peoria Chiefs. Carmelo approached Donnie Scott, manager of the Dayton Dragons 
and engaged in a heated discussion before shoving him, resulting in emptied 
benches.[5] Martinez is currently the Cubs' Latin American field coordinator.
