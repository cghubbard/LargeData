Francisco Córdova (born April 26, 1972) is a former Major League Baseball 
right handed starting pitcher . On January 18, 1996, Córdova was signed 
by the Pittsburgh Pirates as an amateur free agent. He made his major league 
debut on April 2, 1996. The following year, on July 12, 1997, at a sold 
out Three Rivers Stadium, he pitched nine innings of a combined 10-inning 
no-hitter for the Pirates. Ricardo Rincón pitched the 10th inning. The 
Pirates won the game on a dramatic three-run, pinch hit home run in the 
bottom of the 10th by Mark Smith. This game pitched by Córdova and Rincón 
is recognized as the only combined, extra-inning no-hitter in modern MLB 
history and is the last no-hitter in Pirates history to date.[1][2] Córdova 
would go on the post an 11-8 record that season. He would post a 13–14 
record in 1998, to go with a 3.31 ERA. His career was shorted by arm troubles, 
and he retired after the 2000 season with a 42–47 record. After his MLB 
stint, Cordova pitched in his native Mexico from 2002 through 2011 with 
the Mexico City Tigres, the Mexico City Diablos Rojos, and the Petroleros
