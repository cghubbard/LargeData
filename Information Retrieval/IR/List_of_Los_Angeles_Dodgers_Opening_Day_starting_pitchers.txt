The Los Angeles Dodgers are a Major League Baseball (MLB) franchise based 
in Los Angeles. They play in the National League West division. The first 
game of the new baseball season for a team is played on Opening Day, and 
being named the Opening Day starter is an honor, which is often given to 
the player who is expected to lead the pitching staff that season,[1] though 
there are various strategic reasons why a team's best pitcher might not 
start on Opening Day.[2] The Dodgers have used 21 different Opening Day 
starting pitchers in their 57 seasons in Los Angeles. The 21 starters have 
a combined Opening Day record of 25 wins, 25 losses and 8 no decisions.[3][4] 
The Dodgers started playing in Los Angeles in 1958, after moving from Brooklyn.[5] 
The first Opening Day game for the Dodgers in Los Angeles was played in 
San Francisco against the San Francisco Giants on April 15, 1958.[3] California 
native Don Drysdale was the Dodgers' Opening Day starting pitcher that 
day, in a game the Dodgers lost 8–0.[3][6] Dodgers starting pitchers won 
both of their Opening Day starts in their first home ballpark in Los Angeles, 
Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. Their Opening Day record in their current 
home park, Dodger Stadium, which opened in 1962, is ten wins, ten losses 
and six no decisions. That gives the Los Angeles Dodgers' Opening Day starting 
pitchers a total home record of twelve wins, ten losses and six no decisions. 
Their record in Opening Day road games is 10 wins, 14 losses and 2 no decisions.[3][4] 
Drysdale would make seven Opening Day starts for the Dodgers between 1958 
and 1969, a team record he shares with Don Sutton who accumulated them 
from 1972 through 1978.[3] Fernando Valenzuela, Clayton Kershaw, Ramón 
Martínez and Orel Hershiser have had at least four Opening Day starts, 
with six, six, five and four respectively.[3] Hall of Famer Sandy Koufax, 
who won three Cy Young Awards during the 1960s, only made one Opening Day 
start for the Dodgers, in 1964.[3][7] Drysdale also holds the Los Angeles 
Dodgers record for most wins as an Opening Day starter, with five wins 
against two losses. Sutton has four wins and two losses, and one no decision.[3] 
Kershaw (2011, 2013, 2014, 2016), Koufax (1964), Chan Ho Park (2001), Brad 
Penny (2008) and Hiroki Kuroda (2009) are the only Los Angeles Dodgers 
Opening Day starting pitchers to have won all their Opening Day decisions, 
Martinez and Derek Lowe share the Los Angeles Dodgers record for most Opening 
Day losses, with three.[3] The Los Angeles Dodgers won the World Series 
championship in 1959, 1963, 1965, 1981 and 1988. Drysdale (1959, 1963 and 
1965), and Fernando Valenzuela (1981 and 1988) were the Dodgers' Opening 
Day starting pitchers those years.[3] The Dodgers' starting pitcher won 
the Opening Day game in 1963, 1965 and 1981, but lost in 1959 and 1988.[8][9][10][11][12]
