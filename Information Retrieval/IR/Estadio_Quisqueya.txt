Quisqueya stadium Juan Marichal is a baseball stadium in Santo Domingo, 
Dominican Republic. It is often used as a multi-use stadium. The Quisqueya 
holds about 14,469 people after its renovation. The Dominican League Of 
Baseball Authority is in charge of its management. It is the only stadium 
in Dominican Republic to host two different baseball teams, the Licey Tigers 
(Tigres del Licey) and the Escogido Lions (Leones del Escogido). Its field 
dimensions are 335 feet at the foul poles, 383 feet at the power alleys, 
and 411 feet at the center field. It was built in 1955 as Estadio Trujillo, 
during the Rafael Leonidas Trujillo Molina dictatorship, taking the Bobby 
Maduro Miami Stadium as the design base. The stadium was renamed Estadio 
Quisqueya Juan Marichal, after the former Major League Baseball player 
and Hall of Famer Juan Marichal.[1][2] [3] The Estadio Quisqueya underwent 
a rebuilding job which expanded its amount of seats and the overall look 
of the field. The bullpens are now enclosed and out of play. President 
Leonel Fernández announced in 2009 that there are plans to turn the stadium 
and the adjacent area into a modern sports complex which will bear the 
name Complejo Deportivo Juan Marichal in honor of the first Dominican in 
the Major League Baseball Hall of Fame. Serie del Caribe 1972, 1976, 1980,
