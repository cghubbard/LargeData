As Player As Coach Henry Ramón Blanco (born August 29, 1971) is a Venezuelan 
former professional baseball player and current coach with the Chicago 
Cubs.[1] He played as a catcher in Major League Baseball from 1997 to 2013. 
Although Blanco was a light-hitting player, he was regarded as one of the 
best defensive catchers in Major League Baseball.[2] Blanco began his professional 
baseball career in 1989 when he was signed by the Los Angeles Dodgers as 
an amateur free agent.[1] He didn't begin to play as a catcher until 1995.[2] 
After seven years in the minor leagues, he finally blossomed in 1997 when 
he hit for a .313 batting average in 91 games for the Albuquerque Dukes 
of the Pacific Coast League.[3] Blanco made his major league debut with 
the Dodgers on July 25, 1997.[1] He returned to play for Albuquerque in 
1998 and was granted free agency in October of that year.[1] In December 
1998, Blanco signed a contract to play for the Colorado Rockies and won 
the starting catcher's role for the 1999 season.[4] Hitting for a .232 
batting average, he embellished his defensive credentials by leading National 
League catchers with 39 baserunners caught stealing.[5] In December 1999, 
he was traded (along with Jamey Wright) to the Milwaukee Brewers as part 
of a three-team trade that sent Jeff Cirillo and Scott Karl to Colorado 
and Justin Miller to the Oakland Athletics.[6] Blanco caught the majority 
of the Brewers' games in 2000, posting a .236 batting average with 7 home 
runs, 31 runs batted in.[7] He led National League catchers with a 58.2% 
baserunners caught stealing percentage, the highest percentage since 1982 
when Bob Boone also had a 58.2% success rate.[8] His batting average fell 
to .210 in the 2001 season. In March 2002, he was traded to the Atlanta 
Braves for Paul Bako and José Cabrera.[1][9] While Blanco served as a reserve 
catcher with the Braves working behind Javy Lopez, he also became known 
as Greg Maddux' personal catcher, a role he inherited from fellow Venezuelan 
catcher, Eddie Pérez.[2] Although he only produced 22 runs batted in, he 
had 5 game-winning RBIs and provided solid defense, helping the Braves 
win the National League Eastern Division title.[10] Blanco was the starting 
catcher for the Braves in Game 3 of the 2002 National League Division Series 
and was a late-inning replacement in Game 5 as the Braves were defeated 
by the San Francisco Giants.[11][12] In January 2003, Blanco signed a $1.3 million, 
one-year contract with the Braves.[10] The Braves repeated as Eastern Division 
champions in 2003 however, Blanco's batting average dropped to .199 and 
he was left off the post-season roster in favor of catcher Johnny Estrada 
as, the Braves lost to the Chicago Cubs in the 2003 National League Division 
Series.[13][14] When the Braves assigned him to the Triple-A Richmond Braves 
at the end of the season, Blanco opted for free agency. In December 2003, 
he signed a one-year, $750,000 contract to play for the Minnesota Twins.[15] 
Blanco became a valuable member of the Twins when rookie catcher Joe Mauer 
was injured early in the 2004 season.[16] He was credited for helping the 
Twins pitching staff with his game-calling skills, guiding them to the 
lowest team earned run average in the league.[17][18] Twins pitcher, Johan 
Santana, gave Blanco credit for helping him win the 2004 American League 
Cy Young Award.[19] He caught the majority of the Twins' games helping 
them to clinch the American League Central division title.[20] Blanco posted 
career-highs with 10 home runs and 37 runs batted in, while leading the 
American League catchers with a 49.2% caught stealing percentage.[1] He 
started all four games of the 2004 American League Division Series, hitting 
1 home run along with a .250 batting average as the Twins lost to the New 
York Yankees.[21] After failing to reach a contract agreement with the 
Twins after the 2004 season, Blanco opted for free agency again and, in 
December 2004 he signed a two-year, $2.7 million contract to play for the 
Chicago Cubs.[22] He worked as a back up catcher to Michael Barrett although, 
many of the Cubs pitchers preferred pitching to Blanco as his 2005 catcher's 
earned run average of 3.58 was almost 1 run lower than the 4.45 average 
posted by Barrett.[23][24] In the 2006 Caribbean Series, Blanco had a walk 
off double off the top of the opposing shortstop's head in the championship 
game to give the Leones del Caracas the series championship win over the 
Tigres del Licey.[25] In the 2006 major league season, he hit for a .266 
batting average with a career-high 37 runs batted in and, in November, 
signed a two-year contract for $5.25 million to remain with the Cubs.[1][26] 
Blanco appeared in only 22 games for the Cubs in 2007, missing two months 
of the season due to a herniated disc.[27] The Cubs went on to win the 
National League Central division although, Blanco did not appear in any 
post-season games. In 2008, Blanco posted career-highs with a .292 batting 
average and a .325 on-base percentage while serving as back up and mentor 
to rookie catcher Geovany Soto, who went on to win the 2008 National League 
Rookie of the Year Award.[28] After the 2008 season, Blanco's option was 
declined making him a free agent. In January 2009, he signed a $750,000, 
one-year contract to play for the San Diego Padres.[29] During the 2009 
season, he was a pinch-hitter, late-inning defensive replacement, and a 
mentor for Padres starting catcher Nick Hundley.[30] Blanco signed a one-year, 
1.5 million dollar contract with the New York Mets on December 3, 2009. 
On May 8, 2010, Blanco hit a walk-off home run to help the Mets defeat 
the San Francisco Giants 5–4.[31] Blanco signed a one-year contract on 
December 15, 2010 with the Arizona Diamondbacks.[32] He played in 37 games, 
hitting .250 and was re-signed following the season. He played in 21 games 
in the 2012 season. Blanco signed a non-guaranteed contract on January 
11, 2013 with the Toronto Blue Jays.[33] Blanco made the opening day roster 
for Toronto as the batterymate to recently acquired 2012 NL Cy Young winner 
R.A. Dickey. Blanco and Dickey previously played together for the New York 
Mets during the 2010 season, and Dickey had said Blanco was "the best [Dickey's] 
had at catching the knuckleball".[34] Blanco was designated for assignment 
on June 7, 2013,[35] and released on June 10. He batted .184 with the Blue 
Jays in 15 games played, with no home runs or RBI. Blanco was signed by 
the Seattle Mariners on June 14, 2013 to be a mentor to Mike Zunino.[36] 
In Blanco's first game with the Mariners on June 15 (against the Oakland 
Athletics), he hit a grand slam down the left field line.[37] On July 25, 
Zunino broke his left hand, and Blanco began splitting the catching duties 
with recently signed Humberto Quintero.[38] On August 1, 2013, Blanco hit 
his second grand slam since becoming a Mariner. This one also down the 
left field line, against the Boston Red Sox starting pitcher Ryan Dempster 
which gave the Mariners a 7-1 lead, but the bullpen allowed seven runs 
in the final two innings in an 8-7 loss. In 35 games with the Mariners, 
Blanco hit .125/.215/.240 with 3 HR and 14 RBI, while throwing out 6 of 
16 would-be base stealers. He was designated for assignment on October 
8, 2013 after the Mariners claimed outfield prospect Travis Witherspoon 
off waivers from the Los Angeles Angels.[39] He elected free agency the 
next day. Blanco signed a minor-league contract, with an invitation to 
spring training, with the Arizona Diamondbacks on December 13, 2013.[40] 
He was released on March 31, 2014, and immediately re-joined the Diamondbacks 
as a coach.[41] In a sixteen-year major league career, Blanco played in 
971 games, accumulating 615 hits in 2,761 at bats for a .223 career batting 
average along with 72 home runs, 298 runs batted in and an on-base percentage 
of .288. Blanco's .994 career fielding percentage ranks 20th all-time among 
major league catchers.[42] Although he was a light-hitter, Blanco has had 
an extended major league career due to the value of his excellent defensive 
abilities.[2] He has credited former catcher Mike Scioscia, who was the 
catching coordinator during his time with the Dodgers, with helping him 
develop his catching skills.[43] Blanco signed a minor-league contract, 
with an invitation to spring training, with the Arizona Diamondbacks on 
December 13, 2013.[44] He was released on March 31, 2014, and immediately 
re-joined the Diamondbacks as a coach.[45] On November 22, Blanco was hired 
by the Chicago Cubs to be their quality assurance coach.[46] Blanco made 
his managerial debut with the Bravos de Margarita club of the Venezuelan
