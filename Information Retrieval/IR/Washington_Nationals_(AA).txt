The Washington Nationals of 1884 were a short-lived baseball team in the 
American Association. They won 12 games and lost 51. Their home games were 
played at Athletic Park in Washington, D.C. They are also known as the 
Washington Statesmen. The Nationals were managed for all but one game by 
former player Holly Hollingshead. John Bickerton managed their final game 
on August 2, 1884, a loss to the New York Metropolitans.[1][2] Their top 
hitter was shortstop Frank Fennelly, who went 75-for-257, a batting average 
of .292. By far their best pitcher was Bob Barr, who was 9-23 with an ERA 
of 3.46. This team should not be confused with the other 1884 Washington 
Nationals franchise, a different team which played in the Union Association 
during its only year of operation. In 1891 the AA had another team in Washington,
