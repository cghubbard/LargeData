William Joseph "Bill" Buckner (born December 14, 1949) is a former Major 
League Baseball (MLB) first baseman. He appeared in MLB from 1969 through 
1990. During his career, he played for the Los Angeles Dodgers, Chicago 
Cubs, Boston Red Sox, California Angels, and Kansas City Royals. Buckner 
accumulated over 2,700 hits in his twenty-year career, won a batting title 
in 1980, and represented the Cubs at the All-Star Game the following season. 
Buckner is best remembered for a ground ball fielding error in the tenth 
inning that ended Game 6 of the 1986 World Series against the New York 
Mets, a play that has since become prominently entrenched in American baseball 
lore.[1] Buckner was born in Vallejo, California and grew up in American 
Canyon, California.[2] He graduated from Napa High School in 1968 after 
playing on the school's baseball and football teams. While playing football, 
he was a two-time All-Statewide receiver Coaches and also achieved All-America 
honors twice.[3][4] Buckner was selected by the Los Angeles Dodgers in 
the second round of the 1968 Major League Baseball draft. His friend, Bobby 
Valentine, was the Dodgers' first round pick. Upon signing with the Dodgers, 
Buckner was assigned to the Ogden Dodgers of the Pioneer League. He also 
briefly attended Los Angeles Valley College, the University of Southern 
California and Arizona State University and became a member of the Sigma 
Chi fraternity while a farmhand with the Dodgers. After two minor league 
seasons, in which he batted .323, Buckner made his major league debut with 
the Los Angeles Dodgers as a September call-up in 1969 at the age of 19. 
He appeared in one game, September 21 against the San Francisco Giants, 
and popped out to second baseman Ron Hunt, pinch hitting for Jim Brewer 
in the ninth inning.[5] Buckner began the 1970 season with the Dodgers, 
but after batting .121 with no home runs and no RBIs, he was returned to 
Triple-A Spokane. His .335 batting average with the Spokane Indians earned 
him a second chance, and he returned to the Dodgers when rosters expanded 
that September. He batted .257 in the months of September and October, 
with four RBIs and five runs scored. Buckner earned a starting job with 
the Dodgers in 1971 as their opening day right fielder. Buckner also played 
some first base with the Dodgers, making 87 starts at first in 1973, but 
when Steve Garvey emerged as a Gold Glove first baseman and the National 
League's Most Valuable Player the following season, he was shifted to left 
field permanently. Buckner played a supporting role in a baseball milestone 
on April 8, 1974. Playing left field, Buckner climbed the fence in an attempt 
to catch Hank Aaron's 715th home run. In his Dodger career, Buckner batted 
.289 with 38 home runs and 277 runs batted in in 773 games. Following the 
season, Buckner was traded to the Chicago Cubs with Iván DeJesús and Jeff 
Albert for Rick Monday and Mike Garman. He had suffered a staph infection 
in his ankle in 1976, so the Cubs shifted him to first base, where he remained 
for the final fourteen years of his career. Whereas early indications seemed 
to lean toward the Dodgers getting the better end of this deal, with Monday 
becoming one of the key centerpieces of the Dodgers clubs that went to 
the 1977 and 1978 World Series, Buckner soon emerged as something of a 
star for the beleaguered Cubs. During his career in Chicago, he batted 
over .300 four times, leading the league in 1980 at .324, and was the Cubs' 
sole representative at the 1981 Major League Baseball All-Star Game.[6] 
On May 17, 1979, in a famous slugfest at Wrigley Field that included three 
homers by Dave Kingman and two by Mike Schmidt, Buckner went four-for-seven 
with a grand slam and seven RBIs.[7] When manager Herman Franks resigned 
late in the 1979 season, he made negative comments about several players, 
including calling Buckner "nuts."[8] Early in the 1984 season, the Boston 
Red Sox were in the market for an upgrade at first base. On May 25, they 
acquired Buckner from the Cubs for Dennis Eckersley and Mike Brumley. The 
Red Sox were 19–25, and in sixth place in the American League East at the 
time of the trade, and improved to 67–51 the rest of the way to finish 
the season in fourth. Buckner appeared in all 162 games for the Red Sox 
in 1985, and batted .299 with sixteen home runs and a career high 110 RBIs. 
Buckner was a prototypical contact hitter, and struck out just 36 times 
in 718 plate appearances to lead the league in that category (he also led 
the league in most at bats per strike out in 1980, 1982 & 1986, and placed 
second in 1979, 1981, 1983 & 1987). In 1985, he also set the Major League 
record for assists by a first baseman in a season with 184. His record 
stood for almost 25 years; in 2009, the St. Louis Cardinals' Albert Pujols 
had 185 assists. In September 1986, Buckner hit .340 with eight home runs 
and 22 RBIs, while missing just three games in spite of chronic ankle soreness. 
Dave Stapleton, the Bosox first baseman prior to the acquisition of Buckner, 
began seeing more playing time as a late inning defensive replacement for 
Buckner in September and October. Buckner, meanwhile, became the first 
major league player to wear Nike high-top baseball cleats professionally 
in an effort to relieve pressure from his ankles. Buckner drove in over 
100 runs for the second season in a row, and was a key member of the team 
that won the American League East by 5.5 games. He entered Game five of 
the 1986 American League Championship Series batting just .111 in the ALCS, 
and was 0-for-3 in the game when he singled to start the ninth inning rally, 
which was capped off by Dave Henderson's famous home run. He went three-for-six 
in the final two games, as the Red Sox came back from the brink of elimination 
to defeat the California Angels, and win the American League pennant. Boston 
was leading the heavily favored New York Mets three games to two in the 
1986 World Series when Game Six of the series went into extra innings. 
For his part, Buckner was batting just .143 against Mets pitching, and 
was 0-for-5 in Game 6. When the Sox scored two runs in the top of the tenth, 
Boston manager John McNamara chose to have Buckner take the field in the 
bottom of the inning instead of bringing Stapleton in as a defensive replacement 
for the ailing Buckner as he had in games one, two and five.[9] New York 
came back to tie the game with three straight two-out singles off Calvin 
Schiraldi and a wild pitch by Bob Stanley. Mookie Wilson fouled off several 
pitches before hitting a slow roller to Buckner at first base. Aware of 
Wilson's speed, Buckner tried to rush the play. As a result, the ball rolled 
to the left side of his glove,[10] through his legs and into right field, 
allowing Ray Knight to score the winning run from second base.[11] Boston 
led Game 7 of the World Series 3–0 heading into the bottom of the sixth 
inning when New York scored three runs off Bruce Hurst (who had been named 
World Series Most Valuable Player before the Mets' improbable comeback 
in Game 6) to tie the game, and score three more off Schiraldi in the seventh 
to take a 6–3 lead. Buckner was two-for-four in the game, and scored one 
of two runs the Sox plated in the eighth. However, the comeback fell short, 
and the Mets won their second World Championship in franchise history.[12] 
Regardless of any of the other perceived shortcomings that led to Boston's 
loss in the 1986 World Series, Buckner's error epitomized the "Curse of 
the Bambino" in the minds of Red Sox fans, and he soon became the scapegoat 
for a frustrated fan base.[13] Buckner began receiving death threats and 
was heckled and booed by some of his own home fans. Meanwhile, he was the 
focal point of derision from the fans of opposing teams on the road—especially 
when he faced the Mets in Spring training 1987, and the first time he came 
to bat at Yankee Stadium during the regular season.[14] The Red Sox released 
Buckner on July 23, 1987, after recording a .273 batting average, two home 
runs and 42 RBI through 95 games.[citation needed] Upon his release from 
the Red Sox, Buckner signed with the California Angels. For the remainder 
of the 1987 season, Buckner batted .306 and drove in 32 runs in just 57 
games. At 38 years old, Buckner was released by the Angels on May 9, 1988 
just before a road trip that would have brought him to New York against 
the Yankees and Boston. He signed with the Kansas City Royals shortly after 
his release, and walked into Fenway Park as a player for the opposing team 
for the first time on July 15. He went one-for-two off Roger Clemens with 
a walk.[15] Buckner returned to the Red Sox in 1990 as a free agent, and 
received a standing ovation from the crowd during player introductions 
at the home opener on April 9.[16] Bill Buckner’s last home run was against 
Kirk McCaskill on April 25, 1990, at Fenway Park – and was the only inside-the-park 
home run of his career. Despite his infamous bad legs, the 40-year-old 
Buckner circled the bases in the fourth inning when Angels’ outfielder 
Claudell Washington fell into the grandstands behind the short right field 
wall while attempting to retrieve Buckner’s drive over Washington's head.[17] 
His return was short lived, as he retired on June 5 with a .186 batting 
average, one home run and three RBIs. On April 8, 2008, Buckner threw out 
the first pitch to former teammate Dwight Evans at the Red Sox home opener 
as they unfurled their 2007 World Series championship banner. He received 
a four-minute standing ovation from the sell-out crowd. After the game, 
when asked if he had any second thoughts about appearing at the game, he 
said, "I really had to forgive, not the fans of Boston, per se, but I would 
have to say in my heart I had to forgive the media for what they put me 
and my family through. So, you know, I've done that and I'm over that."[18] 
Buckner was a speedy baserunner until his ankle surgeries in 1975 and '76 
for a severe ankle sprain and bone chips, respectively. He twice finished 
in the top-ten in the league in stolen bases (1974 and 1976), and twice 
led the league in doubles (1981 and 1983). After moving to first base, 
he played 1,555 regular season games and made only 128 errors in 13,901 
chances. After Buckner retired from professional baseball he moved his 
family to Idaho, where he invested in real estate in the Boise area. One 
of the housing subdivisions which he developed is named "Fenway Park". 
He lent his name to and was a minority owner of a local car dealership, 
Bill Buckner Motors in Emmett, which was in business from 2006 to 2008. 
On January 4, 2011, Buckner was named the manager of the Brockton Rox of 
the Can-Am League.[19][20] The Rox posted a 51–42 record in 2011, but after 
the season, the Rox dropped the professional format to join the Futures 
Collegiate Baseball League. In December, Buckner became the hitting instructor 
for the Boise Hawks for 2012. The Hawks are the Cubs' affiliate in the 
Class A-Short Season Northwest League.[21][22] Buckner announced his retirement 
from baseball on March 3, 2014.[23] Buckner was inducted into the Napa 
High School Hall of fame in 1997[24][25] and the CIF Sac-Joaquin Section[26] 
Hall of Fame in 2010. With his wife, Jody, Buckner has two daughters, Brittany 
and Christen, and a son, Bobby. Bobby is a member of the Texas A&M–Corpus 
Christi Islanders baseball team.[27] Buckner also has two brothers, Jim 
and Robert, who played minor league ball but did not make it to the majors. 
He also has a sister, Jan, who is Jim's twin. Warren Brusstar who also 
graduated from Napa High School was a teammate with Buckner for a year 
and a half while they played for the Cubs.[28] Charlie Sheen purchased 
the "Buckner Ball" at auction in 1992 for $93,000, and it long resided 
in the collection of songwriter Seth Swirsky, who refers to it as the "Mookie 
Ball."[29] The ball was on loan for a time from Swirsky to the Mets to 
display in their Mets Hall of Fame and Museum, and it was among the most 
popular artifacts for fans to see. On May 3, 2012, Swirsky sold the ball 
through Heritage Auctions for $418,250.[30][31][32] Buckner made a cameo 
at the beginning of the sports parody film The Comebacks and appeared in 
an episode of the HBO series Curb Your Enthusiasm,[33] as well as a cameo 
in the pilot episode of the short-lived sitcom Inside Schwartz, advising 
the title character to "just let it go". His famous miscue is also referenced 
in the films Celtic Pride, Rounders[34] and Fever Pitch, the episode "Brother's 
Little Helper" of The Simpsons,[35] and the musical Johnny Baseball.[36] 
On October 23, 2008, during former Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan's 
testimony in House hearings on the economic crisis of 2008, Representative 
John Yarmuth referred to Greenspan as one of "three Bill Buckners."[37] 
During WrestleMania XIV, Pete Rose cut a promo against the city of Boston, 
facetiously saying "I left tickets (to the event) for Bill Buckner, but
