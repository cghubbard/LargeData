There are nine fielding positions in baseball. Each position conventionally 
has an associated number, which is used to score putouts: 1 (pitcher), 
2 (catcher), 3 (first baseman), 4 (second baseman), 5 (third baseman), 
6 (shortstop), 7 (left fielder), 8 (center fielder), and 9 (right fielder).[1]
