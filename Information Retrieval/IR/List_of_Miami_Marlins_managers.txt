The Miami Marlins are a professional Major League Baseball based in Miami, 
Florida. The Marlins are members of the National League East division in 
MLB, joining in 1993 as an expansion team. In baseball, the head coach 
of a team is called the manager, or more formally, the field manager. The 
duties of the team manager include team strategy and leadership on and 
off the field.[1][2] The Marlins have employed 12 different managers since 
their founding as the Florida Marlins in 1993. The Marlins' first manager 
was Rene Lachemann, who led the team from its creation in 1993 through 
part of the 1996 season. He has the most losses in franchise history with 
285, and has the lowest winning percentage, with .437.[3] After Cookie

75 games of the 1996 season.[5] Jim Leyland took over the franchise for 
the next two seasons, and in the process led the Marlins to their first
