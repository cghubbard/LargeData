Renaldo Antonio Stennett Porte (born April 5, 1951), is a former second 
baseman in Major League Baseball. Stennett played with the Pittsburgh Pirates 
(1971–79) and San Francisco Giants (1980–81). He batted and threw right-handed. 
A World Series champion with the Pirates in 1979, Stennett is one of three 
players to go 7-for-7 in a game, which he did in a 22-0 victory over the 
Chicago Cubs. He was also a member of the first all-black starting lineup 
in the major leagues. In an 11-season career, Stennett was a .274 batter, 
with 41 home runs and 432 RBIs in 1,237 games. Stennett was a good contact 
hitter with occasional power, and an aggressive and smart runner on the 
basepaths. As a fielder, he had sure hands and a strong and accurate arm 
for balls up the middle and double plays. On September 1, 1971, Pittsburgh 
faced the Phillies with the first major league all-black starting lineup 
(including some Latin players). Stennett led off the game for the Pirates, 
who won 10–7.[1] In his first three seasons with Pittsburgh, Stennett was 
used at shortstop and second base. He also played a solid defense at all 
three outfield positions, with an average arm and great reaction speed. 
He showed progress in 1973, when he hit 10 home runs and 55 RBIs in 128 
games. Following the 1973 season, Pittsburgh traded incumbent second baseman 
Dave Cash to Philadelphia and gave Stennett the starting job. Batting from 
the leadoff spot, he responded with a .291 average, 84 runs, 56 RBI, and 
a career-high 196 hits. On September 16, 1975, Stennett became the only 
player in the 20th century to have seven hits in seven at bats in a nine-inning 
game, as Pittsburgh routed the Cubs, 22–0. Stennett's first hit in that 
game came off starter Rick Reuschel and his seventh was off Rick's brother 
Paul Reuschel. Pittsburgh also set a major league record for the largest 
winning score in a shutout game in the modern era (later matched by the 
Cleveland Indians in 2004). He was the third player to collect seven hits 
in a single game, and the second to do it in a nine-inning game. With Stennett's 
position at second base secure in a lineup loaded with young hitters such 
as Dave Parker, Richie Zisk, and Rich Hebner and complemented by veterans 
Willie Stargell and Manny Sanguillén, Pittsburgh traded up-and-coming second 
baseman Willie Randolph to the New York Yankees after the 1975 season. 
On August 21, 1977, Stennett was batting .336 for the season, but he broke 
his right leg while sliding into second base. He was out for the year and 
had fewer than the required number of at bats or plate appearances (12), 
falling short of qualifying for the batting title, won by teammate Dave 
Parker (.338). In that season, Stennett collected a career-high 28 stolen 
bases. Stennett was a free agent at the end of the 1979 season and was 
signed by the San Francisco Giants to a five-year, $3 million contract 
in what would be one of the first "busts" of the free agent era. The Giants 
would release Stennett in April 1982, with three years remaining on and 
$2 million left on his contract. Not even 31 years of age, Stennett would
