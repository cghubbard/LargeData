August John Galan (May 23, 1912 – December 28, 1993) was an American professional 
baseball player. A left fielder and center fielder, he played in the Major 
Leagues from 1934–49 for the Chicago Cubs (1934–41), Brooklyn Dodgers (1941–46), 
Cincinnati Reds (1947–48), New York Giants (1949) and Philadelphia Athletics 
(1949). Galan threw right-handed and began his career as a switch hitter, 
but, starting in the latter part of 1943, he became strictly a left-handed 
hitter until the end of his career. Born in Berkeley, California, Galan 
stood 6 feet (1.8 m) tall and weighed 175 pounds (79 kg). In a 16-season 
big-league career, Galan posted a .287 batting average with 1,706 hits, 
100 home runs and 830 run batted in in 1,742 games played. In 1937, Galan 
was the first player in the Majors to hit switch-hit home runs in a game.[1] 
Galan was selected to three National League All-Star teams and homered 
in the 1936 contest off Schoolboy Rowe to help power the Senior Circuit 
to a 4–3 victory. He also played in three World Series (1935 and 1938 with 
the Cubs, and 1941 with the Dodgers), but his teams never won. Galan collected 
four Fall Classic hits in 29 total at bats (.138). In 1935, he became the 
first full-time player to make 649 plate appearances and not hit into a 
double play,[2] though he did hit into a triple play.Often injured (he 
broke his knee in 1940), Alan had a deformed arm from a childhood injury. 
A knee injury forced him to give up batting from the right side of the 
plate. After leaving the Major Leagues in 1949, Galan returned to the San 
Francisco Bay Area and played two more seasons with the Oakland Oaks of 
the Pacific Coast League, then managed the club to a 77–103 record (seventh 
place) in 1953. He joined the Philadelphia Athletics' coaching staff in 
1954, their last year in that city, and went on to spend 17 years as a 
minor league coach and manager in the Athletics' organization.[3] Augie
