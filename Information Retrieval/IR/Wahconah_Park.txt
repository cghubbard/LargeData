(2012–present) Wahconah Park is a city-owned baseball park located in Pittsfield, 
Massachusetts and nestled in a working-class neighborhood. One of the last 
remaining ballparks in the United States with a wooden grandstand, it was 
constructed in 1919 and seats 4,500. Through the park's history, 201 different 
Pittsfield players went on to the Major Leagues, and 100 different Pittsfield 
players already had some Major League experience. In the July 23, 1990 
issue of Sports Illustrated, author Daniel Okrent raved about the park 
in his column entitled Just A Little Bit of Heaven – Pittsfield's Wahconah 
Park is Baseball as it Oughta Be.[2] In 2012, the stadium became the home 
field of the Pittsfield Suns, an expansion franchise of the Futures Collegiate 
Baseball League. The Pittsfield Mets were a minor-league baseball team 
who were moved to Pittsfield, Massachusetts from Little Falls, New York, 
by an investment group organized by Michael T. Casey. The team played in 
the New York - Penn League, and were affiliated with the New York Mets 
from 1989 to 2000 and the Houston Astros in 2001. The Pittsfield Mets developed 
many future Major League players.[3] At the end of the 2003 season, the 
Berkshire Black Bears did not renew their lease and moved to New Haven, 
Connecticut. Jim Bouton proposed to renovate the park without any public 
dollars and bring professional baseball back. On July 3, 2004, a record 
crowd of 5,000 attended a vintage baseball game that he organized at Wahconah 
Park between Pittsfield and Hartford, a game telecast live for over four 
hours on ESPN Classic as America's Pastime: Vintage Baseball, Live. Commentators 
included Bouton, Bill Lee, actor Tim Robbins, and baseball historians John 
Thorn and David Pietrusza. Pittsfield politics intervened and Bouton was 
forced out, a saga which was described in Bouton's book Foul Ball plus 
Part II, published in paperback by Lyons Press in 2005. In 2005, Pittsfield 
city officials reached an agreement with Dan Duquette for the Pittsfield 
Dukes, a New England Collegiate Baseball League summer team, to play at 
Wahconah Park. During the 2007 season, the Dukes attracted a season attendance 
of 28,955 through 21 home games, averaging 1,378 fans per game. The agreement 
between the Dukes and the city of Pittsfield was jeopardized prior to the 
2008 season when it was reported that the Dukes owed thousands of dollars 
in back maintenance fees, however Duquette and city officials reached a 
consensus that permitted the Dukes to continue play. Field dimensions are 
334 feet to left field, 374 feet to center field, and 333 feet to right 
field. Because the field was constructed before the advent of field lighting, 
no harm was seen in orienting the diamond due west. One of only two professionally 
used parks in the U.S. today facing west (the other being Sam Lynn Ballpark 
in Bakersfield, California built in 1941), games are sometimes temporarily 
suspended while the sun sets. Lights were not installed until 1946. In 
1989 a mesh screen was placed in center field to help shield batters’ eyes. 
In 1927, a dike was installed on the Housatonic River in an attempt to 
prevent recurrent flooding. In the summer, concerts are held in Wahconah 
Park. It is also home to Varsity Football games for Pittsfield area high 
schools. In the fall of 2008, Dan Duquette partnered with the Nokona glove 
company and the U.S. Army USA team to create the Pittsfield American Defenders. 
Also, Wahconah Park was renamed to Nokona Stadium at Wahconah Park. Nokona 
is the only glove maker to produce in the United States. With the newly 
received money Wahconah Stadium is getting a much needed makeover. A brand 
new infield was constructed this fall. The stadium is getting all new bathrooms, 
stadium offices and press box. On May 3, 2009, Williams College and Amherst 
College alumni played a game of vintage baseball at Wahconah Park according 
to 1859-rules to commemorate the 150th-anniversary of the first college 
baseball game played on July 2, 1859 between the two schools. Amherst-almnus 
Dan Duquette was instrumental in organizing the event.[4] On November 22, 
2011 the Pittsfield Parks and Commissioner Board unanimously approved the 
Futures Collegiate Baseball League to operate an expansion franchise at 
Wahconah Park. Marvin Goldklang is the majority owner, with the Goldklang 
Group taking up much of the remainder of the ownership.[5] Goldklang formerly 
owned and operated the Pittsfield Mets; he currently owns four other minor 
league baseball teams: the Charleston RiverDogs, Fort Myers Miracle, Hudson
