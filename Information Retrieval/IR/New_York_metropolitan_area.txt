The New York metropolitan area, also referred to as the Tri-State Area, 
includes the most populous city in the United States (New York City); Long 
Island and the Mid- and Lower Hudson Valley in the state of New York; the 
five largest cities in New Jersey (Newark – the largest city in New Jersey 
– Jersey City, Paterson, Elizabeth, and Edison) and their vicinities; six 
of the seven largest cities in Connecticut (Bridgeport – the largest city 
in Connecticut – New Haven, Stamford, Waterbury, Norwalk, and Danbury) 
and their vicinities; and five counties in northeastern Pennsylvania. As 
per the 2015 United States Census Bureau estimates, the New York metropolitan 
area remains, by a significant margin, the most populous in the United 
States, as defined by both the Metropolitan Statistical Area (20.2 million 
residents)[2] and the Combined Statistical Area (23.7 million residents);[1] 
it is also one of the most populous urban agglomerations in the world, 
and the single largest in North America.[3][4][5] The New York metropolitan 
area continues to be the premier gateway for legal immigration to the United 
States,[6][7][8][9] with the largest foreign-born population of any metropolitan 
region in the world. The MSA covers 6,720 sq mi (17,405 km2), while the 
CSA area is 13,318 sq mi (34,493 km2), encompassing an ethnically and geographically 
diverse region. The New York metropolitan area's population is larger than 
that of the state of New York. As a center of many industries, including 
finance, international trade, new and traditional media, real estate, education, 
fashion and entertainment, tourism, biotechnology, and manufacturing, the 
New York City metropolitan region is one of the most important economic 
regions in the world; in 2015, the MSA produced a gross metropolitan product 
(GMP) of nearly US$1.60 trillion,[10] while in 2015, the CSA[11] had a 
GMP of over US$1.83 trillion, both ranking first nationally by a wide margin 
and behind the GDP of only nine nations and seven nations, respectively.[12] 
In 2012, the New York metropolitan area was also home to seven of the 25 
wealthiest counties in the United States by median household income, according 
to the American Community Survey.[13] According to Forbes, in 2014, the 
New York City metropolitan area was home to eight of the top ten ZIP codes 
in the United States by median housing price, with six in Manhattan alone.[14] 
The New York metropolitan region's higher education network comprises hundreds 
of colleges and universities, including Princeton University, Columbia 
University, Yale University, New York University, and Rockefeller University, 
which have been ranked among the top 35 in the world.[15][16] The U.S. 
Office of Management and Budget utilizes two definitions of the area: the 
Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) and the Combined Statistical Area (CSA). 
The MSA definition is titled the New York-Newark-Jersey City, NY-NJ-PA 
Metropolitan Statistical Area, and includes a population of 20.2 million 
people by 2015 Census estimates, roughly 1 in 16 Americans and a couple 
million more than the second-place Los Angeles metropolitan area in the 
United States.[2] The MSA is further subdivided into four metropolitan 
divisions. The 25-county metropolitan area includes 12 counties in New 
York State (coinciding with the five boroughs of New York City, the two 
counties of Long Island, and five counties in the lower Hudson Valley); 
12 counties in Northern and Central New Jersey; and seven counties in northeastern 
Pennsylvania. The largest urbanized area in the United States is at the 
heart of the metropolitan area, the New York–Newark, NY–NJ–CT Urbanized 
Area (estimated to have an area of 6,720 square miles). The counties and 
county groupings constituting the New York metropolitan area are listed 
below, with 2012 population estimates: New York–Newark–Jersey City, NY–NJ–PA 
Metropolitan Statistical Area (19,831,858) (Note: 20,182,305 estimated 
in 2015[2]) Combined Statistical Areas (CSA) group together adjacent core-based 
statistical areas with a high degree of economic interconnection.[17] The 
New York-Newark, NY-NJ-CT-PA Combined Statistical Area had an estimated 
population of 23.7 million as of 2014.[1] About one out of every fifteen 
Americans resides in this region, which includes seven additional counties 
in New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut. This area, less the Pennsylvania 
portion, is often referred to as the Tri-State Area and less commonly the 
Tri-state Region. The New York City television designated market area (DMA) 
includes Pike County, Pennsylvania,[18] which is also included in the CSA. 
In addition to the New York–Newark–Jersey City, NY–NJ–PA Metropolitan Statistical 
Area, the following core-based statistical areas are also included in the 
New York-Newark, NY-NJ-CT-PA Combined Statistical Area: The area is frequently 
divided into the following subregions:[20][21] All eight subregions are 
often further divided. For instance, Long Island can be divided into its 
South and North Shores (usually when speaking about Nassau County and western 
Suffolk County) and the East End. The Hudson Valley and Connecticut are 
sometimes grouped together and referred to as the Northern Suburbs, largely 
because of the shared usage of the Metro-North Railroad system.[22] The 
geographical, cultural, and economic center of the metropolitan area is 
New York City, which consists of five boroughs, each of which is also a 
county of New York State.[23] The five boroughs – Brooklyn, Queens, Manhattan, 
the Bronx, and Staten Island – were consolidated into a single city in 
1898.[24] With a Census-estimated population of 8,550,405 in 2015 (8,491,079 
in 2014[25][26]), distributed over a land area of just 305 square miles 
(790 km2),[27] New York is the most densely populated major city in the 
United States.[28] Long Island is an island located just off the northeast 
coast of the United States and a region wholly within both the U.S. state 
of New York and the New York City metropolitan area. Stretching east-northeast 
from New York Harbor into the Atlantic Ocean, the island comprises four 
counties: Kings and Queens (these form the New York City boroughs of Brooklyn 
and Queens, respectively) to the west; then Nassau and Suffolk to the east. 
However, most people in the New York metropolitan area (even those living 
in Queens and Brooklyn) colloquially use the term "Long Island" (or "The 
Island") exclusively to refer to the Nassau-Suffolk county area collectively, 
which is mainly suburban in character.[29] North of the island is Long 
Island Sound, across which are the states of Connecticut and Rhode Island. 
With a Census-estimated population of 7,838,722 in 2015, constituting nearly 
40% of New York State's population,[30][31][32][33][34] Long Island is 
the most populated island in any U.S. state or territory, and the 17th-most 
populous island in the world (ahead of Ireland, Jamaica, and Hokkaidō). 
Its population density is 5,571 inhabitants per square mile (2,151/km2). 
If Long Island geographically constituted an independent metropolitan statistical 
area, it would rank fourth most populous in the United States; while if 
it were a U.S. state, Long Island would rank 13th in population and first 
in population density. Queens is the most ethnically diverse urban area 
in the world.[35][36] Long Island is the most populated island in the United 
States and the 17th most populous island in the world. Known especially 
for recreation, boating and miles of public beaches, including numerous 
town, county and state parks and Fire Island National Seashore. Along the 
north shore, the Gold Coast of Long Island is an upscale section of Nassau 
and western Suffolk counties that once featured many lavish mansions built 
and inhabited by wealthy business tycoons in the earlier years of the 20th 
century, of which only a few remain preserved as historic sites. The East 
End of Long Island (known as the "Twin Forks" because of its physical shape) 
boasts open spaces for farmland and wineries. The South Fork, in particular, 
comprises numerous towns and villages known collectively as "The Hamptons" 
and has an international reputation as a "playground for the rich and famous", 
with some of the wealthiest communities in the United States. In 2015, 
according to Business Insider, the 11962 zip code encompassing Sagaponack, 
within Southampton, was listed as the most expensive in the U.S. by real 
estate-listings site Property Shark, with a median home sale price of $5,125,000.[37] 
During the summer season, many celebrities and the wealthy visit or reside 
in mansions and waterfront homes, while others spend weekends enjoying 
the beaches, gardens, bars, restaurants, and nightclubs. Long Island is 
served by a network of parkways and expressways, with the Long Island Expressway, 
Northern State Parkway, and Southern State Parkway being major east-west 
routes across significant portions of the island. Passenger rail access 
is provided by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) Long Island 
Rail Road, one of the largest commuter railroads in the United States. 
Air travel needs are served by several airports – most notably Farmingdale-Republic 
Airport (private and commuter) and Islip-MacArthur Airport (commercial 
airlines), both in Suffolk County. Within Queens, it is home to John F. 
Kennedy International Airport and LaGuardia Airport, two of the three major 
airline hubs serving the New York City area (with Newark Liberty International 
Airport being the third; all three major airports are operated by The Port 
Authority of New York & New Jersey). Northern New Jersey is typically defined 
as the following counties: The New Jersey State Department of Tourism splits 
North Jersey into the urban Gateway Region and the more rural Skylands 
Region. Northern New Jersey is home to four of the largest cities of that 
state: Newark, Jersey City, Paterson, and Elizabeth. The region is geographically 
diverse with wetlands, mountains, and valleys throughout the area. It has 
a large network of expressways and public transportation rail services, 
mostly operated by New Jersey Transit. It is also home to the second busiest 
airport in the metropolitan area, Newark Liberty International Airport. 
Central Jersey is the middle portion of the state of New Jersey. Municipalities 
including Trenton (State capital of New Jersey) and Princeton (home to 
Princeton University) are located in this subregion, as is a significant 
portion of the Jersey Shore. Known for its hilly terrain, picturesque settings, 
and quaint small towns and villages, the Lower Hudson Valley is centered 
around the Hudson River north of New York City and lies within New York 
State. Its two most populous counties, Westchester and Rockland, are located 
on opposite sides of the river, connected by the heavily trafficked Tappan 
Zee Bridge (a major commuter route from Rockland towards New York City) 
as well as the Bear Mountain Bridge near their northern ends. Several branches 
of the MTA Metro-North Railroad serve the region's rail commuters. Southern 
Westchester County contains more densely populated areas and includes the 
cities of Yonkers, Mount Vernon, New Rochelle, and White Plains. Although 
many of the suburban communities of Westchester are known for their affluence 
and expense (some examples: Scarsdale, Chappaqua, Armonk, Katonah, and 
Briarcliff Manor), the Lower Hudson Valley as a whole is one of the fastest-growing 
areas in the metropolitan area because of high housing costs in New York 
City and the inner suburbs. Historically, the valley was home to many factories, 
including paper mills, but a significant number have closed. After years 
of lingering pollution, cleanup efforts to improve the Hudson River water 
quality are currently planned and will be supervised by the United States 
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).[40] Fairfield, New Haven, and Litchfield 
Counties are in western Connecticut. Large business and industrial parks 
are scattered throughout the area, though mostly contained within Fairfield 
County. The three counties (and Connecticut in general) are known for affluence. 
Geographically, the areas are flat along the coast with low hills eventually 
giving way to large mountain ranges such as The Berkshires further inland, 
to the Massachusetts border. Most of the largest cities in the state are 
located within New Haven County (home to Yale University) and Fairfield 
County. Pike County is located in northeastern Pennsylvania. As of the 
2010 Census, the population was 57,369.[41] Its county seat is Milford.[42] 
Part of the Pocono Mountains region lies within Pike County, which has 
ranked among the fastest-growing counties of Pennsylvania.[43] Monroe County 
was added to the CMSA in March 2013, as was the Lehigh Valley. Monroe's 
county seat is Stroudsburg, and its largest borough is East Stroudsburg. 
Monroe and Pike are the fastest-growing counties in Pennsylvania and are 
home to many residents who commute to jobs in Northern New Jersey and New 
York City. They are located largely in the Pocono Mountains and have multiple 
state parks as well as most of the Pennsylvania portion of the Delaware 
Water Gap National Recreation Area. Efforts continue to resume passenger 
rail service on the Lackawanna Cutoff route between Scranton and Northern 
New Jersey via Monroe County. The Allentown-Bethlehem-Easton MSA (better 
known as the Lehigh Valley) consists of Carbon, Lehigh, and Northampton 
constitutes the third-largest metropolitan area of Pennsylvania and Allentown 
is Pennsylvania's third-largest city. The region is important for east-west 
transportation between Greater NYC, the Harrisburg metropolitan area, and 
points west, both by rail and Interstate 78. It also important for north-south 
road traffic via Interstate 476 and the Route 33 Expressway. The Lehigh 
Valley is in the process of major urban economic redevelopment including 
the Two Rivers Landing in downtown Easton, the Steel Stacks/Sands complex 
on the south side of Bethlehem, and a multi-purpose arena (which hosted 
its first event on 12 September 2014) in downtown Allentown. In 2010 the 
population was 712,481 for the PA portion and 821,173 in the MSA as a whole. 
While a large portion of Carbon County is in the Pocono Mountains, it is 
also in the Lehigh River valley and the employment interchange is mainly 
with Lehigh and Northampton Counties. The combined statistical area is 
a multicore metropolitan region containing several urban areas. The following 
is a list of "principal cities" and their respective population estimates 
from the 2010 U.S. Census Bureau publication. Principal cities are generally 
those where there is a greater number of jobs than employed residents.[48][49][50][51] 
Under the Köppen climate classification, using the 0 °C (32 °F) January 
isotherm, New York City, western (and parts of eastern) Long Island, and 
a sliver of the Jersey Shore experience a humid subtropical climate (Cfa),[52][53] 
and New York is thus the northernmost major city on the North American 
continent with this climate type. Much of the remainder of the metropolitan 
area lies in the transition zone from a humid subtropical (Cfa) to a humid 
continental climate (Dfa),[52][53] and it is only the inland, more exurban 
areas far to the north and west such as Sussex County, New Jersey, that 
have a January daily average of −3 °C (26.6 °F) or below and are fully 
humid continental; the Dfb (warm summer subtype) regime is only found inland 
at a higher elevation,[52] and receives greater snowfall[54] than the Dfa 
region. Carbon, Monroe, and Pike Counties in Pennsylvania also have a fully 
humid continental climate, as do colder areas of Lehigh and Northampton 
Counties. The oceanic climate zone (Cfb) only exists on the North Fork, 
islands in Peconic Bay, and Fishers Island. It is rare in eastern North 
America. Winters are cold and damp, and prevailing wind patterns that blow 
offshore minimize the moderating effects of the Atlantic Ocean; yet the 
Atlantic and the partial shielding by the Appalachians from colder air 
keep the New York area warmer in the winter than inland North American 
metropolitan areas located at similar or lesser latitudes including Pittsburgh, 
Cincinnati, and Indianapolis. Warm periods with 50 °F (10 °C)+ temperatures 
may occasionally occur during winter.[55] Spring and autumn are unpredictable 
and can range from chilly to warm, although they are usually mild with 
low humidity. Summers in the area are typically hot and humid. Nighttime 
conditions in and around the Five Boroughs are often exacerbated by the 
urban heat island phenomenon, and temperatures exceed 90 °F (32 °C) on 
average of 7–8 days (on the immediate Long Island Sound and Atlantic coasts), 
up to in excess of 27 days (inland suburbs in New Jersey) each summer and 
may exceed 100 °F (38 °C).[56] Almost all of the metro area receives at 
least 42 inches (1,070 mm) of precipitation annually, which is fairly spread 
throughout the year, and many areas receive upwards of 50 in (1,270 mm). 
Average winter snowfall for 1981 to 2010 ranges from just under 25 inches 
(64 cm) along the coast of Long Island to more than 50 in (127 cm) in some 
inland areas, but this usually varies considerably from year to year.[57] 
Hurricanes and tropical storms are rare in the New York area, but are not 
unheard of and always have the potential to strike the area, with storm 
surge a major threat in coastal areas and heavy rain (with the danger of 
flooding) further inland.[58] The New York metro area averages 234 days 
with at least some sunshine and 59% of possible sunlight annually,[59] 
accumulating 2,400 to 2,800 hours of sunshine per annum.[60] See Geography 
of New York City for additional climate information from the outer boroughs. 
During the Wisconsinan glaciation, the region was situated at the edge 
of a large ice sheet over 1000 feet in depth. The ice sheet scraped away 
large amounts of soil, leaving the bedrock that serves as the geologic 
foundation for much of the New York City metropolitan region today. Later 
on, the ice sheet would help split apart what are now Long Island and Staten 
Island. At the time of European contact the region was inhabited by Native 
Americans, predominantly the Lenape[71] and others. The Native Americans 
used the abundant waterways in the area for many purposes such as fishing 
and trade routes. Sailing for France in 1524, Giovanni da Verrazzano was 
the first European to enter the local waters and encounter the residents, 
but he did not make landfall. Henry Hudson, sailing for the Dutch in 1609, 
visited the area and built a settlement on Lower Manhattan Island that 
was eventually renamed New Amsterdam by Dutch colonists in 1626.[72] The 
area came under English control in 1664[72][73] and was renamed New York 
after King Charles II of England granted the lands to his brother, the 
Duke of York.[74][75] As the fur trade expanded north, New York became 
a trading hub, which brought in a diverse set of ethnic groups including 
Africans, Jews, and Portuguese. The island of Manhattan had an extraordinary 
natural harbor formed by New York Bay (actually the drowned lower river 
valley of the Hudson River, enclosed by glacial moraines), the East River 
(actually a tidal strait), and the Hudson River, all of which merge at 
the southern tip, from which all later development spread. During the American 
Revolution, the strategic waterways made New York vitally important as 
a wartime base for the British navy. Many battles such as the Battle of 
Long Island and the Battle of New York were fought in the region to secure 
it. New York City was captured by the British early in the war, becoming 
a haven for Loyalist refugees from other parts of the country, and remained 
in the hands of the British until the war ended in 1783. New York served 
as the capital of the United States from 1785 until 1790,[76] after which 
the capital moved to Philadelphia. New York City has been the country's 
largest city since 1790.[77] In 1792, the Buttonwood Agreement, made by 
a group of merchants, created what is now the New York Stock Exchange in 
Lower Manhattan. Today, many people in the metropolitan area work in this 
important stock exchange. The Statue of Liberty in New York Harbor greeted 
millions of immigrants as they came to America by ship in the late 19th 
and early 20th centuries[78] and is a globally recognized symbol of the 
United States and its democracy.[79] Large-scale immigration into New York 
was a result of a large demand for manpower. A cosmopolitan attitude in 
the city created tolerance for various cultures and ethnic groups. German, 
Irish, and Italian immigrants were among the largest ethnic groups. Today, 
many of their descendants continue to live in the region. Cultural buildings 
such as the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Metropolitan Opera, the American 
Museum of Natural History were built. New York newspapers were read around 
the country as media moguls James Gordon Bennett, Sr., Joseph Pulitzer 
and William Randolph Hearst battled for readership. In 1884, over 70% of 
exports passed through ports in New York or in one of the surrounding towns. 
The five boroughs of New York City — The Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens, 
and Staten Island — were consolidated into a single city in 1898.[80][81] 
The now-unified New York City encouraged both more physical connections 
between the boroughs and the growth of bedroom communities. The New York 
City Subway began operating in 1904 as the Interborough Rapid Transit Company, 
one of three systems (the other two being the Brooklyn-Manhattan Transit 
Corporation and the Independent Subway System) that were later taken over 
by the city. Railroad stations such as Grand Central Terminal and Pennsylvania 
Station helped fuel suburban growth. During the era of the Prohibition, 
when alcohol was banned nationwide, organized crime grew to supply the 
high demand for bootleg alcohol. The Broadway Theater District developed 
with the showing of the musical, Show Boat. The Great Depression suspended 
the region's fortunes as a period of widespread unemployment and poverty 
began. City planner Robert Moses began his automobile-centered career of 
building bridges, parkways, and later expressways. During World War II, 
the city economy was hurt by blockades of German U-Boats, which limited 
shipping with Europe. After its population peaked in 1950, much of the 
city's population began leaving for the suburbs of New York City. The effects 
were a result of white flight. Industry and commerce also declined in this 
era, with businesses leaving for the suburbs and other cities. Crime affected 
the city severely. Urban renewal projects alleviated the decay in Midtown 
Manhattan to a certain extent, but later failed. Blackouts such as the 
Northeast Blackout of 1965 and the New York City Blackout of 1977 caused 
massive rioting. A rare highlight was the completion of the former World 
Trade Center, which once stood as the tallest buildings in the world. In 
the 1980s, the city economy was booming. Wall Street was fueling an economic 
surge in the real estate market. Despite this, crime was still an issue. 
Beginning in the 1990s, however, crime dropped substantially. Crime in 
New York City has continued to decline through the 21st century. A major 
event in the region's history was the September 11th attacks in 2001, that 
killed nearly 3,000 people as two planes crashed into the former World 
Trade Center and caused the towers to collapse. Businesses led an exodus 
from Lower Manhattan because of this. In 2003, another blackout occurred, 
the 2003 North America blackout, but the city suffered no looting and a 
building boom in New York City continues to this day. On October 29 and 
30, 2012, Hurricane Sandy caused extensive destruction in the metropolitan 
area, ravaging portions of the Atlantic coastline with record-high storm 
surge, severe flooding, and high winds, causing power outages for millions 
of residents via downed trees and power lines and malfunctions at electrical 
substations, leading to gasoline shortages and snarling mass transit systems. 
Damage to New York and New Jersey in terms of physical infrastructure and 
private property as well as including interrupted commerce was estimated 
at several tens of billions of dollars.[83] The storm and its profound 
impacts have prompted the discussion of constructing seawalls and other 
coastal barriers around the shorelines of the metropolitan area to minimize 
the risk of destructive consequences from another such event in the future.[84][85] 
The U.S. Census Bureau first designated metropolitan areas in 1950 as standard 
metropolitan areas (SMAs). The "New York–Northeastern NJ SMA" was defined 
to include 17 counties: 9 in New York (the five boroughs of New York City, 
Nassau, Suffolk, Westchester, and Rockland) and 8 in New Jersey (Bergen, 
Hudson, Passaic, Essex, Union, Morris, Somerset, and Middlesex). In 1960, 
the metropolitan area standards were modified and renamed standard metropolitan 
statistical areas (SMSAs). The new standards resulted in the splitting 
of the former SMA into several pieces: the nine New York counties became 
the "New York SMSA"; three of the New Jersey counties (Essex, Union, and 
Morris) became the "Newark SMSA"; two other New Jersey counties (Bergen 
and Passaic) became the "Paterson–Passaic–Clifton SMSA"; Hudson County 
was designated the "Jersey City SMSA"; and Middlesex and Somerset counties 
lost their metropolitan status. In 1973, a new set of metropolitan area 
standards resulted in further changes: Nassau and Suffolk counties were 
split off as their own SMSA ("Nassau–Suffolk SMSA"); Bergen County (originally 
part of the Paterson–Clifton–Passaic SMSA) was transferred to the New York 
SMSA; the New York SMSA also received Putnam County (previously non-metropolitan); 
Somerset County was added to the Newark SMSA; and two new SMSAs, the "New 
Brunswick–Perth Amboy–Sayreville SMSA" (Middlesex County) and "Long Branch–Asbury 
Park SMSA" (Monmouth County), were established. In 1983, the concept of 
a consolidated metropolitan statistical area (CMSA) was first implemented. 
A CMSA consisted of several primary metropolitan statistical areas (PMSAs), 
which were individual employment centers within a wider labor market area. 
The "New York–Northern New Jersey–Long Island CMSA" consisted of 12 PMSAs. 
Seven PMSAs were based on the original 1950 New York SMA that were split 
up: New York, Bergen–Passaic, Jersey City, Middlesex–Somerset–Hunterdon 
(Hunterdon added for the first time), Monmouth–Ocean (Ocean added for the 
first time), Nassau–Suffolk, and Newark (Sussex added for the first time). 
One additional PMSA was the Orange County PMSA (previously the Newburgh–Middletown 
SMSA). The other four PMSAs were former SMSAs in Connecticut: Bridgeport, 
Stamford, Norwalk, and Danbury. In 1993, four PMSAs were added to the New 
York–Northern New Jersey–Long Island CMSA: Trenton PMSA (Mercer County), 
Dutchess County PMSA, Waterbury PMSA, and New Haven PMSA. Several new counties 
were also added to the CMSA: Sussex, Warren, and Pike. The CMSA model was 
originally utilized for tabulating data from the 2000 census. In 2003, 
a new set of standards was established using the Core Based Statistical 
Area (CBSA) model was adopted and remains in use as of 2010. The CBSA model 
resulted in the splitting up of the old CMSA into several metropolitan 
statistical areas: New York–Northern New Jersey–Long Island, Poughkeepsie–Newburgh–Middletown, 
Trenton–Ewing, Bridgeport–Stamford–Norwalk (includes Danbury), and New 
Haven–Milford (includes Waterbury). In 2013, the Census Bureau added Carbon, 
Lehigh, Northampton, and Monroe counties in Pennsylvania, and Warren County, 
New Jersey (encompassing collectively the Allentown-Bethlehem-Easton, PA-NJ 
MSA and the East Stroudsburg, PA MSA), to the Combined Statistical Area,[86] 
and assimilated Poughkeepsie–Newburgh–Middletown into the larger New York–Northern 
New Jersey–Long Island–NY–NJ–PA MSA. As of the 2010 Census, the metropolitan 
area had a population of 22,085,649. The population density was 1,865 per 
square mile. The racial markup was 51.7% White (non-Latino), 21.7% Latino, 
15.3% African-American, 9.0% Asian-American, 0.16% Native American and 
Alaskan Native, 0.03% Pacific Islands American, 0.5% Other, and 1.6% Multiracial.[95] 
The median age was 37.9. 25.5% were under 18, 9.5% were 18 to 24 years, 
28% were 25 to 44 years of age, 26.6% were 45 to 64 years old, and 13.2% 
were over the age of 65. Males composed 48.3% of the population while females 
were 51.7% of the population.[citation needed] 97.7% of the population 
were in households, 2.3% were in group quarters, and 1% were institutionalized. 
There were 8,103,731 households of which 30.2% or 2,449,343 had children. 
46.1% or 3,736,165 were composed of opposite sex and married couples. Male 
households with no wife composed 4.9% or 400,534. 15.0% or 1,212,436 were 
female households, with no husbands. 34% or 2,754,596 were non-family households. 
The household density was 684 per square mile. 91.9% of housing units were 
occupied with a 3.8% vacancy rate. The average household size was 2.65 
per household. The average income for non-family households was $90,335, 
and the average income for families was $104,715. 13.3% or 2,888,493 of 
the population were below the poverty line.[citation needed] 26.7% or 5,911,993 
of the population were born outside the United States. Out of this, 17.4% 
or 1,028,506 were born in Europe, 27.0% or 1,595,523 were born in Asia, 
3.8% or 224,109 were born in Africa, 0.2% or 11,957 were born in Oceania, 
50.6% or 2,992,639 were born in Latin America.[citation needed] As of July 
1, 2015, the United States Census Bureau estimated the population of the 
New York City metropolitan area at 23,723,696, an increase of 647,032 from 
2010.[1] The New York City metropolitan region is ethnically diverse. Asian 
Americans in New York City, according to the 2010 Census, number more than 
one million, greater than the combined totals of San Francisco and Los 
Angeles.[96] New York contains the highest total Asian population of any 
U.S. city proper.[97] The New York City borough of Queens is home to the 
state's largest Asian American population and the largest Andean (Colombian, 
Ecuadorian, Peruvian, and Bolivian) populations in the United States, and 
is also the most ethnically diverse urban area in the world.[98][99] The 
Han Chinese population constitutes the fastest-growing ethnicity in New 
York State; multiple satellites of the original Manhattan Chinatown (紐約華埠), 
in Brooklyn (布鲁克林華埠), and around Flushing, Queens (法拉盛華埠), are thriving 
as traditionally urban enclaves, while also expanding rapidly eastward 
into suburban Nassau County (拿騷縣)[100] on Long Island (長島),[101] as the 
New York metropolitan region and New York State have become the top destinations 
for new Chinese immigrants, respectively, and large-scale Chinese immigration 
continues into New York City and surrounding areas.[102][103][104][105][106][107] 
In 2012, 6.3% of New York City was of Chinese ethnicity, with nearly three-fourths 
living in either Queens or Brooklyn, geographically on Long Island.[108] 
In particular, the New York area has over 100,000 Fuzhounese people.[109] 
A community numbering 20,000 Korean-Chinese (Chaoxianzu (Chinese: 朝鲜族) 
or Joseonjok (Hangul: 조선족)) is centered in Flushing, Queens, while New 
York City is also home to the largest Tibetan population outside China, 
India, and Nepal, also centered in Queens.[110] Koreans made up 1.2% of 
the city's population, and Japanese 0.3%. Filipinos were the largest Southeast 
Asian ethnic group at 0.8%, followed by Vietnamese, who made up 0.2% of 
New York City's population in 2010. Indians are the largest South Asian 
group, comprising 2.4% of the city's population, with Bangladeshis and 
Pakistanis at 0.7% and 0.5%, respectively.[111] Queens is the preferred 
borough of settlement for Asian Indians, Koreans, and Filipinos,[112] as 
well as Malaysians[6] and other Southeast Asians;[113] while Brooklyn is 
receiving large numbers of both West Indian as well as Asian Indian immigrants. 
New York City has the largest European and non-Hispanic white population 
of any American city. At 2.7 million in 2012, New York's non-Hispanic white 
population is larger than the non-Hispanic white populations of Los Angeles 
(1.1 million), Chicago (865,000), and Houston (550,000) combined.[114] 
The European diaspora residing in the city is very diverse. According to 
2012 Census estimates, there were roughly 560,000 Italian Americans, 385,000 
Irish Americans, 253,000 German Americans, 223,000 Russian Americans, 201,000 
Polish Americans, and 137,000 English Americans. Additionally, Greek and 
French Americans numbered 65,000 each, with those of Hungarian descent 
estimated at 60,000 people. Ukrainian and Scottish Americans numbered 55,000 
and 35,000, respectively. People identifying ancestry from Spain numbered 
30,838 total in 2010.[115] People of Norwegian and Swedish descent both 
stood at about 20,000 each, while people of Czech, Lithuanian, Portuguese, 
Scotch-Irish, and Welsh descent all numbered between 12,000–14,000 people.[116] 
Arab Americans number over 160,000 in New York City,[117] with the highest 
concentration in Brooklyn. Central Asians, primarily Uzbek Americans, are 
a rapidly growing segment of the city's non-Hispanic white population, 
enumerating over 30,000, and including over half of all Central Asian immigrants 
to the United States,[118] most settling in Queens or Brooklyn. Albanian 
Americans are most highly concentrated in the Bronx.[119] The wider New 
York City metropolitan area is also ethnically diverse.[122] The New York 
region continues to be by far the leading metropolitan gateway for legal 
immigrants admitted into the United States, substantially exceeding the 
combined totals of Los Angeles and Miami, the next most popular gateway 
regions.[123][124][125][126] It is home to the largest Jewish as well as 
Israeli communities outside Israel, with the Jewish population in the region 
numbering over 1.5 million in 2012 and including many diverse Jewish sects 
from around the Middle East and Eastern Europe.[110] The metropolitan area 
is also home to 20% of the nation's Indian Americans and at least 20 Little 
India enclaves, as well as 15% of all Korean Americans and four Koreatowns;[127][128] 
the largest Asian Indian population in the Western Hemisphere; the largest 
Russian American,[102] Italian American, and African American populations; 
the largest Dominican American, Puerto Rican American, and South American[102] 
and second-largest overall Hispanic population in the United States, numbering 
4.8 million;[115] and includes at least 6 established Chinatowns within 
New York City alone,[129] with the urban agglomeration comprising a population 
of 819,527 uniracial overseas Chinese as of 2014 Census estimates,[130] 
the largest outside of Asia.[89][90] Ecuador, Colombia, Guyana, Peru, and 
Brazil were the top source countries from South America for legal immigrants 
to the New York City region in 2013; the Dominican Republic, Jamaica, Haiti, 
and Trinidad and Tobago in the Caribbean; Egypt, Ghana, and Nigeria from 
Africa; and El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala in Central America.[131] 
Amidst a resurgence of Puerto Rican migration to New York City, this population 
had increased to approximately 1.3 million in the metropolitan area as 
of 2013. The New York metropolitan area is home to a self-identifying gay 
and bisexual community estimated at 568,903 individuals, the largest in 
the United States and one of the world's largest.[120][121] Same-sex marriages 
in New York were legalized on June 24, 2011 and were authorized to take 
place beginning 30 days thereafter.[132] The 2014 Pew Religious Landscape 
Survey showed that the religious makeup of the New York City metro area 
was as follows: The New York City regional economy is the largest in the 
United States and one of the most important in the world. In 2015 the CSA 
had a GDP of $1.83 trillion, which would rank 8th among countries. Many 
Fortune 500 corporations are headquartered in New York City,[136] as are 
a large number of foreign corporations. One out of ten private sector jobs 
in the city is with a foreign company.[137] In 2012 and 2015, New York 
City topped the first and second Global Economic Power Index lists, respectively, 
as published by The Atlantic, with cities ranked according to criteria 
reflecting their presence on five different lists as published by five 
separate entities.[138][139] Finance, international trade, new and traditional 
media, real estate, education, fashion and entertainment, tourism, biotechnology, 
and manufacturing are the leading industries in the area. Along with its 
wealth, the area has a cost of living that is among the highest in the 
United States.[140] New York City's most important economic sector lies 
in its role as the headquarters for the U.S. financial industry, metonymously 
known as Wall Street. Anchored by Wall Street, in the Financial District 
of Lower Manhattan, New York City has been called both the most economically 
powerful city and the leading financial center of the world,[138][143][144][145][146] 
and the city is home to the world's two largest stock exchanges by total 
market capitalization, the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ.[141][142] 
The city's securities industry, enumerating 163,400 jobs in August 2013, 
continues to form the largest segment of the city's financial sector and 
an important economic engine, accounting in 2012 for 5 percent of the city's 
private sector jobs, 8.5 percent (US$3.8 billion) of its tax revenue, and 
22 percent of the city's total wages, including an average salary of US$360,700.[147] 
Manhattan had approximately 520 million square feet (48.1 million m²) of 
office space in 2013,[148] making it the largest office market in the United 
States,[149] while Midtown Manhattan is the largest central business district 
in the nation.[150] Lower Manhattan is the third largest central business 
district in the United States and is home to both the New York Stock Exchange, 
on Wall Street, and the NASDAQ, at 165 Broadway, representing the world's 
largest and second largest stock exchanges, respectively, when measured 
both by overall average daily trading volume and by total market capitalization 
of their listed companies in 2013.[142] Wall Street investment banking 
fees in 2012 totaled approximately US$40 billion,[151] while in 2013, senior 
New York City bank officers who manage risk and compliance functions earned 
as much as US$324,000 annually.[152] In July 2013, NYSE Euronext, the operator 
of the New York Stock Exchange, took over the administration of the London 
interbank offered rate from the British Bankers Association.[153] Many 
Wall Street firms have added or moved auxiliary financial or technical 
operations into Jersey City, to take advantage of New Jersey's relatively 
lower commercial real estate and rental prices, while offering continued 
geographic proximity to Manhattan's financial industry ecosystem.[154] 
Silicon Alley, centered in New York City, has evolved into a metonym for 
the sphere encompassing the metropolitan region's high technology industries[156] 
involving the Internet, new media, financial technology (fintech), telecommunications, 
digital media, software development, biotechnology, game design, and other 
fields within information technology that are supported by its entrepreneurship 
ecosystem and venture capital investments. In 2015, Silicon Alley generated 
over US$7.3 billion in venture capital investment,[157] most based in Manhattan, 
as well as in Brooklyn, Queens, and elsewhere in the region. High technology 
startup companies and employment are growing in New York City and across 
the metropolitan region, bolstered by the city's emergence as a global 
node of creativity and entrepreneurship,[157] social tolerance,[158] and 
environmental sustainability,[159][160] as well as New York's position 
as the leading Internet hub and telecommunications center in North America, 
including its vicinity to several transatlantic fiber optic trunk lines,[161] 
the city's intellectual capital, and its extensive outdoor wireless connectivity.[162] 
Verizon Communications, headquartered at 140 West Street in Lower Manhattan, 
was at the final stages in 2014 of completing a US$3 billion fiberoptic 
telecommunications upgrade throughout New York City.[163] The biotechnology 
sector is also growing in the New York metropolitan region, based upon 
its strength in academic scientific research and public and commercial 
financial support. On December 19, 2011, then Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg 
of New York City announced his choice of Cornell University and Technion-Israel 
Institute of Technology to build a US$2 billion graduate school of applied 
sciences on Roosevelt Island, Manhattan with the goal of transforming New 
York City into the world's premier technology capital.[165][166] By mid-2014, 
Accelerator, a biotech investment firm, had raised more than US$30 million 
from investors, including Eli Lilly and Company, Pfizer, and Johnson & 
Johnson, for initial funding to create biotechnology startups at the Alexandria 
Center for Life Science, which encompasses more than 700,000 square feet 
(65,000 m2) on East 29th Street and promotes collaboration among scientists 
and entrepreneurs at the center and with nearby academic, medical, and 
research institutions. The New York City Economic Development Corporation's 
Early Stage Life Sciences Funding Initiative and venture capital partners, 
including Celgene, General Electric Ventures, and Eli Lilly, committed 
a minimum of US$100 million to help launch 15 to 20 ventures in life sciences 
and biotechnology.[167] Westchester County has also developed a burgeoning 
biotechnology sector in the 21st century, with over US$1 billion in planned 
private investment as of 2016,[168] earning the county the nickname Biochester.[169] 
The Port of New York and New Jersey is the port district of the New York 
metropolitan area, encompassing the region within approximately a 25-mile 
(40 km) radius of the Statue of Liberty National Monument. A major economic 
engine for the New York metropolitan area, the port includes the system 
of navigable waterways in the estuary along 650 miles (1,050 km) of shoreline 
in the vicinity of New York City and the Gateway Region of northeastern 
New Jersey, as well as the region's airports and supporting rail and roadway 
distribution networks. In 2010, 4,811 ships entered the harbor carrying 
over 32.2 million metric tons of cargo valued at over $175 billion.[170] 
The port handled $208 billion in shipping cargo in 2011. Approximately 
3,200,000 TEUs of containers and 700,000 automobiles are handled per year.[171] 
In the first half of 2014, the port handled 1,583,449 containers, a 35,000-container 
increase above the six-month record set in 2012,[172] while the port handled 
a monthly record of 306,805 containers in October 2014.[173] Water purity 
and availability are a lifeline for the New York City metropolitan region. 
New York City is supplied with drinking water by the protected Catskill 
Mountains watershed.[174] As a result of the watershed's integrity and 
undisturbed natural water filtration system, New York is one of only four 
major cities in the United States the majority of whose drinking water 
is pure enough not to require purification by water treatment plants.[175] 
The Croton Watershed north of the city is undergoing construction of a 
US$3.2 billion water purification plant to augment New York City's water 
supply by an estimated 290 million gallons daily, representing a greater 
than 20% addition to the city's current availability of water.[176] The 
ongoing expansion of New York City Water Tunnel No. 3, an integral part 
of the New York City water supply system, is the largest capital construction 
project in the city's history,[177] with segments serving Manhattan and 
The Bronx completed, and with segments serving Brooklyn and Queens planned 
for construction in 2020.[178] Much of northern and central New Jersey 
is provided by reservoirs to provide fresh water, but numerous municipal 
water wells exist which accomplish the same purpose. The New York metropolitan 
area is home to many prestigious institutions of higher education. Three 
Ivy League universities (Columbia University in Manhattan, Princeton University 
in Princeton, New Jersey, and Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut 
– all ranked amongst the top 4 U.S. national universities as per U.S. News 
& World Report as of 2013[179]) reside in the region,[180] as well as New 
York University and The Rockefeller University, both located in Manhattan; 
all of the above have been ranked amongst the top 35 universities in the 
world.[181] Rutgers University, a global university located 27 miles (43 km) 
southwest of Manhattan in New Brunswick, New Jersey, is by far the largest 
university in the region.[182] New York Institute of Technology is located 
on two campuses, one in Old Westbury, Long Island and one near Columbus 
Circle in Manhattan. Fordham University, also a nationally ranked university,[183] 
is located on three campuses, in the Bronx, Manhattan, and Westchester 
County.[184] The New York City Department of Education is the largest school 
district in the United States serving over 1.2 million students.[185] The 
overall region also hosts many public high schools, some of which have 
been described as among the most prestigious in the country.[186] According 
to the 2010 American Community Survey, of the 14,973,063 persons in this 
area over 25 years of age, 14.8% (2,216,578) had a graduate or professional 
degree, 21.1% (3,166,037) had a bachelor's degree, 6.4% (962,007) had an 
associate degree, 16.0% (2,393,990) had some college education but no degree, 
26.8% (4,009,901) had a high school diploma or equivalent, 14.8% (2,224,557) 
had less than a high school education.[187] In 2010, CNN Money ranked the 
area as one of the top 10 smartest regions in the United States.[188] The 
depth and intricacy of the transportation network in the New York City 
region parallel the size and complexity of the metropolis itself. About 
one in every three users of mass transit in the United States and two-thirds 
of the nation's rail riders live in the New York City metropolitan area.[189][190] 
The New York City Subway is the largest rapid transit system in the world 
when measured by stations in operation, with 469, and by length of routes. 
In 2006 it was the third largest when measured by annual ridership (1.5 billion 
passenger trips in 2006),[191] However, in 2013, the subway delivered over 
1.71 billion rides,[192] but slipped to being the seventh busiest rapid 
transit rail system in the world.[193] New York's subway is also notable 
because nearly the entire system remains open 24 hours a day, in contrast 
to the overnight shutdown common to systems in most cities, including Hong 
Kong,[194][195] London, Seoul,[196][197] Tokyo, and Toronto. The metropolitan 
area is also fundamentally defined by the areas from which people commute 
into New York City. The city is served by three primary commuter rail systems 
plus Amtrak. The Long Island Rail Road (LIRR), the busiest commuter railroad 
in the United States as of 2015,[198] is operated by the Metropolitan Transportation 
Authority (MTA), an agency of the State Government of New York that focuses 
on New York City-area transit). It has two major terminals at Pennsylvania 
Station in Midtown Manhattan and Atlantic Terminal in Downtown Brooklyn, 
with a minor terminal at the Long Island City station and a major transfer 
point at the Jamaica station in Queens. New Jersey Transit (NJT), the second 
busiest commuter railroad in the United States as of 2015,[198] is operated 
by the New Jersey Transit Corporation, an agency of the state of New Jersey, 
in conjunction with Metro-North Railroad and Amtrak. It has major terminals 
at Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan, Hoboken Terminal, and Newark Pennsylvania 
Station, with a major transfer point at Secaucus Junction in Hudson County, 
New Jersey. New Jersey Transit also operates the Hudson–Bergen Light Rail 
through Hudson County, the Newark City Subway, and the River Line that 
runs along tracks shared with Conrail Shared Assets Operations from Trenton 
to Camden in southern New Jersey. NJ Transit also has commuter buses operating 
in and out of Manhattan. Metro-North Railroad (MNRR), the third busiest 
commuter railroad in the United States as of 2015,[198] is also operated 
by the MTA, in conjunction with the Connecticut Department of Transportation 
and New Jersey Transit. Its major terminal is Grand Central Terminal. Trains 
on the Port Jervis Line and Pascack Valley Line terminate at Hoboken Terminal 
in Hoboken, New Jersey; commuters may transfer at either Secaucus Junction 
for New Jersey Transit trains to New York Pennsylvania Station or at Hoboken 
Terminal for PATH trains into Manhattan. Amtrak's Northeast Corridor offers 
service to Philadelphia, New Haven, and other points between and including 
Boston and Washington, D.C. Additionally, the Port Authority of New York 
and New Jersey, an agency controlled by the states of New York and New 
Jersey, operates the PATH system; this heavy rail transportation service 
links Manhattan with the counties of Hudson and Essex, New Jersey. Major 
stations in the metropolitan area include: The following table shows all 
train lines operated by these commuter railroads in the New York metropolitan 
area. New Jersey Transit operates an additional train line in the Philadelphia 
metropolitan area. (Shown counterclockwise from the Atlantic Ocean): The 
following highways serve the region: Some of these roads have a numerical 
designation assigned to it: New Jersey Transit, Academy Bus, Coach USA, 
Spanish Transportation, Trailways of New York, and several other companies 
operate commuter coaches into the Port Authority Bus Terminal in Manhattan, 
and many other bus services in New Jersey. Bus services also operate in 
other nearby counties in the states of New York and Connecticut, but most 
terminate at a subway terminal or other rail station. The New York metropolitan 
area handles the busiest urban airspace in the United States – carrying 
over 100 million passengers annually,[208] and is served by three major 
airports. The following smaller airports are also in the metro area and 
provide daily commercial service: According to the 2010 American Community 
Survey, 54.3% (5,476,169) of commuters used a car or other private vehicle 
alone, 7.0% (708,788) used a carpool, 27.0% (2,721,372) used public transportation, 
5.5% (558,434) walked to work, 2.0% (200,448) used some other means of 
transportation such as a bicycle to get to work.[209] New York City has 
been described as the cultural capital of the world by the diplomatic consulates 
of Iceland[219] and Latvia[220] and by New York's own Baruch College.[221] 
A book containing a series of essays titled New York, culture capital of 
the world, 1940–1965 has also been published as showcased by the National 
Library of Australia.[222] Tom Wolfe has quoted regarding New York's culture 
that "Culture just seems to be in the air, like part of the weather."[223] 
Although Manhattan remains the epicenter of cultural life in the metropolitan 
area, the entire region is replete with prominent cultural institutions, 
with artistic performances and ethnically oriented events receiving international 
attention throughout the year. New York City is home to the headquarters 
of the National Football League,[224] Major League Baseball,[225] the National 
Basketball Association,[226] the National Hockey League,[227] and Major 
League Soccer.[228] Four of the ten most expensive stadiums ever built 
worldwide (MetLife Stadium, the new Yankee Stadium, Madison Square Garden, 
and Citi Field) are located in the New York metropolitan area.[211] The 
New York metropolitan area has the highest total number of professional 
sports teams in these five leagues. Listing of the professional sports 
teams in the New York metropolitan area: The New York City metropolitan 
area is home to the headquarters of several well-known media companies, 
subsidiaries, and publications, including Thomson Reuters, The New York 
Times Company, the Associated Press, Time Warner, NBCUniversal, the Hearst 
Corporation, Viacom, News Corporation, The Wall Street Journal, Fox News, 
ABC, CBS, and NBC. Local television channels include WCBS-TV 2 (CBS), WNBC 
4 (NBC), WNYW 5 (FOX), WABC-TV 7 (ABC), WWOR-TV 9 (MyNetworkTV), WPIX 11 
(CW), WNET 13 (PBS), WNYE-TV 25 (NYC Media) and WPXN-TV 31 (Ion). NY1 is 
a 24/7 local news provider available only to cable television subscribers. 
Radio stations serving the area include: WNYC, WKCR, WFMU, WABC-AM, and 
WFAN. Many television and radio stations use the top of the Empire State 
Building to broadcast their terrestrial television signals, while some 
media entities broadcast from studios in Times Square. The New York metropolitan 
area is extensive enough so that its own channels must compete with channels 
from neighboring television markets (including Philadelphia, Scranton/Wilkes-Barre, 
and Hartford) within its outlying counties. Cable companies offer such 
competition in the Pennsylvania portion, Connecticut, and a few counties 
in central New Jersey. Playland, Rye, Westchester County Plans were unveiled 
by New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg on September 27, 2012 for the 
New York Wheel, a giant Ferris wheel, to be built at the northern shore 
of Staten Island, overlooking the Statue of Liberty, New York Harbor, and 
the Lower Manhattan skyline.[231] Dorney Park & Wildwater Kingdom, Dorneyville, 
Lehigh County Although the DP&WWK complex is not planned as a theme park, 
it is nonetheless one of the largest amusement parks in Pennsylvania and 
draws substantially from Greater NYC since it is just off Interstate 78 
in a location just west of Allentown. The area is served by at least 29 
area codes: 1 Tokyo-Yokohama 2 Jakarta 3 Shanghai 4 Karachi 5 Delhi   6 
Seoul-Incheon   7 Mexico City   8 Beijing   9 Lagos   10 São Paulo 11 Mumbai
