The 1931 World Series featured the two-time defending champion Philadelphia 
Athletics and the St. Louis Cardinals. The Cardinals beat the Athletics 
in seven games, a rematch and reversal of fortunes of the previous World 
Series. The same two teams faced off during the 1930 World Series and the 
Athletics were victorious. The only day-to-day player in the Cardinals' 
lineup who was different in 1931 was the "Wild Horse of the Osage", Pepper 
Martin—a 27-year-old rookie who had spent seven seasons in the minor leagues. 
He led his team for the Series in runs scored, hits, doubles, runs batted 
in and stolen bases, and also made a running catch to stifle a ninth-inning 
rally by the A's in the final game. The spitball pitch was banned by Major 
League Baseball in 1920, but those still using it at that time were "grandfathered", 
or permitted to keep throwing it. One of those who "wet his pill" still 
active in 1931 was Burleigh Grimes, with two Series starts, two wins and 
seven innings of no-hit pitching in Game 3. "Wild" Bill Hallahan started 
and won the other two for the Cards, and saved Game 7. The Athletics had 
captured their third straight American League pennant, winning 107 games 
(and 313 for 1929–31). But this would prove to be the final World Series 
for longtime A's manager Connie Mack. As he did after the Boston "Miracle 
Braves" swept his heavily favored A's in the 1914 Series, Mack would break 
up this great team by selling off his best players, this time out of perceived 
economic necessity rather than pique and competition from the short-lived 
Federal League. It would be the A's last World Series appearance in Philadelphia 
and it would be 41 years—and two cities—later before the A's would return 
to the Fall Classic, after their successive moves to Kansas City in 1955 
and Oakland in 1968. This would also be the city of Philadelphia's last 
appearance in the Series until 1950. NL St. Louis Cardinals (4) vs. AL
