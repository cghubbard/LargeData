Phillip Douglas Coke (born July 19, 1982) is an American professional baseball 
pitcher who is currently a free agent. He previously played for the New 
York Yankees, Detroit Tigers, Chicago Cubs, Toronto Blue Jays, and Pittsburgh 
Pirates. Coke attended San Joaquin Delta College. He was drafted by the 
Florida Marlins in the 49th round (1450th overall) of the 2001 Major League 
Baseball Draft, but did not sign. He was drafted by the New York Yankees 
in the 26th round (786th overall) of the 2002 Major League Baseball Draft, 
and did sign. He began his baseball career with the GCL Yankees in 2003. 
By 2007, Coke had also pitched for the short season Staten Island Yankees, 
Class-A Charleston RiverDogs, and Class-A Advanced Tampa Yankees. He made 
his Double-A debut with the Trenton Thunder in 2008, going 9–4 with a 2.54 
earned run average (ERA) in 23 games (20 starts). Later that year in Triple-A 
with the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Yankees, he pitched in 13 games (starting 
one) and went 2–2 with a 4.67 ERA. He made his major league debut on September 
1, 2008, for the Yankees against the Detroit Tigers with a scoreless inning 
and strikeouts of Curtis Granderson and Miguel Cabrera. In 2009, Coke got 
his first World Series title after the Yankees defeated the Philadelphia 
Phillies in six games. On December 9, 2009, Coke was traded to the Detroit 
Tigers as part of a three-team trade that sent Curtis Granderson to the 
Yankees.[1] Coke's first season in Detroit proved to be successful, as 
he finished 2010 with a 3.76 ERA (his career best to date) with 17 holds 
and 2 saves in 21 hold/save situations. The Tigers signed Coke to a new 
contract on February 7, 2011. After spending all of his previous time in 
the major leagues as a relief pitcher, Coke was moved from the bullpen 
to the fifth spot in the starting rotation to start the 2011 season.[2] 
On June 30, after accumulating a 1–8 record, Coke was moved back to the 
bullpen.[3] He would finish 2011 with a 3–9 record and a 4.47 ERA. On January 
16, 2012, Coke signed a one-year, $1.1 million deal with the Tigers to 
avoid arbitration. He was eligible to earn an additional $50,000 based 
on appearances in the 2012 season.[4] Despite a season in which he posted 
a 4.00 ERA and a 1.65 WHIP, Coke was the Tiger's most reliable reliever 
in the 2012 postseason. Pressed into duty as the team's closer on October 
14, 2012 after regular season closer José Valverde surrendered seven runs 
in his previous two appearances, Phil pitched two shutout innings in Game 
2 of the 2012 ALCS against the Yankees to earn a save, then saved Game 
3 by striking out Raúl Ibañez on a 3–2 slider to preserve a 2–1 victory 
after allowing back-to-back two-out singles. In Game 4, Coke pitched two 
perfect innings to finish off the Tigers' 8–1 win over his former team 
and send Detroit to the World Series for the first time in six years. In 
the 2012 World Series, Coke pitched 3 1⁄3 innings, allowing one run, but 
that run came in the top of the 10th inning of Game 4 and was the game 
and series winner for the Champion San Francisco Giants. This came after 
Coke had struck out the side in the top of the 9th inning which, coupled 
with his appearances in Games 2 and 3 of the series, gave him a World Series 
record seven consecutive strikeouts.[5] Coke finished the 2012 postseason 
allowing one run in 10 2⁄3 innings (0.84 ERA) and striking out 13 batters. 
Coke struggled throughout the 2013 season, failing to thrive as either 
a setup man or a lefty specialist. Tossing only 38 1⁄3 innings on the year, 
Phil's ERA ballooned to a career-high 5.40. On August 20, 2013, after an 
outing against the Minnesota Twins that typified Coke's ineffectiveness 
this season, the Tigers demoted him to their Triple-A farm club in Toledo, 
subsequently promoting left-handed pitcher José Álvarez to the major league 
roster.[6] In 2014, his final season with the Tigers, Coke posted a 5–2 
record with 41 strikeouts and a 3.88 ERA in 58 innings pitched. In March 
2015, Coke signed a minor league contract with the Chicago Cubs, receiving 
a non-roster invitation to spring training.[7] Coke earned a $2.25 million 
salary upon making the team.[8][9] Coke had a 6.30 ERA in 16 appearances, 
allowing left-handed batters to hit .304 (7-for-23) against him. He was 
designated for assignment by the Cubs on May 18, and released by the club 
on May 26.[10][11] On May 30, 2015, Coke signed a minor league contract 
with the Toronto Blue Jays, and was assigned to the Triple-A Buffalo Bisons.[12][13] 
On June 11, the Blue Jays purchased Coke's contract from Triple-A.[14] 
He took the mound for the first time with Toronto on June 14, pitching 
2 scoreless innings in a 13–5 win over the Boston Red Sox.[15] He became 
a free agent again on June 22, after he declined his minor-league assignment 
by the Blue Jays.[16] On June 27, 2015, Coke signed a minor league deal 
with the Oakland Athletics. He was assigned to the Triple-A Nashville Sounds, 
but was released on August 18. Coke signed a minor league contract with 
the Atlanta Braves on March 11, 2016.[17] On March 26, 2016, he was released. 
On April 10, 2016, Coke signed with the Lancaster Barnstormers of the Atlantic 
League of Professional Baseball.[18][19] On April 25, 2016, the Yankees 
acquired Coke from the Atlantic League, and assigned him to Scranton/Wilkes-Barre.[20] 
The Yankees promoted Coke to the major leagues on May 6.[21] He was designated 
for assignment on May 17. On May 21, he was outrighted from the 40-man 
roster and optioned to Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes Barre. On September 22, 
2016, the Pirates acquired Coke from the Yankees for cash considerations. 
Coke throws mainly four-seam and two-seam fastballs. His four-seamer is 
thrown in the 93 to 95 miles per hour (150 to 153 km/h) range, occasionally 
reaching 97 miles per hour (156 km/h). The two-seamer is a shade slower, 
averaging 92 to 93 miles per hour (148 to 150 km/h). He mixes in a slider 
in the 78 to 83 miles per hour (126 to 134 km/h) range and an occasional 
changeup between 83 miles per hour (134 km/h) and 86 miles per hour (138 km/h).[22]
