Chase Jordan Headley (born May 9, 1984) is an American professional baseball 
third baseman for the New York Yankees of Major League Baseball (MLB). 
He previously played in MLB for the San Diego Padres, making his debut 
in 2007. Headley is a switch-hitter. Headley played college baseball for 
the Pacific Tigers and Tennessee Volunteers, before the Padres selected 
him in the 2005 MLB draft. During the 2012 season, Headley led the National 
League (NL) in runs batted in (RBIs) and was honored for his hitting with 
a Silver Slugger Award. He also won a Gold Glove Award for his defense. 
The Padres traded Headley to the Yankees during the 2014 season. Headley 
graduated as valedictorian from Fountain-Fort Carson High School in Fountain, 
Colorado, in 2002. He distinguished himself in two sports, receiving four 
varsity letters in both baseball and basketball. In baseball, he was a 
three-time Colorado All-State player, and was named to the South Metro 
All-League team for all four of his seasons. Other high school honors included 
being named 2002 Player of the Year by the Colorado Springs Gazette, 2002 
Male Scholar-Athlete of the Year by Rotary International/KRDO-TV, and 2002 
Male Athlete of the Year by the Fellowship of Christian Athletes. He was 
selected to play in the 2002 Colorado Rockies Senior All-Star Game, in 
which he hit a home run in his first time at bat. He also played two seasons 
with the Colorado Rockies Select Scout Team, and in the National Baseball 
Congress World Series. In basketball, he was named to the All-Conference 
squad for two seasons.[1] Headley enrolled at the University of the Pacific 
and continued to play baseball in college, playing shortstop for the Pacific 
Tigers. He transitioned to third base, which would become his primary position, 
when he transferred to the University of Tennessee in 2003 to play for 
the Tennessee Volunteers. His sophomore year at Tennessee was difficult 
for him, as he had meniscus surgery on his knee, and a hamstring injury.[2] 
He recovered, however, and worked out 62 walks (breaking Todd Helton's 
1995 school record), approached the college's single-season mark for on-base 
percentage (OBP), and was named the 2004 team Most Valuable Player.[1] 
He also did not neglect his studies, becoming an Academic All-American 
with a 3.63 grade point average, majoring in sports management.[3] The 
San Diego Padres drafted Headley in the second round of the 2005 Major 
League Baseball draft.[3] Headley first played professionally with the 
Eugene Emeralds of the Class A-Short Season Northwest League, where he 
was described as a team "mainstay,"[4] then for the Lake Elsinore Storm 
of the Class A-Advanced California League, where he was called "one of 
the top prospects in the Padres' organization."[5] In 2006, he was one 
of seven players representing the Padres organization in the Arizona Fall 
League, playing for the Peoria Saguaros.[6] He was the only one who had 
not played in a Class AA league before.[7] The San Diego Union-Tribune 
called Headley the Padres' best eventual prospect to fill the third base 
position, though it theorized it would take two years.[8] Headley says: 
Headley was named the 2007 Texas League Player of the Year, after hitting 
.330/.437/.580 with a 1.016 OPS and leading the league in many fielding 
stats for third basemen. He did strike out 114 times, though, in just 443 
at bats. Headley hit well in spring training in 2008, .371 with a team-leading 
12 RBIs, but was sent to the Portland Beavers of the Class AAA Pacific 
Coast Leagueto get more experience playing left field. In 65 games in Portland, 
he hit 13 HRs and 24 doubles, batted .305/.383/.556, and was then called 
up to the Padres. On June 15, 2007, after hitting .357 for the San Antonio 
Missions of the Double-A Texas League, Headley was brought up for 8 games 
because of an injury to Padres third baseman Kevin Kouzmanoff. He made 
his major league debut against the Chicago Cubs at Wrigley Field. His first 
major league hit came on June 17; a single to center field in the second 
inning against the Cubs. Headley finished the season with the majors.[citation

two strikeouts against the Yankees at Yankee Stadium. He picked up his 
first major league home run the following night, an eighth inning shot 
off Kyle Farnsworth. Headley batted .269/.337/.420, with nine home runs 
and 104 strikeouts in 331 at bats that year.[citation needed] Headley began 
the 2009 season as the Padres' starting left fielder. On July 10, he was 
the only player to reach base during Jonathan Sánchez's no-hitter, reaching 
on an error by Juan Uribe, and ending the perfect game bid after 22 straight 
retirements. He finished the season with a .262 BA, 12 HR, 64 RBIs and 
a .734 OPS. Headley also had the second-highest Range Factor/Game as LF.[citation

to the Oakland Athletics, moving Headley back to third base, his original 
position. On April 16, Headley hit a walk-off three-run HR off Diamondbacks 
pitcher Juan Gutierrez, snapping the Padres two-game losing streak. Headley 
finished the season with a .264 batting average, 11 HR, 17 SB and a .702 
OPS. He led the National League in games played at third base and appeared 
in the top 10 for Defensive WAR (1.5), Games Played (161), At Bats (610), 
Plate Appearances (674), singles, assists at 3B, and fielding % at 3B (.966).[citation 
needed] Headley had multiple career bests in 2011, batting .289/.374/.399 
with a .773 OPS. But an injury limited Headley to only 4 home runs in 381 
at bats. He also led the National league in putouts at 3B.[citation needed] 
During spring training in 2012, Headley set initial goals of hitting 15 
home runs and recording 75 RBIs in the upcoming season after a discussion 
with former Padre and Hall of Fame outfielder Dave Winfield. While the 
Padres were extending contracts of some of their players, they did not 
pursue a deal with Headley due to the potential of third base prospects 
Jedd Gyorko and Logan Forsythe. Headley was rumored to be traded but was 
kept at the trade deadline in July.[10][11] He was named the NL Player 
of the Week for the week ending August 12 in 2012. He was later named NL 
Player of the Month for August, becoming the first Padre to be so honored 
since Tony Gwynn won the award in May 1997. Headley that month was tied 
for the major league lead in home runs (10) and led the majors with 31 
RBIs. He hit .306 (33-for-108) in August with 20 runs scored and a .611 
slugging percentage (SLG).[12] He earned a second consecutive Player of 
the Month honor in September after hitting .324 that month with nine homers, 
30 RBIs, a .410 OBP, and a .645 SLG. He was the second Padre to win Player 
of the Month in consecutive months, the first being third baseman Ken Caminiti 
in August and September of 1996.[13] He became the first Padre to ever 
have more than one 30-RBI month. Over the final 57 games of the season, 
he batted .313 with 19 homers, 44 runs scored and 63 RBIs.[10] Headley 
was unanimously voted the Padre Player of the Year by the San Diego chapter 
of the Baseball Writers' Association of America (BBWAA) after hitting .286 
and leading the league in RBIs with 115.[13][14] He joined Winfield (118 
in 1979) as the only Padres to lead the league in RBIs. Headley set career 
highs in hits (173), runs (95), home runs (31), walks (86), RBIs, total 
bases (301), OBP (.376) and SLG (.498) and matched career highs in games 
played (161), doubles (31) and steals (17). He reached base in 146 games, 
breaking the Padres record held by Gwynn (144 in 1987)[13][15] Headley 
won a Gold Glove Award after leading all major league third basemen in 
games played (159) and assists (315) and the National League in total chances 
(425).[16] He also won a Silver Slugger Award after leading all NL third 
basemen in home runs, runs scored, and walks. He was the eighth third baseman 
in NL history to win a Gold Glove and a Silver Slugger in the same season.[14][17] 
Headley finished in fifth place with 127 votes in the voting for the NL 
Most Valuable Player (MVP) award,[18] and won the This Year in Baseball 
award for "MLB Breakout Hitter of the Year".[19] After making $3.475 million 
in 2012, Headley was under team control for the following two seasons with 
San Diego but eligible for salary arbitration.[10] On January 30, 2013, 
Headley signed a one-year contract worth $8.575 million with San Diego.[20] 
On March 17 during spring training, he fractured the tip of his left thumb 
when it got caught under the second base bag while he was sliding feet-first 
to break up a double play.[21] He started the 2013 season on the disabled 
list, and returned exactly a month after the injury on April 17.[22] He 
also played through a torn meniscus in his left knee during the season, 
which began giving him problems during spring training. His offensive production 
slipped from the previous season. At season's end, Headley admitted his 
knee troubles "probably" contributed to his decline. He was scheduled to 
undergo arthroscopic surgery on his knee during the offseason.[23] On July 
22, 2014, the Padres traded Headley to the New York Yankees in exchange 
for Yangervis Solarte and Rafael De Paula.[24][25] In 77 games with the 
Padres in 2014, he had batting only .229 with a .296 OBP.[26] Later that 
same day, after shaving his beard to comply with Yankee policy, Headley 
drove in the winning run for the Yanks with a walk-off single in the bottom 
of the 14th inning to seal a 2-1 victory over the Texas Rangers. [27] On 
September 4, 2014, Headley hit a walk-off solo home run off Red Sox closer 
Koji Uehara to give the Yankees a come from behind 5-4 victory. On September 
11, 2014 Headley was hit in the face with a 97 m.p.h. fastball. He was 
able to walk off the field under his own power, although he required stitches 
on his chin.[28] In 58 games with the Yankees, he had a .371 OBP, which 
was the fifth highest among third basemen over that span.[26] On December 
15, Headley returned to the Yankees, agreeing to a reported four-year, 
$52 million contract.[26] Headley is a Christian. Headley has spoken about 
his faith saying, "Jesus has changed my life. My goal is to have Jesus 
be the center of everything. I can worship Jesus by the way I play baseball 
and in how I interact with teammates, opponents, umpires and fans. I try 
to let my life reflect my faith in Christ."[29] He and his wife Casey married
