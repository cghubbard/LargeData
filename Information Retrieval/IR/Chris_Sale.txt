Christopher Allen "Chris" Sale (born March 30, 1989), nicknamed The Condor,[1] 
is an American professional baseball pitcher for the Chicago White Sox 
of Major League Baseball (MLB). Prior to playing professionally, he played 
college baseball for Florida Gulf Coast University. Sale made his MLB debut 
in 2010. He is a five-time MLB All-Star, and he led the American League 
in strikeouts in 2015. Sale was born in Lakeland, Florida. He graduated 
from Lakeland Senior High School.[2] After his senior year for the Dreadnaughts, 
Sale was drafted in the 21st round of the 2007 Major League Baseball Draft 
by the Colorado Rockies, but chose not to sign and instead to attend Florida 
Gulf Coast University. Sale played college baseball for the Florida Gulf 
Coast Eagles baseball team under head coach Dave Tollett. During the 2010 
season at FGCU, Sale posted an 11–0 win–loss record and a 2.01 ERA over 
17 games. Sale pitched 103 innings while striking out 146 and walking 14. 
He led the NCAA in strikeouts at the end of the regular season. He received 
both conference and national Pitcher of the Year honors.[3] He is one of 
four Eagles to play in the major leagues, along with pitchers Jacob Barnes, 
Richard Bleier and Casey Coleman.[4] Like many top college players, Sale 
spent the NCAA offseason pitching in wooden bat summer leagues. In 2008 
he was an All-Star for the La Crosse Loggers of the Northwoods League, 
and it was during his time in Wisconsin that coaches suggested he adopt 
his now distinctive low three-quarter arm angle.[5][6] In the summer of 
2009, Sale pitched for the Yarmouth-Dennis Red Sox of the Cape Cod Baseball 
League.[7] He had a record of 4–2 and an earned run average of 1.47 with 
Y-D, with 57 strikeouts as well. He was awarded the MVP in the Cape Cod 
All-Star Game.[8][better source needed] Sale was drafted by the White Sox 
13th overall in the 2010 MLB Draft.[9] He is one of five players in MLB 
history to play the same year he was drafted.[10] Once Sale signed with 
the White Sox in 2010, he was assigned to the White Sox' Class A affiliate 
Winston-Salem Dash. Sale pitched in four games for the Dash with a 2.25 
ERA in four innings. Sale gave up three hits and one earned run while walking 
two and striking out 4 during his tenure with the Dash. Sale was then promoted 
to the White Sox triple-A affiliate Charlotte Knights. While there, Sale 
pitched in seven games for the Knights with a 2.84 ERA in 6.1 innings. 
Sale gave up three hits and two earned runs while walking four and striking 
out 15 while with the Knights. Sale was called up to the majors for the 
first time on August 4, 2010, and made his MLB debut August 6, 2010, against 
the Baltimore Orioles in the 8th inning.[11] He was the first 2010 draft 
pick to be promoted to the majors. He got his first major league save on 
September 1, 2010, against the Cleveland Indians.[12] In 21 appearances 
his rookie year, Sale went 2–1 with a 1.93 ERA, 32 strikeouts, and 4 saves. 
During 2011, Sale made 58 appearances out of the bullpen with a 2–2 record, 
a 2.79 ERA, 8 saves, and 79 strikeouts. The White Sox announced that Sale 
would transition to a starting pitcher for the 2012 season. On May 28, 
2012, Sale struck out a career high 15 batters in seven and a third innings 
during a 2–1 victory over the Tampa Bay Rays. Sale's 15 strikeouts are 
tied for second most in franchise history with Eddie Cicotte, Ed Walsh 
and Jim Scott. Jack Harshman holds the White Sox team record with 16 strikeouts 
in a game.[13] Sale was named the American League Pitcher of the Month 
for the month of May with a record of 4–1, ERA of 1.71, 35 strikeouts and 
a .181 opponents average over six games.[14] Sale was chosen by American 
All-Star manager Ron Washington to pitch in the 83rd All-Star Game in Kansas 
City. This marked Sale's first All-Star appearance.[citation needed] During 
the 2012 season, Sale compiled a 17–8 record, a 3.05 ERA, and 192 strikeouts 
in 192 innings pitched. He was 6th in voting for the AL Cy Young Award. 
On March 7, 2013, Sale and the White Sox agreed on a five-year, $32 million 
contract with two option years depending on the team.[15] On May 12, 2013, 
Sale threw a 1-hit shutout during a 3–0 Sox victory over the Los Angeles 
Angels of Anaheim. Sale took a perfect game into the seventh inning. With 
one out in the top of the seventh inning, Mike Trout singled up the middle 
for the only hit of the game. Sale finished the game with 7 strikeouts 
and no walks, allowing Trout as the only base runner.[16] Sale began the 
2013 season with a 6–8 record and a 2.85 ERA. He was named an All-Star 
for the 2nd season in a row. Sale came on to pitch for the 2nd and 3rd 
innings, allowing no hits, no runs, no walks and striking out two NL hitters. 
He was named the winning pitcher for the American League, which won the 
game 3–0. In 30 starts of the 2013 season, Sale had an AL-leading 4 complete 
games, an 11–14 record, 226 strikeouts, and a 3.07 ERA in 214.1 innings 
pitched. He received one of the lowest run supports in the AL. Sale ended 
up in 5th place in Cy Young votes for 2013.[17] On April 21, Sale was placed 
on the 15-day disabled list after sustaining a flexor strain in his left 
(pitching) elbow.[18] During his first start off the disabled list against 
the New York Yankees on May 22, 2014, Sale retired the first 17 batters 
in a row before allowing a single by Zoilo Almonte. He struck out 10 in 
6 innings pitched as the White Sox won the game 3–2.[19] During a game 
against the Angels on June 7, 2014, Sale had a 5–0 lead but surrendered 
5 runs all in the 7th inning that featured a grand slam by Mike Trout. 
Sale continued his dominance on the mound, winning eight of his first nine 
decisions and carrying a 8–1 record and 2.08 ERA into the All-Star break. 
After not initially making the All-Star roster, Sale was voted into the 
game by fans (alongside Cubs first baseman Anthony Rizzo) as part of the 
"Final Vote."[20] Sale joined all-star teammates Jose Abreu and Alexei 
Ramirez in the all-star game in Minneapolis. Sale finished the season with 
a 12–4 record, 208 strikeouts in 174 innings pitched, and a 2.17 ERA, second 
best in the American League. He finished 3rd in voting for the AL Cy Young 
award, behind winner Corey Kluber and Felix Hernandez. Sale started the 
2015 year on the disabled list due to a foot injury. He returned on April 
12, pitching 6 innings with 8 strikeouts in a 6–2 victory over the Minnesota 
Twins.[21] During a game against the Kansas City Royals on April 23, 2015, 
Sale was warned by home plate umpire Sam Holbrook after hitting Mike Moustakas 
with a pitch. Later on, Sale was involved in a bench-clearing brawl after 
his teammate Adam Eaton grounded out to Yordano Ventura. Sale was one of 
five players to be ejected for his role in the brawl as the White Sox lost 
to the Royals 2–3 in 13 innings.[22] On April 25, 2015, Sale was suspended 
for 5 games.[23] In a June 8 win over the Houston Astros, Sale struck out 
14 batters. On June 19 Sale had his 5th consecutive game with 12 or more 
strikeouts tying a major league record. Also on June 19 Sale had his 6th 
consecutive game with 10 or more strikeouts. On June 30 against the St. 
Louis Cardinals, Sale struck out 12 batters to tie a major league record 
with his eighth consecutive start of 10 or more strikeouts. He shares the 
record with Pedro Martínez, who accomplished the feat while pitching for 
the Boston Red Sox in 1999.[24] On October 2, versus the Detroit Tigers, 
Sale set the franchise record for number of strikeouts in a season. The 
previous record of 269 Ks in a season was held by Hall of Famer Ed Walsh 
in 1908. He accomplished the feat in 464 innings, while Sale's 270th strikeout 
came in the midst of his 203rd inning of 2015.[25] Sale began the 2016 
season winning each of his first 9 starts. He entered the All-Star Break 
with a 14–3 record (12 quality starts), an ERA of 3.38, and a WHIP of 1.04. 
Kansas City Royals manager Ned Yost named him the starter for the 2016 
Major League Baseball All-Star Game.[26] In the All Star Game Sale pitched 
1 Inning and gave up a home run to Chicago Cub Kris Bryant. On July 23, 
Sale used a knife to destroy the team's throwback jerseys for a game while 
the team was taking batting practice. He was suspended 5 games for insubordination 
by the team on July 24.[27] Sale relies on three pitches — a fastball at 
93–99 mph, a slider at 79–83 mph, and a changeup (84–89 mph). The slider, 
which carries a career whiff rate of 43%, is Sale's most common 2-strike 
pitch to hitters from both sides of the plate.[28] Sale throws with a "funky"
