The Padres adopted their name from the Pacific Coast League team which 
arrived in San Diego in 1936. That minor league franchise won the PCL title 
in 1937, led by then-18-year-old San Diegan Ted Williams. The team's name, 
Spanish for "fathers", refers to the Spanish Franciscan friars who founded 
San Diego in 1769. In 1969, the San Diego Padres joined the ranks of Major 
League Baseball as one of four new expansion teams, along with the Montreal 
Expos (now the Washington Nationals), the Kansas City Royals and the Seattle 
Pilots (now the Milwaukee Brewers). Their original owner was C. Arnholt 
Smith, a prominent San Diego businessman and former owner of the PCL Padres 
whose interests included banking, tuna fishing, hotels, real estate and 
an airline. Despite initial excitement, the guidance of longtime baseball 
executives, Eddie Leishman and Buzzie Bavasi as well as a new playing field, 
the team struggled; the Padres finished in last place in each of its first 
six seasons in the NL West, losing 100 games or more four times. One of 
the few bright spots on the team during the early years was first baseman 
and slugger Nate Colbert, an expansion draftee from the Houston Astros 
and still (as of 2015) the Padres' career leader in home runs. Before the 
1974 season began, the Padres were on the verge of being sold to Joseph 
Danzansky, who was planning to move the franchise to Washington, D.C. in 
time for the upcoming season. New uniforms were designed for the team, 
which was planning to be renamed to the Washington Stars.[1] Given the 
uncertain status of the Padres, Topps printed two sets of baseball cards 
for the team, splitting production between one set with "San Diego" and 
"Padres" as banners, and another with "Washington" and "Nat'l Lea" (National 
League).[2][3] However, the sale to Danzansky became tied up in lawsuits, 
and Smith instead sold the team to McDonald's co-founder Ray Kroc for $12 
million, saving baseball in San Diego.[4][5] In his first home game as 
the Padres' new owner in 1974, Ray Kroc grabbed the public address system 
microphone and apologized to fans for the poor performance of the team, 
saying, "I have never seen such stupid ballplaying in my life."[6] At the 
same time, a streaker raced across the field, eluding security personnel. 
Kroc shouted, "Throw him in jail!" The following season, 1975, would be 
the first season that the Padres would not finish in the National League 
West cellar (finishing fourth), and brought the promise of an owner who 
would make the necessary changes to the organization. Nate Colbert is one 
of two major-league baseball players (Stan Musial is the other) to have 
hit five home runs in a doubleheader, a feat he accomplished as a Padre. 
He collected 13 RBIs in that doubleheader, still a major league record. 
Although the Padres continued to struggle after Colbert's departure via 
trade to the Detroit Tigers in 1974, they did feature star outfielder Dave 
Winfield, who came to the Padres in 1973 from the University of Minnesota 
without having played a single game in the minor leagues. Winfield was 
also drafted by the Minnesota Vikings of the National Football League, 
the Atlanta Hawks of the National Basketball Association and the Utah Stars 
of the American Basketball Association. Winfield took over where Colbert 
left off, starring in the Padres outfield from 1973 until 1980, when he 
joined the New York Yankees. In seven seasons, Winfield played in 1,117 
games for San Diego and collected 1,134 hits, 154 home runs and drove in 
626 runs. But most importantly, he helped the team out of the National 
League West basement for the first time in 1975, under the guidance of 
manager John McNamara, who took over the club at the start of the 1974 
season. Winfield's emergence as a legitimate star coincided with the turnaround 
of a promising young left-handed pitcher named Randy Jones, who had suffered 
through 22 losses in 1974. Jones became the first San Diego pitcher to 
win 20 games in 1975, going 20–12 in 37 outings as the Padres finished 
in fourth place with a 71–91 record, 37 games behind the Cincinnati Reds. 
Jones won 22 games in 1976, winning the Cy Young Award in the process, 
another franchise first. The club set a new high with 73 wins, but fell 
to fifth place. Jones slipped to 6–12 in 1977, and not even the acquisition 
of Rollie Fingers could help the Padres escape the bottom half of the division. 
Only Winfield and fellow outfielder George Hendrick cracked the 20-homer 
barrier, and the pitching staff was filled with a group of unknowns and 
youngsters, few of whom would enjoy much success at the major league level. 
The 1978 season brought hope to baseball fans in San Diego, thanks to the 
arrival a young shortstop named Ozzie Smith, who arrived on the scene and 
turned the baseball world on its ears with an acrobatic style that redefined 
how the position should be played in the field. The Padres hosted the All-Star 
Game that summer. The National League won the contest 7–3 thanks to an 
MVP performance by Los Angeles Dodgers first baseman Steve Garvey, who 
would play a crucial role for San Diego in the not-too-distant future. 
Winfield and Fingers represented the team at the game, but conspicuously 
absent was starting pitcher Gaylord Perry, who joined the Padres after 
spending three years with the Texas Rangers. At 39 years of age and coming 
off a 15–14 season with Texas, little was expected of him. All Perry did 
that summer was post a 21–6 record and a 2.73 earned run average, edging 
Montreal's Ross Grimsley to earn the Padres' second Cy Young Award in three 
seasons. San Diego also picked up another first that summer, compiling 
an 84–78 mark for manager Roger Craig, the only time in 10 seasons the 
team finished a season with a winning percentage above .500. The good times 
did not last, as the Padres closed out the decade with another losing season 
in 1979, a 68–93 record that cost Craig his job. Winfield was the lone 
bright spot, leading the National League with 118 RBIs. The good times 
continued to fade out as Winfield signed a 10-year contract with the New 
York Yankees after the 1980 season. The 1984 season began with a shock: 
Ray Kroc died of heart disease on January 14. Ownership of the team passed 
to his third wife, Joan Kroc. The team would wear Ray's initials, "RAK" 
on their jersey's left sleeve during the entire season, as well as the 
1985 and 1986 seasons. Fortunately, happier times were ahead for the team. 
The Padres finished at 92–70 in 1984 and won the National League West championship, 
despite having no players with 100-RBI and only two batters with 20-HR. 
They were managed by Dick Williams and had an offense that featured veterans 
Steve Garvey, Garry Templeton, Graig Nettles, Alan Wiggins as well as Hall-of-Famer 
Tony Gwynn, who captured his first of what would be eight National League 
batting championships that year (he would also win in 1987–89 and from 
1994–97; Gwynn shares the National League record with Honus Wagner). Gwynn, 
who also would win five National League Gold Gloves during his career, 
joined the Padres in 1982 following starring roles in both baseball and 
basketball at San Diego State University (he still holds the school record 
for career basketball assists), and after having been selected in the previous 
year by both the Padres in the baseball draft and by the then San Diego 
Clippers in the National Basketball Association draft. The Padres pitching 
staff in 1984 featured Eric Show (15–9), Ed Whitson (14–8), Mark Thurmond 
(14–8), Tim Lollar (11–13), and Rich "Goose" Gossage as their closer (10–6, 
2.90 ERA and 25 saves).[7] In the 1984 NLCS, the Padres faced the NL East 
champion Chicago Cubs, who were making their first post-season appearance 
since 1945 and featured NL Most Valuable Player Ryne Sandberg and Cy Young 
Award winner Rick Sutcliffe. The Cubs would win the first two games at 
Wrigley Field, and were less than two innings away from a series sweep 
when their luck changed. The Padres swept the final three games at then 
San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium (the highlight arguably being Steve Garvey's 
dramatic, game-winning home run off of Lee Smith in Game 4) to win the 
1984 National League pennant.[8] Gossage, a former New York Yankee, said 
the San Diego crowd at Game 3 was "the loudest crowd I've ever heard anywhere."[9] 
Gwynn agreed as well.[10] Jack Murphy Stadium played "Cub-Busters", a parody 
of the theme song from the 1984 movie Ghostbusters.[9][10] Cub-Busters 
T-shirts inspired from the movie were popular attire for Padres fans.[11][12] 
In the 1984 World Series, the Padres faced the powerful Detroit Tigers, 
who steamrolled through the regular season with 104 victories (and had 
started out with a 35–5 record, the best ever through the first 40 games). 
The Tigers were managed by Sparky Anderson and featured shortstop and native 
San Diegan Alan Trammell and outfielder Kirk Gibson, along with Lance Parrish 
and DH Darrell Evans. The pitching staff was bolstered by ace Jack Morris 
(19–11, 3.60 ERA), Dan Petry (18–8), Milt Wilcox (17–8), and closer Willie 
Hernández (9–3, 1.92 ERA with 32 saves).[13] Jack Morris would win games 
1 and 4 and the Tigers would go on to win the Series 4-games-to-1.[14] 
Reporter Barry Bloom of MLB.com wrote in 2011 that "the postseason in ’84 
is still the most exciting week of Major League Baseball ever played in 
San Diego."[15] After the Padres won the pennant in 1984, they had some 
tough times. Tony Gwynn continued to win batting titles (including batting 
.394 in 1994). The Padres would come close in 1985. They would field eight 
All-Stars (manager Dick Williams, Tony Gwynn, Graig Nettles, Rich Gossage, 
Terry Kennedy, Garry Templeton, Steve Garvey, and LaMarr Hoyt) at the 1985 
All-Star Game in Minnesota. However, they collapsed at the end of the season, 
finishing tied for third with the Houston Astros behind the Los Angeles 
Dodgers and Cincinnati Reds. Williams was let go as manager just before 
1986 spring training. His record with the Padres was 337–311 over four 
seasons. As of 2011, he was the only manager in the team's history without 
a losing season.[16] His difficulties with the Padres stemmed from a power 
struggle with team president Ballard Smith and general manager Jack McKeon.[16] 
Late in the 1986 season, Gossage was suspended and then reinstated with 
a $25,000 fine for behavior not in the best interest of the team. Gossage 
said that Smith "wants choirboys and not winning players" and that Smith 
"just listens to what Mom says", a reference to Padres owner Kroc, Smith's 
mother-in-law. Gossage also said Kroc was "poisoning the world with her 
cheeseburgers." He later apologized to McDonald's, which Gossage said his 
family would continue to frequent.[17] In 1987, rookie catcher Benito Santiago 
hit in 34 straight games, earning him the NL Rookie of the Year Award. 
However, the Padres finished dead last in 1987, thanks to the managing 
of the tempestuous Larry Bowa. The next season, rookie second baseman Roberto 
Alomar would make his debut, forming a double play combination with veteran 
shortstop Garry Templeton. During the 1988 season, Bowa was replaced by 
Jack McKeon and the Padres won 83 games, finishing in third place. Team 
president Chub Feeney resigned after giving the finger to fans carrying 
a sign reading "SCRUB CHUB" on Fan Appreciation Night.[18] In 1989, the 
Padres finished 89–73 thanks to Cy Young Award-winning closer Mark Davis. 
Between 1989 and 1990, friction dominated the Padres' clubhouse as Tony 
Gwynn had constant shouting matches with slugger Jack Clark. But as the 
franchise player, Gwynn prevailed as Clark finished his career with the 
Red Sox. Midway through the 1990 season, Joan Kroc wanted to sell the team. 
But she wanted a commitment to San Diego. So Kroc sold it to television 
producer Tom Werner. Just under six weeks into his new ownership role, 
Werner attempted to cross-promote the team with one of his television series 
in between games of a twi-night doubleheader versus the Cincinnati Reds 
at Jack Murphy Stadium on July 25, 1990. On an evening billed as Working 
Women's Night at the ballpark, he had invited Roseanne Barr, the eponymous 
star of one of his sitcoms, to perform The Star-Spangled Banner. She comically 
sang the national anthem with a loud, screechy voice. After finishing her 
rendition, she grabbed her crotch and spat at the ground in an attempt 
to parody baseball players. The publicity stunt was met with condemnation 
from baseball fans, sportswriters, and even the President, some of whom 
called it either the "Barr-Mangled Banner" or the "Barr-Strangled Banner."[6][19][20] 
Under Werner, the old brown that remained in Padres uniforms since their 
inception were supplanted by navy blue, a nod to the vintage 1940s PCL 
franchise colors. A trade was also made with the Toronto Blue Jays where 
Joe Carter and Roberto Alomar were traded for Fred McGriff and Tony Fernandez. 
In 1992, the Padres lineup featured the "Four Tops": Gary Sheffield, Fred 
McGriff, Tony Fernández, and Tony Gwynn. However, Fernandez would go to 
the New York Mets, McGriff went to the division-winning Atlanta Braves, 
and Sheffield would go to the expansion Florida Marlins. Although extremely 
unpopular at the time, it was the Sheffield trade that brought in pitcher 
Trevor Hoffman, who was virtually unknown to Padres fans. While Sheffield 
led Florida to a World Championship in 1997, Hoffman would be the next 
franchise player behind Dave Winfield and Tony Gwynn. The Padres would 
finish dead last in the strike-shortened 1994 season, but Gwynn hit .394 
that year (the most since Ted Williams hit over .400 in 1941). After that 
season, the Padres made a mega-trade with Houston reeling in Ken Caminiti, 
Steve Finley, and others. In November 1995, Kevin Towers was promoted from 
scouting director to general manager. In 1996, under new owner John Moores 
(a software tycoon who purchased controlling ownership in the team in 1994 
from Tom Werner, who subsequently formed a syndicate that purchased the 
Boston Red Sox) and team president Larry Lucchino, and with a team managed 
by former Padres catcher Bruce Bochy (a member of the 1984 NL championship 
squad), the team won the NL West in an exciting race, sweeping the Los 
Angeles Dodgers at Dodger Stadium in the final series of the regular season. 
The '96 team featured Gwynn, who won his seventh National League batting 
championship, National League MVP Ken Caminiti, premier leadoff hitter 
Rickey Henderson, pitcher Fernando Valenzuela, first baseman Wally Joyner 
and outfielder Steve Finley. The Padres had led the NL West early in the 
season only to falter in June, but came back in July and battled the Dodgers 
the rest of the way. However, they were defeated in the National League 
Division Series by the Tony La Russa-led St. Louis Cardinals, 3 games to 
0. The Padres suffered an off-year in 1997, plagued by a pitching slump. 
The one silver lining was Tony Gwynn's eighth and final National League 
batting title, won in the final days of the season after a down-to-the 
wire duel with the Colorado Rockies' Larry Walker. Walker barely missed 
becoming the first Triple Crown winner in baseball since Carl Yastrzemski 
in 1967. In 1998, Henderson and Valenzuela were gone, but newly acquired 
(from the 1997 World Series champion Florida Marlins) pitcher Kevin Brown 
had a sensational year (his only one with the Padres) and outfielder/slugger 
Greg Vaughn hit 50 home runs (overlooked in that season of the Mark McGwire–Sammy 
Sosa race). Managed by Bruce Bochy and aided by the talents of players 
such as Tony Gwynn, Ken Caminiti, Wally Joyner, Steve Finley, pitcher Andy 
Ashby and premier closer Trevor Hoffman (4–2, 1.48 ERA and 53 saves), the 
Padres had their best year in history, finishing 98–64 and winning the 
NL West division crown.[21] In the next year, the team owners would make 
a bid to have the city of San Diego construct a new stadium for the Padres. 
To guarantee that the city fathers would vote in the affirmative, the Padres 
recruited a record number of players for the 1998 season, most of whom 
would become free agents in 1999. Therefore, they would have the best incentive 
to have a successful season, to get the best contracts possible (potentially 
with other teams), in 1999. This gambit was completely successful : The 
Padres had a record season, the new Ball Park was approved, most of the 
stars of 1998 left, and the team would have a lackluster year in 1999. 
The Padres defeated the Houston Astros in the 1998 NLDS, 3 games to 1, 
behind solid pitching by Brown and Hoffman, and home runs by Greg Vaughn, 
Wally Joyner and Jim Leyritz (who homered in 3 of the 4 games).[22] In 
the 1998 NLCS, the Padres faced the Atlanta Braves, who had won the National 
League East with an astonishing 106–56 record. The offense was paced by 
talent such as Andrés Galarraga, Chipper Jones, Andruw Jones and Javy López. 
Their pitching staff had the perennial big-3 of Greg Maddux (18–9, 2.22 
ERA), Tom Glavine (20–6, 2.47 ERA), and John Smoltz (17–3, 2.90 ERA), as 
well as Kevin Millwood (17–8, 4.08 ERA) and Denny Neagle (16–11, 3.55 ERA). 
However, it was the Padres that would prevail, 4 games to 2, with ace Kevin 
Brown pitching a shutout in game 2 (winning 3–0).[23] Steve Finley caught 
a pop fly for the final out, as the Padres clinched the series. In the 
1998 World Series the Padres faced the powerhouse New York Yankees, who 
had steamrolled through the season with a 114–48 record and drew acclaim 
as one their greatest teams of all time. There was no offensive player 
with more than 30 home runs, in contrast to the teams of the 1920s, or 
1950s, but they had four players with 24+ and eight with 17+. Yankee pitching 
had been paced by David Cone (20–7, 3.55), Andy Pettitte (16–11, 4.24), 
David Wells (18–4, 3.49), Hideki Irabu (13–9, 4.06) and Orlando Hernández 
(12–4, 3.13). Mariano Rivera, their closer, was excellent once again (3–0, 
1.91 ERA with 36 saves).[24] The Yankees swept the Padres in four games. 
Mariano Rivera closed out 3 of the 4 games. One of the few bright spots 
of the series for the Padres was a home run by Tony Gwynn, in Game 1 that 
hit the facing of the right-field upper deck at Yankee Stadium and put 
the Padres ahead briefly, 5–2. But the Yankees would score 7 runs in the 
7th inning en route to a 9–6 victory.[25] This World Series loss by the 
Padres was the only time during the Yankees' dynasty of the 1990s that 
did not revive the rivalry between the New York Mets and the Atlanta Braves.[26] 
Three of the four Yankees championships during their dynasty came against 
either team (1996 and 1999 against Atlanta, 2000 against New York).[26] 
Entering the 1999 season, some instrumental players to the 1998 World Series 
team were gone.[27] Brown, a free agent, signed the biggest contract in 
baseball history with the Dodgers. Finley, a free agent, signed with the 
Arizona Diamondbacks. Caminiti, a free agent went to the Houston Astros. 
Vaughn and utilityman Mark Sweeney were traded to the Cincinnati Reds for 
left fielder Reggie Sanders, infielder Damian Jackson and pitching prospect 
Josh Harris. Starting pitcher Joey Hamilton was traded to the Toronto Blue 
Jays for pitchers Woody Williams and Carlos Almanzar.[28] The Padres opened 
their 1999 season in Monterrey, Mexico versus the Colorado Rockies. On 
August 6, 1999, Tony Gwynn got his 3,000th hit (a single) against the Montreal 
Expos at Olympic Stadium. On October 7, 2001, in a post-game ceremony at 
Qualcomm Stadium, Tony Gwynn made an emotional farewell to the team that 
had been his only major-league home. In the game played that day, Rickey 
Henderson, who in the meantime had rejoined the Padres, collected his 3,000th 
major-league base hit, a double. Gwynn struck his final major-league hit, 
also a double, in the previous game. He was the head coach of the San Diego 
State University Aztecs, his alma mater from 2003 to 2014. He was inducted 
into the National Baseball Hall of Fame on July 29, 2007. Gwynn died on 
June 16, 2014 of salivary gland cancer. Also in 2001, Dave Winfield became 
the first player to be elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame as 
a Padre. After five straight losing seasons in Qualcomm Stadium (1999–2003), 
the Padres moved into newly built Petco Park. Petco Park is situated in 
downtown near San Diego's Gaslamp District, the main entrance located just 
two blocks from the downtown terminal of the San Diego Trolley light-rail 
system. With new amenities and a revitalization of the downtown neighborhood, 
fan interest renewed. Modeled after recent successes in downtown ballpark 
building (such as San Francisco's AT&T Park), and incorporating San Diego 
history in the form of the preservation of the facade of the historic Western 
Metals Company building (now the left-field corner, the corner of the building 
substituting for the left field foul pole), the new Petco Park is a sharp 
contrast to their previous home at Qualcomm (Jack Murphy) Stadium which 
was a cookie-cutter type football-baseball facility located in an outer, 
mostly commercial-industrial, area of the city near an interstate interchange. 
With the ocean air prevalent and a sharp, clean park to play in, the Padres 
began to win again. The new stadium also acquired a reputation as a pitchers' 
park, with notable complaints from some of the Padres batters themselves 
(deep center field and evenings with dense foggy air). The Padres finished 
the 2004 season with an 87–75 record, good enough for 3rd in the NL West. 
The team somewhat rebranded itself going into the 2004 season, with new 
colors (navy blue and sand brown), new uniforms and a new advertising slogan, 
"Play Downtown", referring to the near-downtown location of the new ballpark. 
One of the bricks at the center plaza of Petco Park was secretly purchased 
by the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, an animal rights organization 
that has protested the breeding and purchasing of the animals sold at Petco 
stores. The brick reads, "Break out your cold ones. Toast the Padres. Enjoy 
this champion organization." The first letter of each word is really an 
acrostic urging people to boycott the stores. In 2005, the Western Division 
Champion Padres finished with the lowest-ever winning percentage for a 
division champion (or for that matter, a postseason qualifier) in a non-strike 
season, 82–80. Three teams in the Eastern Division finished with better 
records than San Diego but failed to qualify for the playoffs, including 
second-place Philadelphia, which won 88 games and all six of its contests 
with the Padres. There had been some speculation that the Padres would 
be the first team in history to win a division and finish below .500, but 
their victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers on September 30 gave them their 
81st victory. In the 2005 NLDS, the reigning National League champion St. 
Louis Cardinals, who finished the season with the majors' best record, 
swept the Padres in three consecutive games. Thus the Padres finished the 
season with an overall regular-and-post-season record of 82–83, the first 
post-season qualifier in a normal-length season to lose more games than 
it won overall. The 2005 Padres featured bright spots, however, including 
ace pitcher Jake Peavy, the NL strikeout leader, and closer Trevor Hoffman, 
who claimed his 400th save. The Padres started April 2006 with a 9–15 record 
and were stuck in the cellar of the NL West. However, after going 19–10 
in May, the club moved into first place in the division. Closer Trevor 
Hoffman was elected to the 2006 MLB All-Star Game in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, 
threw one inning in that game and got the loss. On September 24 (the last 
home game of the regular season), Hoffman became the all-time saves leader 
when he recorded his 479th career save, breaking Lee Smith's record of 
478 (Hoffman's career total as of the end of the season was 482). Hoffman's 
2006 campaign (2.14 ERA, 46 saves in 51 opportunities through 65 games 
pitched) was one of his best. The 2006 Padres would attribute their success 
largely to the team's pitching staff. Their ERA was 3.87, first in the 
NL and trailing only the Detroit Tigers in all of MLB. On September 30, 
2006, the Padres clinched a playoff berth with a 3–1 win over the Arizona 
Diamondbacks. In the final game of the season, the Padres defeated the 
Diamondbacks 7–6 to win back to back division titles for the first time 
in team history (they were tied with the Dodgers for the division title, 
but because of winning the season series against them, the division title 
went to them and the wild card went to the Dodgers). The final out of the 
final game of the 2006 regular season — confirming the Padres as Division 
champions — was a highly unusual play. With Trevor Hoffman pitching the 
9th, 2 out, Diamondback Chris Young was on first. Alberto Callaspo hit 
a grounder past first. Second baseman Josh Barfield fielded and threw wildly 
to first, forcing Gonzalez to come off the bag. However, Gonzalez then 
threw to Khalil Greene at second, beating but not tagging Young. Second 
base umpire Larry Poncino initially called safe because of the no-tag, 
but Padres manager Bruce Bochy successfully argued that the force play 
at second did not need a tag to be declared out. The game, and the season, 
ended with a changed call. TV replay, however, clearly showed that Greene 
was off the bag as well, so the original call may have been correct. This 
call, understandably, was greeted by a long and loud chorus of boos by 
the Diamondbacks fans who packed Chase Field to bid farewell to Luis Gonzalez. 
Only 53 teams in the modern era have posted sub-.500 records in April and 
survived to make the postseason. The San Diego Padres achieved the feat 
in both 2005 and 2006. The Padres opened the 2006 National League Division 
Series at home against the St. Louis Cardinals on Tuesday, October 3, 2006. 
After losing the first two games at home (5–1 and 2–0 respectively), they 
won game 3 at Busch Stadium 3–1, but were eliminated with a 6–2 loss in 
Game 4, when the Cardinals, who trailed 2–0 before their first at-bat, 
scored six unanswered runs (two in the first, and four in the sixth) for 
the win. After the end of the 2006 season, the Padres had an overall post-season 
record of 12–22, losing 10 of their last 11 games since winning the National 
League pennant in 1998. One key offseason trade between the San Diego Padres' 
General Manager, Kevin Towers, and the Texas Rangers' General Manager, 
Jon Daniels, would prove to have a dramatic impact on their 2006 season. 
The Padres dealt starting pitcher Adam Eaton, middle reliever Akinori Otsuka, 
and minor-league catcher Billy Killian in exchange for starting pitcher 
Chris Young, left fielder Terrmel Sledge, and first baseman Adrian Gonzalez. 
Gonzalez would take over the everyday duties at first base, batting .304 
with a club-leading 24 home runs and 82 RBI in his first year as a full-time 
starter. Sledge would hit .229 in limited major league action. Chris Young 
proved to be the real story, however, as he would go 11–5 with a 3.46 ERA 
(6th best in the National League) and allowed just 6.72 hits per 9 innings 
pitched – best in the majors. 2006 also ended up being the last year of 
Bruce Bochy's tenure as the manager of the Padres, taking the managerial 
position for their divisional rivals, the San Francisco Giants. He was 
replaced by Bud Black, a San Diego State University alumni and former pitching 
coach of the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. On Sunday, April 1, 2007, Major 
League Baseball's 2007 Opening Night, the Padres announced that they had 
agreed to terms on a four-year contract with 1B Adrian Gonzalez, keeping 
him in San Diego until 2010 with a club option for 2011. Prior to this 
contract agreement the Padres had offered to renew Gonzalez's contract 
during the offseason at $380,500, only $500 over the league minimum for 
the 2007 season. The Padres' 2007 season began April 3 in an away game 
against the San Francisco Giants, winning it 7–0 in front of a capacity 
crowd of 42,773 at AT&T Park, defeating $126 million staff-ace Barry Zito 
in his Giants debut. The Padres bullpen continued to be the team's strength 
as in recent years, opening the season with 28 1⁄3 scoreless innings, a 
Major League record to start a season. At the start of the season the Padres 
starting rotation order was as follows: Jake Peavy, Chris Young, Clay Hensley 
(injured, replaced by Justin Germano), Greg Maddux, David Wells. On June 
4, 2007, Jake Peavy was named NL Pitcher of the Month after going 4–0 with 
a 0.79 ERA in May. The next day, Trevor Hoffman was named the "DHL Presents 
the Major League Baseball Delivery Man of the Month Award" for May 2007. 
The award recognizes the most outstanding relief pitcher during each month 
of the regular season. On June 6, 2007, Trevor Hoffman became the first 
pitcher in major league history to record 500 saves, 498 of them coming 
as a Padre (the first 2 were as a Florida Marlin). On September 23, 2007, 
Milton Bradley tore his right ACL while being restrained by Padres manager 
Bud Black during an altercation with first base umpire Mike Winters. Home 
plate umpire Brian Runge reportedly told Bradley that Winters said that 
Bradley had tossed his bat in Runge's direction in a previous at-bat. After 
Bradley reached first base, he questioned Winters about the alleged bat 
throwing and subsequent communication with Runge. According to Bradley 
and Padres first base coach Bobby Meacham, Winters used a profanity towards 
Bradley. Bradley then moved towards Winters. While restrained by Black, 
Bradley fell to the ground resulting in the injury. He missed the last 
week of the regular season in 2007, during which the Padres relinquished 
their wild card lead, ultimately losing to the eventual N.L. Champion Colorado 
Rockies in a one-game playoff.[29] The Padres ended the regular season 
in an 89–73 tie for the NL wild card with the Colorado Rockies. In a cruel 
piece of irony, on September 29, 2007, the Padres were within one out and 
one strike of clinching the National League Wild Card berth, but Tony Gwynn, 
Jr., son of the longtime Padres legend, tripled against Hoffman to tie 
the game. The Padres went on to lose that game, and the one that followed, 
even though the Milwaukee Brewers had been eliminated from the pennant 
race and had nothing left to play for. The Padres then met the Rockies 
on October 1, 2007 in Denver for a one-game playoff to decide the wild 
card winner. Despite having Jake Peavy start the game and bringing in Trevor 
Hoffman in the bottom of the 13th inning to try to hold an 8–6 lead, the 
Padres' season ended when the Rockies rallied to win 9–8. It ended on a 
controversial call on a sacrifice fly where many questioned whether Matt 
Holliday ever touched home plate, leaving Padre fans saying "Holliday never 
touched home!" The umpire of that game claimed that the catcher, Michael 
Barrett, was blocking the plate before he had possession of the ball. Therefore, 
Holiday was ruled safe. On November 15, Jake Peavy won the National League 
Cy Young Award by unanimous ballot. He was the fourth Padre to capture 
the pitching award. The Padres entered the 2007–08 offseason with a number 
of questions, including the ability of Trevor Hoffman to close games past 
his 40th birthday, the ongoing inability to hold runners on base (the Padres' 
caught-stealing ratio in 2007 was one of the worst in baseball history), 
two holes in the back of the starting rotation, and the possible departure 
of Mike Cameron to free agency. The two holes in the rotation were filled 
by former Dodger Randy Wolf and Mark Prior and the club dealt for Jim Edmonds 
to replace Cameron. Additionally, Milton Bradley was signed by the Texas 
Rangers. The Padres signed Mark Prior to a one-year deal in the off-season. 
Prior, a University of San Diego HS graduate (now Cathedral HS), joined 
a team that consisted of players that were also local prep stars, Brian 
Giles (Granite Hills HS), Adrian Gonzalez (Eastlake HS), and Óscar Robles 
(Montgomery HS). Recent Padres teams had also included Dave Roberts (Rancho 
Buena Vista HS), David Wells (Point Loma HS), and Marcus Giles (Granite 
Hills HS). The Padres started the 2008 campaign March 31, in San Diego 
against the Houston Astros, and won the series 3–1. 2007 All-Star Chris 
Young pitched in the second game of the season, a 2–1 win, and Trevor Hoffman, 
the game's all-time saves leader, wrapped up the ninth for the save. The 
Los Angeles Dodgers came into town and took two of three. 2007 Cy Young 
winner Jake Peavy picked up the only win during the Dodgers' series. At 
the end of the opening homestand, the Padres were 3–3. The Padres traveled 
to San Francisco, hoping to fatten up on former manager Bruce Bochy's Giants, 
but the now-Bondsless bay dwellers took two of three. In Los Angeles, the 
Padres won two of three, pushing their record back to .500. On April 17, 
2008, during the series against the Colorado Rockies at Petco Park, the 
Padres played the longest game in team history, in terms of innings (22), 
losing 2–1.[30] The game was the second longest in team history, in terms 
of time, played in 6 hours, 16 minutes;[31] the game was a minute shorter 
than the longest game, in terms of time, played against the Houston Astros 
in 1980.[32] Following that game, which sapped the team's bullpen strength, 
the Padres stumbled, dropping games at home, where they struggled to score 
runs, and on the road, where they committed uncharacteristic errors and 
failed to hold leads. Returning home after a humbling[citation needed] 
three-game sweep in Atlanta in early May, the Padres cut Jim Edmonds, the 
Cardinals castoff who had been brought in after the Padres failed to sign 
Mike Cameron to a new deal in the off-season. With former Indian Jody Gerut 
now in center, the Padres won the three-game weekend home series with the 
Rockies and motored to Chicago with the hopes of winning three of four 
to get the season back on track. Instead, the Cubs, with Jim Edmonds in 
center, won three of four and booted the Padres from the Windy City into 
an interleague series with the Mariners, their Peoria, Ariz. spring training 
neighbors. The Mariners used speed—and a late-inning burst of power from 
Adrián Beltré in one game—to win the series and shove the Padres deeper 
into their early-season hole. After sweeping the New York Mets in a four-game 
series that ended on June 8, the Padres climbed to 7 games back of first-place 
Arizona. The sweep put the Mets 7.5 games behind the first-place Philadelphia 
Phillies, sending the Padres and the Mets, expansion teams in the 1960s, 
in different directions. The Padres won two of three games in a series 
against the Dodgers at Petco Park. There was talk in San Diego that the 
Padres had a serious chance to get back in the race in a weak NL West.[citation 
needed] A road trip sent the Padres to play the Indians in Cleveland, where 
they lost two of the three games. During their final trip to Yankee Stadium, 
the site of Tony Gwynn's upperdeck World Series blast, the Padres were 
swept by the Yankees. They returned to Petco and dropped two of three to 
the Tigers. They were then swept by the Twins and Mariners. Returning to 
National League competition did not help much, as Padres lost two of three 
in Colorado to the Rockies. Powered by former Diamondbacks outfielder Scott 
Hairston, the Padres won two of three in Arizona. The team could not sustain 
the momentum however and they lost two of three to the Marlins at Petco 
Park. In the last series before the All-Star break, the Padres lost two 
of three to the Braves. Adrian Gonzalez represented the Padres at the All-Star 
Game at Yankee Stadium, going 1–3 with an RBI. Gonzalez made a nice scoop 
on a throw from catcher Russell Martin during a tense moment late in the 
game but he struck out with a chance to drive in the go-ahead run late 
in the game. According to media reports, Gonzalez was asked during an All-Star 
game media session what it would take for the Padres to make the playoffs. 
He said 30 wins. When the interviewer asked if he thought that was possible, 
Gonzalez glared at the interviewer and did not answer the question.[citation 
needed] On July 17, the Padres traded former San Diego State player Tony 
Clark to the Diamondbacks for minor league pitcher Evan Scribner. Following 
the All-Star break, the Padres continued to struggle, getting swept in 
a four-game series in St. Louis and losing two of three in Cincinnati. 
A trip to Pittsburgh proved to be the tonic the team needed. The Padres 
won three of four in the Steel City and during the series the Pirates traded 
former Padre underachiever Xavier Nady to the Yankees for prospects. Back 
home, the Padres won the first game of the series against the division-leading 
Diamondbacks. The win gave Greg Maddux 351 career wins and he tipped his 
hat to the crowd when he left with a lead. Late in August, the team parted 
ways with Greg Maddux by trading him to the Los Angeles Dodgers. As this 
disastrous season started to come to a close, questions about the coaching 
staff started swirling like crazy.[citation needed] In mid-September, Hitting 
Coach Wally Joyner resigned due to the team's lackluster offense and a 
difference in philosophy with upper management (most notably, CEO Sandy 
Alderson). It seems that Joyner beat the Padres to the punch, as he was 
likely to be replaced at the end of the season.[citation needed] The team 
finished off a 63–99 season on September 28 with a 10–6 loss to the Pittsburgh 
Pirates, finishing 5th in the NL West, 21 games behind the division leader 
Los Angeles Dodgers. On September 29, the team renewed the contracts of 
Manager Bud Black, Pitching Coach Darren Balsley, Bullpen Coach Darrell 
Akerfelds, 3rd Base Coach Glenn Hoffman (brother of closer Trevor Hoffman) 
and 1st Base Coach Rick Renteria. Only Bench Coach Craig Colbert was not 
renewed and because of Wally Joyner's earlier resignation the team had 
no Hitting Coach to bring back. On October 10, the Padres offered Trevor 
Hoffman a $4 million salary for 2009 plus a $4 million club option in 2010 
then on November 11 the Padres withdrew the $4 million offer to the all-time 
saves leader, making him a free agent.[33] The Padres opened 2009 April 
6 versus the rival Dodgers at home, losing 4–1 and splitting the four-game 
series. They then swept the Giants, also at home in three games. Then they 
took 2 of 3 from the Mets to ruin the first series at Citi Field. In that 
series, Jody Gerut became the first player in major league history to open 
a new ballpark with a leadoff home run.[34] After the first three series, 
the Padres were tied with the Dodgers for first place at 7–3. After the 
hot start however, the Padres stumbled and were 25–25 as of May 31. Early 
in the season, the Padres acquired Tony Gwynn, Jr., son of franchise great 
Tony Gwynn, from the Milwaukee Brewers. San Diego finished 75–87, fourth 
in the NL West, only ahead of the Arizona Diamondbacks. Many preseason 
predictions picked the Padres in 2010 to finish the season in last place 
in the NL West.[35] On August 25, however, the Padres were 76–49 and in 
first place with a 6  1⁄2 game lead.[36] A 10–game losing streak immediately 
followed.[37] With a 3–0 loss on October 3, the final game of the season, 
the Padres were officially eliminated from playoff contention and the eventual 
World Series champion San Francisco Giants won the division.[36] The Padres 
led the NL West for 148 days in 2010.[37] Adrian Gonzalez would have been 
in the last year of his contract in 2011, but the Padres were not going 
to meet Gonzalez's open market value especially with Jeff Moorad's purchase 
of the Padres from John Moores not completing until around 2013.[38][39] 
On December 6, 2010, Gonzalez was traded to the Boston Red Sox for a package 
of right-handed pitcher Casey Kelly, first baseman Anthony Rizzo, outfielder 
Reymond Fuentes, and a player to be named later, later determined to be 
Eric Patterson.[40][41] After the 2011 season, general manager Jed Hoyer 
left the Padres to join the Chicago Cubs. Josh Byrnes was promoted from 
senior vice president of baseball operations to replace Hoyer.[42][43] 
Byrnes made two big trades in the offseason. He traded Rizzo to Hoyer's 
new club, the Cubs, in a four-player trade that brought right-hander Andrew 
Cashner to the Padres.[44] Byrnes also traded young ace Mat Latos to the 
Reds for starting pitcher Edinson Vólquez and prospects Yonder Alonso, 
catcher Yasmani Grandal and pitcher Brad Boxberger.[45] Former Reds general 
manager Jim Bowden commented that the Padres clearly won the trade with 
the Reds, saying "In modern times, I can’t remember a trade that was this 
far lopsided."[46] In March 2012, Moorad withdrew his application to complete 
the full purchase of the Padres.[47][48] He stepped down as CEO of the 
Padres later that month, but remained with the team as Vice-Chairman.[49] 
Media outlets including U-T San Diego, Fox Sports, and Associated Press 
speculated that Moorad was short of the needed support of 22 MLB team owners 
to complete the purchase of the Padres.[47][48][49] Moores declared that 
the entire team was up for sale again in April, citing the good opportunity 
in the market after the record $2 billion sale of the Los Angeles Dodgers.[50] 
In August, MLB approved Moores' $800 million sale of the Padres to a group 
led by beer distributor Ron Fowler that included four heirs to the O’Malley 
family, who owned the Dodgers for five decades. The sale completed on or 
before August 28, 2012.[51][52] As much as $200 million of the sale price 
includes the team's 20-percent stake in Fox Sports San Diego.[53] Members 
of the O'Malley family include Kevin and Brian O'Malley, who are the sons 
of former Dodgers owner Peter O'Malley and grandsons of Walter O'Malley, 
the owner who moved the Dodgers west from Brooklyn after the 1957 season. 
Peter and Tom Seidler are the nephews of Peter O’Malley.[51] Fowler was 
named the ownership group's executive chairman and was named the Padres 
representative in all league meetings.[51][54] He was the first locally 
based control person of the team since founding owner C. Arnholdt Smith.[54]
