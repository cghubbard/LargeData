Panthers is the only non Athenian team that ever won a baseball championship 
in Greece and this is a wonder since there is no baseball field in entire

athletes from broken baseball teams in Patras ( Sirius, Pelops, Theseus

Greece because of the economic crisis. The team played first time in 2009 
at the Greek Baseball League and won the Silver medal . They tied with 
the first team Spartakos Glyfadas , but due to the defeat in their match 
between, Panthers ranked second. In 2010 the team participated in the 10th 
Greek Baseball League and won the first place and the gold medal. It is 
the first time for any men team from Patras, that won any champion that

in Greece, abandoned the team, leaving it with only rookies. The team played 
next championship, and ranked 5th and next year did not participate. Again 
played in 2013 but 3 injuries made the 2013 attempt to stop early. The 
baseball team collects new players and struggles with no baseball field 
to teach the basics and participate again in the next up coming event of
