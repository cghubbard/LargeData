The Schaumburg Boomers are a professional baseball team, based in Schaumburg, 
Illinois, that began play in the independent Frontier League on May 18, 
2012 with their first home game coming a week later on May 25. Home games 
are played at Schaumburg Baseball Stadium. The Boomers replaced the now 
defunct Schaumburg Flyers of the Northern League after the franchise was 
evicted for not paying almost $1 million in back rent.[1] The "Boomers" 
nickname comes from a common nickname for males of the greater prairie 
chicken species, a bird which was once abundant in the Midwest but is now 
a vulnerable species. That bird's nickname comes from the dance these males 
do in order to attract females for mating purposes. The Boomers carry on 
the mascot's tradition by performing a reenactment of the prairie chicken's 
dance in between innings during games. Originally, the team was set to 
play in the American Association of Independent Professional Baseball under 
the ownership of Joliet Slammers principal owner Alan Oremus; however, 
Oremus sold the team to Gary SouthShore RailCats owner Pat Salvi, who moved 
the team to the Frontier League because of his loyalty to the RailCats 
and lack of interest in setting up a conflict should the two teams play 
against each other.[2] Under Oremus's ownership, the team had held a name-the-team 
contest, with the winner selecting "Mallers". After the ownership change, 
however, the Boomers name, logo, and colors were unveiled on October 18, 
2011.[3] The games are broadcast on WRMN (1410 AM, Elgin, Illinois) by 
Boomers broadcaster Tim Calderwood.[4][5] Shortstop Gerard Hall recorded 
the first hit in Boomers history in a 4-0 shutout against the Lake Erie 
Crushers in Avon, Ohio in the franchise's first-ever regular season game. 
Outfielder Jereme Milons had the first extra-base hit in team history with 
a double to centerfield in the same game. The Boomers won their home debut 
with a 5-2 victory over the Florence Freedom in front of 6,067 fans at 
Boomers Stadium. Outfielder Nate Baumann hit the first home run at Boomers 
Stadium with a two-run blast to left in the five-run sixth inning. The 
Schaumburg Boomers won the 2013 Frontier League Championship in September 
2013, becoming the first team in Frontier League history to finish the 
playoffs undefeated (in this case 6-0 as they won two best-of-5 series). 
They defeated the Lake Erie Crushers in the championship final. The Boomers 
again won the 2014 Frontier League Championship, winning back-to-back titles. 
They beat the Southern Illinois Miners 2 games to 1 in the Divisional round, 
and beat the River City Rascals 3 games to 1 to win the Title. The Boomers 
finished the first half of their inaugural season as the Frontier League 
West Division Leaders with a record of 29-19. The team had a total of 10 
representatives appear in the 2012 Frontier League All-Star game in Normal, 
Illinois. Manager Jamie Bennett managed the West Division squad and was 
joined by his coaching staff, Mike Kashirsky, Paul Kubon, C.J. Thieleke, 
and team trainer Scott Waehler. Schaumburg's Frank Pfister was selected 
as the West Division's starting third-baseman, and was joined by outfielders 
Sean Mahley and Chad Mozingo and pitchers Cameron Roth and Patrick Mincey.[6] 
The mascot of the Schaumburg Boomers is Coop the boomer. Coop is portrayed 
by a person dressed in a prairie chicken costume.[7][8] Pitchers Catchers
