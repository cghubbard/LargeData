As player As manager James Louis Fregosi (April 4, 1942 – February 14, 
2014) was an American professional baseball player and manager. He played 
in Major League Baseball as a shortstop. During an 18-year baseball career, 
he played from 1961–1978 for four different teams, primarily the Los Angeles 
and California Angels. In that franchise's first eleven years of play, 
he became its first star as the team's most productive and popular player. 
He led the American League (AL) in double plays twice, winning the 1967 
Gold Glove Award, and upon leaving the team ranked ninth in AL history 
with 818 double plays. He holds the franchise record with 70 career triples; 
several of his other team records, including career games (1,429), hits 
(1,408), doubles (219), runs (691) and runs batted in (546), were broken 
by Brian Downing between 1986 and 1989. He returned to the team as manager, 
guiding it to its first-ever postseason appearance in 1979, and later managed 
the Philadelphia Phillies to the 1993 National League pennant. He was the 
top advance scout for the Atlanta Braves when he died.[1] He suffered a 
stroke while on a cruise with Major League Baseball alumni in February 
2014 and was taken to a hospital in Florida for treatment where he was 
put on life support. He was taken off life support after suffering multiple 
strokes in the hospital, and died a few hours later. A right-handed batter, 
Fregosi is one of many notable alumni of Junípero Serra High School of 
San Mateo, California, and was signed by the Boston Red Sox in 1960. The 
same year he was selected by the Angels in the 1960 MLB Expansion Draft, 
and made his debut in September 1961. After hitting .291 as a reserve in 
1962, he batted .287 – ninth in the AL – in his first full season in 1963, 
and was second in the league in triples and fifth in hits. He made his 
first All-Star squad in 1964, batting .277. From 1964 to mid-1969, he teamed 
with second baseman Bobby Knoop to form one of the game's top double play 
combinations; with Knoop winning Gold Gloves from 1966–68, the two became 
only the third middle infield combination to win the honor in the same 
season (1967). On July 28, 1964, he became the first Angel to hit for the 
cycle (and the only man to do so at Dodger Stadium until Orlando Hudson 
accomplished the feat in 2009), and he did so again on May 20, 1968 but 
this one was an unnatural cycle. Fregosi continued to turn out solid years, 
particularly in 1967 when he batted .290 (seventh in the AL) and won his 
only Gold Glove, finishing seventh in the MVP voting. He became regarded 
as the league's top-hitting shortstop, leading the AL in triples (13) in 
1968, and was named an All-Star every season from 1966 to 1970. But he 
was sidelined in 1971 when a tumor was discovered in his foot. The Angels 
became uncertain of Fregosi's future, and on December 10 traded him to 
the New York Mets in the same deal that brought pitcher Nolan Ryan to California. 
(Fregosi would later manage Ryan in 1978 and 1979, Ryan's last two years 
as an Angel.) Sidelined by several injuries including a broken thumb in 
1972, Fregosi struggled with the Mets, where he played mainly at third 
base, and was sold to the Texas Rangers in the 1973 mid-season. After five 
years as a backup for the Rangers (1973–77), during which he played primarily 
as a first baseman, he was sent to the Pittsburgh Pirates in June 1977. 
When the Angels expressed interest in naming him as their manager in 1978, 
the Pirates released him to pursue the opportunity. In his 18-year career, 
Fregosi batted .265 with 1726 hits, 151 home runs, 844 runs, 706 RBI, 264 
doubles, 78 triples, and 76 stolen bases in 1902 games played. In addition 
to the Angels records previously noted, Brian Downing also broke his club 
marks for career at bats (5244), total bases (2112) and extra base hits 
(404). Don Baylor broke his team record of 115 home runs in 1981. Fregosi 
was the last player to retire who was a member of the "original" Los Angeles 
Angels. In becoming the Angels' manager at age 36, Fregosi was presented 
with a solid team nucleus of Ryan, Baylor, Downing, Bobby Grich, Carney 
Lansford, Frank Tanana and longtime owner Gene Autry, compiling a record 
of 62-55 in 117 games, and tying for second with Texas behind the Kansas 
City Royals. In 1979, with the addition of Rod Carew, he led the Angels 
to an 88-74 record, surprising the Royals and winning the first title in 
the club's 19-year existence. But they didn't have enough to get by the 
Baltimore Orioles in the 1979 American League Championship Series, losing 
Game 1 in 10 innings and dropping a 9-8 slugfest in Game 2; the Angels 
captured a 4-3 win in Game 3, scoring twice in the bottom of the ninth 
on an error and a Larry Harlow double, but were knocked out in an 8-0 Game 
4 loss. After Ryan's departure to the Houston Astros at the end of the 
season, the team's pitching faltered in 1980, and the club dropped back 
into sixth place in their division; Fregosi was replaced in the first half 
of the 1981 season. Fregosi's record was 237 wins and 248 losses in the 
regular season and one win and three losses in the post-season.[2] From 
the Angels, Fregosi was brought back into the game by Cardinals Farm Director 
Lee Thomas to manage the Louisville Redbirds of the American Association 
for three seasons. Louisville won the league championship in Fregosi's 
first season in 1983, and lost the league championship in the playoffs. 
In Fregosi's second season, Louisville tied for fourth place in the regular 
season but won the 1984 league championship. In 1985 Fregosi's Louisville 
team finished the season in first place and won the league championship 
in the playoffs also. With his success in Louisville, Fregosi was hired 
to manage the Chicago White Sox in 1986. Fregosi managed the team for three 
seasons, in each of which the White Sox finished in fifth place in the 
American League West. Fregosi was released at the end of the 1988 season. 
Fregosi finished with a record of 193 wins and 226 losses in the regular 
season.[2] He didn't manage any post-season games for the White Sox.[2] 
Fregosi returned in 1991 with the Phillies, hired again by former Angels 
teammate and General Manager Lee Thomas. His greatest triumph as a manager 
came in 1993, when he managed the club to the World Series. After finishing 
26 games out of first place in 1992, the 1993 Phillies (featuring a cast 
of colorful characters including Darren Daulton, Lenny Dykstra, Dave Hollins, 
John Kruk, Danny Jackson, Curt Schilling, and Mitch Williams) charged to 
97 wins and then further shocked the baseball world by pulling off a major 
upset against the two-time defending NL Champion Atlanta Braves in six 
games in the League Championship Series. Despite putting up a good fight 
against the defending World Champion Toronto Blue Jays in the World Series, 
Fregosi's Phillies wound up losing to Toronto in six games, with Joe Carter's 
Series-winning home run in Game 6 being the final blow. Despite the World 
Series run, Fregosi was often the target of criticism by the Philadelphia 
sports media. One general criticism of Fregosi was that he was a manager 
who relied on veteran players and was unable to develop younger players. 
He was ultimately fired by the Phillies in 1996 after posting a series 
of dismal post-1993 seasons. Fregosi finished with a record of 431 wins 
and 463 losses in the regular season and six wins and six losses in the 
post-season.[2] Fregosi was hired away from the San Francisco Giants (where 
he had been serving as a special assistant) as the new manager for the 
Blue Jays in 1999, and was replaced after the 2000 season despite the fact 
that the team finished in third place and above .500 in each of his two 
years in Toronto. Fregosi finished with a record of 167 wins and 157 losses 
in the regular season.[2] This ended up being his final managerial position 
in Major League Baseball.[2] This was the only team where he finished above 
.500 winning percentage.[2] As a manager, he had a record of 1028 wins 
and 1094 losses in 15 seasons.[2] He also managed 16 post-season games.[2] 
His post-season record was seven wins and nine losses.[2] At the end of 
2004, when the Phillies were looking for a manager to replace Larry Bowa, 
Fregosi surfaced as a candidate for the job. The job ended up going to 
Charlie Manuel. Fregosi's number 11 was retired by the Angels in 1998. 
Fregosi delivered a eulogy at the March 2007 funeral of longtime friend 
and former Phillies coach John Vukovich.[3][4] In February 2014, Fregosi 
was a part of an MLB Alumni cruise when he suffered multiple strokes. The 
cruise docked in the Cayman Islands where he was rushed to a local hospital, 
had his condition stabilized by doctors, and then was moved to Miami. However, 
on February 13, Fregosi's condition took a turn for the worse and died 
at 2:36 AM on February 14.[5] Phillies owner David Montgomery called Fregosi
