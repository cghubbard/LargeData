Leon Kessling "Red" Ames (August 2, 1882 â€“ October 8, 1936) was an American 
pitcher in Major League Baseball for the New York Giants, Cincinnati Reds, 
St. Louis Cardinals, and Philadelphia Phillies. Born in Warren, Ohio, Ames 
was a third or fourth starter for the New York Giants during their early 
period of dominance under John McGraw. He made his debut on September 14, 
1903, pitching an abbreviated five-inning no-hitter against the Cardinals, 
but was not in the rotation full-time until 1905, when his 22 wins and 
2.74 ERA helped the Giants to their first twentieth-century world championship. 
This was by far his best season; although the Giants were perennial contenders 
during this time, injury and wildness kept him from becoming a star even 
though he was the Opening Day pitcher three years running. A career ERA 
of 2.63 ties him with Cy Young. He pitched in three World Series with the 
Giants (1905, 1911, 1912), but appeared almost entirely in relief in the 
fall classic, starting only once, the last game in 1911, which he lost 
decisively to the world champion Philadelphia Athletics. He was traded 
to the Reds in 1913, and never again approached his earlier success with 
the Giants. Ames' greatest distinction was being one of the wildest pitchers 
in history with a curveball charitably described as "dramatic." Other of 
his notable accomplishments are leading the National League in saves with 
6 in 1914 and 8 in 1916, and in strikeouts per 9 innings pitched in 1905 
(6.78), 1906 (6.90) and 1907 (5.63). On Opening Day, April 15, 1909, he 
achieved the feat of losing a no-hitter in a game in which he did not give 
up a hit until the 10th inning or a run until the 13th, but received credit 
for nine no-hit innings.[1] After leaving the majors, he pitched in the 
minors for three more years and managed briefly in the minors in 1923.
