III Corps First Army Division West 1st Cavalry Division 36th Engineer Brigade 
13th Sustainment Command. 3d Cavalry Regiment 41st Fires Brigade 504th 
Battlefield Surveillance Brigade Fort Hood is a U.S. military post located 
in Killeen, Texas. The post is named after Confederate General John Bell 
Hood. It is located halfway between Austin and Waco, about 60 miles (100 km) 
from each, within the U.S. state of Texas. Its origin was the need for 
wide-open space to test and train with World War II tank destroyers. The 
War Department announced the location in January 1942, and the initial 
completion was set for that August. As originally constructed, Fort Hood 
had an area of 158,706 acres (64,226 ha), with billeting for 6,007 officers 
and 82,610 enlisted personnel. The main cantonment of Fort Hood had a total 
population of 53,416 as of the 2010 U.S. Census. Fort Hood is the most 
populous U.S. military installation in the world.[1] The main business 
area is in Bell County, with the training countryside area of the post 
in Coryell County. In April 2014, the Fort Hood website lists 45,414 assigned 
soldiers and 8,900 civilian employees with Fort Hood covering 214,000 acres 
(87,000 ha).[2] During World War II, tank destroyers were developed to 
counter German mobile armored units. These were mobile anti-tank guns on 
armored halftracks or specially developed tanks. Wide-open space was needed 
for the tank destroyer testing and training, which Texas had in abundance. 
Andrew Davis (A.D.) Bruce was assigned to organize a new Tank Destroyer 
Tactical and Firing Center, and he chose Killeen, Texas for the new camp.[3] 
The War Department announced the selection on 15 January 1942. An initial 
acquisition of 108,000 acres (169 mi² / 437 km²) was made, and it was estimated 
that the camp would cost $22,800,000 for the land, facilities, and development 
of utilities. The date of completion was set for 15 August 1942. About 
300 families had to move from their homes to make room for the camp area 
and the communities of Clear Creek, Elijah, and Antelope were demolished 
to facilitate construction of the base. The old Sugar Loaf community, historically 
called the "Cradle of Killeen," provided the city with many of its first 
citizens in 1882. All that remains of the community is the mountain from 
which it took its name, located in the Fort Hood area. To lessen the burden 
of moving, the Army agreed to allow land to be used for grazing for a nominal 
grazing fee. This grazing arrangement still continues today.[citation needed] 
In mid-August the camp was occupied and the official opening took place 
on 18 September 1942. Camp Hood was named for the Confederate General John 
Bell Hood, who gained recognition during the Civil War as the commander 
of Hood's Texas Brigade.[citation needed] The original facilities provided 
housing and training sites for nearly 38,000 troops. In January 1943, an 
additional 16,000 acres (65 km²) in Bell County and 34,943 acres (141 km²) 
in Coryell County near Gatesville, Texas were purchased. The site near 
Gatesville was known as the sub-camp and later as North Camp Hood. During 
the war years, North Camp Hood housed nearly 40,000 troops and 4,000 prisoners 
of war, and was the site for the southern branch of the United States Disciplinary 
Barracks.[citation needed] At the end of 1942 there were about 45,000 troops 
living and training at Camp Hood and in late June 1943 it peaked at almost 
95,000 troops, which was maintained until early 1944.[citation needed] 
In 1944 the number of tank destroyer battalions in training at Camp Hood 
declined rapidly. Field artillery battalions and the Infantry Replacement 
Training Center replaced them in March 1944. By September, the Infantry 
Center was the largest activity on post with 31,545 troops. The total camp 
population on the last day of 1944 was 50,228.[citation needed] During 
the last year of World War II Camp Hood's mission shifted and its population 
drastically decreased. As the war came to an end, troop training slowed 
and the priorities were equipment reclamation and demobilization. A separation 
center was established in September 1945, and as the year ended, post strength 
had fallen to 1,807 prisoners and about 11,000 troops.[citation needed] 
In mid-1954, III Corps moved from California to Fort Hood. The Corps supervised 
the training of combat units at Fort Hood and other Fourth Army stations 
from 1954 to 1959 when III Corps was inactivated. Probably the most famous 
trainee to come through Fort Hood was Elvis Presley, arriving on 28 March 
1958. Other than receiving record amounts of mail (3–4 bags per day), he 
was treated like all other trainees. On 19 September, Presley shipped out 
for Germany. During this period, the 4th Armored Division was reactivated 
and deployed to Germany as part of the "Gyroscope" concept of unit movement. 
In 1958, the 4th Infantry Division was selected to be the sole infantry 
component in the Strategic Army Corps (STRAC) and assigned the mission 
to suppress aggression wherever American interests were threatened.[citation 
needed] In September 1961, Fort Hood again became the home for the III 
Corps, and in February 1962, III Corps was assigned as part of the U.S. 
Army Strategic Army Corps (STRAC). On 15 June 1963 Killeen Base was turned 
over to the Army.[citation needed] In October 1969, Killeen Base was designated 
as West Fort Hood and the airfield's name was designated as Robert Gray 
Army Airfield. The base was named after a Killeen native who was a pilot 
of a B-25 bomber on the famous Doolittle Raid on Tokyo in 1942. He was 
killed later in World War II flying combat missions. With the redesignation 
came a change in mission at West Fort Hood. Nuclear weapons were removed; 
they had been secretly kept there since 1947.[4] During the late 1960s 
Fort Hood trained and deployed a number of units and individuals for duty 
in Vietnam. As the United States ended its role in the conflict, thousands 
of returning soldiers completed their active duty with one of the divisions. 
During this time, the post was modernized. On 13 September 1965 Darnall 
Hospital opened. In 1970, construction began on Palmer Theater and Venable 
Village was dedicated. Modern barracks were springing up around post. The 
wood buildings of Fort Hood were replaced with brick structures.[citation 
needed] In September 1967, Fort Hood was officially designated a two-division 
post with the 1st and 2d Armored Divisions. In 1971 the colors of the 1st 
Cavalry Division came to Fort Hood from Vietnam, resulting in the reflagging 
of the 1st Armored Division, the colors of which were sent to Germany to 
reflag the 4th Armored Division.[citation needed] From 23 December 1972 
to 19 January 1973, Elements of the 13th Support Brigade deployed to the 
1972 Nicaragua earthquake to assist in disaster relief serving at Camp 
Christine, Managua, Nicaragua.[citation needed] Since the early 1970s, 
Fort Hood has played a major role in the training, testing, and introduction 
of new equipment, tactics, and organizations. The U.S. Army Training and 
Doctrine Command's Test and Experimentation Command (now the U.S. Army 
Operational Test Command), located at West Fort Hood has been A primary 
player. Fort Hood fielded the M1 Abrams tank, M2/3 Bradley Infantry/Cavalry 
Fighting Vehicle, the Multiple Launch rocket System (MLRS), and the AH-64 
Apache helicopter.[citation needed] In January 1975, the 1st Cav "First 
Team" was reorganized, as the Army's newest armored division. Since fielding 
the M-1 Abrams in 1980, force modernization has continued as a major focus. 
The First Team became the first division to field the AH-64 Apache attack 
helicopter, M2 Bradley Fighting Vehicle, the Humvee, the Multiple Launch 
Rocket System and Mobile Subscriber Equipment (MSE) tactical communications.[citation 
needed] In August 1990, Fort Hood was alerted for deployments to Southwest 
Asia as part of the joint forces participating in Operation Desert Shield. 
The deployment to Saudi Arabia began in September, extending into mid-October. 
on 21 May 1991 with the reactivation of its 3rd Brigade ("Greywolf") the 
1st Cavalry Division became the largest division in the Army upon its return 
to the United States. In October 1992 the Engineer Brigade, 1st Cavalry 
Division was reactivated. Through the Engineer Restructuring Initiative, 
the nucleus of the brigade was formed around the 8th Engineer Battalion. 
The 20th Engineer Battalion was brought from Fort Campbell, KY, to join 
the brigade, and the 91st Engineer Battalion was activated to complete 
the brigade. In November 1992, the unit designations for the battalions 
remaining from the former "Tiger" Brigade of the 2nd Armored Division were 
returned prior to 2nd AD's activation at Fort Hood on 2 December 1992. 
This action was done to realign the historical designations of units to 
their parent divisions. On 29 November 1992, the 3d Battalion, 41st Infantry 
was designated as the 1st Battalion, 9th Cavalry; 1st Battalion, 67th Armor 
to 3d Battalion, 8th Cavalry, and 1st Battalion, 3rd Field Artillery to 
2d Battalion, 82d Field Artillery. On 16 December 1992, 1st Cavalry Division 
units designated to accomplish realignments for historical purposes and 
included the 1st Battalion, 32d Armor reflagged as 2d Battalion, 12th Cavalry; 
3d Battalion, 32d Armor to 1st Battalion, 12th Cavalry; and Battery A, 
333d Field Artillery to Battery B, 26th Field Artillery. During the post 
war periods called Operation Desert Calm and Operation Provide Comfort, 
Fort Hood units continued to serve in the Persian Gulf area. From December 
1992 to May 1993, Fort Hood soldiers deployed to Somalia for Operation 
Restore Hope to command and control the Joint Task Force Support Command. 
In the fall of 1994, Fort Hood units participated in the largest deployment 
since Operation Desert Shield and Desert Storm executed split base operations 
in the Caribbean Basin, Central America and Southwest Asia, in support 
of Operations Vigilant Warrior and Sea Signal V, as well as other contingency 
operations. 13th COSCOM Commander Brig. Gen. Billy K. Solomon deployed 
along with a portion of the headquarters in December 1992 to Mogadishu 
to serve as the nucleus of Joint Task Force Support Command. Their major 
units included the 593d Support Group (Fort Lewis), 36th Engineer Group 
(Fort Benning), 7th Transportation Group (Fort Eustis), and 62d Medical 
Group (Fort Lewis). Soldiers of the Lucky 13th returned to Fort hood in 
May 1993. As a result of the Base Realignment and Closure Commission (BRAC) 
reductions, the 5th Infantry Division (Mechanized), then located at Fort 
Polk Louisiana, was reflagged as the U.S. 2nd Armored Division in late 
1992. By mid-1993 the division at Fort Hood had completed changes of unit 
names to those associated with the 5th Division, and began participation 
in the early stages of the Army's Experimental Force, Force XXI. In 1995, 
the 2nd Armored Division was reflagged as the U.S. 4th Infantry Division. 
Twenty-five years after making its home in Colorado, the Ironhorse Division 
was again restationed to meet the Army's requirements but this move would 
be quite different from others. The Ironhorse Division became a split-based 
organization with six brigades and three separate battalions stationed 
at Fort Hood and the 3rd Brigade Combat Team remaining at Fort Carson. 
By December 1995 The 4th Infantry Division (Mechanized) assumed responsibility 
as the Army's Experimental Force (Force XXI), and on 15 December 1995 its 
colors were unfurled for the first time over central Texas and Fort Hood. 
Since the 1990s, Fort Hood units have supported Operation Joint Endeavor 
in Bosnia and Herzegovina. In October 1998, The 1st Cavalry Division was 
the first United States division to assume authority of the Multinational 
Division (North) area of operation in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The mission was 
to conduct operations to enforce the military provisions set forth by the 
Dayton Peace Accords. In 1998, the Ironhorse Division was designated to 
be the Army's first Multi-Component unit. The main objective being to enhance 
Total Force integration, optimize the unique capabilities of each component, 
and improve the overall readiness of the Army. The program was developed 
to leverage the strengths of the Army's three components (active, reserve 
and National Guard). As such, 515 positions within the division have been 
designated as reserve component. These positions include individuals, a 
unit from the Wyoming National Guard and dual-mission units from the Texas 
Army National Guard. In addition to peacekeeping efforts, Fort Hood units 
routinely participate in national and international disaster relief efforts. 
Hours after the 1985 Mexico City earthquake, III Corps units were ready 
to move out to provide assistance. Fort Hood units also aided Managua, 
Nicaragua, after an earthquake ravaged the city. During the 1990s, Fort 
Hood continued an extensive building program to modernize the post. This 
modernization continues today[when?], with emphasis on quality of life, 
force projection and training. The Robertson Blood Center, Soldier Development 
Center, and a new commissary at Warrior Way have been completed. Many other 
improvements were made to improve the Power Projection Mission of the post 
such as improvements to the railhead and the runway at Gray Army Airfield. 
Training ranges have been upgraded. At the beginning of the 21st century 
the Army's modernization was in full swing. Some of thes new advances in 
technology and war fighting included the fielding of the M1A2 Abrams Main 
Battle Tank, the M2A2 Operation Desert Storm (ODS) Bradley Infantry Fighting 
Vehicle, the M109A6 Paladin Howitzer, the OH-58D Kiowa Warrior, the AH-64D 
Apache Longbow Helicopter, and the M6 Bradley Linebacker.[citation needed] 
Fort Hood was the first installation selected to privatize post housing 
under the residential communities initiative. Under this initiative, new 
housing units, remodeled housing and community improvements will be added 
to the post.[citation needed] In 2001, the war on terror became a prime 
focus. Fort Hood transitioned from an open to a closed post with the help 
of military police from reserve units. The 1st Cav sent additional troops 
to Kuwait to protect against possible aggressive actions from Iraq. The 
4003rd Garrison Support Reserve unit fills vacancies left by deploying 
units at Fort Hood. Fort Hood has a key role as a training base for mobilizing 
Reserve and National Guard units to support the Homeland Defense effort.[citation 
needed] Many Fort Hood units have deployed to Afghanistan for Operation 
Enduring Freedom, and to Iraq for Operation Iraqi Freedom. In December 
2003, the 4th Infantry Division captured Saddam Hussein. In the spring 
of 2004, the 1st Cavalry Division followed the 4th Infantry Division deploying 
to Iraq. Task Force ODIN was created at Ft. Hood.[citation needed] In September 
2005, 13th COSCOM and key enablers were called to support Joint Task Force 
Katrina/Rita hurricane relief and went on to serve as the senior joint 
logistical support command for JTF Katrina. 13th COSCOM eventually provided 
one hundred million rations, collected human remains with dignity, executed 
emergency engineering operations, transported, distributed and stored over 
one billion dollars in humanitarian relief from both non-governmental and 
federal sources from across the nation.[citation needed] In 2009, Fort 
Carson, Colorado's First Army Division West re-stationed to Fort Hood in 
order to consolidate its mission to conduct Reserve Component mobilization 
training and validation for deployment, switching places with 4th Infantry 
Division, which relocated to Fort Carson.[5] On 12 June 2007, the body 
of Lawrence George Sprader, Jr was found at about 8:30 p.m. in a brushy 
area located within the Central Texas Army post's training ground. He had 
gone missing for days while conducting an exercise for testing basic map-reading 
and navigation skills. A massive search had been conducted, with over 3000 
parties scouring the countryside. According to autopsy records, he had 
died from hyperthermia and dehydration.[6] According to an Army investigatory 
report, there were "a multitude of procedural violations, judgment errors 
and alleged acts of misconduct by Army trainers that not only contributed 
to Sprader's death but put some 300 other soldiers in danger that day, 
including about two dozen who required medical attention."[7] On 5 November 
2009, a gunman opened fire in the Soldier Readiness Center of Fort Hood 
and killed 13 people while wounding 32 others. Nidal Malik Hasan, a U.S. 
Army Major and psychiatrist, was the gunman. He was non-fatally shot and 
then arrested by Department of the Army police officers Sergeant Mark Todd 
and Sergeant Kimberly Munley.[8][9][10] Eyewitnesses to the actual events 
said: "...Major Hasan wheeled on Sergeant Munley as she rounded the corner 
of a building and shot her, putting her on the ground. Then Major Hasan 
turned his back on her and started putting another magazine into his semiautomatic 
pistol. It was at that moment that Senior Sgt. Mark Todd, a veteran police 
officer, rounded another corner of the building, found Major Hasan fumbling 
with his weapon and shot him."[11] In 2013, Hasan was convicted of thirteen 
counts of premeditated murder[12] and thirty-two counts of attempted premeditated 
murder for the thirty soldiers and two civilian police officers injured 
in the shooting.[13] On 23 August 2013, Hasan was found guilty on all charges 
and was sentenced to death.[14] Pfc. Naser Jason Abdo, an AWOL private, 
was arrested near Fort Hood, and in a statement by the police chief of 
Killeen, Texas, the man told investigators that he wanted to attack fellow 
soldiers at the military post.[15] At his trial in August 2012, Abdo stated, 
through a cloth mask, "I will continue until the day the dead are called 
to account for their deeds." Abdo was sentenced to life in prison for the 
attempted attack.[16] On 2 April 2014, a shooting spree occurred at several 
locations on the base, leaving three people dead and sixteen others wounded. 
The gunman then died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.[17][17][18] He 
was later identified as 34-year-old Ivan Lopez, an Iraq War veteran.[19][20] 
On 3 June 2014, a woman testified to a Fort Hood hearing board that the 
sexual assault prevention officer on base forced her into a prostitution 
ring.[21] The woman described how when she was 20, she was struggling to 
buy groceries for her preschool aged child after her husband left her and 
drained their bank account. According to UT San Antonio Associated Press, 
"Anu Bhagwati, executive director of Service Women's Action Network and 
a former captain with the Marine Corps, said prostitution rings are not 
uncommon within the military and the allegations against McQueen were no 
surprise." "Institutionally, a lot of inappropriate behavior is condoned," 
she told The Associated Press. "Women are so few within the military still 
that I think predators look at women as fresh meat and the military as 
an institution where they can get away with criminal activity."[22] The 
woman told the board that "Basically, it was having sex with higher ranking 
officers for money."[23] McQueen, who is no longer responsible for sexual 
assault prevention duties, is facing charges of pandering, conspiracy, 
adultery and sexual assault. According to the Military Times, "Investigators 
believe that McQueen, 37, persuaded a female private first class to become 
a prostitute who sold sex to other servicemembers, according to a senior 
defense official and Capitol Hill staffer who have been briefed on the 
investigation. It is the latest in a string of sex scandals to rock the 
military. Earlier this month, the Air Force officer in charge of sexual 
abuse prevention was arrested near the Pentagon, accused of drunkenly groping 
a woman. His trial is slated for July. Last week, the Pentagon announced 
that incidents of sexual assault had jumped 35 percent from 2010 to 2012, 
hitting 26,000. McQueen was working as a sexual harassment/assault response 
and prevention (SHARP) coordinator when he recruited the woman."[24] McQueen 
also approached another woman in an alleged attempt to get her to join 
the prostitution ring. She complained to military officials that after 
she refused, he sexually assaulted her.[24] In the court-martial of U.S. 
vs. Sgt. 1st Class Gregory McQueen on March 12, 2015 Military Judge Lt. 
Col. Rebecca Connally determined McQueen was guilty of having committed 
the following offenses. McQueen was also charged for one specification 
of Article 128, assault consummated by a battery, which was tried on the 
merits as he did not plead guilty to this particular offense. Connally 
announced that McQueen was guilty of this offense. The sentence adjudged 
in McQueen’s court-martial was a reduction to the grade of E-1, 24 months 
confinement and a dishonorable discharge.[25] Currently, Fort Hood has 
nearly 65,000 soldiers and family members and serves as a home for the 
following units: Headquarters III Corps; First Army Division West; the 
1st Cavalry Division; 13th Sustainment Command (formerly 13th Corps Support 
Command); 89th Military Police Brigade; 504th Battlefield Surveillance 
Brigade; 85th Civil Affairs Brigade; 1st Medical Brigade; and the 69th 
Air Defense Artillery Brigade. Fort Hood also includes Carl R. Darnall 
Army Medical Center and the Medical And Dental Activities as tenant units.[26] 
As of October 2015[update] Killeen, Texas started a land use study, to 
“identify and mitigate compatibility and encroachment issues that may impact 
training, operations".[27] Fort Hood has served as a hub for anti-war activity 
during both the Vietnam War (e.g. the "Fort Hood Three" incident) and the 
War on Terror. From 1968-1972, the Oleo Strut was a G.I. coffeehouse located 
near post in Killeen, Texas.[28] The coffee house was featured in the documentary 
Sir! No Sir!.[29] In 2009, the tradition of The Oleo Strut continued when 
the Under the Hood Café opened. The location serves as an outreach center 
for antiwar activists to reach out to area soldiers, and provide them with 
support.[28] Under the Hood Cafe announced on 10 Nov. 2014 that it would 
close by the end of the year.[30] Recently several soldiers supported by 
Under the Hood have taken public acts of resistance, including Amnesty 
International Prisoner of Conscience[31] Travis Bishop.[32][33][34] As 
of the census[35] of 2000, there were 33,711 people, 5,819 households, 
and 5,679 families residing in the Fort Hood CDP. The population density 
was 2,255.7 people per square mile (870.6/km²). There were 5,941 housing 
units at an average density of 397.5 per square mile (153.4/km²). The racial 
makeup of the CDP was 50.7% White, 31.6% African American, 1.2% Native 
American, 2.1% Asian, 0.8% Pacific Islander, 8.7% from other races, and 
4.8% from two or more races. 16.7% of the population were Hispanics or 
Latinos of any race. There were 5,819 households out of which 87.6% had 
children under the age of eighteen living with them, 87.1% were married 
couples living together, 8.2% had a female householder with no husband 
present, and 2.4% were non-families. 2.0% of all households were made up 
of individuals and 0.0% had someone living alone who is sixty-five years 
of age or older. The average household size was 3.92 and the average family 
size was 3.95. The age distribution was 33.3% under the age of eighteen, 
32.3% from eighteen to twenty-four, 33.1% from twenty-five to forty-four, 
1.2% from forty-five to sixty-four, and 0.1% who were sixty-five years 
of age or older. The median age was twenty-one years. For every one hundred 
females there were 163.4 males. For every one hundred females over the 
age of eighteen there were 209.4 males. All of these statistics are typical 
for military bases. The median income for a household on the base was $32,552, 
and the median income for a family was $32,296. Males had a median income 
of $18,884 versus $17,101 for females. The per capita income for the CDP 
was $11,078. 9.5% of the population and 8.3% of families were below the 
poverty line. Out of the total population, 11.0% of those under the age 
of eighteen and 25.8% of those sixty-five and older were living below the 
poverty line. Fort Hood is one of the largest United States military installations 
in the world, and is the home of III Corps, 1st Cavalry Division, 13th 
Sustainment Command, First Army Division West, 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment, 
41st Fires Brigade and many other Forces Command and other units. The 4th 
Infantry Division completed its move from Fort Hood to Fort Carson, Colorado, 
exchanging positions with several units. The 4th Infantry Division Museum 
closed at Fort Hood for the last time on 29 May 2009 to complete its move 
to Colorado although most of the outdoor pieces remained at Fort Hood as 
part of the new 3CR Museum.[36] Before the breakup of the Soviet Union, 
Fort Hood was billed as the largest military base in the free world (Fort 
Benning is larger in personnel, Fort Bliss in land area). During peacetime, 
Fort Hood is a gated post, with the 1st Cavalry Division Museum, the Belton 
Lake Outdoor Recreation Area (BLORA), and a number of other facilities 
that are open to the public. Access to the cantonments became restricted 
starting on 12 September 2001. However, passes are available to visit the 
two museums on post, and the lake area remains open to the public without 
restriction since it is outside the cantonments. Various events, including 
the annual Independence Day celebration, which has one of the largest fireworks 
displays in the country, are open to the public. Shortly after the 2000 
census, responsibility for post housing was turned over to privatized partnership 
with Actus Lend Lease. Under the terms of the contract, most of the housing 
has been remodeled or rebuilt, and hundreds of new units have been built 
or are in the process of being built, operating as Fort Hood Family Housing. 
The nine schools on Fort Hood are part of the Killeen Independent School 
District. Fort Hood consists of three sections: the main cantonment, West 
Fort Hood, and North Fort Hood. The main cantonment is bounded by Killeen 
on the east and Copperas Cove on the west. The Fort Hood main cantonment 
area, otherwise referred to as Main post, holds its own airfield, Hood 
Army Airfield. North Fort Hood is bounded by Gatesville to the northwest. 
West Fort Hood, bounded by Killeen and Copperas Cove, includes Fort Hood's 
second airfield, Robert Gray Army Airfield, which has been expanded for 
civilian use (Killeen-Fort Hood Regional Airport (GRK)) and additional 
training areas. To the east and southeast, the reservation is bounded by
