The New York Yankees are a professional baseball team based in the Bronx, 
a borough of New York City, New York. Also known as "the Bronx Bombers" 
and "the Pinstripers",[1][2] the Yankees play in the East Division of Major 
League Baseball's (MLB) American League (AL). In its 114 major league seasons, 
the franchise has won 27 World Series championships, the most of any MLB 
team and 16 more than the second-place St. Louis Cardinals.[3] The Yankees 
played home games in Yankee Stadium from 1923 to 2008, except for a stint 
at Shea Stadium from 1974 to 1975 while Yankee Stadium was undergoing renovations.[4] 
In 2009, the team moved into a new ballpark, which is also called Yankee 
Stadium.[5] The Baltimore Orioles began play in the AL in 1901.[6] After 
two seasons, the Orioles were replaced by a club in New York City; it is 
unclear whether it was an expansion team or a relocated version of the 
Orioles.[7] Frank Farrell and William S. Devery purchased the franchise, 
naming it the New York Highlanders.[8] In 1913, the team changed its name 
to the Yankees.[8] From 1921 to 1964, the Yankees were the most successful 
Major League franchise, winning 20 World Series titles and 29 AL pennants. 
This period included streaks of four consecutive championships from 1936 
to 1939 and five straight titles from 1949 to 1953. Following an 11-year 
playoff drought, the club appeared in the playoffs five times in a six-year 
period and won back-to-back World Series championships in 1977 and 1978. 
The Yankees won the World Series again in 1996, and in 1998 began a run 
of three consecutive Series titles. From 1995 to 2007, the Yankees made 
the playoffs each year; their 13-season postseason streak was the second-longest 
in MLB history.[9] After missing the playoffs in 2008, they won another 
World Series in 2009 and reached the postseason each year from 2010 to 
2012. In the most recent MLB season, 2016, New York had an 84–78 record 
and did not qualify for the playoffs. Overall, the Yankees' .569 regular 
season winning percentage is the highest of any MLB team, and they have 
the eighth-most regular season wins, behind seven clubs founded in the 
19th century.[10] These statistics are from Baseball-Reference.com's New
