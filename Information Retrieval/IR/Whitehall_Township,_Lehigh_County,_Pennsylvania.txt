Whitehall Township is a township with home rule status in Lehigh County, 
Pennsylvania, in the United States. It is a suburb of Allentown, Pennsylvania, 
in the Lehigh Valley region of the state. The population of Whitehall Township 
was 26,738 at the 2010 census. The Province of Pennsylvania was created 
in 1681 when King Charles II granted a tract of land in the New World to 
William Penn. After the death of William Penn, his sons, John, Thomas and 
Richard, became the owners of Pennsylvania. The Delaware Indians deeded 
that part of Lehigh County lying between the Lehigh (South) Mountain and 
the Blue Mountains to Penn’s sons in 1736. A wave of immigrants from Germany’s 
Palatinate settled in Whitehall Township, the first being Jacob Kohler, 
who settled in the vicinity of Egypt about 1728. The settlers staked their 
claim on the lands by applying to the Penn's for a land warrant. They cleared 
the land for farming and established churches around which villages grew. 
When the first European settlers came to the Whitehall area, the Lenape 
Indians were living on the banks of the Hokendauqua River. The Europeans 
and the Lenape Indians gathered together and designed a deal based on how 
far the Europeans were able to walk in 2 days, that's how much land they 
would acquire. So to gain more land, the Europeans paid a professional 
runner. The runner was able to get as far as what is now Coaldale, Pennsylvania, 
in Schuylkill County. A walk east got them as far as Jim Thorpe, Pennsylvania. 
The local tribe of Native Americans, the Lenni Lenapes, lived peacefully 
among the white settles for a time. They suffered injustices at the hands 
of the settlers and lashed back during the last Indian uprising in Lehigh 
County in 1763. Fort Deshler, which stood near Rt. 145 at Chestnut Street, 
played a key role in the defense of our lands during this battle in which 
23 settlers were killed. The original Whitehall Township, established in 
1753, was split into the three townships of Whitehall, North Whitehall 
and south Whitehall in 1867. The name Whitehall is said to have originated 
from Lynford Lardner’s hunting lodge that was painted with whitewash. Lardner 
named it “Grouse Hall”, but the common people of the region called it “White 
Hall”. Whitehall Township ’s villages include Cementon, Egypt, Fullerton, 
Hokendauqua, Mickleys, Stiles and West Catasauqua. Coplay was also part 
of Whitehall until it incorporated as a borough in 1869. Agriculture was 
the major industry until the mid-1800s. Today, about 2,000 acres (809 ha) 
are under cultivation. There were six grist mills in Whitehall, built to 
process grains for the farmers into flour and animal feed. Only one grist 
mill remains - the Helfrich Springs Grist Mill. It is the home of the Whitehall 
Historical Preservation Society, which has preserved the building for use 
as a local history museum. Completion of the Lehigh Canal in 1829 led to 
further development. Discovery of iron ore deposits brought Whitehall into 
the Industrial Revolution when the first blast iron furnace was built in 
Hokendauqua in 1854. This was immediately followed by the establishment 
of a railroad system to transport raw materials to the furnaces and to 
ship the final product. Population grew rapidly as these industries attracted 
Welsh and Irish immigrants. While the railroads were being constructed, 
cuts in the bedrock led to the discovery of Whitehall ’s deposits of Jacksonburg 
limestone or “cement rock”. David O. Saylor perfected and patented the 
process of manufacturing Portland Cement. The first Portland Cement plant 
was located between the villages of Cementon and Coplay. Others quickly 
followed and, by 1914, 70% of the cement produced in the United States 
came from the “Cement Belt” or Lehigh District. The cement industry attracted 
a new wave of immigrants from Austria-Hungary, creating yet another population 
spurt. Whitehall became classified as a First Class Township with a population 
of 7,935 in 1900. This gave the Township specified municipal rights for 
supplying electric lights, highways and sewers at public expense. The post-World 
War II era began the transition from the manufacturing industries to the 
retail industry as Whitehall became a bedroom community as a suburb of 
Allentown. The individual villages became united into one entity known 
as Whitehall in 1968, when the U.S. Post Office combined its separate town 
branches. In 1974, voters approved the adoption of a Home Rule Charter 
form of government, creating a seven-member legislative body and an elected 
Mayor. Today, with an annual budget in excess of $21 million, Whitehall 
provides a full range of municipal services to its residents.[1] According 
to the United States Census Bureau, the township has a total area of 12.8 square 
miles (33.1 km2), of which, 12.6 square miles (32.6 km2) of it is land 
and 0.2 square miles (0.6 km2) of it (1.80%) is water. The township was 
originally created on March 20, 1753 and included what is now North Whitehall 
and South Whitehall Townships. In 1810, a petition was made to the Northampton 
County Court to split the township into two portions (at the time, the 
area now encompassed by Lehigh County was part of Northampton County). 
The name Whitehall refers to a white hall that was built along the Jordan 
in the early 1700s as a hunting lodge. The area had a large ruffed grouse 
population along with numerous white-tail deer, eastern elk, eastern wolves, 
and black bear. Mountain lions or cougars may have also existed within 
Whitehall Township at some point in time. Because of the rich biodiversity 
of the area it became known as the wilderness of Whitehall. Old growth 
forest consisting of oak, tulip poplar, hickory, black walnut, sugar maple, 
basswood, American chestnut, American beech, and sycamore covered the entire 
township. In 1867 eastern portions of both North and South Whitehall were 
reapportioned into the current Whitehall Township. The new Whitehall Township 
is generally rectangular in shape, running from NNW to SSE and is situated 
along the western bank of the Lehigh River. Two years after the new township's 
formation, the Borough of Coplay was incorporated, removing from the township 
a square section of 0.6 square miles (1.6 km2). Whitehall is drained by 
the Lehigh River, which separates it from Northampton County and Catasauqua. 
Its villages include Cementon, Egypt, Fullerton, Hokendauqua, Mickleys, 
North Coplay, Scherersville (also in South Whitehall) Stiles, and West 
Catasauqua. The township's main north-to-south road is MacArthur Road (PA 
145), which has an interchange with US 22 in the south and crosses PA 329 
in the north. As of the census[2] of 2010, there were 26,738 people, 10,376 
households, and 6,817 families residing in the township. The population 
density was 1,981.1 people per square mile (764.7/km2). There were 10,744 
housing units at an average density of 855.0 per square mile (330.0/km2). 
The racial makeup of the township was 90.56% White, 2.74% African American, 
0.13% Native American, 3.62% Asian, 0.06% Pacific Islander, 1.71% from 
other races, and 1.18% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any 
race were 4.37% of the population. There were 10,376 households, out of 
which 27.0% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 53.3% were 
married couples living together, 8.8% had a female householder with no 
husband present, and 34.3% were non-families. 28.6% of all households were 
made up of individuals, and 52% had someone living alone who was 65 years 
of age or older. The average household size was 2.37 and the average family 
size was 2.93. In the township the population was spread out, with 21.2% 
under the age of 18, 7.3% from 18 to 24, 30.6% from 25 to 44, 22.7% from 
45 to 64, and 18.1% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 
40 years. For every 100 females there were 92.0 males. For every 100 females 
age 18 and over, there were 89.3 males. The median income for a household 
in the township was $43,070, and the median income for a family was $51,597. 
Males had a median income of $39,175 versus $26,933 for females. The per 
capita income for the township was $21,383. About 4.4% of families and 
6.5% of the population were below the poverty line, including 8.7% of those 
under age 18 and 7.0% of those age 65 or over. Whitehall-Coplay School 
District serves the township, as well as the borough of Coplay. Students 
in grades 9–12 from both municipalities attend Whitehall High School. There 
also are several parochial and private schools within the Township: The 
Dent Hardware Company Factory Complex at Fullerton and Helfrich's Springs 
Grist Mill are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.[3] The 
Lehigh Valley Mall, the largest Lehigh Valley-based shopping mall, is located 
in Whitehall Township, as is the Whitehall Mall. Several radio stations 
have broadcast facilities within the township (all owned by iHeartMedia): 
Walt Groller (born February 12, 1931 in Allentown, Pennsylvania) is an 
American polka musician. He is generally considered one of the premier 
polka musicians in the world.[1] Whitehall Township operates as a First 
Class Township. On November 5, 1974, the township adopted a Home Rule Charter 
(here) form of government that became effective January 5, 1976. As part 
of this governmental arrangement, the Township has separate executive and 
legislative branches. The legislative branch consists of a Township Board 
of Commissioners of seven (7) members, each serving 4-year terms. Four 
of the seats have terms that overlap the remaining three seat terms (e.g. 
four of the current terms end in 2007, while the remaining 3 terms end 
in 2009). The seated members then elect a President and Vice President 
who conduct Board meetings. The executive branch consists of a Mayor, who 
also serves a 4-year term. The Mayor may appoint a Deputy Mayor at his/her 
discretion, with approval from the Board of Commissioners. The Deputy Mayor 
does not automatically become Mayor should the standing Mayor leave office 
for any reason—a replacement is to be appointed by the Board of Commissioners. 
Whitehall Township also maintains an elected Treasurer who serves a 4-year 
term. The township is broken into twelve (12) voting districts, each with 
one polling place. Below is a list of each district, a link to a district 
map, area covered and the current polling location for the district. Map
