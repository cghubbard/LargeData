Florida. It is located in the Durkeeville community in northwest Jacksonville. 
Constructed in 1912 and rebuilt in 1936, it was the city's first municipal 
recreation field, and served as its primary baseball park before the construction 
of Wolfson Park in 1954. Throughout the years the stadium has been known 
at various times as Barrs Field, Durkee Field, and the Myrtle Avenue Ball 
Park. The original facility was constructed in 1911–1912 on a patch of 
land owned by Joseph H. Durkee, a former Union officer during the American 
Civil War who had settled in Jacksonville, where he became a prominent 
businessman and politician. In 1911, Durkee's son Jay Durkee turned control 
of the property over to Amander Barrs, a local businessman and President 
of the Jacksonville Baseball Association. Barrs ordered the construction 
of a recreational field to be used by local teams on the property. The 
facility was completed in 1912 and was known as Barrs Field, but was generally 
known as the Myrtle Avenue Ball Park to locals.[2] One early tenant was 
the Jacksonville Athletics, an African-American club for which James Weldon 
Johnson played. One of the rare professional clubs was the Jacksonville 
Scouts of the Florida State League, who played in 1921. However, as the 
city had no municipal park, other teams used fields at the Jacksonville 
Fairgrounds or across the river in South Jacksonville during this time.[2] 
In addition to local teams, Major League clubs including the New York Giants 
and the Brooklyn Dodgers held their spring training at the field. The Philadelphia 
Athletics were the first major league team to use Barrs Field for spring 
training, from 1914 until 1918. In 1918, the Pittsburgh Pirates held their 
spring training at the ballpark. From 1919 until 1920, the New York Yankees 
and the Brooklyn Dodgers called Barrs Field their spring training home. 
The Dodgers would return for one last spring at Barrs in 1922. The lack 
of a city park led both major and minor league teams to avoid Jacksonville 
after 1922. In 1926, the city government decided to purchase Barrs Field 
from Durkee in hopes of bringing back professional baseball. On March 13, 
1926, the city signed a binder to purchase the park, which was renamed 
Durkee Field. Shortly after this, the city entered into negotiations to 
bring a Southeastern League franchise to the city. This was successful, 
and the original incarnation of the Jacksonville Tars was born.[2] In 1932, 
the city purchased Durkee Field for $348,000. The original stadium was 
destroyed in a fire in 1936, but the city immediately rebuilt it in 1936–1937. 
The new structure was larger, and included a section for African-American 
patrons in the era of segregation. In 1938 and from 1941 to mid-1942, Jacksonville's 
only Negro league franchise, the Jacksonville Red Caps of the Negro American 
League, used the park as their home field.[3] The Jersey City Giants held 
spring training at the ballpark in 1946. In that year, the Giants were 
scheduled to play against a Montreal Royals team that included Jackie Robinson 
and John Wright, who were in the process of integrating organized baseball. 
The Giants-Royals game was scheduled for On March 24, 1946 at Durkee Field; 
however, the Jacksonville Playground and Recreation Board prohibited "white 
and Negro athletes" from playing together in their facilities, and pledged 
to bar Robinson and Wright from the park. The Royals, with support from 
the Dodgers, refused to leave Robinson and Wright at Montreal's training 
camp in Daytona Beach, and canceled the game.[4] In 1953, Jacksonville 
businessman Samuel W. Wolfson purchased the Jacksonville Tars franchise 
and reorganized the team as the Jacksonville Braves, a Class A affiliate 
of the Milwaukee Braves Major League Baseball club. Among the major changes 
Wolfson introduced to the team was racial integration. Three black players 
from the Braves farm system – Hank Aaron, Félix Mantilla, and Horace Garner 
– came to Jacksonville, making the Braves one of the first integrated teams 
in the South Atlantic League and in the state of Florida.[5] In the following 
year, the city started construction on the stadium later known as Wolfson 
Park, and the Braves moved out upon its completion.[5] After its replacement 
as the municipal ballpark, Durkee Field continued to be used by local high 
schools and colleges, including Edward Waters College, Raines High School, 
and Stanton High School. However, by the late 1970s the stadium was in 
disrepair and was scheduled for demolition. Local advocates pushed to save 
the park, and in 1980 Jacksonville City Council member Sallye B. Mathis 
sponsored legislation to renovate it and rename it for J. P. Small, who 
had served as a teacher, band director, coach, and athletic director of 
Stanton High from 1934 to 1969. Renovations included structural repairs, 
a new roof, press box and dugouts, paving the parking lot, a new playscape, 
and lighted fields. Councilwoman Denise Lee and Mayor Jake Godbold hosted 
a rededication ceremony of the park. Following demolition of Wolfson Park 
in 2002, J. P. Small Ballpark became the last historic park in the city 
of Jacksonville. In May 2003 the Jacksonville City Government pushed forward 
legislation that would give J. P. Small Ballpark a permanent historical 
marker. Further renovation in 2006 included a small museum. In July 2013, 
the park was added to the National Register of Historic Places under the
