The Los Angeles Dodgers are a Major League Baseball franchise currently 
based in Los Angeles. They play in the National League West division. The 
franchise joined the American Association in 1884 as the "Brooklyn Atlantics". 
They have been known in their early years as the "Brooklyn Grays" (1885–87), 
"Brooklyn Bridegrooms" (1888–90, 1896–98), "Brooklyn Grooms" (1891–95), 
"Brooklyn Superbas" (1899–1910, 1913), "Brooklyn Robins" (1914–31), and 
"Brooklyn Dodgers" (1911–12, 1932–57).[1] There have been 20 pitchers for 
the Dodgers that have thrown 25 no-hitters in franchise history.[2] A no-hitter 
is officially recognized by Major League Baseball only "...when a pitcher 
(or pitchers) allows no hits during the entire course of a game, which 
consists of at least nine innings. In a no-hit game, a batter may reach 
base via a walk, an error, a hit by pitch, a passed ball or wild pitch 
on strike three, or catcher's interference".[3] No-hitters of less than 
nine complete innings were previously recognized by the league as official; 
however, several rule alterations in 1991 changed the rule to its current 
form.[4] A no-hitter is common enough that only one team in Major League 
Baseball has never had a pitcher accomplish the feat.[a] There has been 
one perfect game thrown by a Dodgers pitcher. A perfect is defined by Major 
League Baseball as occurring "when a pitcher (or pitchers) retires each 
batter on the opposing team during the entire course of a game, which consists 
of at least nine innings. In a perfect game, no batter reaches any base 
during the course of the game."[3] This feat was achieved by Sandy Koufax 
on September 9, 1965. It was Koufax's fourth career no-hitter, and is the 
franchise record for no-hitters by one pitcher. At the time, Koufax's four 
no-hitters was the major league record for any pitcher, but it was later 
surpassed in 1981 by Nolan Ryan. Sam Kimber threw the first no-hitter in 
Dodgers history on October 4, 1884, which ended as a scoreless tie after 
ten innings.[5] The most recent no-hitter thrown by a Dodgers pitcher was 
on June 18, 2014 by Clayton Kershaw.[5] Five of the 20 pitchers were left-handed 
pitchers, 14 were right-handed, and one, Tom Lovett, is still unknown. 
In addition to Koufax, two other Dodgers pitchers have thrown multiple 
no-hitters, Adonis Terry and Carl Erskine. 18 of the no-hitters were thrown 
at home and seven on the road. The longest interval between no-hitters 
was between the games pitched by Hideo Nomo and Josh Beckett, encompassing 
17 years and 250 days from September 17, 1996 until May 25, 2014. Conversely, 
the shortest interval between no-hitters was between the games pitched 
by Beckett and Clayton Kershaw, encompassing merely 24 days from May 25, 
2014 until June 18, 2014. The San Francisco Giants (formerly "New York 
Giants") have been no-hit six times, the most by any Dodgers opponent. 
Dazzy Vance is the only Dodgers no-hit pitcher to have allowed at least 
one run. The most baserunners allowed in any of these game were by Terry 
(in 1886) and Koufax (in 1962), who each allowed five. Of the 25 no-hitters, 
five have been won by a score of 5–0 and four by the score of 3–0, more 
common than any other results. The largest margin of victory in a no-hitter 
was a 9–0 win by Hideo Nomo in 1996 and a 10–1 win by Vance in 1925. The 
smallest margins of victory were 1–0 wins by Terry in 1888 and Koufax in 
1965. The umpire is an integral part of any no-hitter. The task of the 
umpire in a baseball game is to make any decision "which involves judgment, 
such as, but not limited to, whether a batted ball is fair or foul, whether 
a pitch is a strike or a ball, or whether a runner is safe or out… [the 
umpire's judgment on such matters] is final."[6] Part of the duties of 
the umpire making calls at home plate includes defining the strike zone, 
which "is defined as that area over homeplate (sic) the upper limit of 
which is a horizontal line at the midpoint between the top of the shoulders 
and the top of the uniform pants, and the lower level is a line at the 
hollow beneath the kneecap."[6] These calls define every baseball game 
and are therefore integral to the completion of any no-hitter.[7] There 
have been 24 different home plate umpires who have called Dodgers no-hitters;
