Sporting News, originally The Sporting News (TSN), is an American sports 
website and former print magazine. It was established in 1886, and it became 
the dominant American publication covering baseball—so much so that it 
acquired the nickname "The Bible of Baseball."[1] It is currently owned 
by Sporting News Media. After 122 years as a weekly publication, the magazine 
switched to a biweekly publishing schedule in 2008, and to a monthly schedule 
in 2011. In December 2012, the magazine announced it would go digital-only 
starting in 2013.[2] The Sporting News was founded in 1886[3] by Alfred 
H. Spink, a director of the St. Louis Browns and former writer for the 
Missouri Republican daily newspaper. Each number was 17 by 22 inches, eight 
pages, price five cents (Cooper 1996). The Browns were champions of the 
American Association, one of two major leagues in baseball, with a claim 
to the championship of the United States or the world based on the disputed 
1885 World Series contest with regional rival Chicago, and the undisputed 
1886 winner. Meanwhile, the sporting weeklies Clipper and Sporting Life 
were based in New York and Philadelphia. By World War I, TSN would be the 
only national baseball newspaper. Al Spink had long turned it over to his 
brother, first hiring Charles as business manager, then selling his stock, 
and finally departing from writing and editorial work in 1899 (Cooper 1996). 
His son, J. G. Taylor Spink, took over in 1914 and gradually added coverage 
of other sports as well. Throughout much of the 20th century TSN was decidedly 
non-glamorous, consisting of black-and-white newsprint with staid graphics. 
However, for most of its first century it was the only vehicle for serious 
sports fans to follow teams from around the nation. For example, each week 
it printed a box score and blurb for every baseball game played in the 
major leagues and numerous minor leagues. Similarly, every issue had a 
report on each MLB team, usually written by a local newspaper's beat writer 
for that team. Franklin Gritts, the Cherokee artist, served as TSN's art 
director from the early 1950s to the mid-1970s. Other TSN publications 
included the annual Baseball Register, a compilation of lifetime statistics 
of active major league players. Its subtitle from the 1940s through the 
mid-'60s was The Game's Four Hundred. J. G. Taylor Spink died in 1962. 
The Spink family continued to own TSN until selling it to Times Mirror 
in the mid-1980s. Also around this time the company began publishing annual 
previews for professional and college football, professional and college 
basketball, baseball, and hockey. With the advent of national sports media 
in the 1980s such as USA Today and ESPN, and of comprehensive web sites 
run by the major sports leagues in the 1990s, TSN lost its unique role. 
Consequently, it evolved into more of a conventional, glossy sports magazine 
similar to Sports Illustrated in both appearance and contents. Box scores 
disappeared from its pages in the late 1980s, but were still made available 
to subscribers in a separate publication for an undetermined period of 
time afterwards. The online SN Today revived the tradition of publishing 
boxscores in its virtual pages. In 2000, TSN was purchased by Paul Allen's 
Vulcan Inc. The following year, the company acquired the One on One Sports 
radio network, renaming it Sporting News Radio. The magazine's title was 
shortened to Sporting News in December 2002. In September 2006, Advance 
Publications bought Sporting News and its online division and folded it 
into American City Business Journals. With the change in ownership, the 
company ceased most of its book publishing efforts. The Baseball Guide, 
a TSN annual in one form or another since the 1920s, was last published 
in 2006. The Baseball Register, an annual since the early 1940s, published 
its last edition in 2007. The Baseball Record Book was last published in 
2007, and then only as a download. None of these guides were published 
in 2008. After 122 years as a weekly publication, it became a bi-weekly 
in 2008. In 2011, Garry D. Howard was appointed as editor-in-chief of Sporting 
News magazine, Sporting News Today and its website, Sporting News Feed. 
Howard came to Sporting News from the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, where 
he was sports editor. Howard also was president of the Associated Press 
Sports Editors. Also as part of its reorganization in 2011, Benson Taylor 
was named managing editor of SN magazine and Paul Kasko was named managing 
editor of SN Today and SN Feed. It also switched to weekly publication. 
In late 2012, Sporting News ceased its print edition after 126 years.[3] 
However, its Fantasy Football and Fantasy Baseball yearbooks remained in 
publication. In 2013, Perform Group combined its US businesses with Sporting 
News to form Sporting News Media, in which it took a 65% stake. ACBJ retained 
35%.[4] In 1962, after J. G. Taylor Spink's death, Baseball Writers' Association 
of America (BBWAA) instituted the J. G. Taylor Spink Award as the highest 
award given to its members. Spink was also the first recipient. From 1968 
to 2008, the magazine selected one or more individuals as Sportsman of 
the Year. On four occasions, the award was shared by two recipients. Twice, 
in 1993 and 2000, the award went to a pair of sportsmen within the same 
organization. In 1999, the honor was given to a whole team. No winner was 
chosen in 1987. On December 18, 2007, the magazine announced New England 
Patriots quarterback Tom Brady as 2007 Sportsman of the Year, making Brady 
the first to repeat as a recipient of individual honors. Mark McGwire of 
the St. Louis Cardinals was also honored twice, but shared his second award 
with Sammy Sosa of the Chicago Cubs. In 2009, the award was replaced by 
two awards: Pro Athlete of the Year and College Athlete of the Year. Beginning 
in 2011, the awards were merged into a singular Athlete of the Year. SN 
sponsors its own annual Team, Player, Pitcher, Rookie, Reliever, Comeback 
Player, Manager, and Executive of the Year awards. Many fans once held 
the newspaper's baseball awards at equal or higher esteem than those of 
the Baseball Writers' Association of America.[9] Prior to 2005, the SN 
Comeback Player Award was generally recognized as the principal award of
