Thomas Alan Pagnozzi (born July 30, 1962 in Tucson, Arizona) is a former 
Major League Baseball (MLB) catcher who played twelve seasons for the St. 
Louis Cardinals. He played collegiately for Arkansas. Besides catcher, 
Pagnozzi also made 40 appearances at first base and seven at third base 
during his career, which spanned from 1987 to 1998. Initially a backup 
catcher and utility player for the Cardinals, in 1990 Pagnozzi impressed 
Cardinals manager Joe Torre enough to move Todd Zeile, then the Cardinals' 
hot catching prospect, to third base to make room for him. Pagnozzi remained 
the Cardinals' regular catcher until 1996. While he had moderate power 
and was considered an run batted in (RBI) threat, he was primarily regarded 
for his defense, for which he won Gold Gloves in 1991, 1992, and 1994. 
Pagnozzi also made the National League All-Star team in 1992. From 1986 
to 1990, Pagnozzi played in the Puerto Rican Liga de Béisbol Profesional 
Roberto Clemente with the Indios de Mayagüez (Mayagüez Indians). Pagnozzi 
retired from MLB as a player in 1998 at the age of 36 after having been 
released by the Cardinals in August. His offensive career totals included 
a batting average of .253 with 44 home runs and 320 RBI. He placed in the 
top five in Cardinals franchise history in catcher defensive categories 
such as games caught, innings, putouts, stolen bases allowed, caught stealing, 
and fielding percentage. Pagnozzi now makes his home in Fayetteville, Arkansas, 
giving extensively to the youth of the community, as well as the community 
as a whole. He recovered well after an auto accident on December 22, 2008, 
near his home. Pagnozzi, who was driving with Cardinals farmhand Casey 
Rowlett, hit a patch of ice and that caused his truck to flip several times. 
The two men emerged with minor injuries; however, another passenger was 
seriously injured.[citation needed] Tom Pagnozzi's nephew, Matt Pagnozzi, 
is also a catcher, and made his debut with the Cardinals on September 29,
