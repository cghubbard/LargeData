Ariel Prieto (born October 22, 1969) is a former Major League Baseball 
right-handed pitcher and currently a coach with the Arizona Diamondbacks. 
Prieto graduated from Fajardo University in Santiago de Cuba, and immigrated 
to Puerto Rico soon after. In Puerto Rico he played professional winter 
league baseball for the first time in his career. As a member of the Cangrejeros 
de Santurce, Prieto was able to attend the Caribbean World Series for the 
first time. After intentionally pitching poorly during the 1994–95 Cuban 
National Series, Prieto was allowed a visa to leave Cuba in April 1995.[1] 
He was selected with the fifth overall selection in the 1995 MLB draft 
by the Oakland Athletics. Prieto made his major league debut for the Athletics 
that July. Prieto, being unfamiliar with American banks and credit cards 
walked around with his $1.2 million signing bonus check in his pocket for 
over a week.[2] He won two games and lost six, becoming one of just a handful 
of players who were drafted and then played in the big leagues during the 
same season. In 1996 Prieto had what was arguably his best season, winning 
6 games and losing 7 with an ERA of 4.15. Prieto was traded to the Tampa 
Bay Devil Rays before the 2001 season. With the Devil Rays, Prieto saw 
action in three games, without any decisions, allowing one earned run in 
3 2/3 innings pitched. His one season with the Devil Rays was his last 
season in the major leagues. Prieto surfaced in Mexico during the middle 
2000s, playing with the Venados de Mazatlán, a team with which he reappeared 
at the Caribbean World Series, held that year in Venezuela. During six 
MLB seasons, Prieto won 15 games and lost 24, with a 4.85 ERA. He played 
until 2005 in the minor leagues, unable to make it back to the A's. Prieto 
spent the 2009 through 2011 seasons as the pitching coach for the Athletics' 
Arizona League team.[3] On November 10, 2011, Prieto was announced as the 
pitching coach for the Vermont Lake Monsters, the Athletics' New York–Penn 
League (Single A, short season) team.[4] Since the 2012 season, Prieto 
has served as interpreter for fellow Cuban defector, New York Mets outfielder
