James Thomas Brewer (November 17, 1937 – November 16, 1987) was an American 
relief pitcher in Major League Baseball. From 1960 through 1976, Brewer 
played for the Chicago Cubs, Los Angeles Dodgers, and California Angels. 
He batted and threw left-handed. Following the advice of Warren Spahn,[1] 
Brewer developed a screwball to become one of the most successful relievers 
in the National League in the 1960s and 1970s. A graduate of Broken Arrow 
Senior High in Broken Arrow, Oklahoma, Brewer compiled a 69–65 record with 
810 strikeouts and a 3.07 ERA in a 17-year career that began with the Cubs 
and ended with the Angels, and in between spent twelve seasons with the 
Dodgers. In his career, Brewer recorded 132 saves, 125 with the Dodgers, 
appearing in 474 games for the club. Only two Dodgers pitchers, Don Sutton 
and Don Drysdale, have more appearances –550 and 518, respectively. As 
a Dodger, Brewer appeared in the 1973 All-Star Game and in three World 
Series (1965-66 and 1974). From 1968 to 1973 he averaged 20 saves a season, 
with a career-high 24 in 1970, and in 1972, he posted an 1.26 ERA, allowing 
only 4.7 hits per nine innings. Brewer was involved in an on-field altercation 
with Billy Martin on August 4, 1960. Brewer, then with the Cubs, brushed 
back Martin, then with the Cincinnati Reds, with a pitch in the second 
inning of a game at Wrigley Field. Martin threw his bat at Brewer, who 
picked it up and started to hand it to Martin as Martin approached. Martin 
punched Brewer in the right eye, breaking his cheekbone.[2] Brewer was 
twice operated[3] on for his injuries, and Martin served a five-day suspension.[4] 
The Cubs and Brewer sued Martin for over $1 million for the loss of Brewer's 
services,[5] but later dropped their case. Brewer, however, pursued his, 
and in 1969 a judge ordered Martin to pay $10,000 in damages. Brewer died
