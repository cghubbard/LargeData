Roger Kahn (born October 31, 1927) is an American author, best known for 
his 1972 baseball book The Boys of Summer. Kahn's family first settled 
in the New York area in 1848, and he was born in Brooklyn, New York in 
1927. Kahn attended Froebel Academy, a prep school, then Erasmus Hall High 
School in Brooklyn.[1] Kahn has worked as a journalist, author, editor, 
and teacher. In 2004, he was named as the fourth James H. Ottaway Sr. Visiting 
Professor of Journalism at SUNY New Paltz.[2] Kahn describes[where?] his 
background as a mix of Alsatian Catholic Jewish and Russian Jewish Marxist, 
and himself as a 100% American agnostic[not in citation given]. He lives 
in the Hudson Valley community of Stone Ridge, New York with his second 
wife, Katharine Colt Johnson, a psychotherapist. He has two adult children, 
Alissa and Gordon.[3] He was inducted into the National Jewish Sports Hall 
of Fame on April 30, 2006.[4] Kahn began his newspaper career in 1948, 
when he took a job as copy boy for the New York Herald Tribune. A keen 
Dodgers fan, he reported on their games over the 1952 and 1953 seasons. 
He became sports editor for Newsweek in 1956, and editor-at-large of the 
Saturday Evening Post in 1963. His best-known book, The Boys of Summer, 
was published in 1972. The book examines his relationship with his father 
seen through the prism of their shared affection for the Brooklyn Dodgers. 
In 2002, a Sports Illustrated panel placed The Boys of Summer second on 
a list of "The Top 100 Sports Books of All Time".[5] In addition to The 
Boys of Summer, Kahn wrote books such as Good Enough to Dream, a chronicle 
of his year as the owner of a minor league baseball franchise; The Era 
1947–57, an examination of the decade during which the three New York clubs 
– the Dodgers, Yankees and Giants – dominated Major League Baseball; and 
Memories of Summer, a look back at his youth and early career, plus extended 
pieces on New York baseball legends Willie Mays and Mickey Mantle. He also 
wrote a biography of the heavyweight boxing champion Jack Dempsey, entitled 
A Flame of Pure Fire.[6] Kahn's 2006 book Into My Own is a memoir describing 
friendships with Robert Frost, Jackie Robinson, Pee Wee Reese, Eugene McCarthy, 
and, in its last chapter titled Rescuing Roger, his late son, Roger Laurence 
Kahn, who suffered from bipolar disorder and heroin addiction, spent time 
with Michael DeSisto at the DeSisto School,[7] and who committed suicide 
via carbon monoxide poisoning in 1987.[8] Andrew Ervin wrote in The Washington 
Post that the book "proves that Kahn's not only a great baseball writer 
but also something rarer: a great writer whose subject happens to be baseball."[9] 
Kahn cites[where?] as his journalism influences, Stanley Woodward, John 
Lardner, and Red Smith. He has won the E. P. Dutton Award for best sports 
magazine article of the year five times, and tied for first once.[citation
