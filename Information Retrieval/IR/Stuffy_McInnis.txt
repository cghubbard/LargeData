As player As manager John Phalen "Stuffy" McInnis (September 19, 1890 – 
February 16, 1960) was a first baseman and manager in Major League Baseball. 
McInnis gained his nickname as a youngster in the Boston suburban leagues, 
where his spectacular playing brought shouts of "that's the stuff, kid". 
From 1909-27, McInnis played for the Philadelphia Athletics (1909–17), 
Boston Red Sox (1918–21), Cleveland Indians (1922), Boston Braves (1923–24), 
Pittsburgh Pirates (1925–26) and Philadelphia Phillies (1927). He batted 
and threw right-handed. In a 19-season career, McInnis posted a .307 batting 
average with 20 home runs and 1,062 RBI in 2,128 games. A native of Gloucester, 
Massachusetts, McInnis broke into baseball with the Philadelphia Athletics 
as a shortstop in 1909. Two seasons later, he replaced Harry Davis at first 
base as a member of the famous $100,000 infield, teaming up with second 
baseman Eddie Collins, third baseman Frank Baker and shortstop Jack Barry. 
As prices and costs rose in later years the tag seemed low, but at this 
time the group was higher-price than any. The Athletics were in their prime, 
winning the American League pennant in 1910, 1911, 1913 and 1914, and back-to-back 
World Championships in 1910 and 1911. But after they were swept by the 
Boston Braves in the 1914 World Series, owner Connie Mack asked waivers 
on three starting pitchers and began to dismantle his team in light of 
the attempted raids on his stars by the new Federal League. The $100,000 
infield broken up after Collins was sold to the White Sox, Baker went to 
the Yankees, and Barry was sent to the Red Sox. Only McInnis stayed, and 
he was traded to the Red Sox at the end of the 1917 season. McInnis was 
part of the Red Sox in the 1918 World Series. He drove in the only run 
of Babe Ruth's 1-0 pitching victory over the Chicago Cubs in Game 1 of 
the Series. He joined Cleveland for one season in 1922 before going to 
the National League in 1923. He played with the Braves and Pirates, and 
also managed the Phillies in 1927, his last year in the majors. A good 
contact line drive hitter, McInnis batted over .300 during 12 of his 19 
seasons, and in each year from 1910 to 1915. His most productive season 
came in 1912, when he hit .327, though he batted .368 in 59 games for the 
Pirates champion team in 1925. Extremely hard to strike out, he fanned 
only 189 times in 7,822 at-bats and amassed 2,405 hits. In 1921, he struck 
out only 9 times in 584 at bats. McInnis also excelled in moving runners 
ahead with sacrifice hits. His career total of 384 sacrifice hits is third 
best in MLB history.[1] McInnis also was an especially solid defensive 
player. He for decades held major league fielding records for first basemen 
over one season. In 1921, he played in 152 games with the Red Sox and committed 
only one error in 1,651 chances for a .9993 mark, and his 1,300 errorless 
chances, also represented a season mark. Between May 31, 1921, and June 
2, 1922, McInnis set a third record with 1,700 chances without an error 
over the course of 163 games. On June 25, 2007, Kevin Youkilis played in 
his 120th consecutive game at first base without an error, breaking the 
prior Red Sox record set in 1921 by McInnis.[2] In his 205th game without 
an error on April 27, 2008, Youkilis also established a new major league 
record for first basemen when he fielded his 1,701st consecutive chance 
without an error, passing the old mark of 1,700 set by McInnis.[3] His 
streak was snapped at 238 games (2,002 fielding attempts) on June 7, 2008.[4] 
Following his retirement as a player, McInnis coached the Harvard baseball
