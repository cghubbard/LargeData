Edison Rosanda Armbrister (born July 4, 1948 in Nassau, Bahamas) is a former 
outfielder in Major League Baseball who had a five-year career from 1973

Gerónimo, Denis Menke and Jack Billingham to Cincinnati for Lee May, Tommy 
Helms and Jimmy Stewart. Armbrister is best remembered for his involvement 
in a controversial play in the 1975 World Series. In the tenth inning of 
Game Three, with César Gerónimo on base and nobody out, Armbrister collided

call on Armbrister, a decision which was a source of heated debate after 
the Reds won the game 6–5. After baseball, he returned to the Bahamas.
