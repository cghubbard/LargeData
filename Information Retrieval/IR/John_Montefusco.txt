John Joseph Montefusco Jr. (born May 25, 1950) is a former Major League 
Baseball pitcher from 1974 to 1986 for the San Francisco Giants, Atlanta 
Braves, San Diego Padres, and New York Yankees. Named the National League 
Rookie of the Year in 1975, Montefusco's nickname was "The Count", a pun 
on his last name which sounds like Monte Cristo. In his 13-year career, 
his record was 90-83, with 1,081 strikeouts, and a 3.54 ERA. He was a National 
League All-Star in 1976, winning a career high 16 games that year. Before 
a game against the Los Angeles Dodgers on July 4, 1975, Montefusco guaranteed 
he would win the game. He proceeded to throw a shutout as the Giants defeated 
the Dodgers 1â€“0.[1] On September 29, 1976, Montefusco threw a no-hitter 
for the Giants in a 9-0 victory versus the Atlanta Braves. It was the last 
no-hitter to be thrown by a Giant until Jonathan Sanchez threw one on July 
10, 2009. [1] He also is one of only a handful of pitchers to hit a home 
run in his first at bat (September 3, 1974). Montefusco is one of two players 
to hit a home run in his first at bat and win the Rookie of the Year Award. 
The other is Wally Moon. In October 1997, Montefusco was arrested and charged 
with beating his former wife of 23 years Doris,[2] whom he had recently 
divorced, in her Marlboro, New Jersey home.[3][4] He was held on $60,000 
bail and was charged with aggravated sexual assault, making terroristic 
threats, assault, burglary and criminal mischief.[5] Montefusco was indicted 
in December 1997 and was held on $1 million in bail.[6] Montefusco was 
released on bail in November 1999 after serving more than two years behind 
bars, and in February 2000, he was acquitted of the most serious charges 
and found guilty of criminal trespass and simple assault and sentenced 
to three years of probation.[7] In 2001, a U.S. district judge in Trenton, 
New Jersey dismissed a lawsuit filed by Montefusco against the ESPN network. 
Judge Anne Elise Thompson ruled that being compared to O. J. Simpson is 
not defamation.[8] During a March 19, 2000 broadcast on ESPN's "SportsCenter 
2000," Doris Montefusco had likened her ex-husband to Simpson, who was 
acquitted in 1995 of the murder of Nicole Brown Simpson. An ESPN announcer 
during the broadcast had paraphrased Montefusco's ex-wife as saying "the 
only difference between this and the O.J. Simpson case is that she's alive 
to talk about it. Nicole Simpson is not."[9] At the time of his October 
1997 arrest, Montefusco had been a pitching instructor for the Tampa Yankees, 
a minor league team.[10] He later spent several years as the pitching coach 
for the Somerset Patriots in the independent Atlantic League of Professional
