Class B (1896–1899, 1902–1909, 1920–1921, 1938–1942, 1950–1961) Class C 
(1949) The Cedar Rapids Kernels are a Class A minor league baseball team 
based in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. The team is affiliated with the Minnesota 
Twins and plays in the Midwest League. The Kernels are owned by Cedar Rapids 
Ball Club, Inc. (also known as Cedar Rapids Baseball Club, Inc.).[3][4][5] 
Cedar Rapids first began play in 1890 and have played 110 seasons through 
2015. The franchise has been a member of various leagues preceding the 
Midwest League. They have been a member of the Central Association (1949), 
Western League (1934–1937), Mississippi Valley League (1922–1932), Central 
Association (1913–1917), Illinois–Indiana–Iowa League (1901–1909, 1920–1921, 
1938–1942, 1950–1961), Western Association (1896–1899), Eastern Iowa League 
(1895) and the Illinois–Iowa League (1890–1891).[6] The team also had numbeous 
nicknames prior to joining the Midwest League: Cedar Rapids Braves (1958–1962), 
Cedar Rapids Raiders (1953–1957), Cedar Rapids Indians (1950–1952), Cedar 
Rapids Rockets (1949), Cedar Rapids Raiders (1934–1942), Cedar Rapids Red 
Raiders (1963–1964), Cedar Rapids Bunnies (1904–1932), Cedar Rapids Rabbits 
(1896–1903) and Cedar Rapids Canaries (1890–1891).[7] When Cedar Rapids 
was awarded a Midwest League franchise in 1962, the franchise switched 
back to the Red Raiders (1962–1964) nickname. Subsequently, the team used 
the name of the major league franchise it affiliated with: the Cardinals 
(1965–1972), the Astros (1973–1974), the Giants (1975–1979), and the Reds 
(1980–1992). The team adopted the current "Kernels" nickname before the 
1993 season. On the field, the franchise won Midwest League championships 
in 1988, 1992, and 1994. The team's first home ballpark was Belden Hill 
Park,[8] followed by the original Veterans Memorial Stadium,[9] which opened 
in 1949. In August 2000 voters approved a referendum to build a new ballpark 
adjacent to the old one, which was demolished after the 2001 season. The 
new Veterans Memorial Stadium was completed in time for the opening of 
the 2002 season, and the Kernels set a franchise attendance record of 196,066 
in the new park's inaugural year. Pitchers Catchers Infielders Outfielders
