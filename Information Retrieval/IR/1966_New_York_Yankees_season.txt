WPIX The 1966 New York Yankees season was the 64th season for the Yankees. 
The team finished with a record of 70â€“89, finishing 26.5 games behind the 
Baltimore Orioles. New York was managed by Johnny Keane and Ralph Houk. 
The Yankees played at Yankee Stadium. Keane managed his final MLB game 
in early-May, and died the following January at the age of 55. The Yankees 
finished in 10th place, although arguably a "strong" tenth.[1] It was the 
first time they had finished in last place since 1912, their last year 
at the Hilltop. On September 22, paid attendance of 413 was announced at 
the 65,000-seat Yankee Stadium.[2] WPIX announcer Red Barber asked the 
TV cameras to pan the empty stands as he commented on the low attendance. 
Although denied the camera shots on orders from the Yankees' head of media 
relations, he said, "I don't know what the paid attendance is today, but 
whatever it is, it is the smallest crowd in the history of Yankee Stadium, 
and this crowd is the story, not the game." By a horrible stroke of luck, 
that game was the first for CBS executive Mike Burke as team president. 
A week later, Barber was invited to breakfast where Burke told him that 
his contract wouldn't be renewed. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10]
