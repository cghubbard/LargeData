Jacob Nelson "Nellie" Fox (December 25, 1927 – December 1, 1975) was an 
American professional baseball player. Fox was one of the best second basemen, 
and the third most difficult hitter to strike out in Major League Baseball 
(MLB) history.[1] He played for the Philadelphia Athletics, Chicago White 
Sox, and Houston Astros, from 1947 through 1965. Fox was an American League 
(AL) All-Star for twelve seasons,[a] an AL Most Valuable Player (MVP) for 
one season, and an AL Gold Glove winner for three seasons. He had a .288 
major-league career batting average with 2663 hits, 35 home runs, and 790 
runs batted in. He hit .300 or more six times, and led the AL in singles 
eight times (seven consecutive seasons) and in fielding average six times 
as second baseman. In 1959, when the "Go Go" Chicago White Sox won the 
American League Pennant championship, he hit .306 with 149 singles and 
70 RBI. He coached for the Houston Astros and Texas Rangers after his playing 
career. He was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1997.[1] 
Fox was born on Christmas Day 1927 in St. Thomas Township, Pennsylvania, 
a rural area in the south central portion of Pennsylvania. He was the youngest 
of three sons born to a carpenter who grew up on a farm and liked to play 
town baseball at St. Thomas. Despite his short stature, with the help of 
his father, he distinguished himself as a baseball player at a young age, 
even playing with his father on their St. Thomas team. Fox at age 16 in 
1944, thought that he had a good chance to sign on with a professional 
baseball team due to player shortages from World War II. His mother wrote 
a letter on her son's behalf to Connie Mack the owner/manager of the Philadelphia 
Athletics which enabled him to attend an open tryout that spring for the 
Athletics in Frederick, Maryland. Fox caught the attention of Mack who 
signed him to a professional contract.[2] Fox started his professional 
baseball career with the Lancaster team of the Pennsylvania Interstate 
League and the Jamestown Falcons where he hit .314. He played a range of 
infield and outfield positions, ultimately settling at second base. He 
came back with Lancaster in 1945 and was known as the best second baseman 
in the league. The Philadelphia Athletics bought his contract that year, 
but Fox did not get to play for them because he was called to service and 
was stationed in Korea in 1946.[2] Fox's major league career began in 1947 
when he started to play for the Philadelphia Athletics, but he played mostly 
in the minor leagues, appearing in a total of ten MLB games in 1948 and 
1949.[3] In 1949, the Philadelphia Athletics set a major league team record 
of 217 double plays, a record which still stood as of 2012.[4] Fox appeared 
in 88 of the Athletics games that season, and contributed to 68 of the 
team's double plays.[3] Fox's career took off after he was traded to the 
Chicago White Sox for Joe Tipton on October 29, 1949. He spent the next 
14 seasons with the Sox, making 12 AL All-Star teams[3] and 15 of 16 AL 
All-Star Game selections beginning in 1951 (two All-Star games were played 
in 1959 through 1962[5]) when he batted .313.[3] The White Sox finished 
in third place in each season between 1952 and 1956, followed by second-place 
finishes in 1957 and 1958 (Baseball-Reference.com lists Billy Pierce and 
Minnie Miñoso as the top White Sox players during most of those years, 
as reflected by wins above replacement (WAR), but Fox had the team's highest 
WAR in 1957).[6] Fox's best season came in 1959, when he received the AL 
Most Valuable Player award (not until Dustin Pedroia in 2008 would another 
American League second baseman receive such an honor) on a White Sox team 
that won its first AL pennant in 40 years. He batted .306, had an on-base 
percentage of .380, and led the AL in singles. He also started and had 
four hits in two All-Star games and won his second Gold Glove. The Al López-managed 
White Sox had the best record in baseball, going 94-60 to finish five games 
ahead of the Cleveland Indians and a surprising 15 ahead of the New York 
Yankees. It was one of just two seasons the Yankees did not win the pennant 
between 1949–1964. In the World Series, Fox batted a team-high .375 with 
three doubles, but the Sox lost to the Los Angeles Dodgers in six games. 
In Game 5, Fox scored the only run when Sherm Lollar hit into a double 
play in the fourth inning (this was only the second time that a World Series 
game did not have an RBI). It was Fox's only postseason experience, and 
the White Sox did not make it back to the World Series until they swept 
the 2005 World Series from the Houston Astros. Fox played his final two 
seasons (1964–65) with the Houston Colt .45s and Astros. Joe Morgan later 
said that he looked up to Fox's example as a rookie with the Astros; Fox 
and Morgan were both diminutive second basemen. Morgan grew up hitting 
with a Nellie Fox model bat, which had a large barrel and large handle. 
With the Astros, Fox convinced Morgan to switch to a bat with a thin handle 
to leverage his power.[7] Fox was 5-foot-9, he made up for his modest size 
and minimal power — he hit only 35 home runs in his career, and never more 
than six in a single season — with his good batting eye, excellent fielding, 
and baserunning speed. Fox was perennially one of the toughest batters 
to strike out, fanning just 216 times in his career, an average of once 
every 42.7 at-bats which ranks him 3rd all-time.[1] He led the league in 
most at-bats per strikeouts a phenomenal 13 times in his career. A solid 
contact hitter (lifetime .288 batting average), he batted over .300 six 
times, with 2,663 hits, 355 doubles, and 112 triples. He also led the league 
in singles for seven straight years, in triples once, and in hits four 
times.[3] Fox was one of the best second basemen in the major leagues.[1] 
He played next to a pair of slick-fielding White Sox shortstops from Venezuela, 
Chico Carrasquel (1950–55) and Luis Aparicio (1956–62). He was the first 
major league Gold Glove Award winner for a second baseman in 1957, and 
he received two more Gold Glove awards in 1959 and 1960. Between August 
1956 and September 1960, Fox played a major-league record 798 consecutive 
games at second base. In 1959 and 1960, the Aparicio-Fox middle infield 
duo won two Gold Gloves twice for their respective positions, starting 
a select list of eight shortstop-second baseman combinations who have both 
won Gold Gloves in the same season. Fox led the league's second basemen 
in defensive games played each season between 1952 and 1959. He also led 
second basemen in putouts between 1952 and 1961, and in assists several 
times during his career. Fox finished among the top five second basemen 
in fielding percentage every year between 1950 and 1964, and currently 
ranks second in career double plays as a second baseman.[3] Fox was a coach 
for the Houston Astros (1965–67) and the Washington Senators/Texas Rangers 
(1968–72). In the late 1960s, Fox appeared to have a chance to manage the 
Senators when Jim Lemon's post came open following the team's purchase 
by Bob Short. However, around the same time the Washington Redskins named 
Vince Lombardi as their football coach, so Short felt pressure to hire 
a manager with a very well-known name and selected Ted Williams for the 
position.[8] Fox lived in St. Thomas Township, Pennsylvania after his playing 
days were over. He co-owned and managed Nellie Fox Bowl[9] in Chambersberg 
after retiring from baseball. Fox was diagnosed with skin cancer in 1973. 
In October 1975, he was admitted to the Baltimore Cancer Research Center 
and treated for lymphatic cancer.[10] He died on December 1, 1975 at the 
age of 47.[2][9][11] Jim Lemon, who played for the White Sox with Fox in 
1963, said that Fox's cancer "had to be incurable – because if it wasn't, 
Nellie would have beat it."[11] Former White Sox manager Al López described 
how Fox had found success through hard work rather than natural ability: 
"He wasn't fast and didn't have an arm, but he worked hard to develop what 
he needed to make himself a good all-around ballplayer. If you had eight 
Nellie Foxes, all with his spirit and determination, I think you'd have 
a winning team."[11] On May 1, 1976, Fox's uniform number 2 was retired 
by the White Sox; he is the second of ten White Sox players to have his 
uniform number retired.[12] Fox was not selected to the Hall of Fame in 
his initial period of eligibility. In his final ballot cast by baseball 
writers in 1985, he gained 74.7 percent of the vote, just shy of the 75 
percent (traditionally baseball percentages were rounded off) required 
for election by the Baseball Writers' Association of America. However, 
in 1997, the Hall of Fame's Veterans Committee elected him. He had the 
required 75% of the committee's vote in 1996, but the committee was allowed 
to vote in only one former MLB player; Jim Bunning was inducted after receiving 
one more vote than Fox.[13] Prior to his Hall of Fame election, a group 
of fans formed the Nellie Fox Society to promote his case for induction. 
The group grew to as many as 600 members, including Richard M. Daley, James 
R. Thompson, George Will and several former MLB players.[14] In 2001, a 
Pennsylvania state historical marker was dedicated to honor Fox.[15] Bronze 
statues of Fox and Aparicio were unveiled on the outfield concourse of 
U.S. Cellular Field in 2006. Fox's statue depicts him flipping a baseball 
toward Aparicio, while Aparicio is depicted as preparing to receive the 
ball from Fox. , which originally appeared in the book Go-Go To Glory--The
