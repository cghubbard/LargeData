Carl Michael Yastrzemski (/jəˈstrɛmski/; nicknamed "Yaz";[1] born August 
22, 1939) is an American former Major League Baseball player. He was elected 
to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1989.[2] Yastrzemski played his entire 
23-year baseball career with the Boston Red Sox (1961–1983). He was primarily 
a left fielder, but also played 33 games as a third baseman[3] and mostly 
was a first baseman and designated hitter later in his career.[4] Yastrzemski 
is an 18-time All-Star, the possessor of seven Gold Gloves, a member of 
the 3,000 hit club, and the first American League player in that club to 
also accumulate over 400 home runs.[5] He is second on the all-time list 
for games played, and third for total at-bats. He is the Red Sox' all-time 
leader in career RBIs, runs, hits, singles, doubles, total bases, and games 
played, and is third on the team's list for home runs behind Ted Williams 
and David Ortiz.[5] In 1967 Yastrzemski achieved a peak in his career, 
leading the Red Sox to the American League pennant for the first time in 
over two decades and being voted the 1967 American League MVP. Yaztrzemski 
also won the Triple Crown that year, a milestone which was not accomplished 
again in the Major Leagues until Miguel Cabrera achieved the feat 45 years 
later in 2012.[4][6][7] Yastrzemski was born in Bridgehampton, New York 
to Carl Yastrzemski, Sr. and Hattie Skonieczny.[4] Both his parents were 
of a Polish background, and young Carl was bilingual from an early age. 
Raised on his father's potato farm, Carl played on sandlot baseball teams 
with his father, who, he maintains, was a better athlete than he was. Carl 
also played Little League Baseball.[8] "Yaz" attended Notre Dame on a basketball 
scholarship (his career Long Island high school scoring mark at Bridgehampton 
broke one previously held by Jim Brown) briefly before embarking on his 
baseball career. Yastrzemski signed with the Red Sox organization, which 
sent him to the minor-league Raleigh Capitals in 1959, where he led the 
league with a .377 batting average,[1][9] They then moved him to the Minneapolis 
Millers for the post-season and the 1960 season.[10] Yastrzemski, who had 
studied business at Notre Dame, fulfilled a promise to his parents by finishing 
his degree at Merrimack College in North Andover, Massachusetts, in 1966.[11] 
Yastrzemski began his major-league career in 1961.[4] From the beginning, 
there was tremendous pressure on him to perform, as he succeeded to the 
position of the great Red Sox legend Ted Williams.[5] He would prove to 
be a worthy successor at the plate, and a far superior defensive player 
with a strong arm, expert in playing off the Green Monster, Fenway Park's 
left-field wall. In 12 years as a left fielder, Yastrzemski won seven Gold 
Gloves and led in assists seven times.[12][13] While his first two years 
were viewed as solid but unspectacular, he emerged as a rising star in 
1963, winning the American League batting championship with a batting average 
of .321, and also leading the league in doubles and walks, finishing sixth 
in the Most Valuable Player voting.[14][15] Yastrzemski enjoyed his best 
season in 1967, when he won the American League Triple Crown with a .326 
batting average, 44 home runs (tied with Harmon Killebrew) and 121 RBIs.[6] 
Yastrzemski's Triple Crown win in 1967 was the last time a major league 
hitter won the Batting Triple Crown until Miguel Cabrera in the 2012 season 
– conversely six different pitchers have since won the pitchers' version. 
He was voted Most Valuable Player almost unanimously (one voter chose César 
Tovar of the Twins).[7] His 12.4WAR was the highest since Babe Ruth's 1927 
season.[16] 1967 was the season of the "Impossible Dream" for the Red Sox 
(referring to the hit song from the musical play Man of La Mancha), who 
rebounded from a ninth-place finish a year before to win the American League 
pennant (their first since 1946) on the last day of the season.[17] With 
the Red Sox battling as part of a four-team pennant race, Yastrzemski hit 
.513 (23 hits in 44 at-bats) with five home runs and 16 runs batted in 
over the last two weeks of the season, and finished a mere one game ahead 
of the Detroit Tigers and Minnesota Twins.[17][18] The Red Sox went into 
the final two games of the season trailing the Twins by 1 game and leading 
the Tigers by 1/2 game. The Red Sox final two games were against Minnesota 
with the pennant and home run title (and hence, the triple crown) on the 
line. In the Saturday game, Yaz went 3 for 4 with a home run and 4 RBI. 
Klllebrew also homered, but the Red Sox won, 6-4. Thus, the teams went 
into the final game tied for 1st place, and Yaz and Killebrew were tied 
with 44 home runs apiece. In the final game, neither player homered, but 
Yaz went 4 for 4 with 2 RBI in the Red Sox 5-3 win. So in the two games 
with the pennant on the line, Yastrzemski was 7 for 8 with 6 RBI The Red 
Sox lost the World Series four games to three to the St. Louis Cardinals, 
losing three times to Bob Gibson.[19] However, Yaz batted .400 with 3 home 
runs and 5 RBI in the series. In that season, Yastrzemski also won the 
Hickok Belt as top professional athlete of the year and Sports Illustrated 
magazine's "Sportsman of the Year" Award. In an article he co-wrote for 
the November 1967 issue of SPORT Magazine, Yastrzemski credited Boston's 
remarkable season to manager Dick Williams and an infusion of youth, including 
Rico Petrocelli and Tony Conigliaro. Referring to Williams, Yastrzemski 
wrote: "He got rid of all the individuality, made us into a team, gave 
us an incentive, and made us want to win."[20] In 1968 Yastrzemski again 
won the batting championship.[21] Because of the competitive advantages 
pitchers enjoyed between 1963 and 1968 (prior to the lowering of the pitcher's 
mound), Yastrzemski's .301 mark in "The Year of the Pitcher" is the lowest 
average of any batting champion in major league history; however, he was 
the only hitter in the American League to hit .300 for that season against 
such formidable pitching, as well as leading the league in on-base percentage 
and walks.[21] He had many more strong seasons, consistently finishing 
in the top ten in the league in many statistical categories. In 1969, Yastrzemski 
enjoyed the first of two consecutive 40-home run seasons as he led the 
Red Sox to third-place finishes that year and the next. He got four hits, 
tying the record, and won the All-Star Game MVP in 1970, although the American 
League lost.[22] He is one of two players to win the All-Star Game MVP 
Award despite playing for the losing team, Brooks Robinson having done 
so in 1966. Yastrzemski's .329 batting average that season was his career 
high, but he finished second behind the California Angels' Alex Johnson 
for the batting title by less than .001.[23] In 1970 Yaz led the league 
in slugging and on-base percentage, finishing third in home runs.[23] Although 
he hit but 61 home runs over the next four years (1971 through 1974) as 
the Red Sox finished second twice and third twice, he finished in the top 
10 in batting, and top three in on-base percentage and walks in 1973 and 
1974, and led the league in runs scored in 1974.[24][25] In the 1975 All-Star 
Game, Yastrzemski was called to pinch-hit in the sixth inning, with two 
men on base and the American League down 3-0. Without wearing a batting 
helmet, he hit Tom Seaver's first pitch for a home run to tie the score.[26] 
The three-run homer was the only scoring the American League did that night 
as they lost 6-3. Yastrzemski and the Red Sox would suffer another World 
Series loss in 1975, losing four games to three to the Cincinnati Reds.[27] 
Yastrzemski made the final out in Game 7 on a fly out to center, trailing 
by one run.[28] Coincidentally, he also made the final out of the 1978 
American League East tie-breaker game with a foul pop to third base.[29] 
This game featured Bucky Dent's famous homer (although Reggie Jackson's 
home run was the eventual winning run). Earlier in the game, however, Yastrzemski 
began the scoring with a home run off left-handed pitcher Ron Guidry, who 
was having a career year (25 wins, 3 loses and a 1.74 ERA).[29] It was 
the only homer the Cy Young Award winner allowed to a left-hander all season. 
On May 19, 1976, Yastrzemski hit three home runs against the Detroit Tigers 
at Tiger Stadium.[30] He then went to Yankee Stadium and hit two more, 
tying the major league record of five home runs in two consecutive games.[31][32] 
In 1978 Yastrzemski, then 39, was one of the five oldest players in the 
league.[33] On September 12, 1979 Carl Yastrzemski achieved another milestone 
becoming the first American League player with 3000 career hits and 400 
home runs.[34] In 1982, playing primarily as a designated hitter, an early 
season hitting streak placed him among the league's leading hitters and 
saw him featured on the cover of Sports Illustrated and played in that 
year's All-Star game. Yastrzemski retired in 1983 at the age of 44, although 
he stated in his autobiography Yaz that he was initially planning on playing 
the 1984 season, until he tired from a long midseason slump. He also stated 
that had he known how good Roger Clemens would have been as a pitcher, 
he would have played in 1984 to have had a chance to play with him. No 
player has had a longer career with only one team, 23 seasons, a record 
which he shares with Brooks Robinson of the Baltimore Orioles.[5] His final 
career statistics include 3,308 games played (second all-time and the most 
with a single team), 646 doubles (seventh all-time), 452 home runs, 1,844 
RBIs (12th all-time), and a batting average of .285.[4] He had 1,845 walks 
in his career (sixth all-time), and 1,157 extra base hits (ninth all-time). 
Yastrzemski was the first player to ever collect over 3,000 hits and 400 
home runs solely in the American League[35] (the feat has since been accomplished 
by Cal Ripken Jr.). He was named to the All-Star Game 18 times.[4] Yastrzemski 
won three American League batting championships in his career.[2] In addition, 
Yastrzemski only trails Ty Cobb and Derek Jeter in hits collected with 
a single team, and trails only Cobb, Jeter and Tris Speaker in hits collected 
playing in the American League. Yastrzemski is also Fenway Park's all-time 
leader in hits, doubles, and RBI's. By the time of his retirement, he was 
the all-time leader in plate appearances, since surpassed by Pete Rose. 
As one of the top players of his era, he was elected to the Baseball Hall 
of Fame in 1989, his first year of eligibility, with the support of 94% 
of voters. Notably, this makes him one of the few Hall of Famers to directly 
succeed another Hall of Famer at the same position.[35] For his entire 
career with the Red Sox, he wore uniform number 8. The Red Sox retired 
this number on August 6, 1989 after Yastrzemski was elected to the Hall 
of Fame.[35] In 1999, Yastrzemski ranked number 72 on The Sporting News' 
list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players.[36] That same season, he was 
named a finalist to the Major League Baseball All-Century Team.[37] Prior 
to his induction in the Baseball Hall of Fame, in 1986, Carl Yastrzemski 
was inducted into the National Polish-American Sports Hall of Fame.[38] 
Yastrzemski was well known for his batting stance, holding his bat exceptionally 
high, giving his swing a large, dramatic arc, and more power at the plate. 
However, in his later years, he adjusted his stance and held the bat lower. 
He was also known for modifying his batting helmets by enlarging the right 
ear hole (for comfort) and removing part of the right ear flap (for better 
vision of the ball as it was being pitched). A record album of the Red 
Sox's 1967 season, aptly titled "The Impossible Dream", featured a song 
by DJ Jess Cain of praise for "The man they call Yaz", which included the 
line "Although 'Yastrzemski' is a lengthy name / It fits quite nicely in 
our Hall of Fame." (A link to the song appears below.) The song can be 
heard, and the album cover can be seen, in the apartment of Ben Wrightman 
(played by Jimmy Fallon) in the 2005 film Fever Pitch. Earlier in the film, 
Ben's girlfriend, Lindsay Meeks (Drew Barrymore), not yet familiar with 
the triumphs and tribulations of the Red Sox, is unable to properly pronounce 
Yastrzemski's name, and has to be corrected by the surrounding fans: "Ya-STREM-ski!" 
The final scene of the movie indicates that if the couple's unborn child 
is a girl she will be named "Carla Yastrzemski Wrightman." Along with Johnny 
Pesky, Yastrzemski raised the 2004 World Series championship banner over 
Fenway Park.[39] He is currently a roving instructor with the Red Sox, 
and was honored by throwing out the first pitch in Game 1 of the 2004, 
2007 and 2013 World Series. In August 2008, Yastrzemski underwent successful 
triple bypass heart surgery at Massachusetts General Hospital. The Red 
Sox honored Yastrzemski with a statue of him outside Fenway Park on September 
23, 2013. Yastrzemski's son Mike Yastrzemski was drafted by the Atlanta 
Braves in the third round in 1984 and eventually played for the White Sox 
Triple-A affiliate until 1988. He died of a heart attack in 2004 at age 
43.[40] In June 2009, Boston drafted Carl's grandson Michael, an outfielder 
out of St. John's Prep, in the 36th round; Michael did not sign with the 
team and went to Vanderbilt. In 2012, Michael was drafted by the Seattle 
Mariners in the 30th round, with the 911th overall pick. He signed with 
the Baltimore Orioles as their 14th round pick in 2013. While with the 
Aberdeen IronBirds, he started in the 2013 New York–Penn League All-Star 
Game.[40] Michael started the 2015 season with the Double-A affiliate Bowie 
Baysox. In May 2016 Michael was moved up to the Triple-A affiliate Norfolk 
Tides. As of the 2014 baseball season, on the all-time lists for Major 
League baseball, Yastrzemski ranks at #1 for games played for one team, 
#2 for games played, #3 for at-bats, #6 for bases on balls, #8 for hits, 
#8 for total bases, #8 for doubles, and #13 for RBIs.[4] Italics denotes
