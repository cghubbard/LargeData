Francisco Miguel "Paquito" Lindor[1] (born November 14, 1993), is a Puerto 
Rican professional baseball shortstop for the Cleveland Indians of Major 
League Baseball (MLB). He made his MLB debut during the 2015 season. On 
November 2016, he became the first Puerto Rican Shortstop to win the Gold 
Glove Award, doing so playing for the Cleveland Indians in the American 
League.[2] Lindor was born in Caguas, Puerto Rico on November 14, 1993, 
the third of four children.[3] Lindor began playing baseball at a young 
age, assisted by his father, who would hit him ground balls from the top 
of a hill while the younger Lindor stood partway down the slope, attempting 
to field them.[4] Lindor moved to Florida at the age of 12, with his father, 
stepmother and youngest sibling. After he signed with the Cleveland Indians 
in August 2011, his family joined him in Florida.[3] Lindor attended Montverde 
Academy in Montverde, Florida.[5] The school's baseball facility was named 
after him in 2013.[6] He was named to the USA Today All-USA high school 
baseball team. The Indians drafted Lindor in the first round (eighth overall) 
of the 2011 MLB Draft. He had full-ride scholarship offer in place with 
the Florida State Seminoles baseball team, but chose to sign with the Indians 
for $2.9 million in August.[7][8] In September, Lindor was drafted by the 
Indios de Mayagüez in the second round of the Liga de Béisbol Profesional 
Roberto Clemente's (LBPRC) first year draft.[9] However, he has been unable 
to play there due to Cleveland's intervention. On May 7, 2014, the Indios 
de Mayagüez traded Lindor's LBPRC player rights to the Gigantes de Carolina 
in exchange for Carlos Correa.[10] However, only two weeks later the Cangrejeros 
de Santurce signed him by exploiting a legal loophole declaring that any 
player that has not been officially contracted within three years after 
being drafted is considered a free agent.[11] Lindor began his professional 
career appearing in five games with the Mahoning Valley Scrappers during 
the 2011 season.[12] MLB.com rated Lindor as the 32nd best prospect in 
baseball before the 2012 season.[13] He was assigned to the Lake County 
Captains of the Class A Midwest League, and named to appear in the 2012 
All-Star Futures Game.[14] With Lake County, Lindor had a .257 batting 
average with 33 extra-base hits and 27 stolen bases.[15] Prior to the 2013 
season, Baseball America ranked him as the Indians top prospect.[16] Lindor 
started the 2013 season with the Carolina Mudcats of the Class A-Advanced 
Carolina League. He was promoted to the Akron Aeros of the Class AA Eastern 
League on July 15, 2013.[17] Between the two levels, Lindor batted .303 
with 31 extra-base hits, 25 stolen bases, and 34 runs batted in.[15] Lindor 
began the 2014 season with Akron. The Indians promoted Lindor to the Columbus 
Clippers of the Class AAA International League on July 21, 2014.[15] Lindor 
began the 2015 season with Columbus.[18] The Indians purchased Lindor's 
contract from Columbus on June 14, 2015 and added him to the active roster.[19] 
He made his debut with the Indians that day as a pinch hitter. He stayed 
in the game and recorded his first major league hit.[20][21] Lindor won 
the American League Rookie of the Month Award for September, during which 
he batted .362.[22] He finished the 2015 season with a .313 batting average, 
12 home runs, 51 RBI, 12 stolen bases and 22 doubles in 99 games for the 
Indians.[23] He placed second in the American League Rookie of the Year 
Award voting.[24] In 2016, Lindor finished season with a .301 batting average, 
15 home runs, 78 RBI, 19 stolen bases and 30 doubles in 158 games for the 
Indians.[25] He was named a Gold Glove Award Finalist in the AL Shortstop 
position along Jose Iglesias and Andrelton Simmons.[26] In the 2016 MLB 
postseason, Lindor's seven multi-hit games broke the record for most ever 
for a player less than 23 years old. His 16 postseason hits are also the 
most hits by a Cleveland batter since 1997, and he's the youngest Cleveland 
batter to have six World Series hits.[27] Following the 2016 season, Lindor 
was presented with his first Gold Glove Award and first Platinum Glove
