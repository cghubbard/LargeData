José Guillermo Quintana (born January 24, 1989) is a Colombian professional 
baseball pitcher for the Chicago White Sox of Major League Baseball (MLB). 
He made his MLB debut with the White Sox in 2012, and was named an All-Star 
in 2016. Quintana signed as an international free agent with the New York 
Mets, and began his professional career in the Rookie-level Venezuelan 
Summer League (VSL), pitching for the VSL Mets in 2006. He did not play 
in 2007 as he was suspended for violating the terms of minor league baseball's 
drug policy.[1] Quintana signed with the New York Yankees in 2008. He pitched 
the 2008 and 2009 seasons in the Rookie-level Dominican Summer League (DSL) 
with the DSL Yankees 2. In 2010, he pitched for the Gulf Coast Yankees 
of the Rookie-level Gulf Coast League and the Charleston RiverDogs of the 
Class A South Atlantic League.[2] In 2011, Quintana posted a 10-2 win–loss 
record and a 2.91 earned run average (ERA), with 88 strikeouts in 102 innings 
pitched for the Tampa Yankees of the Class A-Advanced Florida State League 
(FSL).[1][3] He became a minor league free agent after the 2011 season.[4] 
White Sox' scouts Daraka Shaheed and Joe Siers, who watched Quintana pitch 
in the FSL the previous season, recommended that the team sign him.[4] 
Quintana signed with the Chicago White Sox during the 2011-12 offseason.[5] 
The White Sox assigned Quintana to the Birmingham Barons of the Class AA 
Southern League. After starting the season with a 1-2 win-loss record, 
a 3.06 ERA, and 26 strikeouts in 35 innings pitched for Birmingham, the 
White Sox promoted Quintana to the majors on May 7, 2012, according to 
a new MLB rule that allow teams to carry a 26th man on their 25-man roster 
during the day of a doubleheader; the White Sox returned Quintana to Birmingham 
after the games. He made his MLB debut in the first game of the doubleheader, 
pitching 5 2⁄3 innings in relief, allowing no runs, one hit, and two walks 
while striking out three.[6] Quintana was optioned back to Birmingham the 
next day, and he stayed there up until May 24, when he was promoted to 
the Charlotte Knights of the Class AAA International League. However, he 
did not pitch there, as he was promoted to Chicago the next day when John 
Danks was placed on the 15-day DL.[7] On May 25, 2012, Quintana got his 
first Major League victory during a 9-3 victory over the Cleveland Indians 
pitching six innings giving up two runs on four hits, walking three and 
striking out four. During a game against the Tampa Bay Rays on May 30, 
2012, Quintana was ejected by umpire Mark Wegner after throwing a pitch 
behind Ben Zobrist.[8][9][10] During the 2012 year, Quintana appeared in 
25 games making 22 starts going 6-6 with a 3.76 ERA. In 2013, Quintana 
made 33 starts going 9-7 with 164 strikeouts and a 3.51 ERA. On March 24, 
2014, Quintana signed a five-year extension with the White Sox, which also 
includes club options for a further two years. He qualified as a "Super 
2" arbitration eligible player after the 2014 season, activating a clause 
in his contract making the deal worth a guaranteed $26.5 million.[11] During 
the 2014 year, Quintana made 32 starts going 9-11 with 178 strikeouts and
