Year at Ole Miss in 1995. Dellucci was elected into the Ole Miss "M Club" 
Athletic Hall of Fame in 2010 and was named as one of the 50 Greatest Athletes 
in Ole Miss history. In spite of playing well and racking up solid statistics 
as a college player, Dellucci was viewed by MLB Central Scouting as a utility 
outfielder when compared to the thick talent pool of other players in the 
'95 draft. As a result, he did not rate a high pick, and he went in the 
10th round and was eventually selected by the Baltimore Orioles in that 
year's First-Year Player Draft. In 1997, Dellucci recorded his first Major 
League hit off of Tom Gordon, which hit off of the Green Monster in Fenway 
Park. He hit his first major league home run on June 25 in a road game 
against Cal Eldred of the Brewers. While playing in the Arizona Fall league

inaugural season in 1998 to 2003. He played on the World Series-winning 
squad in 2001. However, in 1998, as a rookie, and as he found his rhythm 
in major league baseball, he led the National League in triples. While 
hitting .394 in June, 1999 he was diagnosed with a degenerative bone in 
his left wrist called Keinboks disease. In honor of Dellucci, the each 
Diamondback player and coach displayed his number on the side of their

a successful reconstructive surgery and extensive rehabilitation, he returned 
to make the team out of spring training in 2000. During the 2001 season, 
Dellucci hit 10 home runs in 217 at bats with 6 of the home runs coming

the 2003 season, Dellucci was traded to the New York Yankees, along with 
pitcher Bret Prinz and catcher John Sprowl, in exchange for outfielder 
Raúl Mondesí. He finished the 2003 season as a member of the American League 
Champion Yankees and appeared in the World Series against the Florida Marlins. 
In 2004, Dellucci signed with the Texas Rangers as a free agent. In 331 
at bats, Dellucci hit 17 home runs along with 61 RBI. During the Rangers 
playoff run, Dellucci hit a game winning double to beat the Oakland A's 
and keep the Rangers in playoff hopes alive. It has been described as one 
of the most memorable plays in Texas Rangers history. In 2005, Dellucci 
had one of his best years as a professional. He recorded a season high 
in total at bats (435), along with homers (29) and RBIs (65). He is tied 
for second in Ranger history with 4 lead off home runs. In spring training 
of 2006, Dellucci was traded to the Philadelphia Phillies for pitcher Robinson 
Tejeda and Minor League outfielder Jake Blalock. Until the trade of Bobby 
Abreau, Dellucci was used mostly as a pinch hitter/reserve outfielder but 
still hit .292 with 13 home runs in 264 at bats. Dellucci signed with the 
Cleveland Indians on December 6, 2006. On June 19, 2007, while running 
to first base, Dellucci severely tore his left hamstring tendon off the 
bone just under his left knee. He missed time early in Spring training 
2009 due to a surgically repaired thumb after smashing it in the tailgate 
of his trailer. He started the 2009 season on the disabled list with a 
strained left calf. While hitting .275 in 40 at bats, he was designated 
for assignment by the Indians on May 29, 2009, and after clearing waivers 
was released on June 1. On June 10, 2009, Dellucci agreed to terms on a
