Rahway /ˈrɔːweɪ/ is a city in southern Union County, New Jersey, United 
States. It is part of the New York metropolitan area, being 21.6 miles 
(34.8 km) southwest of Manhattan and 5 miles (8.0 km) west of Staten Island. 
As of the 2010 United States Census, the city's population was 27,346,[8][9][10] 
reflecting an increase of 846 (+3.2%) from the 26,500 counted in the 2000 
Census, which had in turn increased by 1,175 (+4.6%) from the 25,325 counted 
in the 1990 Census.[20] Rahway and the surrounding area were once the home 
of the Lenni Lenape Native Americans, and tradition states that the city 
was named after Rahwack, a local tribal chief.[21][22][23] Formal European 
settlement began in 1664 with the purchase by the English from the Lenape 
of the Elizabethtown Tract, which encompassed lands from the mouth of the 
Raritan River and included all of present-day Union County as well as parts 
of Somerset, Middlesex, Morris and Essex counties. The Seventeenth Century 
Clark House is one of the oldest buildings in the state.[24] Rahway saw 
action during the American Revolutionary War because of its proximity to 
Staten Island, Elizabethtown and Perth Amboy. In January 1777, rebels were 
victorious against the British in the Battle of Spanktown, which resulted 
in the death of some 100 British troops.[25] The battle was named this 
after Rahway's original name given to it by the first settlers, Spanktown,[21] 
which is said to have been chosen "because an early settler publicly took 
his spouse across his knee and chastised her".[26] The Merchants' and Drovers' 
Tavern resides at the corner of St. Georges and Westfield Avenues. The 
earliest buildings at the site date to 1795 and the property remains one 
of Rahway's most prominent historical landmarks.[27] George Washington 
visited Rahway during his travel to New York City prior to his presidential 
inauguration in 1789. A marker across the street from the tavern reads:[28] 
Following the Revolution, Rahway became the home of the first national 
mint to create a coin bearing the inscription E pluribus unum.[29] A United 
States Post Office established in Rahway was one of only six in the entire 
state in 1791. Rahway grew due to its location along the major stagecoach 
and railroad lines between New York City and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. 
The navigable Rahway River, which flows through the city, also aided the 
city's commercial growth. As immigrants from Britain, Ireland and Germany 
streamed into what was then Rahway Township in the 1850s, Rahway became 
incorporated as a city by an act of the State Legislature on April 19, 
1858, from portions of Rahway Township in Union and Woodbridge Township 
in Middlesex County. In 1860, the portion of Rahway that had been part 
of Middlesex County was transferred to Union. On March 13, 1861, the remainder 
of Rahway Township became part of Rahway City. Clark Township was formed 
from portions of the city on March 23, 1864.[30] The first municipal elections 
for the mayor and council were conducted on April 19, 1858, and the council 
held its first meeting on May 3, 1858. The city's police department and 
its initial group of four constables were created at that first council 
meeting.[31] The city became home to dozens of major manufacturers, including 
the Regina Music Box Company, Wheatena, Mershon Bros. and, most importantly, 
Merck & Co., which was established in Rahway in 1903, when George Merck 
moved his small chemical company to Rahway from New York City.[32] The 
company remained in Rahway through the presidency of George W. Merck and 
after. The national decline in industry after World War II led to the closure 
of most of Rahway's major manufacturing facilities (except for Merck) and 
a general deterioration of the city's central business district. Beginning 
in the late 1990s, the city launched a plan to revitalize the downtown 
area and authorized the construction of hundreds of new market-rate housing 
units, a hotel, art galleries and additional retail space. According to 
the United States Census Bureau, Rahway had a total area of 4.028 square 
miles (10.434 km2), including 3.897 square miles (10.094 km2) of land and 
0.131 square miles (0.340 km2) of water (3.26%).[1][2] Rahway is bordered 
to the northwest by Clark, to the northeast by Linden and to the south 
by Woodbridge Township in Middlesex County.[33] The city is home to more 
than ten parks. The best-known park is Rahway River Park, which is maintained 
by Union County, and is also partially located in Clark. The park hosts 
a number of baseball fields, picnic areas, a lake and a public pool.[34] 
The park was designed by the Olmsted Brothers in 1922 and its swimming 
pool, built in 1929, was documented by the Historic American Engineering 
Record in 1985.[35] The Rahway River travels through Rahway, entering from 
Clark at Rahway River Park. The river receives the waters of Robinsons 
Branch at Elizabeth Avenue between West Grand Avenue and West Main Street, 
and then receives the waters of the South Branch at East Hazlewood Avenue 
and Leesville Avenue. Finally the river leaves Rahway to enter the city 
limits of Linden and Carteret before flowing into the Arthur Kill.[36] 
Unincorporated communities, localities and place names located partially 
or completely within the city include North Rahway.[37] The climate in 
this area is characterized by hot, humid summers and generally mild to 
cool winters. According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Rahway 
has a humid subtropical climate, abbreviated "Cfa" on climate maps.[38]

City of Rahway is governed under the Faulkner Act system of municipal government 
under the Mayor-Council (Plan F), implemented as of January 1, 1955, based 
on the recommendations of a Charter Study Commission.[51] Under the City 
of Rahway's form of government, all executive and administrative authority 
is vested in the office of the mayor, who appoints the Business Administrator 
and department directors. The Business Administrator develops an annual 
budget for the city, manages the city's departments and oversees its employees. 
This form of government gives citizens a centralized line of authority 
for the efficient management of the city's business.[3] There are nine 
members of the Municipal Council, all elected to four-year terms of office. 
Six members of the council are elected from each of six wards. The other 
three members are elected to represent the entire city at large, and come 
up for election at the same time as the mayor two years after the ward 
seats are up for election.[6][52] As of 2016[update], the mayor of Rahway 
is Democrat Samson Steinman, who is serving a term of office ending December 
31, 2018.[3] Members of the Municipal Council are Council President Robert 
"Bob" C. Bresenhan Jr. (Second Ward; D, 2016), James E. Baker (At Large; 
D, 2018), David Brown (Fourth Ward; D, 2016), Michael W. Cox (Third Ward; 
D, 2016), Rodney Farrar (First Ward; D, 2016), Raymond A. Giacobbe Jr. 
(Sixth Ward; D, 2016 - elected to serve an unexpired term), Joanna Miles 
(At Large; D, 2018), Jeremy E. Mojica (At Large; D, 2018) and Jennifer 
Wenson-Maier (Fifth Ward; D, 2016).[53][54][55][56][57][58] Samson Steinman 
was appointed to the position of mayor in September 2013 following the 
resignation of Rick Proctor, whose term of office was to have run until 
December 31, 2014.[59] In turn, the city council chose Raymond A. Giacobbe 
Jr., from among three candidates nominated by the Democratic municipal 
committee to fill Steinman's vacant Sixth Ward seat expiring in December 
2016.[60] Giacobbe served on an interim basis until the November 2014 general 
election, when he was elected to serve the balance of the term of office.[57]

the National Center for Education Statistics[97]) are four PreK-6 elementary 
schools (which had been PreK-5 until 2011) — Grover Cleveland School[98] 
(343 students), Franklin School[99] (564), Madison School[100] (308) and 
Roosevelt School[101] (665) — Rahway 7th & 8th Grade Academy[102] (845) 
for grades 7-8 and Rahway High School[103] (1,133) for grades 9-12.[104][105] 
The city had a total of 73.67 miles (118.56 km) of roadways, of which 59.18 
miles (95.24 km) were maintained by the municipality, 10.45 miles (16.82 km) 
by Union County and 4.04 miles (6.50 km) by the New Jersey Department of 
Transportation.[106] Rahway is served by U.S. Route 1/9, and Route 27. 
The city is sandwiched between the Garden State Parkway and the New Jersey 
Turnpike, which are each located about two miles outside of the city limits. 
New Jersey Transit 115 route provides local service and interstate service 
to and from the Port Authority Bus Terminal in Midtown Manhattan, with 
service on the 48 line to Elizabeth and Perth Amboy.[107] Rahway Train 
Station[108] serves New Jersey Transit's North Jersey Coast Line and Northeast 
Corridor Line.[109][110] The City of Rahway and New Jersey Transit helped 
fund a $16 million renovation for the station in 1999 and a public plaza 
in front of the station was completed in 2001, changes that have spurred 
cleanup and revitalization downtown.[111] A new US$11.2 million 524-space 
parking deck opened across the street from the station in January 2005, 
helping train commuters and allowing the city to transform old parking 
lot space into new buildings and residences.[112] A typical train ride 
to New York City's Pennsylvania Station takes 40 minutes. Newark Liberty 
International Airport is located 10.2 miles (16.4 km) northeast of Rahway, 
approximately a 20-minute drive by car.[113] Beginning in the early 1990s 
and continuing through the present day, the City of Rahway has rebounded 
as its downtown began to see the construction of new restaurants, art galleries, 
market-rate housing and the old Rahway Theatre reopening as the Union County 
Performing Arts Center. The theater underwent a $6.2-million renovation 
and expansion project, completed in 2007. As part of the expansion, the 
facility was purchased by the County of Union for $1.3 million and leased 
back for $1 a year.[114] In September 1999, remnants of Hurricane Floyd 
swept across New Jersey and caused severe damage. The Rahway Public Library 
was on a flood plain and suffered over US$1 million in flood damage. The 
building was demolished in October 2001 and a new library was constructed 
and opened on March 22, 2004, behind the city's municipal building along 
a less flood-prone area of the Rahway River.[115] The area where the former 
Rahway Public Library was now contains tennis courts and a small playground. 
East Jersey State Prison, formerly known as Rahway State Prison, actually 
is located in Woodbridge Township at the border with Rahway. The prison's 
mailing address is in Rahway, leading many to believe the facility was 
located there. The prison's official name was changed to East Jersey State 
Prison as of November 30, 1988, at the request of the citizens of Rahway.[116] 
East Jersey State Prison is seen at the beginning of the movie, Ocean's 
Eleven, starring George Clooney. The 1978 documentary Scared Straight was 
filmed there as was the 1989 movie Lock Up, starring Sylvester Stallone 
and the prison was briefly mentioned in John Sayles City of Hope (1991).[117]
