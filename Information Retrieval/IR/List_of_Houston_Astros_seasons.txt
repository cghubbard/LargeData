as the Houston Colt .45s, professional baseball franchise. The Astros have

franchise in 1962, the team's first winning season was in 1972. In 1980 
the Astros made their first postseason appearance. From 1997–2005, the 
team made postseason appearances in six out of nine seasons. From 2006

Yankees in the 2015 American League Wild Card Game. This was the Astros' 
first postseason appearance as an American League team, and first overall 
since 2005. It was also the Astros' first playoff win since Game 6 of the 
2005 National League Championship Series. The following table describes
