Stephen Richard Sundra (March 27, 1910 – March 23, 1952) was a pitcher 
in Major League Baseball who played during eight seasons for the New York 
Yankees (1936; 1938–1940), Washington Senators (1941–1942) and St. Louis 
Browns (1942–1944; 1946). He batted and threw right-handed. A native of 
Luxor, Pennsylvania, Steve Sundra was the son of a Czech coal miner. The 
family moved to Cleveland, Ohio, when he was 16 and Sundra starred in sandlot 
ball there. He was signed by the Cleveland Indians and made his pro debut 
in 1932, moving up to Toledo in 1934. Cleveland optioned Sundra to Minneapolis 
and Newark in 1935, and the Yankees obtained him in a three-pitcher deal 
in December, along with Monte Pearson, in exchange for Johnny Allen. His 
career in the American League ran from 1936 to early in 1946, with time 
out for 1944–1945 United States Army service during World War II. In 1936, 
Sundra posted a 12–9 record for the Newark Bears, leading the International 
League with a 2.84 earned run average. After one relief appearance for 
the Yankees in April 1936, he was optioned back to Newark. The Bears won 
the IL championship with a 109–43 mark, and Sundra went 15–4, ranking eighth 
in the league in ERA (3.09), and was selected for the All-Star Game. Sundra 
was a member of the World Champion Yankees in 1938. He won his last four 
starts during the regular season, then ran off 11 straight victories (three 
in relief) for the 1939 AL pennant-winners before losing his last start 
of the season. He appeared in Game Four of the 1939 World Series, pitching 
three hitless, shutout innings of relief. In 1940 Sundra faded, going 4–6, 
and the next year was sold to the Washington Senators, who in turn sent 
him to the St. Louis Browns in the 1942 midseason. He won 15 games in 1943, 
then in 1944, began the year with two complete game victories for the pennant-bound 
Browns. But after his third start on May 2 he entered the Army, thus missing 
the 1944 World Series, the only fall classic in which the Browns would 
ever appear during their 52-year history in the American League. Sundra 
rejoined the Browns for spring training in 1946 after his discharge, but 
was released on May 29, marking the end of his baseball career. Later, 
Sundra sued the Browns under the G.I. Bill, claiming that he should have 
been kept on the roster for one year. He asked for $5,413, the difference 
between what he had been paid and his 1946 salary, but lost in federal 
court in a decision rendered in 1949. He worked in construction until he 
fell ill in late 1950. Sundra died in Cleveland, four days before his 42nd 
birthday, a victim of cancer.[1] He is buried in Cleveland's Calvary Cemetery.
