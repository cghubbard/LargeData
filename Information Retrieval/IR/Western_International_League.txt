The Western International League was a mid- to higher-level minor league 
baseball circuit in the northwest United States and western Canada. Informally 
known as the "Willy" loop,[1][2] it operated in 1923, 1937–1942, and 1946–1954.[3][4] 
In 1955, the league changed its name to the Northwest League,[5] and still 
operates today as a Class A-Short Season loop under that name. The WIL 
consisted of teams in the U.S. states of Oregon, Washington, and Idaho, 
and the Canadian provinces of British Columbia and Alberta.[1] It was a 
Class B league through 1951 and was upgraded to Class A in 1952. In its 
final season in 1954, it started with ten teams in Calgary, Edmonton, Lewiston, 
Salem, Spokane, Kennewick–Richland–Pasco (playing as "Tri-City"), Vancouver, 
Victoria, Wenatchee, and Yakima.[6] Three teams did not finish the season 
(Spokane, Victoria, Calgary).[7] The final champion was the Vancouver Capilanos, 
who swept the Lewiston Broncs in four games. Vancouver was the first half 
champion while third-year Lewiston won the second half.[8] Throughout much 
of the 1930s and 1940s, its teams were largely unaffiliated with major 
league farm systems and provided talent to the strong Pacific Coast League
