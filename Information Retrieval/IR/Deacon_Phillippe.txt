Charles Louis "Deacon" Phillippe (originally Phillippi) (May 23, 1872 – 
March 30, 1952) was a Major League Baseball pitcher who played for the 
Louisville Colonels and the Pittsburgh Pirates. Born in Rural Retreat, 
Virginia to Andrew Phillippe and Jane Margaret Hackler,[1] Phillippe first 
appeared in pro baseball with the National League's Louisville Colonels 
in 1899. He had a 21–17 record that year, which was highlighted by a no-hitter 
in his seventh career game. The Colonels disbanded after the season, before 
which owner Barney Dreyfuss moved a number of Louisville players, including 
Phillippe, to the Pirates, a team Dreyfuss co-owned. Phillippe won 20 games 
for four straight seasons as the Pirates won three straight National League 
pennants from 1901 to 1903. Phillippe earned the honor of starting the 
first World Series game for the Pirates against the Boston Americans in 
1903. In a complete game victory, Phillippe struck out 10 batters and earned 
the win against Cy Young to start the best-of-nine series.[2] He single-handedly 
guided the Pirates to a 3–1 series lead, earning the wins in each game, 
but when his arm wore down due to overuse, the Americans came back to win 
the series 5 games to 3, with Phillippe losing the last two. His five decisions 
in the World Series are still a record for a pitcher. He missed half of 
1904 due to a sore arm, before winning 20 for a sixth time in 1905. His 
years as an ace ended in 1908, when he suffered from another sore arm and 
missed nearly the entire season. Phillippe returned in 1909 to play a bit 
role on a Pirate team which went 110–42. In 1910, he was primarily used 
as a relief pitcher and had a 14–2 record. He retired after the 1911 season 
after making only three appearances that year. In 1912, he managed the 
Pittsburgh Filipinos, which were named after him, and began play in the 
United States Baseball League. The team then moved to the new Federal League 
in 1913 and, for a short time, was later renamed the Pittsburgh Stogies. 
The Filipinos finished in first place during the league's inaugural season, 
which lasted only one month, with a 19-7 record. Phillippe was widely renowned 
for his control. No pitcher who has debuted since 1893 (when the pitching 
mound was moved to its present distance of 60 feet and 6 inches away from 
home plate) has averaged fewer walks per nine innings than Phillippe.[1] 
Deacon is a distant relative of actor Ryan Phillippe, who named his first 
son Deacon in honor of the pitcher in 2003. He was inducted into the Virginia
