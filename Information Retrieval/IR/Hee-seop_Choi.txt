player career coach career Hee-seop Choi (/ˌhiː ˌsɒp ˈtʃɔɪ/; Korean pronunciation: [hɯi 
sʰʌp tɕʰwe]; Hangul: 최희섭; Hanja: 崔熙燮; born March 19, 1979) is a South Korean 
professional baseball player who has played for the Chicago Cubs, Florida 
Marlins, and the Los Angeles Dodgers of Major League Baseball (MLB). He 
is a first baseman who bats and throws left-handed. Choi currently plays 
for the Kia Tigers in the South Korean pro baseball league. Choi was born 
in Hwasun County, South Jeolla Province, South Korea on March 19, 1979. 
He graduated from Gwangju Jaeil High School in Gwangju, South Korea, in 
1998. He attended Korea University in 1998 and was a member of the South 
Korea national baseball team that finished second in the 1998 Baseball 
World Cup. He was scouted and signed by Leon Lee, the father of former 
major league first baseman Derrek Lee. Coincidentally, he later was traded 
to the Marlins for Lee. Beginning in 1999, Choi spent four seasons in the 
Cubs minor league system and was considered to be one of the organization's 
top prospects. On September 3, 2002, Choi made his Major League debut against 
the Milwaukee Brewers and became the first Korean-born position player 
to play in the Major Leagues. In 2003, Choi played in 80 games, hitting 
.218 with eight home runs and 28 RBI. He was the Opening Day starter for 
the Cubs, but suffered a concussion following a collision with teammate 
pitcher Kerry Wood on June 7, 2003.[1] Choi went on the disabled list, 
and never reclaimed his starting role. After the season, he was traded 
to the Florida Marlins for Derrek Lee. With his new team, Choi began the 
2004 season impressively batting .295 with nine home runs and 18 RBIs in 
April. But his stay with the Marlins was a brief one. On July 30, he was 
traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers along with Brad Penny and minor league 
pitcher Bill Murphy for Paul Lo Duca, Guillermo Mota, and Juan Encarnación. 
Choi went on to bat only .161 for the remainder of the 2004 season with 
the Dodgers, leading many to criticize the Dodgers' sabermetrician general 
manager Paul DePodesta for acquiring him. Sabermetric baseball analysts 
claimed that Choi did not get enough playing time because of bias from 
the Dodgers' old school managerial style, which kept rookies on the bench 
for extended periods of time. Jim Tracy reportedly said that he did not 
start Choi on one particular day because Adam Eaton was pitching, and Eaton 
has a unique arm angle in his pitching delivery. Choi's production picked 
up during the 2005 season as he played in 133 games that season and posted 
a .253 batting average , while hitting 15 home runs and driving in 42 runs. 
The highlight of Choi's season came during a weekend series against the 
Minnesota Twins from June 10–12, when he accomplished the rare feat of 
hitting six home runs in a three-game series. However during the 2005–2006 
off-season, DePodesta was fired by Dodgers owner Frank McCourt and new 
general manager Ned Colletti signed Nomar Garciaparra to be the everyday 
first baseman. Rather than keep Choi on the bench or blocking prospect 
James Loney's path to the big leagues, Colleti decided to waive Choi during 
spring training; he was subsequently claimed by the Boston Red Sox. Choi 
represented South Korea in the 2006 World Baseball Classic, in which his 
most significant contribution was hitting a three-run pinch-hit home run 
against Team USA. Choi spent the entire 2006 season with Pawtucket. He 
was designated for assignment August 1, 2006, while on Pawtucket's disabled 
list and removed from Boston's 40-man roster. Choi cleared waivers on August 
11, 2006, and was outrighted to Pawtucket. On December 1, 2006, Choi signed 
a minor league contract with the Tampa Bay Devil Rays where he was given 
a shot to be Tampa Bay's everyday first baseman. Choi decided to return 
home after failing to make Tampa Bay's 40-man roster after 2007 spring 
training. On May 14, 2007, Choi signed with the Kia Tigers in the Korea 
Baseball Organization. In his KBO debut game, He went 0-for-5 against the 
Doosan Bears.[2] Choi finished his first KBO season with a .337 batting 
average, 7 home runs and 45 RBI, playing in 52 games. Choi began the 2008 
season in a slump due to a waist injury, finishing the month of April with 
a batting average of just .208 and going 25-for-120 to close out the month, 
and was then demoted to the Korean minor league affiliate of the Kia Tigers. 
In July, he returned to the 26-man first-team roster, but finished the 
season with horrendous offensive stats. His batting average was a disappointing 
.229, and he had only 6 home runs and 22 RBI. In 2009, Choi broke out offensively 
and became a star, rebounding from the slump. He helped the Tigers into 
title contention immediately, batting .308, blasting a pro career-best 
33 home runs, leading the KBO league in runs with 98 and helping them win 
the 2009 KBO regular season. Choi was runner-up in home runs (33), RBI 
(100) and walks (103), 4th in slugging percentage (.589), 6th in on-base 
percentage (.435), and 11th in batting average (.308). Choi and Kim Sang-hyeon 
hit 69 home runs, and the two together are called the "CK Cannon".[3] On 
December 11, 2009, he obtained his first Golden Glove Award in first baseman 
nomination.[4][5] In 2010, Choi had a .286 batting average, with 21 home 
runs, 84 RBIs, and drew 81 walks. Choi received an all-star selection and 
also participated in the home run derby, where he set the record for longest 
home run.[6] In 2011, Choi was limited to 70 games due to injury. Choi 
hit .281, with 9 home runs and 37 RBI. In 2012, Choi hit .252, with 7 home 
runs and 42 RBI in another injury-plagued season. In 2013, Choi hit .258, 
with 11 home runs and 42 RBI. After the season, he underwent knee surgery.
