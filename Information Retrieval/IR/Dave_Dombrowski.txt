David Dombrowski (born July 27, 1956) is a professional baseball executive 
and is currently serving as the President of Baseball Operations for the 
Boston Red Sox of Major League Baseball (MLB). Dombrowski has previously 
served as the general manager of the Montreal Expos, and the general manager 
and president of the Florida Marlins and Detroit Tigers. Dombrowski began 
his career with the Chicago White Sox in 1978, as an administrative assistant 
in their minor league organization.[1] He moved up the ladder to assistant 
general manager to Roland Hemond by his late 20s, but was purged during 
Ken Harrelson's one-year reign in 1986 as the White Sox front-office boss. 
Dombrowski joined the Montreal Expos front office as director of player 
development for the 1987 season under Bill Stoneman, and on July 5, 1988, 
he became, at age 31, Montreal's general manager—the youngest in MLB at 
the time.[2] Dombrowski built up the Expos farm system during his term. 
He drafted, among others, Rondell White and Cliff Floyd. The team enjoyed 
.500 or better seasons in 1988–90 but struggled on the field in 1991. Concurrently, 
the National League expanded to 14 teams, with two new franchises to begin 
play in 1993. One of those teams, the Florida Marlins, recruited Dombrowski 
to become its first general manager; he was appointed on September 19, 
1991. Dombrowski spent more than a decade in Miami, working under owners 
H. Wayne Huizenga and John W. Henry. Although he built a sound minor league 
system, the Marlins, with Jim Leyland as their manager, achieved their 
first great success—the 1997 NL pennant and world championship—with a team 
composed of many high-salaried players signed as free agents. The following 
year, Dombrowski presided over Huizenga's mandated fire sale of those veteran 
players, and the Marlins failed to reach a .500 winning percentage in each 
of Dombrowski's final four years with the franchise. In November 2001, 
Dombrowski left Florida to become the president of the Detroit Tigers.[3] 
Nevertheless, after Henry sold the club in early 2002, the Marlins managed 
to rebuild behind a nucleus of young players, and in 2003, with a roster 
consisting chiefly of players Dombrowski had acquired,[4] won the World 
Series. Dombrowski hired Jim Leyland as manager of the Marlins in 1996. 
The two had previously worked together with the Chicago White Sox in the 
early 1980s - Dombrowski as assistant general manager and Leyland as third 
base coach.[5] For the 2002 season, his first with the Tigers after being 
hired by owner Mike Ilitch, Dombrowski was to serve as president and chief 
executive officer of the rebuilding Tigers. Incumbent general manager Randy 
Smith would continue in his role, reporting to Dombrowski. However, when 
Detroit lost its first six games in 2002, Dombrowski quickly fired both 
Smith and manager Phil Garner.[6] Dombrowski assumed the general manager's 
role himself, becoming the first person to serve as both president and 
GM for the Tigers since Jim Campbell held both titles from 1978 to 1983.[7] 
In 2003, the Tigers lost an American League-record 119 games, one fewer 
loss than the modern MLB record set by the 1962 New York Mets. The manager 
was Alan Trammell, who was 1984 World Series MVP. Three years later, the 
2006 Tigers, led by manager Jim Leyland, won their first AL pennant since 
their championship season of 1984. Along the way, they won the AL wild 
card, defeated the favored New York Yankees in four games in the division 
series, then swept the Oakland Athletics in the American League Championship 
Series. In the 2006 World Series, they were defeated in five games by the 
St. Louis Cardinals. In addition to bringing Leyland out of semi-retirement,[8] 
Dombrowski presided over the acquisition and development of a corps of 
hard-throwing young pitchers, and signed free agents such as catcher Iván 
Rodríguez, left-handed pitcher Kenny Rogers, and outfielder Magglio Ordóñez. 
In 2012, the Tigers reached their second World Series under Dombrowski's 
tenure by sweeping the New York Yankees in 4 straight games. The Tigers 
were then swept by the San Francisco Giants in 4 straight games, losing 
the World Series. On August 4, 2015, Dombrowski was released by the Tigers, 
and was replaced by his former assistant general manager Al Avila.[9] In 
fourteen years with Tigers organization, Dombrowski led the Tigers to five 
playoff appearances, four consecutive American League Central division 
titles, four American League Championship Series appearances, including 
three consecutive ALCS appearances from 2011 to 2013, and two AL pennants, 
in 2006 and 2012.[10] Prior to his hiring, the Tigers had missed the playoffs 
in fourteen consecutive seasons, and had just four playoff appearances 
in the 60 season stretch from 1946 to 2005. On August 18, 2015, Dombrowski 
was named the president of baseball operations of the Boston Red Sox.[11] 
At the announcement of his hiring, the Red Sox also announced that general 
manager Ben Cherington would step down. In September 2016, Dombrowski filled 
Cherington's post with senior vice president Mike Hazen. Dombrowski made 
his first significant trade for the Red Sox on Nov. 13, when he acquired 
closer Craig Kimbrel from the San Diego Padres for four prospects.[12] 
He also signed high-profile free agent pitcher David Price to a seven-year, 
$217 million contract. In Dombrowski's first season with the Red Sox, Boston 
won 93 regular-season games and the 2016 American League East Division 
title. But the Red Sox were swept in the 2016 American League Division 
Series by the eventual league champion Cleveland Indians. In mid-October, 
Hazen resigned from the Red Sox to take an expanded role as executive vice 
president and general manager of the Arizona Diamondbacks. Dombrowski chose 
not to appoint a successor, assuming general manager responsibilities without 
the added title, and promoting other Red Sox executives to key supporting 
positions, including former MLB general managers Frank Wren and Allard 
Baird.[13] Dombrowski grew up in Palos Heights, Illinois, and graduated 
from Harold L. Richards High School in Oak Lawn, Illinois.[14][15] Dombrowski 
briefly attended Cornell University, where he was a member of the Big Red 
football team. He later transferred to Western Michigan University, where 
he earned a degree in business administration in 1979.[1][16] Dombrowski 
would later be the recipient of Western Michigan University's Distinguished 
Alumni Award in 1998.[15][17] He is married to Karie Dombrowski (née Ross), 
who worked as an ESPN reporter from 1988 to 1990. They met in 1992 while 
he was serving as general manager of the Florida Marlins and Karie was 
a reporter at WTVJ in Miami.[18] The two were married in 1995 in Oklahoma 
City. They have two children, Landon and Darbi, and reside in Bloomfield
