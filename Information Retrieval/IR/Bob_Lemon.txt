As player As manager Robert Granville "Bob" Lemon (September 22, 1920 – 
January 11, 2000) was an American right-handed pitcher and manager in Major 
League Baseball (MLB). Lemon was elected to the National Baseball Hall 
of Fame as a player in 1976. Lemon was raised in California where he played 
high school baseball and was the state player of the year in 1938. At the 
age of 17, Lemon began his professional baseball career in the Cleveland 
Indians organization, with whom he played for his entire professional career. 
Lemon was called up to Cleveland's major league team as a utility player 
in 1941. He then joined the United States Navy during World War II and 
returned to the Indians in 1946. That season was the first Lemon would 
play at the pitcher position. The Indians played in the 1948 World Series 
and were helped by Lemon's two pitching wins as they won the club's first 
championship since 1920. In the early 1950s, Cleveland had a starting pitching 
rotation which included Lemon, Bob Feller, Mike Garcia and Early Wynn. 
During the 1954 season, Lemon had a career-best 23–7 win–loss record and 
the Indians set a 154-game season AL-record win mark when they won 111 
games before they won the American League (AL) pennant. He was an All-Star 
for seven consecutive seasons and recorded seven seasons of 20 or more 
pitching wins in a nine-year period from 1948–1956. Lemon was a manager 
with the Kansas City Royals, Chicago White Sox and New York Yankees. He 
was named Manager of the Year with the White Sox and Yankees. In 1978, 
he was fired as manager of the White Sox. He was named Yankees manager 
one month later and he led the team to a 1978 World Series title. Lemon 
became the first AL manager to win a World Series after assuming the managerial 
role in the middle of a season. Bob Lemon was born in San Bernardino, California. 
Lemon's father, Earl Lemon, ran an ice business and later moved the family 
to Long Beach, California. There, Lemon attended Wilson Classical High 
School and played shortstop on the school's baseball team.[1] He was recognized 
as the state baseball player of the year by the California Interscholastic 
Federation (CIF) Southern Section in 1938.[2] Later that same year, at 
the age of 17, Lemon began his professional baseball career in the farm 
system of the Cleveland Indians as a member of the Oswego Netherlands of 
the Canadian–American League and later that year, the Middle Atlantic League's 
Springfield Indians. In 75 games with the Netherlands he recorded a .312 
batting average. The following season he played 80 games with Springfield, 
and hit .293, and then joined the New Orleans Pelicans of the Southern 
Association, where Lemon hit .309. He spent the next two seasons at the 
Class A level with the Eastern League's Wilkes-Barre Barons as he hit .255 
in 1940 and .301 in 1941. In his final stint in the minors, Lemon hit .268 
with 21 home runs for the 1942 Baltimore Orioles of the International League.[3] 
Lemon's major league debut came as a third baseman as a late season call-up 
on September 9, 1941.[4] He appeared in five games and collected one hit 
in five plate appearances.[5] He was joined by catcher and fellow rookie 
Jim Hegan.[6]:p.109 He repeated the same number of games in the 1942 season 
and failed to record a hit.[7] Lemon served in the United States Navy during 
World War II and missed the next three seasons.[8] Before leaving for tour 
duty in 1943, Lemon married Jane McGee.[1][9] Lemon was the Indians' center 
fielder for Opening Day in 1946. On April 30, Indians pitcher Bob Feller 
no-hit the New York Yankees; Feller later wrote that Lemon's "daring catch" 
and "throwing to and doubling a man off second base" were key in "saving 
my" no-hitter.[10] By season's end, however, Lemon had entered more games 
as a pitcher than a utility player.[9] Before that season, Lemon had only 
pitched one inning while with Oswego and another while with Wilkes-Barre. 
Birdie Tebbetts of the Detroit Tigers and Johnny Pesky of the Boston Red 
Sox had played against Lemon in Navy baseball games, and they spoke to 
Indians player-manager Lou Boudreau about switching Lemon from the outfield 
to the pitching mound.[1][11] Boudreau discussed the potential move to 
pitcher with Yankees catcher Bill Dickey, who had also played in the Navy 
with Lemon. "I knew Lemon had a strong arm, and once I realized he was 
not going to hit with consistency as an outfielder, I thought it would 
be worthwhile to look at him as a pitcher", Boudreau later wrote.[12]:p.86 
Lemon resisted the idea at first, but he agreed to the change after he 
learned that his salary could be higher as a pitcher. Lemon credited Indians 
coach Bill McKechnie with helping him to adjust to his new position.[12]:p.93[13][14] 
Indians pitching coach Mel Harder taught Lemon how to throw a slider, a 
key pitch in his repertoire.[15]:p.38 That same year, Indians owner Bill 
Veeck said that Lemon "some day will become the best pitcher in the American 
League."[16] Lemon finished the 1946 season with a losing record (4–5), 
the only one he would have until 1957, and a career-low 2.49 ERA.[7] He 
followed up his inaugural season as a pitcher with an 11–5 record. He appeared 
in 19 games before August, largely as a relief pitcher, but he made his 
first start in July against the Boston Red Sox.[11] During the last two 
months of the season, Lemon went 9–3 and pitched six complete games, including 
two 11-inning outings.[17] Before the 1948 season started, team president 
Bill Veeck doubled Lemon's contract amount.[18] It would be Lemon's first 
full season as a pitcher.[19] Lemon was the Indians' number-two pitcher 
in the starting rotation, behind Bob Feller.[20] On June 30, 1948, Lemon 
pitched a no-hitter against the Detroit Tigers in a 2–0 win, earning his 
11th win and fifth shutout of the season. He became the ninth Indians pitcher 
to record a no-hitter and ended the season with an AL-best 20 complete 
games. His ten shutouts on the season were the most in the majors.[7][21][22] 
Lemon would go on to win the 1948 AL Pitcher of the Year Award. With three 
games remaining in the regular season, 20-game winner Lemon started the 
first game of their final series against Detroit. Lemon allowed three runs 
on seven hits and the Indians lost the game. Cleveland lost two games of 
the three-game series, forcing a one-game playoff with the Boston Red Sox.[23][24][25] 
Speculation built up around which Indians pitcher Boudreau would send to 
the mound against the Red Sox on October 4; the choices were largely narrowed 
down to Lemon and Satchel Paige. Lemon was listed as Cleveland's "probable 
pitcher" by United Press International in morning newspapers the day of 
the game, even though he would be working on two days of rest.[26] Instead, 
Boudreau went with Gene Bearden, who would be pitching on one day of rest, 
and the choice was solidified when veteran second baseman Joe Gordon spoke 
up in support of Boudreau at a team meeting.[27][28] The Indians won the 
game at Fenway Park by a score of 8–3 and prepared to face the Boston Braves 
in the World Series. Boudreau started Feller in game one, which Cleveland 
lost. Lemon was the starter in the second game.[29] Lemon faced Warren 
Spahn, and Cleveland won 4–1. Lemon was named the starter for game six 
in Boston with the Indians leading the series 3–2. He allowed three earned 
runs on eight hits and Cleveland had the lead when Lemon was replaced by 
Bearden. The Braves scored two runs in the bottom of the eighth inning 
but the Indians won the game, 4–3, to clinch the franchise's first World 
Series title since 1920.[30] Lemon was the only pitcher from either club 
to win two games in the Series. He finished the Series with a 1.65 ERA.[29] 
Lemon's hitting skills began to get attention as well. By August 1949, 
Lemon was batting .295 with 11 extra-base hits and six home runs, prompting 
Yankees manager Casey Stengel to comment, "Well, I see where the Indians 
have nine hitters in the lineup instead of eight."[31] Columnist Milton 
Richman wrote, "Lemon's fine work at the plate has also conspired to tire 
him more. When the Indians get behind and Lemon is pitching, he rarely 
is yanked for a pinch hitter in the early innings. It's a tough price he's 
paying for batting fame."[32] In 1950, Lemon led the major leagues in pitching 
wins (23) for the first time and he would win his second AL Pitcher of 
the Year Award. He pitched a six-hit complete game over the Detroit Tigers 
in his last start of the season on September 29.[33] When Lemon signed 
a new contract before the 1951 season, the Indians made him the highest 
paid pitcher in baseball.[34] At the beginning of the 1951 season, columnist 
Oscar Fraley pointed out that Lemon was one of only 12 active pitchers 
who had earned a winning record in four consecutive seasons.[35] He finished 
the season with a 3.52 ERA, lower than the 1950 season mark of 3.84 when 
he led the majors with 23 wins, and a 17–14 record. The loss total was 
the most in the AL.[7] He did not record his first shutout of the season 
until well into August, when he earned a three-hit win over the Chicago 
White Sox.[36] Upon completion of the 1952 season, Lemon recorded the second-lowest 
ERA of his career, 2.50, and went 22–11. His 28 complete games were a career-high 
and led the AL. He joined teammates Early Wynn (23) and Mike Garcia (22) 
as part of a Cleveland starting rotation which featured three 20-game winners.[37] 
On Opening Day of the 1953 season, Lemon pitched a one-hitter against the 
Chicago White Sox and earned a win.[38] He finished the season with a 21–15 
record, 3.36 ERA and led the AL in innings pitched for the fourth and final 
time of his career.[7] In 1954 he was 23–7 and won his third AL Pitcher 
of the Year Award as Cleveland won the pennant. The Indians set an AL record 
with 111 wins. (The record stood until major league seasons were lengthened 
to 162 games, and it has been surpassed twice since then.)[39][40] Lemon 
was named Cleveland's starter for game one of the 1954 World Series. After 
nine innings, the Indians and Giants were tied 2–2. Lemon stayed in the 
game to pitch the tenth and final inning, but he surrendered a three-run 
home run to pinch hitter Dusty Rhodes and the Indians lost, 5–2. Indians 
manager Al López went with Lemon again in the fourth game after only two 
days rest. "He hasn't worked that close together all year because we had 
a good bunch of other pitchers, but a year ago, he and Wynn and Garcia 
pitched every third day for practically a month. Bob will be all right", 
Lopez said.[41] Lemon and the Indians lost the game, 7–4, as the Giants 
swept the Series four games to none. In his two appearances, he went 0–2 
with a 6.75 ERA, allowed eight walks and recorded 11 strikeouts.[42] Lemon 
began the 1955 season with a 5–0 record in April, but he was the only Cleveland 
starting pitcher with a winning record that month.[43][44] His 18 wins 
tied for the most in the AL that year.[7] He recorded five complete games 
through May 30 but none after that date. Indians general manager Hank Greenberg 
got Lemon to agree to his first reduction in contract salary since joining 
the organization.[45] Lemon earned his 200th career win against the Baltimore 
Orioles on September 11, 1956, and he also hit a home run that day.[46] 
He finished the season with a 20–14 record, the last of his seven career 
20-win seasons, and led the AL in complete games (21).[7] On August 13, 
1957, it was announced that Lemon would not finish the season due to continued 
irritation to his elbow after bone chips were found earlier in the season.[47] 
Lemon ended the season with a record of 6–11, his first losing record since 
1946.[7] In 1958, Lemon was the oldest Indian on the roster at age 37. 
Lemon pitched 3.1 innings over the span of two games before he was put 
on the Indians' disabled list and sent to the Triple-A San Diego Padres. 
There he continued physical conditioning and mentored the pitching staff 
of the Indians' top farm club.[48] He appeared in 12 games with the Padres, 
going 2–5, with a 4.34 ERA, 22 walks, and 19 strikeouts.[3] He returned 
to pitch for the Indians on May 25 in a relief role, but he appeared in 
only nine games that season.[49] He earned just one decision that year, 
a loss, which brought his career pitching record to 207–128.[7] The club 
put him on waivers in July.[50] At 38, Lemon went to Tucson in 1959 to 
attend Indians' spring training camp. He told manager Joe Gordon that he 
was willing to become a relief pitcher, but he retired as a player on March 
5, stating, "I just couldn't keep up with the young fellows anymore."[51] 
He accepted a scouting role with the Indians. Lemon retired in 1958 with 
207 wins, all but ten of them occurring in a ten-year span. He recorded 
274 hits in 1,1883 at-bats (.232), and his 37 career home runs are second 
on the all-time career list for pitchers (behind Wes Ferrell's 38).[52]:p.198 
In 1951, Ted Williams had written of Lemon: "I have to rate Lemon as one 
of the very best pitchers I ever faced. His ball was always moving, hard, 
sinking, fast-breaking. You could never really uhmmmph with Lemon".[53][54]:p.37 
The Indians organization retired Lemon's jersey number, 21, in 1998, making 
him the sixth Indian to receive the honor.[19] On January 22, 1976, Lemon 
was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame by the Baseball Writers' 
Association of America on the twelfth ballot on which he appeared. He received 
75 percent of the vote.[55] On August 8, one day before his induction ceremony, 
Lemon said, "It's a great thrill. My mother is 83 but she is making the 
trip from California. She says she can die happy now that I've been elected 
to the Hall of Fame."[56] Lemon's dominant slider has been cited as a key 
reason for his election to the Hall of Fame.[15]:p.38:p.278 In 1959, Lemon 
became a scout for Cleveland. The next season he became a coach with the 
Indians. In 1961, he joined the Philadelphia Phillies coaching staff. The 
California Angels hired him as their pitching coach for 1967–1968. In 1976, 
Lemon served as pitching coach for the AL champion New York Yankees. The 
Yankees were owned by Cleveland-area native George Steinbrenner and they 
had been the chief antagonists of the Cleveland Indians during Lemon's 
pitching years. In recognition of his election to the Hall of Fame, Lemon 
was named honorary captain of the AL team for the All-Star Game.[57] Lemon's 
first managerial role came with the Triple-A Hawaii Islanders of the PCL. 
His next appointment was in the same league with the Seattle Angels, where 
he managed from 1965–1966 and won the 1966 championship.[3][52]:p.295[58] 
He was named the PCL's Manager of the Year by The Sporting News for the 
1966 season.[59] He returned to the PCL as the manager for the Vancouver 
Mounties for one season in 1969.[3] Lemon said he used Indians manager 
Al López as a model for his managing style: Lemon became pitching coach 
of the Royals for the 1970 season, and got his first major league managing 
position when the Kansas City fired manager Charlie Metro on June 7, 1970.[61][62] 
By August, Lemon received a one-year contract extension with the club: 
In 1971, Lemon guided the Royals to their first winning season since the 
franchise began as an expansion team in 1969. Lemon finished second in 
the Associated Press AL Manager of the Year voting.[64] Before the 1972 
season, Lemon talked about the team's chances, saying "Five clubs could 
win it, including ourselves."[65] However, the Royals finished 76–78 in 
Lemon's last year with the club.[66] Royals owner Ewing Kauffman fired 
Lemon as manager and stated that he wanted a younger person to fill the 
position and "did not want to lose Jack McKeon", who was named as Lemon's 
replacement.[67] Royals outfielder Lou Piniella was one of several players 
who disagreed with Kauffman's decision, saying, "...Lemon deserved to manage 
the club next year."[68] His third and final stint in the PCL was with 
the Sacramento Solons in 1974. His last minor league managerial position 
came the following season with the International League's Richmond Braves.[3] 
Bill Veeck hired Lemon to succeed Paul Richards as the Chicago White Sox 
manager on November 16, 1976.[69] Lemon took over a Chicago team that finished 
in last place in the AL West in 1976.[70] "Bob is the type of manager we 
need at this stage of the game", Veeck said.[69] During spring training 
of 1977, Lemon said, "I think we'll surprise a few people."[71] White Sox 
shortstop Alan Bannister quickly noticed a difference. Comparing Richards 
to Lemon, Bannister said, "He'd post the lineups 10 minutes before the 
game, and only then we'd find out who was playing and where. Lemon's made 
it a serious operation."[72] As late as August 14, the White Sox were in 
first place in the AL West. The White Sox finished with a 90–72 record, 
a 26-game improvement. The team finished third in AL West and Lemon won 
his second Manager of the Year Award. "The fans got behind us after about 
three weeks. They had a lot to do with our success", Lemon said after being 
winning the award.[73] Lemon was fired the following season on June 30, 
1978, by Veeck after Chicago posted a 34–40 record in the first half of 
the 1978 season. He was replaced by former Indians' teammate Larry Doby. 
"This change is not meant as any commentary on Lemon's ability but rather 
was the result of unusual circumstances which seemed to make a change necessary", 
said Veeck.[74] Yankees manager Billy Martin resigned on July 24, 1978, 
and team president Al Rosen called Lemon to offer him the vacant position. 
He was announced as the new manager the next day. At their 1978 Old Timers 
Day five days after the Martin–Lemon changeover, the Yankees divulged that 
Lemon would be moved in 1980 to general manager, and they said that Martin 
would then return as field manager. The announcement was made by public-address 
announcer Bob Sheppard after the Old Timers had been announced and it was 
accompanied by Martin's dramatic entrance from the Yankee dugout. Martin 
received a long standing ovation from fans. Lemon responded to his new 
job—and to the newspaper strike that helped calm down the atmosphere in 
the Yankees clubhouse—by guiding the Yankees to the 1978 pennant. The Yankees, 
who trailed the Red Sox by 14 games at one point in July, pulled even with 
the Red Sox by defeating them in a four-game September series known as 
the "Boston Massacre."[52]:p.294 The Yankees pulled ahead by three and 
a half games, but the Red Sox rallied to tie the Yanks by the final day 
of the season. A one-game playoff would determine the AL Eastern Division 
winner. Ron Guidry was named the Yankees' starting pitcher for the October 
2 playoff game at Fenway Park. Guidry was able to pitch "because of Lemon's 
good planning."[52]:p.295 The Yankees defeated Boston for the division 
title in the tie-breaker game, punctuated both by a dramatic three-run 
home run by Bucky Dent in the seventh inning, and an eighth-inning homer 
by Reggie Jackson that proved the game's winning run. Lemon became the 
third manager in MLB history to replace another mid-season and win the 
pennant.[52]:p.294 Lemon's Yankees then beat the Royals in the ALCS and 
defeated the Los Angeles Dodgers to win the World Series title. With the 
Series win, Lemon became the first AL manager and third MLB manager to 
take over a team mid-season and win a World Series. Before the World Series, 
one columnist wrote, "...many observers feel that Lemon's low-keyed approach 
with the Yankees' temperamental millionaires as compared to the combativeness 
of Martin served to mold a spirit of togetherness among the Yankees that 
did not even exist last year when they won it all."[75] Lemon and his handling 
of the season was described in The New York Times as "an island of calm 
in a stormy summer."[76] Changes Lemon made during the season included 
returning Thurman Munson to the team's every day catcher (he had been playing 
in the outfield), putting Jackson in the clean-up spot in the batting order 
and becoming the regular right fielder, and pitching Ed Figueroa every 
fourth day (instead of fifth).[52]:p.295 In October, Lemon was named the 
Associated Press' AL Manager of the Year, the second time he received such 
an award.[77] Lemon's 26-year-old son, Jerry, was killed in an automobile 
accident in the fall of 1978, 10 days after Lemon won the World Series.[78] 
The following season with the Yankees at 34–31, Lemon was fired in June 
by Steinbrenner and replaced by Martin, but he remained with the organization 
as he had a contract through the 1982 season. Speaking of Martin, Lemon 
said, "He's a very likeable guy, a free spirit. Where maybe I keep things 
inside, he lets them come out. There's nothing wrong with that."[78] The 
Yankees finished in fourth place in the AL East (89–71).[52]:p.292 Lemon 
worked as a scout for the Yankees and received "several offers" from other 
teams to serve as manager.[52]:p.295 One offer came in 1979 from the Indians, 
but Lemon refused it as well as the others.[79] Steinbrenner named Lemon 
the team's field manager a second time on September 6, 1981, the sixth 
Yankees' manager change since 1978.[80] Lemon moved on to the post-season 
and dispatched the Milwaukee Brewers and the Billy Martin-led Oakland Athletics, 
and won the first two games of the 1981 World Series against the Dodgers, 
only to lose four straight and the Series. Lemon survived just a few weeks 
into the 1982 season (the Yankees were 6–8) before Steinbrenner dismissed 
him one last time, despite a promise for Steinbrenner he would manage the 
season "no matter what."[52]:p.295[81]:p.40 Of the agreement between Lemon 
and Steinbrenner, Steinbrenner said, "Lem and I talked. He said it was 
O.K. He said he didn't take it as a promise anyway."[81]:p.45 Gene Michael 
succeeded Lemon as manager. He had managed just over one full season of 
games (172) for the Yankees, winning 99 games for a .576 winning percentage.[82] 
Lemon suffered a stroke in his later years.[19] Lemon died in 2000 in Long 
Beach, California, where he had been a permanent resident since his career 
as a player. Former teammate Bob Feller said, "Bob had a good curve, a 
good slider, and a vicious sinker pitch. He wasn't overly fast, but he 
always stayed ahead of the hitters and he didn't walk many batters, which
