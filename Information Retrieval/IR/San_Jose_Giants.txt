The San Jose Giants are a minor league baseball team in San Jose, California, 
USA. They are a Class A - Advanced team in the Northern Division of the 
California League, and have been a farm team of the San Francisco Giants 
since 1988 and have played continuously since 1962 under several different 
names/affiliations. Home games are played at San Jose Municipal Stadium. 
San Jose, California has hosted multiple minor league baseball teams throughout 
its history. The current lineage can be traced back to the San Jose Bees 
who joined the California League in 1962 as an affiliate of the expansion 
Los Angeles Angels. They switched to a Kansas City Royals affiliate from 
1970-1974 and a Cleveland Indians affiliate in 1975-1976. The Sacramento 
Solons then leased the San Jose affiliate for two seasons, when they were 
known as the San Jose Missions and played in the Pacific Coast League as 
an affiliate of the Oakland Athletics and Seattle Mariners. They returned 
to the California League the following season and became a Montreal Expos 
affiliate in 1982. The team then became an unaffiliated independent team 
until it got its current affiliation with the San Francisco Giants in 1988. 
Since the team's inception, the San Jose Giants have been one of the more 
successful teams in the California League. They captured the league championship 
in 1998, 2001, 2005, 2007, 2009 and most recently in 2010. In 2005 and 
once again in 2007 after being down 2-0 in the best of 5 series, came back 
home and won the final three games over Lake Elsinore Storm to claim the 
Championship Series 3-2. (In 2001 the Giants were declared co-champions 
with the Lake Elsinore Storm after the final series was cancelled after 
the September 11 terrorist attacks). The team has also made the California 
League playoffs numerous times and won the Northern Division championship 
8 times. The Giants also had the best record of any minor league class 
A team in the 1990s. This has shown at the turnstile as attendance has 
increased 14 of the last 17 years. The SJ Giants are now in their 22nd 
season being affiliated with the San Francisco Giants. This makes the SJ 
Giants affiliation the longest currently enjoyed by a team in the California 
League. 2008 marked a second highest team record attendance of 183,788 
for the season. San Jose Giants have developed more than 115 major league 
players, including Buster Posey, Tim Lincecum, Jonathan Sanchez, Matt Cain, 
Brian Horwitz, Noah Lowry, Merkin Valdez, Chad Zerbe, Russ Ortiz, Bill 
Mueller, Doug Mirabelli, Rod Beck, Joe Nathan, Francisco Liriano, Shawn 
Estes, Emmanuel Burriss, Andrés Torres, and Pablo Sandoval. In addition, 
many players on the Kansas City Royals teams of the 1970s and 1980s, such 
as George Brett, Amos Otis, and Dennis Leonard, knew their way to San Jose. 
San Jose Giants games are very much rooted in the older traditions of baseball. 
Fans sit very close to the field, general admission seating is available 
for games, players sign autographs before every game, and the outfield 
walls are lined with advertisements much like the stadiums of the 1920s 
and 1930s were. A simple scoreboard shows basic game data like runs, strikes, 
balls, and outs. This was updated in 2005 to feature lights to denote the 
count rather than numbers much like Fenway Park in Boston.[clarification 
needed] The out-of-town scoreboard for other California League games is 
also hand hung.[clarification needed] In 2006, the simple scoreboard was 
replaced with a 21-by-15-foot video screen costing $500,000,[2] and the 
hand hung out-of-town scoreboard is no longer used.[clarification needed] 
Between innings, fans are treated to all manner of little games and entertainment, 
such as a tire toss, a child footrace around the bases, or throwing a baseball 
at a truck for prizes. The San Jose Giants also added a mascot, Gigante, 
for the 2006 season. Before Gigante's introduction, San Francisco Giants 
mascot Lou Seal made occasional appearances. San Jose Giants games were 
often the home of Krazy George. George is a well known "fan" in the San 
Francisco Bay Area who attends not only SJ Giants games but also many of 
the MLB, NFL, NHL, and NCAA football games in the region. His claim to 
fame is being the creator of "the wave" in Oakland on October 15, 1981 
where fans rise and wave their arms in sequence around a stadium thus created 
a wave like effect when viewed from a distance. Pitchers Catchers Infielders
