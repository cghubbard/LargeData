Andrew Eugene "Andy" Pettitte (/ˈpɛtɪt/; born June 15, 1972) is an American 
former baseball starting pitcher who played 18 seasons in Major League 
Baseball (MLB), primarily for the New York Yankees. He also pitched for 
the Houston Astros. Pettitte won five World Series championships with the 
Yankees and was a three-time All-Star. He ranks as MLB's all-time postseason 
wins leader with 19.[1] Pettitte was drafted by the Yankees organization 
in 1990, and he signed with them roughly a year after. After debuting in 
the major leagues in 1995, Pettitte finished third in voting for the American 
League (AL) Rookie of the Year Award. In 1996, he led the AL with 21 wins 
and was runner-up for the AL Cy Young Award, and two years later, he was 
named the Yankees' Opening Day starter. Pettitte established himself as 
one of the "Core Four" players who contributed to the Yankees' late-1990s 
dynasty that produced four championships. Pettitte won the 2001 American 
League Championship Series Most Valuable Player (MVP) Award in helping 
his team win the pennant. After spending nine seasons with the Yankees—a 
stint in which he won at least 12 games each season—Pettitte signed with 
the Astros in 2004. He rejoined the Yankees in 2007 and later that season 
admitted to using human growth hormone to recover from an elbow injury 
in 2002. Pettitte's second tenure with the team lasted six seasons, interrupted 
by a one-year retirement in 2011, and produced a fifth World series championship. 
Pettitte's pitching repertoire includes a four-seam and cut fastball and 
several off-speed pitches such as a slider, curveball, and changeup. A 
left-handed pitcher, he has an exceptional pickoff move to first base, 
which has allowed him to record 100 career pickoffs as of August 16, 2013. 
Among Yankees pitchers, Pettitte ranks first in strikeouts (2,020), third 
in wins (219), and tied for first in games started (438). He won the most 
games of any pitcher in the 2000s. His number 46 was retired by the Yankees 
on August 23, 2015. Pettitte was born on June 15, 1972, in Baton Rouge, 
Louisiana. He is of Italian and Cajun descent, and the younger of two children 
born to Tommy and JoAnn Pettitte. He attended Deer Park High School in 
Deer Park, Texas, where he pitched for the school's baseball team.[2] His 
fastball ranged from between 85 to 87 miles per hour (137 to 140 km/h). 
He also played center and nose guard for the school's football team.[3] 
The Yankees selected Pettitte in the 22nd round of the 1990 Major League 
Baseball draft. Recruited by San Jacinto College North in Houston, Texas, 
he opted to play college baseball when coach Wayne Graham compared him 
to Roger Clemens. As Pettitte enrolled in a junior college rather than 
a four-year school, the Yankees retained the right to sign him as a draft-and-follow 
prospect. On May 25, 1991, he signed with the Yankees, receiving an $80,000 
signing bonus ($139,223 in current dollar terms), double the Yankees' initial 
offer.[3] In 1991, Pettitte pitched for the Gulf Coast Yankees of the Rookie-level 
Gulf Coast League and Oneonta Yankees of the Class A-Short Season New York–Penn 
League, making six starts for each team.[4] With Oneonta, Pettitte teamed 
up with catcher Jorge Posada, his longtime batterymate, for the first time.[5] 
Pettitte threw a knuckleball at the time. Posada struggled to catch the 
knuckleball, prompting Pettitte to abandon the pitch.[5] In 1992, Pettitte 
pitched for the Greensboro Hornets of the Class A South Atlantic League. 
He pitched to a 10–4 win–loss record and a 2.20 earned run average (ERA), 
with 130 strikeouts and 55 walks, in 27 games started.[4] That season, 
Pettitte and Posada first played with Derek Jeter.[6] Pettitte pitched 
for the Prince William Cannons of the Class A-Advanced Carolina League 
in the 1993 season, finishing the year with an 11–9 record, a 3.04 ERA, 
129 strikeouts, and 47 walks in 26 starts.[4] He also made one start for 
the Albany-Colonie Yankees of the Class AA Eastern League during the season.[7] 
Pettitte began the 1994 season with Albany-Colonie, where he had a 7–2 
record and 2.71 ERA in 11 starts, before receiving a promotion to the Columbus 
Clippers of the Class AAA International League. With Columbus, Pettitte 
had a 7–2 record and a 2.98 ERA in 16 starts.[4] The Yankees named him 
their minor league pitcher of the year.[8] Baseball America ranked Pettitte 
the 49th best prospect in baseball prior to the 1995 season. In spring 
training, Pettitte competed for a spot in the starting rotation with Sterling 
Hitchcock. Hitchcock won the competition, and Pettitte opened the season 
in the bullpen,[3] making his major league debut with the Yankees on April 
29, 1995. The Yankees demoted him back to the minors on May 16 to allow 
him to continue starting.[3] Eleven days later, he was recalled due to 
an injury to Jimmy Key.[3] With Scott Kamieniecki and Mélido Pérez also 
suffering injuries, Pettitte became a member of the starting rotation. 
He recorded his first major league win on June 7.[9][10] He continued to 
perform well through July, leading Yankees' starters in ERA.[11] Pettitte 
won six of his last seven starts, finishing the season with a 12–9 record 
and a 4.17 ERA, and placed third in American League (AL) Rookie of the 
Year Award balloting, behind Marty Cordova and Garret Anderson.[12] He 
started Game Two of the 1995 American League Division Series (ALDS) against 
the Seattle Mariners, allowing four runs in seven innings. The Mariners 
won the series three games to two.[13] Believing Pettitte to be the superior 
pitcher, the Yankees traded Hitchcock prior to the 1996 season.[3] Starting 
the season in the rotation, Pettitte had a 13–4 record at the end of the 
first half of the season, and made the AL All-Star team. He did not appear 
in the 1996 MLB All-Star Game, due to a sore arm.[14] He led the AL with 
21 wins and finished third in winning percentage (.724), and eighth in 
ERA (3.87).[15] He finished second to Pat Hentgen for the AL Cy Young Award, 
with the smallest difference in voting since 1972. Hentgen won the award 
in part because he pitched more complete games than Pettitte.[16] The Yankees 
defeated the Texas Rangers in the 1996 ALDS[17] and the Baltimore Orioles 
in the 1996 American League Championship Series (ALCS).[18] Pettitte won 
two games against the Orioles, and had his opportunity for a third start 
in the series cancelled by rain.[19] Pettitte started Game One of the 1996 
World Series against the Atlanta Braves. He allowed seven runs in 2 1⁄3 
innings in the first game, but outdueled John Smoltz in Game Five, which 
the Yankees won 1–0.[20] The Yankees defeated the Braves in Game Six to 
win the series, four games to two.[21] The next year, Pettitte tied for 
first in games started (35),[22] and also led the league in pickoffs (14), 
and double plays induced (36).[23] He was third in the league in innings 
pitched (IP) ( 240 1⁄3; a career high), fourth in ERA (2.88), wins (18), 
and winning percentage (.720), sixth in complete games (4), eighth in strikeouts 
(166), and tenth in walks per nine innings (2.43).[22] Pettitte finished 
fifth in the AL Cy Young Award voting.[24] In 1998, he was seventh in the 
league in complete games (5; a career high), and eighth in wins (16). In 
the 1998 ALCS, Pettitte allowed four home runs in a game to the Cleveland 
Indians. The Yankees won the series, and defeated the San Diego Padres 
in the 1998 World Series. Pettitte started in Game Four, defeating Kevin 
Brown in the deciding game of the series.[25] The Yankees won the 1999 
World Series. They continued their success in the 2000 season. Pettitte 
finished third in the AL in wins (19), sixth in winning percentage (.679), 
and seventh in complete games (3). He finished off the season with his 
fourth World Series Title. In 2001, he made the All-Star team for the second 
time and was named the ALCS Most Valuable Player, after winning Games 1 
and 5 against the Seattle Mariners in the 2001 ALCS.[26][27] He was third 
in the AL in walks per nine innings (1.84), and eighth in strikeouts (164) 
and strikeouts per nine innings (7.36). The following year, he was ninth 
in the AL in winning percentage (.722) and complete games (3). Pettitte 
continued his success through 2003. Pettitte was second in the league in 
wins (21), fifth in winning percentage (.724), sixth in strikeouts (180; 
a career high) and strikeouts per nine innings (7.78; a career-best), eighth 
in games started (33), and ninth in walks per nine innings (2.16). He won 
the Warren Spahn Award, given annually to the best left-handed pitcher 
in baseball.[28] Pettitte became a free agent after the 2003 season. Interested 
in playing closer to his Deer Park home, and feeling that the Yankees were 
not interested in re-signing him, Pettitte signed a three-year, $31.5 million 
contract with the Houston Astros of the National League (NL).[29] He switched 
his uniform number to #21, in honor of Roger Clemens, who previously wore 
that number in Boston and Toronto. His 2004 season, in which he held batters 
to a .226 batting average, was shortened by elbow surgery. Pettitte returned 
to form in the 2005 season to help the Astros make their first trip to 
the World Series. His 2.39 ERA was a career-best, and second in the NL 
behind teammate Roger Clemens. He was also second in the league walks/9 
IP (1.66) and LOB percentage (79.7%; a career best),[30] 3rd in sacrifice 
hits (15), fifth in wins (17), and eighth in winning percentage. (.654). 
He held left-handed batters, who over his career have outhit righties when 
batting against him, to a .200 batting average, had a career-best 4.17 
SO/BB ratio.[31] Pettitte went 14–13 with a 4.20 ERA during the 2006 season 
as the Astros missed the playoffs. He led the NL in starts (35), tied for 
seventh in pickoffs (4), and was eighth in double plays induced (26), and 
tenth in strikeouts (178) and batters faced (929).[citation needed] After 
the 2006 season, Pettitte signed a one-year, $16 million contract with 
the New York Yankees with a player option for 2008 worth $16 million. The 
Astros had offered Pettitte $12 million for a one-year contract.[32] Pettitte 
won his 200th career game on September 19, 2007. In 2007 he led the American 
League in starts (34), was seventh in batters faced (916), and was 9th 
in innings pitched ( 215 1⁄3), finishing the regular season with a 15–9 
win-loss record. He also had the 5th-lowest HR/9 innings pitched ratio 
in the AL (0.67). After the season, Pettitte declined his 2008 option, 
becoming a free agent.[33] The Yankees offered Pettitte salary arbitration, 
and Pettite accepted the Yankees offer. He signed a one-year, $16 million 
contract with the Yankees on December 12.[34] On September 21, 2008, Pettitte 
was the last starting pitcher for the Yankees at Yankee Stadium. He recorded 
his 2,000th career strikeout in the second inning, striking out Baltimore 
Orioles catcher Ramón Hernández. Pettitte led the Yankees in innings pitched 
in 2008 with 204. Over 14 seasons, Pettitte has averaged 158 strikeouts 
a season, the same number as he accumulated in 2008.[35] Pettitte agreed 
to a one-year, $5.5 million contract with incentives on January 26, 2009. 
Based on incentives such as innings pitched and days on the active roster, 
Pettitte eventually earned $10.5 million for 2009. Pettitte began the 2009 
season as the Yankees' fourth starter, behind CC Sabathia, A. J. Burnett, 
and Chien-Ming Wang, followed by Joba Chamberlain.[36] Pettitte was the 
winning pitcher as the Yankees beat the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim in 
Game 6 of the ALCS on October 25, 2009, to clinch the series and advance 
to the World Series against the Philadelphia Phillies. This brought his 
career total of series-clinching wins to five, breaking the record he previously 
shared with Roger Clemens, Catfish Hunter and Dave Stewart.[37] Pettitte 
drove in his first postseason run during Game 3 of the World Series when 
he got a single to center field that scored Nick Swisher. He was the winning 
pitcher for that game. Pettitte pitched Game 6 of the 2009 World Series 
on three days of rest. Experts were critical of the decision to pitch the 
37-year-old on short rest,[38][39] but Pettitte again was the winning pitcher 
in game 6 of the 2009 World Series, defeating the Philadelphia Phillies 
7–3. He extended his record career total series-clinching wins to six, 
and extended his record for post-season career wins to 18. He became the 
first pitcher in Major League Baseball history to start and win three series-clinching 
playoff games in the same year. Derek Lowe also won three series in 2004, 
but with one of his wins coming in relief. Additionally, on September 27 
against the Red Sox, Pettitte had been the winning pitcher in the division-clinching 
game.[40] Pettitte filed for free agency after the 2009 season.[41] He 
re-signed with the Yankees, receiving a one-year contract worth $11.75 
million.[42] In the first half of the 2010 season, Pettitte went 11–2 with 
a 2.70 ERA, earning an appearance in the 2010 Major League Baseball All-Star 
Game.[43][44] He also won the Yankees.com mid-season Cy Young Award.[45] 
Pettitte finished the season with an 11–3 record and a 3.28 ERA, his lowest 
since 2005.[46] After months of speculation about his future, Pettitte 
announced his retirement on February 4, 2011.[47] He spent the year away 
from professional baseball. Pettitte agreed to join the Yankees in spring 
training in 2012 as a guest instructor. Stating that his return gave him 
"the itch", Pettitte signed a minor league contract with the Yankees worth 
$2.5 million on March 16, 2012.[48] Pettitte began the season in the minor 
leagues pitching in games for different affiliates to build his endurance 
and pitch count.[49] Pettitte returned on May 13, allowing 4 runs over 
6 1/3 innings in a loss to the Seattle Mariners 6–2.[50] During a game 
against the Cleveland Indians on June 27, 2012, Pettitte was hit hard on 
his ankle by a ground ball. Shortly thereafter, it was announced that Pettitte 
had a fractured left fibula and missed over two months. Pettitte returned 
on September 19, 2012 against the Blue Jays pitching five scoreless innings. 
He finished the season with a 5–4 record and a 2.87 ERA in 12 games started. 
He also made two postseason appearances.[51] Pettitte re-signed with the 
Yankees for the 2013 season, agreeing to a one-year, $12 million contract.[51] 
On May 17, 2013, Pettitte was put on the 15-day disabled list due to a 
strained left trapezius muscle. He was activated on June 3, 2013. On June 
8, 2013, Pettitte recorded his 250th career win against the Seattle Mariners, 
becoming the 47th pitcher in Major League history to achieve as many wins.[52] 
On July 1, 2013, in a game against the Minnesota Twins, Pettitte struck 
out Justin Morneau, thereby passing Whitey Ford as the Yankees all-time 
strikeout leader with 1,958.[53] He struck out his 2,000th batter as a 
Yankee on September 6.[54] Pettitte announced on September 20 that he would 
retire at the end of the season.[55] Teammate Mariano Rivera convinced 
him to announce it before the end of the season. Pettitte made his last 
regular season start at Yankee Stadium, on September 22.[56] Pettitte's 
last major league start, on September 28 against the Astros in Houston, 
tied Ford for the most games started in Yankees history (438). Pettitte 
pitched a complete game, receiving the victory.[57] The Astros honored 
his career during the game.[58] Pettitte won 20 games in a season twice, 
posting 21–8 records in 1996 and 2003. He was part of seven American League 
pennant-winning teams, one National League pennant-winning team and five 
World Series championship teams. He holds the record for most wins in postseason 
history with 19. He is the only MLB pitcher since 1930 to win at least 
12 games in each of his first nine seasons. For his career, Pettitte had 
a 256–153 win-loss record with a 3.85 ERA and 2,448 strikeouts in 3,316 
innings. He also never had a losing season in the major leagues. Among 
Yankees pitchers, Pettitte ranks first in strikeouts (2,020), tied-first 
in games started (438), and third in wins (219).[59] Pettitte and Rivera 
have combined for a record 81 (11 in the playoffs) win-save combinations, 
the most in history.[60] They, along with teammates Derek Jeter and Jorge 
Posada, have been noted as the "Core Four", as they were teammates for 
the five World Series won by the Yankees between 1996–2009. During the 
period from 1995–2010, no major league pitcher accumulated more regular 
season victories than Pettitte did. His 148 wins from 2000 to 2009 were 
the most of the decade.[61] Pettitte was 19–10 with a 3.83 ERA and 173 
strikeouts in the postseason (1995–2003, 2005, 2007, 2009–2010), with the 
most postseason wins in MLB history. He also holds the all-time postseason 
record for most starts (42) and innings pitched in the postseason (263). 
He was the second starting pitcher in history to win three series-clinching 
games (ALDS, ALCS and World Series) in the same postseason (2009). Derek 
Lowe did the same in 2004, but with one of the wins in relief, and additionally, 
Pettitte won the regular game in which the Yankees clinched the division. 
When Pettitte started Game 3 of the 2009 World Series, he passed Christy 
Mathewson and Waite Hoyt, with the second most World Series starts. Whitey 
Ford is in front with 22 starts. Pettitte has played in 8 different World 
Series (7 with the Yankees, and one with the Astros), and been on the winning 
end of 19 postseason series – both of which are tops among active players. 
Andy Pettitte's final postseason appearance was on Saturday, October 13, 
2012 which was game one of the 2012 ALCS. Pettitte received a no decision 
in the game which the Yankees would lose in 12 innings. On February 16, 
2015, the Yankees announced that they would be retiring Pettitte's number 
46 on August 23, 2015.[62] Pettitte throws a four-seam fastball, a cutter 
a curveball, a sinker, a changeup to right-handed batters, and a slider.[63] 
His out pitch is a cutter at 84–88 mph with good inside break on right-handed 
batters, resulting in a lot of ground ball outs and double plays.[64] Before 
his original 2011 retirement, his fastball was measured in the lower 90s 
and his curveball was about 74–76 mph. As a left-handed pitcher, Pettitte 
has an exceptional pickoff move to first base, allowing him to record 100 
career pickoffs.[65] Pettitte met his wife Laura in high school. They have 
four children; Joshua Blake, Jared, Lexy Grace, and Luke. Pettitte and 
his wife are devout Christians.[66] Josh was selected by the Yankees in 
the 37th round of the 2013 MLB draft, but enrolled at Baylor University 
rather than sign a professional contract.[67] He currently plays at Rice 
University after transferring from Baylor in April 2014.[68][69] On September 
30, 2006 the Los Angeles Times reported that former relief pitcher Jason 
Grimsley, during a June 6, 2006 federal raid by federal agents investigating 
steroids in baseball, named Pettitte as a user of performance-enhancing 
drugs.[70] The Times reported that Pettitte was one of five names blacked 
out in an affidavit filed in federal court.[70] Grimsley had told investigators 
that he got amphetamines, anabolic steroids, and human growth hormone (HGH) 
from someone (later named as Kirk Radomski) recommended to him by former 
Yankees trainer Brian McNamee, who is a personal strength coach for Roger 
Clemens and Pettitte.[70] However, on October 3, 2006, the Washington Post 
reported that San Francisco United States attorney Kevin Ryan said that 
the Los Angeles Times report contained "significant inaccuracies."[71] 
Contrary to the initial LA Times report, neither the name of Clemens nor 
Pettitte appeared in the affidavit submitted by Grimsley.[72] Pettitte 
was one of several Yankees named in the Mitchell Report, released on December 
13, 2007. Mitchell and his staff received the information on Pettitte from 
McNamee, who told them he injected Pettitte with HGH on 2–4 occasions in 
2002 so that he would heal from an elbow injury quicker.[73] Pettitte verified 
McNamee's claim, admitting to using the HGH on two occasions in 2002, as 
it was meant to help heal an injury, and not to enhance his performance. 
Pettitte said he felt an obligation to return to the team as quickly as 
possible. He denied any further usage of HGH during his career; he also 
denied use of steroids or any other performance-enhancing drug.[74] On 
February 13, 2008, in an affidavit made public as part of a hearing before 
the U.S. House of Representatives' Committee on Oversight and Governmental 
Reform, Pettitte admitted to additional injections of HGH twice in one 
day in 2004, using HGH obtained via prescription for his seriously ill 
father. Also in this affidavit Pettitte recalled being told by former Yankees 
teammate Clemens in 1999 or 2000 that Clemens had recently received injections 
of HGH. Clemens claimed during the noted hearing that Pettitte "misremembered" 
Clemens's 1999/2000 HGH remark, alleging that what Pettitte really heard 
was Clemens's reporting of his wife's use of HGH at that time, though earlier 
during this same hearing Clemens denied knowing of any use of HGH by his 
wife. McNamee corroborated Pettitte's recollection of events. On February 
18, 2008, Pettitte reported to Yankees spring training and apologized to 
both Yankees and Astros fans for his past drug use. In the press conference, 
he said the performance-enhancing-drug scandal has put a "strain" on his
