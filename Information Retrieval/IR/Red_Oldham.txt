John Cyrus "Red" Oldham (July 15, 1893 – January 28, 1961) was a left-handed 
pitcher in Major League Baseball who played five years with the Detroit 
Tigers (1914–1915, 1920–1922) and two years with the Pittsburgh Pirates 
(1925–1926). He pitched the final inning of the 1925 World Series for the 
Pirates, striking out Goose Goslin to end the game and the series. Born 
in Zion, Maryland, Oldham was drafted by the Detroit Tigers on July 31, 
1914. Boston Red Sox owner Joseph Lannin bought the Providence Grays and 
Melrose Park from the Tigers for $75‚000. Detroit got to pick one player 
from the Providence roster and they selected Oldham‚ overlooking Carl Mays.[1] 
Oldham made his debut for the Tigers at age 21 in August 1914 and pitched 
in nine games for the 1914 team—seven as a starter. He had a record of 
2–4 with a 3.38 ERA (Adjusted ERA+ of 83) in 45.3 innings pitched. In 1915, 
Oldham played in 17 games for Detroit, only two as a starter. He had a 
3–0 record with a 2.81 ERA (Adjusted ERA+ of 107) in 57.7 innings pitched. 
On April 5, 1916, the Tigers released Oldham to the San Francisco Seals 
of the Pacific Coast League "under optional agreement."[2] Oldham returned 
to the Tigers in 1920, playing in 39 games, including 22 as a starter. 
He had a record of 8–13 with a 3.85 ERA (Adjusted ERA+ of 97). In 1921, 
Oldham was the #3 starter behind Dutch Leonard and Hooks Dauss on the 1921 
Tigers team that set all time American League records with 1724 runs scored 
and a team batting average of .316. But without pitching, the 1921 team 
finished in sixth place, 27 games behind the Yankees. With a 4.24 ERA (11-14 
record), Oldham had the second lowest ERA on the 1921 team. In 1921, Ty 
Cobb became the Tigers' manager. Shortly after an interview in which he 
told a reporter that "his aim was to use tact and diplomacy" in dealing 
with players, Cobb called time-out from his position in center field, "ran 
in, wrested the ball from pitcher Red Oldham's hand, and gave him a dressing-down 
before calling in a reliever."[3] Oldham played his final season in Detroit 
in 1922, going 10–13 with a 4.67 ERA (Adjusted ERA+ of 83). On November 
24, 1922, the New York Times reported that Oldham, who was under investigation 
by Judge Landis on the charge of playing winter baseball in Los Angeles, 
had announced that he would retire from baseball and go into business.[4] 
There were also published reports that Odham signed on with the Santa Rita 
team in the Copper League. It was reported that during the 1924 season, 
the Santa Rita team had signed up Oldham to pitch. Santa Rita tried to 
sneak him into the game under the assumed name of Miller. The El Paso team, 
however, caught them at their game and refused to play if Oldham participated.[5] 
Oldham made it back to the big leagues in 1925 with the Pittsburgh Pirates. 
He appeared in 11 games and had a record of 3–2 in 53 innings pitched. 
His ERA in 1925 was 3.91, well below the league average, for a career high 
Adjusted ERA+ of 115. Oldham accompanied the Pirates to the 1925 World 
Series against the Washington Senators. He pitched the final inning of 
Game 7 on October 15, 1925, before 42,856 fans at Forbes Field in Pittsburgh. 
In the 8th inning, AL MVP Roger Peckinpaugh homered to put the Senators 
on top 7–6. In the bottom of the 8th inning, the Pirates scored three runs 
to take a 9–7 lead. Then, in the top of the 9th inning, Oldham entered 
the game with the heart of the Washington lineup coming to bat. Oldham 
proceeded to pitch a masterful 1-2-3 inning against three future Hall of 
Famers. He struck out Sam Rice looking, got Bucky Harris on a lineout to 
second base, and finished the game by striking out Goose Goslin looking. 
The Pirates won the game and the World Series with Oldham on the mound. 
Walter Johnson was the losing pitcher for the Senators.[6] In 1926, Oldham's 
ERA soared to a career high 5.64 (Adjusted ERA+ of 70). He played his last 
major league game on July 8, 1926. In his seven major league seasons, Oldham 
appeared in 176 games (92 as a starter) and had a record of 39–48 with 
292 walks, 267 strikeouts, and an ERA of 4.15. Oldham died in Costa Mesa,
