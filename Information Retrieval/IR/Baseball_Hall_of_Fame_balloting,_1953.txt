Elections to the Baseball Hall of Fame for 1953 followed a radically new 
procedure. The institution appointed its Committee on Baseball Veterans, 
the famous "Veterans Committee", to meet in person and consider pioneers 
and executives, managers, umpires, and earlier major league players. Committees 
in the 1930s and 1940s had chosen several pioneers and executives, but 
this was the first direction of anyone's attention to field personnel other

in closed sessions and elected six people: Ed Barrow, Chief Bender, Tommy 
Connolly, Bill Klem, Bobby Wallace, and Harry Wright. The Baseball Writers 
Association of America (BBWAA) voted by mail to select from recent players 
(no change) and elected two, Dizzy Dean and Al Simmons. The 10-year members 
of the BBWAA had the authority to select any players active in 1928 or 
later, provided they had not been active in 1952. Voters were instructed 
to cast votes for 10 candidates; any candidate receiving votes on at least 
75% of the ballots would be honored with induction to the Hall. A total 
of 264 ballots were cast in the Baseball Writers Election, with 2,493 individual 
votes for 82 specific candidates, an average of 9.44 per ballot; 198 votes 
were required for election. The two candidates who received at least 75%

rules at the time indicated that players were eligible if they had been 
out of baseball for at least one season, so this was Joe DiMaggio's first
