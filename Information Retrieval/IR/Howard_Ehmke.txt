Howard Jonathan Ehmke (April 24, 1894 – March 17, 1959) was a right-handed 
American baseball pitcher. He played professional baseball for 16 years 
from 1914 to 1930, including 15 seasons in Major League Baseball pitcher 
for the Buffalo Blues (1915), Detroit Tigers (1916–1917, 1919–1922), Boston 
Red Sox (1923–1926), and Philadelphia Athletics (1926–1930). Ehmke compiled 
a career win–loss record of 166-166 with a 3.75 earned run average (ERA). 
His greatest success was with the Red Sox, including a no-hitter and his 
only 20-win season in 1923. Ehmke still holds the American League record 
for fewest hits allowed (one) in two consecutive starts. Ehmke also ranks 
sixteenth on the all-time major league list for hitting batsmen with a 
pitch. Ehmke hit 137 batters in his career and led the American League 
in the category seven times, including a career-high 23 in 1922. He is 
best known for being the surprise starter who won Game 1 of the 1929 World 
Series for the Athletics at the age of 35. After retiring from baseball, 
he started his own company that began making tarpaulins to cover baseball 
diamonds during rain. Ehmke was born in Silver Creek, New York, in 1894.[1] 
He was the ninth of eleven children born to a German immigrant father and 
a Swedish-American mother. He moved to California as a young man and graduated 
from Glendale High School in 1913.[2] Ehmke began his professional baseball 
career in 1914 with the Los Angeles Angels in the Pacific Coast League. 
In May and June 1914, he put together a streak of eight consecutive victories 
and became the "phenom" of the PCL,[3] described as the best looking prospect, 
in the pitching sense, that the Pacific Coast league ever has possessed."[4] 
He appeared in a total of 40 games for the Angels and compiled a 12-11 
record with a 2.79 earned run average (ERA).[5] A bidding war developed 
among major league teams seeking Ehmke's services. The Pittsburgh Pirates 
offered the Angels $5,000 in June 1914.[3] In July 1914, the Kansas City 
Packers of the Federal League entered the bidding process.[6] The Washington 
Senators purchased Ehmke from the Angels, but Ehmke refused to sign the 
contract presented to him by the Senators.[7] On February 13, 1915, he 
finally signed a contract with the Buffalo Blues of the Federal League.[8] 
He made his major league debut on April 12, 1915, and appeared in 18 games, 
only two as a starter, for Buffalo. He compiled an 0-2 record with a 5.53 
ERA in 53-2/3 innings pitched.[5] The Federal League folded at the end 
of the 1914 season, and in May 1915, Ehmke joined the Syracuse Stars of 
the New York State League.[9] Ehmke appeared in 38 games for Syracuse in 
1916 and compiled a 31-7 record with a 1.55 ERA.[5] On July 28, 1916, Ehmke 
was sold by Syracuse to the Detroit Tigers for a price reported to be "the 
biggest sum ever paid for a pitcher in the State League."[10] He did not 
appear in his first game for the Tigers until September 1916.[11] He appeared 
in a total of five games for the 1916 Tigers in a short tryout and compiled 
a 3-1 record with a 3.13 ERA.[1] In 1917, Ehmke appeared in 35 games, 25 
as a starter, and compiled a 10-15 record with a 2.97 ERA.[1] In late July 
1917, sportswriter Paul Purman wrote that Ehmke had "bewildering speed, 
a wizardly assortment of curves and a change of pace which kept the batters 
off their balance."[12] However, Purman noted that Ehmke weakened after 
seven innings, compiling a 1.60 ERA in the first seven innings and 9.00 
in the eighth and ninth innings.[12] Ehmke missed the 1918 due to wartime 
service in the United States Navy.[13] He was stationed at a submarine 
base on the West Coast of the United States.[14] Ehmke's best season for 
the Tigers was 1919 when he finished with a 17-10 record. Ehmke did not 
have a winning season in Detroit after 1919 and was twice among the American 
League leaders in losses for the Tigers (18 in 1920 and 17 in 1922). In 
1921, Ehmke had a record of 13-14 and an ERA of 4.54 pitching for a team 
that had the highest team batting average (.316) in American League history. 
On August 8, 1920, Ehmke stuck out eight batters and shut out the Yankees, 
1-0, in just one hour, thirteen minutes‚ one of the shortest games in American 
League history.[15][16] With no outs and two on in the fifth inning‚ Yankee 
Ping Bodie fell for the hidden ball trick applied by Tigers' second baseman 
Ralph Young.[17] Ehmke did have problems with control during his tenure 
with the Tigers, leading the American League in batters hit by a pitch 
five times (1921–1923, 1925 and 1927) and was among the top three in bases 
on balls four times (1919, 1920, 1922, 1923).[1] On November 18, 1922, 
the Tigers traded Ehmke with Babe Herman and Carl Holling to the Boston 
Red Sox for Del Pratt and Rip Collins.[18][19] Ehmke flourished in Boston, 
winning 20 games in 1923. On September 7 of that year, he no-hit his future 
team, the Philadelphia Athletics, 4-0, at Shibe Park; not until Mel Parnell 
in 1956 would another Red Sox pitch a no-hitter. In that game, Slim Harriss 
hit a ball to the wall for a double, but was called out for missing first 
base, preserving the no-hitter.[20] He followed the performance up with 
a one-hitter against the Yankees four days later, with the only hit in 
that game a ground ball that bounced off the third baseman's chest. He 
still holds the American League record for fewest hits allowed (one) in 
two consecutive games (Johnny Vander Meer's consecutive no-hitters in 1938 
is the Major League record). His 1923 season was the best of his career. 
That year, he was eleventh in the American League Most Valuable Player 
voting and led the league's pitchers with a 6.3 wins above replacement 
(WAR) rating. He also ranked among the league leaders with 20 wins (fourth), 
121 strikeouts (fourth), 316-2/3 innings pitched (second), 39 games started 
(second), and 28 complete games (second).[1] Ehmke followed with another 
strong performance in 1924, finishing among the league leaders in wins 
(fifth best with 19), ERA (fourth best with 3.46), strikeouts (second best 
with 119), and innings pitched (first with 315). Ehmke finished 15th in 
the American League Most Valuable Player voting for 1924 and again led 
the league's pitchers with an 8.3 WAR rating.[1] In 1925, Ehmke had a record 
of 9-20. Ehmke lost 20 games despite pitching a league high 22 complete 
games, ranking third in the league in strikeouts, and having a 3.73 ERA, 
best among Boston's starters. The Red Sox were a poor team in 1925, losing 
101 games. Ehmke finished 24th in the AL MVP voting despite losing 20 games.[1] 
On June 15, 1926, the Red Sox traded Ehmke to the Philadelphia Athletics 
in exchange for Fred Heimach, Slim Harriss, and Baby Doll Jacobson.[21] 
The change of scene did wonders for Ehmke. After going 3-10 with a 5.46 
ERA in the first half of 1926 with the last place Red Sox, Ehmke went 12-4 
with a 2.81 ERA in the second half of the season with Hall of Famer Mickey 
Cochrane catching and A's slugger, Al Simmons, hitting .341 behind him.[1][22] 
Though the frequency of his starts diminished after 1927, Ehmke had a winning 
record for the Athletics in four consecutive seasons from 1926 to 1929.[1] 
By 1929, however, Ehmke was nearing the end of his career. He appeared 
in 11 games, eight as a starter, and was out for three weeks due to a sore 
arm. He finished the 1929 season with a 7-2 record and a 3.29 ERA, below 
the league average.[1] In August, manager Connie Mack called Ehmke into 
his office and told him that he would be released after the season. Ehmke 
accepted the decision, but told Mack that he believed he had one more game 
left in him. After 15 years in the majors, he badly wanted to pitch in 
a World Series. By this time, it was clear that the A's would win the pennant. 
They had been in first since May 13, and had opened up a 12-game lead in 
the standings. After giving it some thought, Mack told Ehmke that after 
his next start, he wouldn't pitch again for the last month of the season. 
He also told Ehmke to scout the Cubs, who were running away with the National 
League, on their last East Coast trip of the season — and be ready to pitch 
Game 1 of the World Series.[23] Although it was widely thought to be a 
sentimental move, Mack believed that Ehmke's sidearm style and his mix 
of control and slow pitches would keep the predominantly right-handed Cubs 
off balance.[24] He also believed that, with a month's rest, Ehmke's arm 
would hold up well. In Game 1, Ehmke pitched a complete game and struck 
out a then-World Series record 13 batters in a 3-1 win over Chicago. For 
this reason, Bill James called Mack's decision to start Ehmke "the most 
brilliant managerial stratagem in the history of baseball."[23] At the 
time, Ehmke also set a record for lowest win total during the regular season 
by a World Series Game 1 starter. This record stood until 2006 when St. 
Louis Cardinals pitcher Anthony Reyes started Game 1 of the 2006 World 
Series after having gone 5-8 during the regular season. Ehmke also started 
the final game of the 1929 World Series, holding the Cubs scoreless in 
the first two innings, but giving up two runs with two outs in the third 
inning. The A's came from behind to win the game and the World Series. 
Ehmke was brought back for the 1930 season, but was released on May 31, 
1930, after appearing in three games with an 11.70 ERA. He appeared in 
his last game on May 22, 1930.[1] Connnie Mack said at the time, "I think 
his arm is gone. . . . I am sorry to have to let Ehmke go, because he is 
a fine character, but I have to make room for an extra man who will be 
of more use to us."[25] By 1925, Ehmke had developed a large canvas tarpaulin 
product that could cover baseball and football fields when it rained.[26] 
Credited as the inventor of the tarpaulin,[27][28] he formed a company 
called Howard Ehmke Company to manufacture them, making his first sale 
in 1925 to the Pittsburgh Pirates for use at Forbes Field.[26] He also 
made sales in 1926 to the University of Pennsylvania for Franklin Field 
and to the operators of a stadium in Chicago and took orders from three 
more baseball teams and the University of Michigan for Michigan Stadium.[26][29] 
He had a plant in Detroit, and later Philadelphia, where he manufactured 
the tarpaulins,[29] later expanding his business to tents, flags and banners 
in the 1930s,[27] and into defense work, including canvas covers for naval 
guns, during World War II.[30] Ehmke Manufacturing Company is still in 
business today with its operations based in Philadelphia.[31] Ehmke married 
Marguerite Poindexter in approximately 1920.[2] They had no children and 
lived in Philadelphia after retiring from baseball. Ehmke died at age 65
