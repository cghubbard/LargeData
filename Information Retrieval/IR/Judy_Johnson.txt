William Julius "Judy" Johnson (October 26, 1899 â€“ June 15, 1989) was an 
American third baseman in Negro league baseball. He played for the Hilldale 
Club, Homestead Grays, and Pittsburgh Crawfords from 1921 to 1936. Considered 
one of the greatest third basemen in the Negro leagues, he was elected 
into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1975. Johnson was born in Snow 
Hill, Maryland, on October 26, 1899, to Annie and William Johnson. His 
family moved to Wilmington, Delaware, when he was five years old. He attended 
Howard High School but quit to work on the docks in New Jersey. Johnson 
was 5 feet, 11 inches tall and weighed 150 pounds.[1] In 1919, Johnson 
played for a Philadelphia semi-pro team, the Madison Stars. He was acquired 
by a Negro major league club, the Hilldale Daisies, for $100, and played 
for Hilldale from 1921 to 1929.[1][2] During that time, he was nicknamed 
"Judy" because he resembled Judy Gans, a player for the Chicago American 
Giants.[3] Future Baseball Hall of Famer John Henry Lloyd became Johnson's 
mentor and taught him how to play third base.[1] In 1924, Johnson had a 
batting average of .327. Hilldale faced the Kansas City Monarchs that year 
in the first Negro World Series, and Johnson led all batters with a .364 
average in a losing effort. The following year, Johnson batted .392, and 
Hilldale defeated Kansas City in that season's Negro World Series. In 1929, 
Johnson batted .416.[1] When the Hilldale club folded, Johnson became the 
player-manager of the Homestead Grays. There, he discovered and became 
a mentor to future Hall of Famer Josh Gibson.[1] Johnson then ended his 
career playing for the Pittsburgh Crawfords from 1932 to 1936.[2] He was 
the team's captain and helped them win the pennant in 1935.[1] Johnson 
had a career batting average of .298 in the Negro major leagues.[2] After 
his playing career ended, Johnson was a coach and scout for several Major 
League Baseball teams; he signed Dick Allen. Johnson became the first black 
spring training coach in the majors, for the Philadelphia Phillies in 1954.[1] 
Johnson was a good fielder, and he was considered one of the greatest third 
basemen of the Negro leagues. In 1975, he became the sixth black player 
inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame.[1] He was also inducted 
into the Delaware Sports Museum and Hall of Fame and the Philadelphia Sports 
Hall of Fame.[4][5] A statue of Johnson stands outside Frawley Stadium 
in Delaware.[1] Johnson was married to Anita Irons. The couple had one 
daughter, Loretta, who married major league player Bill Bruton. Johnson 
died on June 15, 1989, in Wilmington, Delaware.[1] The William Julius "Judy" 
Johnson House at Marshallton, Delaware was added to the National Register
