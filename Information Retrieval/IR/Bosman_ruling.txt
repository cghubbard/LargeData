Union Royale Belge des Sociétés de Football Association ASBL v Jean-Marc 
Bosman (1995) C-415/93 (known as the Bosman ruling)[1] is a 1995 European 
Court of Justice decision concerning freedom of movement for workers, freedom 
of association, and direct effect of article 39[2] (formerly 48) of the 
EC Treaty. The case was an important decision on the free movement of labour 
and had a profound effect on the transfers of football players within the 
European Union (EU). The decision banned restrictions on foreign EU players 
within national leagues and allowed players in the EU to move to another 
club at the end of a contract without a transfer fee being paid. The ruling 
was made in a consolidation of three separate legal cases, all involving 
Belgian player Jean-Marc Bosman: Jean-Marc Bosman was a player for RFC 
Liège in the Belgian First Division in Belgium whose contract had expired 
in 1990. He wanted to change teams and move to Dunkerque, a French team. 
However, Dunkerque refused to meet his Belgian club's transfer fee demand, 
so Liège refused to let him go.[3] In the meantime, Bosman's wages were 
reduced as he was no longer a first-team player.[4] He took his case to 
the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg and sued for restraint of trade 
citing FIFA's rules regarding football, specifically Article 17. On 15 
December 1995 the court ruled that the system, as it was constituted, placed 
a restriction on the free movement of workers and was prohibited by Article 
39(1) of the EC Treaty (now Article 45 (1) of the Treaty on the functioning 
of the European Union). Bosman and all other EU football players were given 
the right to a free transfer at the end of their contracts, with the provision 
that they were transferring from a club within one EU Association to a 
club within another EU Association. 95 in that context, nationals of Member 
States have in particular the right, which they derive directly from the 
Treaty, to leave their country of origin to enter the territory of another 
Member State and reside there in order there to pursue an economic activity 
(see, inter alia, Case C-363/89 Roux v Belgium [1991] ECR I-273, paragraph 
9, and Singh, cited above, paragraph 17). 96 Provisions which preclude 
or deter a national of a Member State from leaving his country of origin 
in order to exercise his right to freedom of movement therefore constitute 
an obstacle to that freedom even if they apply without regard to the nationality 
of the workers concerned (see also Case C-10/90 Masgio v Bundesknappschaft 
[1991] ECR I-1119, paragraphs 18 and 19). 97 The Court has also stated, 
in Case 81/87 The Queen v H.M. Treasury and Commissioners of Inland Revenue 
ex parte Daily Mail and General Trust plc [1988] ECR 5483, paragraph 16, 
that even though the Treaty provisions relating to freedom of establishment 
are directed mainly to ensuring that foreign nationals and companies are 
treated in the host Member State in the same way as nationals of that State, 
they also prohibit the Member State of origin from hindering the establishment 
in another Member State of one of its nationals or of a company incorporated 
under its legislation which comes within the definition contained in Article 
58. The rights guaranteed by Article 52 et seq. of the Treaty would be 
rendered meaningless if the Member State of origin could prohibit undertakings 
from leaving in order to establish themselves in another Member State. 
The same considerations apply, in relation to Article 48 of the Treaty, 
with regard to rules which impede the freedom of movement of nationals 
of one Member State wishing to engage in gainful employment in another 
Member State. 98 It is true that the transfer rules in issue in the main 
proceedings apply also to transfers of players between clubs belonging 
to different national associations within the same Member State and that 
similar rules govern transfers between clubs belonging to the same national 
association. 99 However, as has been pointed out by Mr Bosman, by the Danish 
Government and by the Advocate General in points 209 and 210 of his Opinion, 
those rules are likely to restrict the freedom of movement of players who 
wish to pursue their activity in another Member State by preventing or 
deterring them from leaving the clubs to which they belong even after the 
expiry of their contracts of employment with those clubs. 100 Since they 
provide that a professional footballer may not pursue his activity with 
a new club established in another Member State unless it has paid his former 
club a transfer fee agreed upon between the two clubs or determined in 
accordance with the regulations of the sporting associations, the said 
rules constitute an obstacle to freedom of movement for workers. 101 As 
the national court has rightly pointed out, that finding is not affected 
by the fact that the transfer rules adopted by UEFA in 1990 stipulate that 
the business relationship between the two clubs is to exert no influence 
on the activity of the player, who is to be free to play for his new club. 
The new club must still pay the fee in issue, under pain of penalties which 
may include its being struck off for debt, which prevents it just as effectively 
from signing up a player from a club in another Member State without paying 
that fee. 102 Nor is that conclusion negated by the case-law of the Court 
cited by URBSFA and UEFA, to the effect that Article 30 of the Treaty does 
not apply to measures which restrict or prohibit certain selling arrangements 
so long as they apply to all relevant traders operating within the national 
territory and so long as they affect in the same manner, in law and in 
fact, the marketing of domestic products and of those from other Member 
States (see Joined Cases C-267/91 and C-268/91 Keck and Mithouard [1993] 
ECR I-6097, paragraph 16). 103 It is sufficient to note that, although 
the rules in issue in the main proceedings apply also to transfers between 
clubs belonging to different national associations within the same Member 
State and are similar to those governing transfers between clubs belonging 
to the same national association, they still directly affect players'access 
to the employment market in other Member States and are thus capable of 
impeding freedom of movement for workers. They cannot, thus, be deemed 
comparable to the rules on selling arrangements for goods which in Keck 
and Mithouard were held to fall outside the ambit of Article 30 of the 
Treaty (see also, with regard to freedom to provide services, Case C-384/93 
Alpine Investments v Minister van Financiën [1995] ECR I-1141, paragraphs 
36 to 38). 104 Consequently, the transfer rules constitute an obstacle 
to freedom of movement for workers prohibited in principle by Article 48 
of the Treaty. It could only be otherwise if those rules pursued a legitimate 
aim compatible with the Treaty and were justified by pressing reasons of 
public interest. But even if that were so, application of those rules would 
still have to be such as to ensure achievement of the aim in question and 
not go beyond what is necessary for that purpose (see, inter alia, the 
judgment in Kraus, cited above, paragraph 32, and Case C-55/94 Gebhard 
[1995] ECR I-0000, paragraph 37). Prior to the Bosman ruling, professional 
clubs in some parts of Europe (but not, for example, in Spain and France) 
were able to prevent players from joining a club in another country even 
if their contracts had expired. In the United Kingdom, Transfer Tribunals 
had been in place since 1981 to resolve disputes over fees between clubs 
when transferring players at the end of their contracts. The Bosman ruling 
meant that players could move to a new club at the end of their contract 
without their old club receiving a fee. Players can now agree a pre-contract 
with another club for a free transfer if the players' contract with their 
existing club has six months or less remaining. The Bosman ruling also 
prohibited domestic football leagues in EU member states, and also UEFA, 
from imposing quotas on foreign players to the extent that they discriminated 
against nationals of EU states. At that time, many leagues placed quotas 
restricting the number of non-nationals allowed on member teams. Also, 
UEFA had a rule that prohibited teams in its competitions, namely the Champions 
League, Cup Winners' Cup and UEFA Cup, from naming more than three "foreign" 
players in their squads for any game. After the ruling, quotas could still 
be imposed, but could only be used to restrict the number of non-EU players 
on each team. Since the ruling came into effect in all of the EU in 1995, 
several notable players in European football have benefited from the ruling.[5] 
In 1996, Edgar Davids became Europe's first high-profile player to benefit 
from the ruling, when he moved from Ajax to AC Milan. In 1999, Steve McManaman 
became the most lucrative transfer at the time in British football, as 
"Britain's first high-profile Bosman departure",[6] when he moved from 
Liverpool to Real Madrid and the deal resulted in McManaman once becoming 
the highest paid British player in history, for the years 1999 through 
2001.[7] Since Davids and McManaman, scores of other notable players became 
able to negotiate deals according to their market value when their contracts 
expired; a trend that continued into the 2000s and beyond. The ruling meant 
that clubs would no longer profit from selling players who they had helped 
to develop if they left at the end of their contracts. The Bosman ruling 
coincided directly with a new era of financial gains in football. In 2005, 
UEFA declared that they were seeking to repair aspects of the ruling, because 
it was believed to be the cause of the increasing rich-poor gap between 
elite and smaller clubs.[8] Bosman confirmed the 'rule of reason' approach 
of the courts used in the important Cassis de Dijon case as not only suitable 
for issues relating to movement of goods within the EU, but also for cases 
concerning the free movement of workers. If free movement is indistinctly 
applied (i.e. not just against foreign nationals) it could be justified 
if... The case also alludes to the fact that Alpine Investments v Minister 
van Financiën provides a similar test for services, and Gebhard v Consiglio 
dell'Ordine degli Avvocati e Procuratori di Milano for establishment. The 
Bosman ruling was considered and distinguished in Lehtonen (2000), a similar 
case which involved a deadline imposed by FIBA after which basketball teams 
could not include players who had played for another team in the same season,
