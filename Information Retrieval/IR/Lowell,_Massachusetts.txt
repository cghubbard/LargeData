Lowell is a city in the US Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Located in Middlesex 
County, Lowell (along with Cambridge) served as a county seat until Massachusetts 
disbanded county government in 1999.[2] With an estimated population of 
109,945 in 2014,[3] it is the fourth-largest city in Massachusetts, and 
the second-largest in the Boston metropolitan statistical area.[4] The 
city is also part of a smaller Massachusetts statistical area called Greater 
Lowell, as well as New England's Merrimack Valley region. Incorporated 
in 1826 to serve as a mill town, Lowell was named after Francis Cabot Lowell, 
a local figure in the Industrial Revolution. The city became known as the 
cradle of the American Industrial Revolution, due to a large series of 
textile mills and factories. Many of the Lowell's historic manufacturing 
sites were later preserved by the National Park Service to create Lowell 
National Historical Park.[5] During the Cambodian genocide, the city took 
in an influx of refugees, leading to a Cambodia Town and America's second-largest 
Cambodian-American population.[6] Lowell is home to two higher education 
schools, the University of Massachusetts Lowell and Middlesex Community 
College. Founded in the 1820s as a planned manufacturing center for textiles, 
Lowell is located along the rapids of the Merrimack River, 25 miles northwest 
of Boston in what was once the farming community of East Chelmsford, Massachusetts. 
The so-called Boston Associates, including Nathan Appleton and Patrick 
Tracy Jackson of the Boston Manufacturing Company, named the new mill town 
after their visionary leader, Francis Cabot Lowell,[7] who had died five 
years before its 1823 incorporation. As Lowell's population grew, it acquired 
land from neighboring towns, and diversified into a full-fledged urban 
center. Many of the men who composed the labor force for constructing the 
canals and factories had immigrated from Ireland, escaping the poverty 
and Potato Famines of the 1830s and 1840s. The mill workers, young single 
women called Mill Girls, generally came from the farm families of New England. 
By the 1850s, Lowell had the largest industrial complex in the United States. 
The textile industry wove cotton produced in the South. In 1860, there 
were more cotton spindles in Lowell than in all eleven states combined 
that would form the Confederacy.[8] Yet the city did not simply finish 
raw materials produced in the American South, but rather became involved 
in the South in another way, too. Many of the coarse cottons produced in 
Lowell eventually returned to the South to clothe enslaved people, and, 
according to historian Sven Beckert, "'Lowell' became the generic term 
slaves used to describe coarse cottons."[9] The city continued to thrive 
as a major industrial center during the 19th century, attracting more migrant 
workers and immigrants to its mills. Next were the Catholic Germans, followed 
by a large influx of French Canadians during the 1870s and 1880s. Later 
waves of immigrants included Portuguese, Polish, Lithuanians, Swedes, Greeks, 
and eastern European Jews. They came to work in Lowell and settled in ethnic 
neighborhoods, with the city's population reaching almost 50% foreign-born 
by 1900.[10] By the time World War I broke out in Europe, the city had 
reached its economic and population peak of over 110,000 people. The Mill 
Cities' manufacturing base declined as companies began to relocate to the 
South in the 1920s.[10] The city fell into hard times, and was even referred 
to as a "depressed industrial desert" by Harper's Magazine in 1931, as 
the Great Depression worsened. At this time, more than one-third of its 
population was "on relief", as only three of its major textile corporations 
remained active.[10] Several years later, the mills were reactivated, making 
parachutes and other military necessities for the World War II effort. 
However, this economic boost was short-lived and the post-war years saw 
the last textile plants close. In the 1970s, Lowell became part of the 
Massachusetts Miracle, being the headquarters of Wang Laboratories. At 
the same time, Lowell became home to thousands of new immigrants, many 
from Cambodia, following the genocide at the hands of the Khmer Rouge. 
The city continued to rebound, but this time, focusing more on culture. 
The former mill district along the river was partially restored and became 
part of the Lowell National Historical Park, founded in the late 1970s. 
At this same time, the Lowell City Development Authority created a Comprehensive 
Master Plan which included recommendations for zoning adaptations within 
the city. The city's original zoning code was adopted in 1926 and was significantly 
revised in 1966 and 2004, with changes included to respond to concerns 
about overdevelopment.[11] Although Wang went bankrupt in 1992, the city 
continued its cultural focus by hosting the nation's largest free folk 
festival, the Lowell Folk Festival, as well as many other cultural events. 
This effort began to attract other companies and families back to the urban 
center. Additional historic manufacturing and commercial buildings were 
adapted as residential units and office space. By the 1990s, Lowell had 
built a new ballpark and arena, which became home to two minor league sports 
teams, the Lowell Devils and Lowell Spinners. The city also began to have 
a larger student population. The University of Massachusetts Lowell and 
Middlesex Community College expanded their programs and enrollment. In 
2002, in lieu of updating the Comprehensive Master Plan, more broad changes 
were recommended so that the land use and development would be consistent 
with the current master plan. The most significant revision to the 1966 
zoning code is the adoption of an inclusion of a transect-based zoning 
code and some aspects of a form-based code style of zoning that emphasizes 
urban design elements as a means to ensure that infill development will 
respect the character of the neighborhood or district in question. By 2004, 
the recommended zoning changes were unanimously adopted by the City Council 
and despite numerous changes to the 2004 Zoning Code, it remains the basic 
framework for resolving zoning issues in Lowell to this day.[12] The Hamilton 
Canal District (HCD) is the first district in Lowell in which regulation 
and development is defined by Form-Based Code (HCD-FBC) and legislated 
by its own guiding framework consistent to the HCD Master Plan.[13] The 
HCD is a major redevelopment project that comprises 13-acres of vacant, 
underutilized land in downtown Lowell abutting former industrial mills. 
Trinity Financial was elected as the Master Developer to recreate this 
district with a vision of making a mixed-use neighborhood. Development 
plans included establishing the HCD as a gateway to downtown Lowell and 
enhanced connectivity to Gallagher Terminal.[14][15] In July 2012, Lowell 
youth led a nationally reported campaign to gain voting privileges for 
17-year-olds in local elections; it would have been the first municipality 
to do so.[16][17] The 'Vote 17' campaign was supported by national researchers; 
its goals were to increase voter turnout, create lifelong civic habits, 
and increase youth input in local matters.[18] The effort was led by youth 
at the United Teen Equality Center in downtown Lowell.[19] Lowell is located 
at 42°38′22″N 71°18′53″W﻿ / ﻿42.63944°N 71.31472°W﻿ / 42.63944; -71.31472 
(42.639444, -71.314722).[20] According to the United States Census Bureau, 
the city has a total area of 14.5 square miles (38 km2).13.8 square miles 
(35.7 km²) of it is land and 0.8 square miles (2.1 km2) of it (5.23%) is 
water. Lowell is located at the confluence of the Merrimack and Concord 
rivers. The Pawtucket Falls, a mile-long set of rapids with a total drop 
in elevation of 32 feet, ends where the two rivers meet. At the top of 
the falls is the Pawtucket Dam, designed to turn the upper Merrimack into 
a millpond, diverted through Lowell's extensive canal system. The Merrimack, 
which flows southerly from Franklin, New Hampshire to Lowell, makes a northeasterly 
turn there before emptying into the Atlantic Ocean at Newburyport, Massachusetts, 
approximately 40 miles downriver from Lowell. It is believed that in prior 
ages, the Merrimack continued south from Lowell to empty into the ocean 
somewhere near Boston. The glacial deposits that redirected the flow of 
the river left the drumlins that dot the city, most notably, Fort Hill 
in the Belvidere neighborhood. Other large hills in Lowell include Lynde 
Hill, also in Belvidere, and Christian Hill, in the easternmost part of 
Centralville at the Dracut town line. The Concord, or Musketaquid (its 
original name), forms from the confluence of the Assabet and Sudbury rivers 
at Concord, Massachusetts. This river flows north into the city, and the 
area around the confluence with the Merrimack was known as Wamesit. Like 
the Merrimack, the Concord, although a much smaller river, has many waterfalls 
and rapids that served as power sources for early industrial purposes, 
some well before the founding of Lowell. Immediately after the Concord 
joins the Merrimack, the Merrimack descends another ten feet in Hunt's 
Falls. There is a ninety-degree bend in the Merrimack partway down the 
Pawtucket Falls. At this point, the river briefly widens and shallows. 
Here, Beaver Brook enters from the north, separating the City's two northern 
neighborhoods, Pawtucketville and Centralville. Entering the Concord River 
from the southwest is River Meadow, or Hale's Brook. This brook flows largely 
in a man-made channel, as the Lowell Connector was built along it. Both 
of these minor streams have limited industrial histories as well. The bordering 
towns (clockwise from north) are Dracut, Tewksbury, Billerica, Chelmsford, 
and Tyngsborough. The border with Billerica is a point in the middle of 
the Concord River where Lowell and Billerica meet Tewksbury and Chelmsford. 
The ten communities designated part of the Lowell Metropolitan area by 
the 2000 US Census are Billerica, Chelmsford, Dracut, Dunstable, Groton, 
Lowell, Pepperell, Tewksbury, Tyngsborough, and Westford, and Pelham, NH. 
See Greater Lowell. Lowell has eight distinct neighborhoods: the Acre, 
Back Central, Belvidere, Centralville, Downtown, Highlands, Pawtucketville, 
and South Lowell.[21] The city also has five ZIP codes: four are geographically 
distinct general ZIP codes, and one (01853) is for post-office boxes only. 
The Centralville neighborhood, ZIP Code 01850, is the northeastern section 
of the city, north of the Merrimack River and east of Beaver Brook. Christian 
Hill is the section of Centralville east of Bridge Street. The Highlands, 
ZIP Code 01851, is the most populated neighborhood, with almost a quarter 
of the city residing here. It is located in the southwestern section of 
the city, bordered to the east by the Lowell Connector and to the north 
by the railroad. Lowellians further distinguish the sections of the Highlands 
as the Upper Highlands and the Lower Highlands, the latter being the area 
closer to downtown. Middlesex Village, Tyler Park, and Drum Hill are in 
this ZIP Code. Downtown, Belvidere, Back Central, and South Lowell make 
up the 01852 ZIP Code, and are the southeastern sections of the city (south 
of the Merrimack River and southeast of the Lowell Connector). Belvidere 
is the mostly residential area south of the Merrimack River, east of the 
Concord River, and north of the Lowell and Lawrence railroad. Belvidere 
Hill is a Historic District along Fairmount Street. Lower Belvidere is 
the section west of Nesmith Street. Back Central is an urban area south 
of downtown, toward the mouth of River Meadow Brook. South Lowell is the 
area south of the railroad and east of the Concord River. Other neighborhoods 
in this ZIP Code are Ayers City, Bleachery, Chapel Hill, the Grove, Oaklands, 
Riverside Park, Swede Village, and Wigginville. Although the use of the 
names of these smaller neighborhoods has been in decline in the past decades, 
there has been recently a reemergence of their use. The ZIP Code 01854 
is the northwestern portion of the city and includes Pawtucketville; the 
University of Massachusetts Lowell; and the Acre. Pawtucketville is where 
Jack Kerouac resided around the area of University Avenue (previously known 
as Moody Street). The north campus of UMass Lowell is in Pawtucketville. 
The older parts of the neighborhood are around University Avenue and Mammoth 
Road, whereas the newer parts are around Varnum Avenue. Middle and elementary 
schools for this area include Wang Middle School, Pawtucketville Memorial, 
McAvinnue Elementary School, and private school Ste Jeanne d'Arc. Pawtucketville 
is the official entrance to the Lowell-Dracut-Tyngsborough State Forest. 
Pawtucketville's Lowell–Dracut–Tyngsborough State Forest is the probable 
site of a Native American tribe, and in the age of the Industrial Revolution 
was a prominent source where granite for canals and factory foundations 
was obtained.[22] According to the 2010 Census,[35] there were 106,519 
people residing in the city. The population density was 7,842.1 people 
per square mile (2,948.8/km²). There were 41,431 housing units at an average 
density of 2,865.5 per square mile (1,106.7/km²). The racial makeup of 
the city was 60.3% White (49.3% Non-Hispanic White[36]), 20.2% Asian American 
(12.5% Cambodian, 2.0% Indian, 1.7% Vietnamese, 1.4% Laotian), 6.8% African 
American, 0.3% Native American, 8.8% from other races, 3.6% from two or 
more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 17.3% of the population. 
The largest Hispanic group was those of Puerto Rican ancestry, comprising 
11.3% of the population. In 2010 there were about 6,000 people of recent 
African heritage living in Lowell.[37] They come from a wide range of countries 
including Liberia, Kenya, and Togo. Between 1990 and 2010, the city's proportion 
of ethnic minorities more than doubled, increasing from 23.5 percent of 
residents to 47.2 percent.[38] In 2010, Lowell had the highest proportion 
of residents of Cambodian origin of any place in the United States, at 
12.5% of the population. Estimates of the total number of Cambodians living 
in the city of Lowell range from 11,000[39] to 25,000-35,000.[40] The Government 
of Cambodia had opened up its third U.S. Consular Office in Lowell, on 
April 27, 2009, with Sovann Ou as current advisor to the Cambodian Embassy.[40] 
The other two are in Long Beach and Seattle, Washington, which also have 
a large community. In 2010, there were 38,470 households, and 23,707 families 
living in Lowell; the average household size was 2.66 and the average family 
size was 3.31. Of those households, 34.9% had children under the age of 
18 living with them, 35.9% were married couples living together, 14.7% 
had a female householder with no husband present, 38.4% were non-families, 
29.4% of all households were made up of individuals, and 8.3% had someone 
living alone who was 65 years of age or older.[35] Lowell has also experienced 
a significant increase in the number of residents between the ages of 50-69 
while the percentages of residents under the age of 15 and over the age 
of 70 decreased.[38] In 2010 the city's population had a median age of 
32.6.[41] The age distribution was 23.7% of the population under the age 
of 18, 13.5% from 18 to 24, 29.4% from 25 to 44, 23.3% from 45 to 64, and 
10.1% who were 65 years of age or older. For every 100 females there were 
98.6 males; while for every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 97.6 
males.[41] The median income for a household in the city was $51,714, according 
to the American Community Survey 5-year estimate ending in 2012.[42] The 
median income for a family was $55,852. Males had a median income of $44,739 
versus $35,472 for females. The per capita income for the city was $22,730. 
About 15.2% of families and 17.5% of individuals were below the poverty 
line, including 24.5% of those under age 18 and 13.2% of those age 65 or 
over.[43] The city of Lowell is primarily policed and protected by the 
Lowell Police Department, secondarily by the Massachusetts State Police, 
the UMass Lowell Police, and the National Park Service. In 2008, the violent 
crime rate for Lowell was 1,126.3 per 100,000 of the population, ranking 
it the 7th most violent city in Massachusetts right ahead of Boston with 
1,104 per 100,000.[44] Lowell's crime rate has dropped tremendously since 
the 1990s Since 1990, Lowell has averaged about 5 homicides per year with 
the highest being 13 homicides in 2006. As of 2008, the crime index rating 
was 446.8. The national average was 320.9. Lowell has been locally notorious 
over the years for being a place of high drug trafficking and gang activity. 
The Lowell Police Department has made positive progress in bringing the 
crime rates down in recent years. In the years from 1994 to 1999, crime 
dropped 50 percent, the highest rate of decrease for any city in America 
with over 100,000 residents.[45] In 2009, Lowell was ranked as the 139th 
most dangerous city of over 75,000 residents in the United States, out 
of 393 communities. Out of Massachusetts cities, nine are larger than 75,000 
residents, and Lowell was fifth most dangerous or safest.[46] For comparison 
Lowell is rated safer than Boston (104 of 393), Providence RI (123), Springfield 
(51), Lynn (120), Fall River (103), and New Bedford (85), but rated more 
dangerous than Cambridge (303), Newton (388), Quincy (312), and Worcester 
(175).[46] Data is from the 2009-2013 American Community Survey 5-Year 
Estimates.[47][48][49] Among the many tourist attractions, Lowell also 
currently has 39 places on the National Register of Historic Places including 
many buildings and structures as part of the Lowell National Historical 
Park. In the early years of the 1840s when the population quickly exceeded 
20,000, Lowell became very active as a cultural center, with the construction 
of the Lowell Museum, the Mechanics Hall, as well as the new City Hall 
used for art exhibits, lectures, and for the performing arts. The Lowell 
Museum was lost in a devastating fire in the early morning of January 31, 
1856,[58] but was quickly rehoused in a new location. The Lowell Art Association 
was founded in 1876, and the new Opera House was built in 1889.[59] Continuing 
to inspire and entertain, Lowell currently has a plethora of artistic exhibitions 
and performances throughout a wide range of venues in the city: Boxing 
has formed an important part of Lowell's working-class culture. The city's 
auditorium hosts the annual New England Golden Gloves tournament, which 
featured fighters such as Rocky Marciano, Sugar Ray Leonard, and Marvin 
Hagler. Micky Ward and Dicky Eklund both began their careers in Lowell, 
the subject of the 2010 film The Fighter.[78] Arthur Ramahlo's West End 
Gym is where many of the city's boxers train.[79] * =former mayor Lowell 
has a council-manager government.[85] There are nine city councilors and 
six school committee members, all elected at large in a non-partisan election. 
The City Council chooses one of its members as mayor, and another as vice-mayor; 
the mayor serves as chair of the council and school committee, and performs 
certain ceremonial duties. As of January 2012, the members of the Lowell 
School Committee are Mayor Edward Kennedy, Jackie Doherty, Stephen Gendron, 
Robert Gignac, Vice Chair Connie Martin, Andre Descoteaux, Robert Hoey. 
The administrative head of the city government is the City Manager, who 
is responsible for all day-to-day operations, functioning within the guidelines 
of City Council policy, and is hired by and serves at the pleasure of the 
City Council as whole. As of April 2014, the City Manager is Kevin J. Murphy.[86] 
Lowell is represented in the Massachusetts General Court by State Representatives 
Thomas Golden, Jr. (16th Middlesex 1995 to Present), David Nangle (17th 
Middlesex 2000 to Present), Rady Mom (18th Middlesex 2014 to Present), 
and by State Senator Eileen Donoghue (1st Middlesex), all of whom are Democrats. 
Federally, the city is part of Massachusetts's 3rd congressional district 
and represented by Democrat Niki Tsongas. The state's senior member of 
the United States Senate is Democrat Elizabeth Warren, elected in 2012. 
The state's junior member of the United States Senate is Democrat Ed Markey, 
elected in 2013. With a rapidly growing student population, Lowell has 
been considered an emerging college town.[88] With approximately 10,000 
students at Middlesex Community College (MCC) and 17,000 students at University 
of Massachusetts Lowell, Lowell is currently home to 27,000 college students. 
UMass Lowell is the second largest state university and fifth largest university 
in Massachusetts, while MCC is the second largest Associate's college in 
Massachusetts.[89] Lowell Public Schools operates district public schools. 
Lowell High School is the district public school. Non-district public schools 
include Greater Lowell Technical High School, Lowell Middlesex Academy 
Charter School,[90] Lowell Community Charter Public School,[91][92] and 
Lowell Collegiate Charter School.[93] The first Lowell public library was 
established in 1844 with 3,500 volumes, and was set up in the first floor 
of the Old City Hall, 226 Merrimack St. In 1872, the expanding collection 
was relocated down the street to the Hosford Building[98] at 134 Merrimack 
St. In 1890-91, the City of Lowell hired local Architect Frederick W. Stickney 
to design the new Lowell City Library, known as "Memorial Hall, in honor 
of the city's men who lost their lives in the American Civil War.[99][100] 
In 1981, the library was renamed the Pollard Memorial Library in memory 
of the late Mayor Samuel S. Pollard. And, in the mid-2000s the century 
old National Historic building underwent a major $8.5m renovation.[101] 
The city also, recently expanded the library system to include the Senior 
Center Branch, located in the City of Lowell Senior Center.[102] In fiscal 
year 2008, the city of Lowell spent 0.36% ($975,845) of its budget on its 
public libraries, which houses 236,000 volumes, and is a part of the Merrimack 
Valley Library Consortium. Currently, circulation of materials averages 
around 250,000 annually, with approximately one-third deriving from the 
children's collection.[99][103] In fiscal year 2009, Lowell spent 0.35% 
($885,377) of its budget on the library—some $8 per person.[104] As of 
2012, the Pollard Library purchases access for its patrons to databases 
owned by: EBSCO Industries; Gale, of Cengage Learning; Heritage Archives, 
Inc.; New England Historic Genealogical Society; OverDrive, Inc.; ProQuest; 
and World Trade Press.[105] The Lydon Library is a part of the University 
of Massachusetts Lowell system, and is located on the North Campus. The 
building is named in honor of President Martin J. Lydon, whose vision expanded 
and renamed the college during his tenure in the 1950s and 1960s.[106] 
Its current collection concentrates on the sciences, engineering, business 
management, social sciences, humanities, and health.[107] The O'Leary Library 
is a part of the University of Massachusetts Lowell system, and is located 
on the South Campus. The building is named in honor of former History Professor 
and then President O'Leary, whose vision helped merge the Lowell colleges 
during his tenure in the 1970s and 1980s.[108] Its current collection concentrates 
on music and art.[109] The Center for Lowell History [special collections 
and archives] is a part of the University of Massachusetts Lowell system, 
established in 1971 to assure the safekeeping, preservation, and availability 
for study and research of materials in unique subject areas, particularly 
those related to the Greater Lowell Area and the University of Massachusetts 
Lowell. Located downtown in the Patrick J. Mogan Cultural Center at 40 
French Street, the Center is committed to the design and implementation 
of historical, educational, and cultural programs that link the university 
and the community in developing an economically strong and multi-culturally 
rich region. Its current collections and archives focus on historic and 
contemporary issues of Lowell (including: industrialization, textile technology, 
immigration, social history, regional history, labor history, women's history, 
and environmental history).[110] The Sun, headquartered in downtown Lowell, 
is a major daily newspaper serving Greater Lowell and southern New Hampshire. 
The newspaper had an average daily circulation of about 42,900 copies in 
2011.[111] Continuing a trend of concentration of newspaper ownership, 
The Sun was sold to newspaper conglomerate MediaNews Group in 1997 after 
119 years of family ownership.[112] Lowell can be reached by automobile 
from Interstate 495, U.S. Route 3, the Lowell Connector, and Massachusetts 
Routes 3A, 38, 110, 113, and 133, all of which run through the city, the 
last one (Route 133) begins at the spot where Routes 110 and 38 branch 
off just south of the Merrimack River. Lowell can also be reached by Interstate 
93 via exit 44B (I-495 south) in nearby Andover, and Interstate 95 via 
the U.S. Route 3 exit (32A) in nearby Burlington.[113] There are six bridges 
crossing the Merrimack River in Lowell, and four crossing the Concord River 
(not including the two for I-495). For public transit, Lowell is served 
by the Lowell Regional Transit Authority, which provides fixed route bus 
services and paratransit services to the city and surrounding area. These 
connect at the Gallagher Transit Terminal to the Lowell Line of the MBTA 
commuter rail system, which connects Lowell to Boston. The terminal is 
also served by several intercity bus lines.[113] The Lowell National Historical 
Park provides a free streetcar shuttle between its various sites in the 
city center, using track formerly used to provide freight access to the 
city's mills. An expansion is currently being planned to expand the system 
to 6.9 miles. The system might be turned over to the Lowell Regional Transit 
Authority after the extension is built. See List of People from Lowell,
