The South Side is part of the city of Chicago, Illinois. It is one of the 
three major parts of the city, the others being the West Side and the North 
Side. Much of it evolved from the city's incorporation of independent townships, 
such as Hyde Park.[1] The city's "sides" have historically been divided 
by the Chicago River and its branches.[2][3] The South Side of Chicago 
was originally defined as all of the city south of the main branch of the 
Chicago River,[4][5] but it now excludes the Loop.[3] The South Side has 
a varied ethnic composition. It has great disparity in income and other 
demographic measures.[6] Although it has a reputation for being poor or 
crime-infested,[7][8] the reality is more varied. The South Side ranges 
from affluent to middle class to working class to impoverished.[9][10] 
Neighborhoods such as Armour Square, Back of the Yards, Bridgeport and 
Pullman host more blue collar residents, while Hyde Park, the Jackson Park 
Highlands District, Kenwood and Beverly feature affluent, middle and upper-middle 
class residents.[11] The South Side boasts a broad array of cultural and 
social offerings, such as professional sports teams, landmark buildings, 
museums, educational institutions, medical institutions and major parts 
of Chicago's parks system. The South Side is served by bus and 'L' train 
via the Chicago Transit Authority and a number of Metra lines.[12] It has 
several interstate and national highways.[13] There is some debate as to 
the South Side's boundaries. The city's address numbering system uses a 
grid demarcating Madison Street as the East-West axis and State Street 
as the North-South axis. Madison is in the middle of the Loop.[14] As a 
result, much of the downtown "Loop" district is south of Madison Street, 
but the Loop is excluded from the definition of the South Side.[3][6][15] 
One definition has the South Side beginning at Roosevelt Road (formerly 
12th Street), at the Loop's southern boundary, with the community area 
known as the Near South Side immediately adjacent. Another definition, 
taking into account that much of the Near South Side is in effect part 
of the commercial district extending in an unbroken line from the South 
Loop, locates the boundary immediately south of 18th Street, where Chinatown 
in the Armour Square district begins.[4] Lake Michigan and the Indiana 
state line provide eastern boundaries. The southern border changed over 
time because of Chicago's evolving city limits; the city limits are now 
at 138th Street (in Riverdale and Hegewisch).[16] Using the Roosevelt Road 
boundary, the South Side is larger than the North and West Sides combined. 
The exact boundaries dividing the Southwest, South and Southeast Sides 
vary by source.[15] If primarily racial lines are followed, the South Side 
can be divided into a White and Hispanic Southwest Side, a largely Black 
South Side and a smaller, more racially diverse Southeast Side centered 
on the East Side (#52) community area and including the adjacent community 
areas of South Chicago (#46), South Deering (#51) and Hegewisch (#55).[17] 
The differing interpretations of the boundary between the South and Southwest 
Sides are due to a lack of a definite natural or artificial boundary.[15] 
One source states that the boundary is Western Avenue or the railroad tracks 
adjacent to Western Avenue.[6] This border extends further south to a former 
railroad right of way paralleling Beverly Avenue and then Interstate 57. 
The Southwest Side of Chicago is a subsection of the South Side comprising 
mainly residential, predominantly white and Hispanic neighborhoods. Architecturally, 
the Southwest Side is distinguished by the tract of Chicago's Bungalow 
Belt, which runs through it.[18] Archer Heights, a Polish enclave along 
Archer Avenue, which leads toward Midway Airport, is located on the Southwest 
Side of the city, as is Beverly-Morgan Park (#72, 75), home to a large 
concentration of Irish Americans. With its factories, steel mills and meat-packing 
plants, the South Side saw a sustained period of immigration which began 
around the 1840s and continued through World War II. Irish, Italian, Polish, 
Lithuanian and Yugoslav immigrants, in particular, settled in neighborhoods 
adjacent to industrial zones.[20] The Illinois Constitution gave rise to 
townships that provided municipal services in 1850. Several settlements 
surrounding Chicago incorporated as townships to better serve their residents. 
Growth and prosperity overburdened many local government systems. In 1889, 
most of these townships determined that they would be better off as part 
of a larger city of Chicago. Lake View, Jefferson, Lake, Hyde Park Townships 
and the Austin portion of Cicero voted to be annexed by the city in the 
June 29, 1889 elections.[1][21][22] After the Civil War freed millions 
of slaves, during Reconstruction black southerners migrated to Chicago 
and caused the black population to nearly quadruple from 4,000 to 15,000 
between 1870 and 1890.[23] In the 20th century, the numbers expanded with 
the Great Migration, as blacks left the agrarian South seeking a better 
future in the industrial North, including the South Side. By 1910 the black 
population in Chicago reached 40,000, with 78% residing in the Black Belt.[23][24] 
Extending 30 blocks, mostly between 31st and 55th Streets,[25] along State 
Street, but only a few blocks wide,[23] it developed into a vibrant community 
dominated by black businesses, music, food and culture.[24] As more blacks 
moved into the South Side, descendants of earlier immigrants, such as ethnic 
Irish, began to move out. Later housing pressures and civic unrest caused 
more whites to leave the area and the city. Older residents of means moved 
to newer suburban housing as new migrants entered the city,[26][27] driving 
further demographic changes. The South Side was racially segregated for 
many decades. During the 1920s and 1930s, housing cases on the South Side 
such as Hansberry v. Lee, 311 U.S. 32 (1940), went to the U. S. Supreme 
Court.[28] The case, which reset the limitations of res judicata, successfully 
challenged racial restrictions in the Washington Park Subdivision by reopening 
them for legal argument.[28] Blacks resided in Bronzeville (around 35th 
and State Streets) in an area called "the Black Belt". After World War 
II they spread across the South Side. The Black Belt, which gave a new 
meaning to the term ghetto, arose from discriminatory real estate practices 
and the threat of violence in nearby ethnic white neighborhoods.[20] In 
the early 1960s,[29] during the tenure of then Mayor Richard J. Daley, 
the construction of the Dan Ryan Expressway created controversy. Many perceived 
the highway's location as an intentional physical barrier between white 
and black neighborhoods,[30] particularly as the Dan Ryan divided Daley's 
own neighborhood, the traditionally Irish Bridgeport, from Bronzeville.[31] 
The economic conditions that led to migration into the South Side were 
not sustained. Mid-century industrial restructuring in meat packing and 
the steel industry cost many jobs. Blacks who became educated and achieved 
middle-class jobs also left after the Civil Rights Movement opened more 
neighborhoods to them. The South Side lost population, leaving a concentration 
of poor families. Many of its businesses and cultural amenities departed. 
Street gangs have been prominent in some South Side neighborhoods for over 
a century, beginning with those of Irish immigrants, who established the 
first territories in a struggle against other European and black migrants. 
Some other neighborhoods stayed relatively safe for a big city. By the 
1960s, gangs such as the Vice Lords began to improve their public image, 
shifting from criminal ventures to operating social programs funded by 
government and private grants. However, in the 1970s gangs returned to 
violence and the drug trade. By 2000, traditionally all-male gangs crossed 
gender lines to include about 20% females.[32] By the 1930s, Chicago boasted 
that over 25% of its residential structures were less than 10 years old, 
many of which were bungalows. These continued to be built in the working-class 
South Side into the 1960s.[33][34] Studio apartments, with Murphy beds 
and kitchenettes or Pullman kitchens, comprised a large part of the housing 
supply during and after the Great Depression, especially in the "Black 
Belt".[35] The South Side had a history of philanthropic subsidized housing 
dating back to 1919.[36] The United States Congress passed the Housing 
Act of 1949 to fund public housing to improve housing for the disadvantaged. 
CHA produced a plan of citywide projects, which was rejected by some of 
the Chicago City Council's white aldermen who opposed public housing in 
their wards. This led to a CHA policy of construction of family housing 
in black residential areas, concentrated on the South and West Sides.[37] 
Gentrification of parts of the Douglas community area has bolstered the 
Black Metropolis-Bronzeville District.[38] Gentrification in various parts 
of the South Side has displaced many black citizens.[39] The South Side 
offers numerous housing cooperatives. Hyde Park has several middle-income 
co-ops and other South Side regions have limited equity (subsidized, price-controlled) 
co-ops.[40] These regions experienced condominium construction and conversion 
in the 1970s and 1980s.[40] In the late 20th century the South Side had 
among the poorest housing conditions in the U.S., but the Chicago Housing 
Authority (CHA) began replacing the old high-rise public housing with mixed-income, 
lower-density developments, part of the city's Plan for Transformation.[41] 
Many of the CHA's massive public housing projects, which lined several 
miles of South State Street, have been demolished. Among the largest were 
the Robert Taylor Homes.[42] The South Side has a population of 752,496, 
of which over 93% are African American .[43][citation needed] Some census 
tracts (4904 in Roseland, 7106 in Auburn Gresham) are 99% black.[44] The 
South Side covers 60% of the city's land area, with a higher ratio of single-family 
homes and larger sections zoned for industry than the rest of the city.[citation 
needed] Hyde Park is home to the University of Chicago, as well as the 
South Side's largest Jewish population, centered on Chicago's oldest synagogue, 
the Chicago Landmark KAM Isaiah Israel.[45] The Southwest Side's ethnic 
makeup also includes the largest concentration of Górals, (Carpathian highlanders) 
outside of Europe; it is the location of the Polish Highlanders Alliance 
of North America.[46] A large Mexican-American population resides in Little 
Village (South Lawndale) and areas south of 99th Street.[47] The South 
Side Irish Parade occurs in the Beverly neighborhood along Western Avenue 
each year on the Sunday before St. Patrick's Day. The parade, which was 
founded in 1979, was at one time said to be the largest Irish neighborhood 
St. Patrick's celebration in the world outside of Dublin, Ireland,[48] 
and was—until being scaled back in 2012—actually larger than Chicago's 
other St. Patrick's Day parade in the Loop. The South Side parade became 
such an event that it was broadcast on Chicago's CBS affiliate.[49][50] 
Following the 2009 parade, organizers stated the group was "not planning 
to stage a parade in its present form".[50] The parade was cancelled in 
2010 and 2011 before being revived with more strict security and law enforcement.[51] 
The Bud Billiken Parade and Picnic, the second largest parade in the U.S. 
and the nation's largest black parade,[52] runs annually on Martin Luther 
King Drive between 31st and 51st Streets in the Bronzeville neighborhood, 
through the main portion of the South Side. Private sector redevelopment 
is occurring rapidly.[citation needed] Neighborhood rehabilitation (and, 
in some cases, gentrification) can also be seen in parts of Washington 
Park, Woodlawn (#42) and Bronzeville, as well as in Bridgeport and McKinley 
Park. Historic Pullman's redevelopment is another example of a work in 
progress. Chinatown is located on the South Side and has seen a surge in 
growth. It has become an increasingly popular destination for both tourists 
and locals alike and is a cornerstone of the city's Chinese community.[citation 
needed][unreliable source?] The South Side offers many outdoor amenities, 
such as miles of public lakefront parks and beaches, as it borders Lake 
Michigan on its eastern side. Today's South Side is mostly a combination 
of the former Hyde Park and Lake Townships. Within these townships many 
had made speculative bets on future prosperity. Much of the South Side 
evolved from these speculative investments. Stephen A. Douglas, Paul Cornell, 
George Pullman and various business entities developed South Chicago real 
estate. The Pullman District, a former company town, Hyde Park Township, 
various platted communities and subdivisions were the results of such efforts.[53] 
The Union Stock Yards, which were once located in the New City community 
area (#61), at one point employed 25,000 people and produced 82 percent 
of US domestic meat production.[54] They were so synonymous with the city 
that for over a century they were part of the lyrics of Frank Sinatra's 
"My Kind of Town", in the phrase: "The Union Stock Yard, Chicago is ..." 
The Union Stock Yard Gate marking the old entrance to stockyards was designated 
a Chicago Landmark on February 24, 1972,[55] and a National Historic Landmark 
on May 29, 1981.[56][57] Other South Side regions have been known for great 
wealth, such as Prairie Avenue. 21st century redevelopment includes One 
Museum Park and One Museum Park West.[58] The South Side accommodates much 
of the city's conference business with various convention centers. The 
current McCormick Place Convention Center is the largest convention center 
in the U.S. and the third largest in the world.[59] Previously, the South 
Side hosted conventions at the Chicago Coliseum and the International Amphitheatre.[6] 
The Ford City Mall and the surrounding shopping district includes several 
big-box retailers. The South Side has been home to some of the most significant 
figures in the history of American politics. These include Richard J. Daley 
and his son, Richard M. Daley; the first black U.S. President, Barack Obama; 
the first female black U.S. Senator, Carol Moseley Braun; and the first 
black presidential candidate to win a primary, Jesse Jackson. Before them, 
Harold Washington, a Congressman and the first black Mayor of Chicago, 
as well as groundbreaking Congressman William L. Dawson, achieved political 
success from the South Side.[60] The University of Chicago is one of the 
world's top universities, with 22 Nobel Prize winners working at the university 
at the time of the award announcement, placing it 3rd among U.S. institutions 
(behind Harvard and Stanford.)[61] At Chicago Pile-1 at the university, 
the first self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction was achieved under the 
direction of Enrico Fermi in the 1940s.[62] Other four-year educational 
institutions there are the Illinois Institute of Technology, St. Xavier 
University, Chicago State University, Illinois College of Optometry and 
Shimer College.[63] The South Side also hosts community colleges such as 
Olive-Harvey College, Kennedy-King College and Richard J. Daley College.[64] 
Chicago Public Schools operates the public schools on the South Side, including 
DuSable High School, Simeon Career Academy, John Hope College Prep High 
School and Phillips Academy High School.[65][66][67][68] The De La Salle 
Institute, located in the Douglas community area across the street from 
Chicago Police Department headquarters, has taught five Chicago Mayors:[69] 
Richard J. Daley, Michael A. Bilandic, Martin H. Kennelly, Frank J. Corr 
and Richard M. Daley. Three of these mayors hail from the South Side's 
Bridgeport community area, which also produced two other Chicago Mayors.[70] 
University of Chicago Lab School, affiliated with the University of Chicago, 
is a private school located there.[63] The South Side is home to many official 
landmarks and other notable buildings and structures.[71][72] It hosts 
three of the four Chicago Registered Historic Places from the original 
October 15, 1966 National Register of Historic Places list (Chicago Pile-1, 
Robie House and Lorado Taft Midway Studios).[73] One Museum Park, which 
is along Roosevelt Road, is the tallest building on the South Side.[74] 
One Museum Park West, which is next door to One Museum Park, is another 
of Chicago's tallest. 1700 East 56th Street in Hyde Park is the tallest 
building south of 13th Street. This neighborhood hosts several other highrises. 
Many landmark buildings are found in the Black Metropolis-Bronzeville District,[75] 
including Powhatan Apartments, Robie House and John J. Glessner House.[76][77][78] 
The South Side has many of Chicago's premier places of worship such as 
Eighth Church of Christ, Scientist, First Church of Deliverance and K.A.M. 
Isaiah Israel Temple.[45][79][80] The South Side has several landmark districts 
including two in Barack Obama's Kenwood community area: Kenwood District, 
North Kenwood District and (partially) Hyde Park-Kenwood Historic District.[81][82] 
The South Side hosts the Museum of Science and Industry,[83] located in 
the Palace of Fine Arts, one of the few remaining buildings from the 1893 
World's Columbian Exposition,[84] which was hosted in South Side. The South 
Side is the residence of other prominent black leaders such as Jesse Jackson 
and Louis Farrakhan. It is also where U.S. Congressmen Jesse Jackson, Jr. 
and Bobby Rush (a former Black Panther leader) serve.[62] The South Side 
has been a place of political controversy. Although the locations of some 
of these notable controversies have not become official landmarks, they 
remain important parts of Chicago history. The Chicago Race Riot of 1919 
was the worst of the approximately 25 riots during the Red Summer of 1919 
and required 6,000 National Guard troops.[85] As mentioned above, segregation 
has been a political theme of controversy for some time on the South Side 
as exhibited by Hansberry v. Lee, 311 U.S. 32 (1940).[86] President Obama 
announced in 2015 that the Barack Obama Presidential Center would be built 
adjacent the University of Chicago campus.[87][88] Both Washington Park 
and Jackson Park were considered and it was announced in July 2016 that 
it would be built in Jackson Park.[89] The South Side is served by mass 
transit as well as roads and highways. Midway International Airport is 
located on the South Side.[90][91] Among the highways through the South 
Side are I-94 (which goes by the names Dan Ryan Expressway, Bishop Ford 
Freeway and Kingery Expressway on the South Side), I-90 (which goes by 
the names Dan Ryan Expressway and Chicago Skyway on the South Side), I-57, 
I-55, U.S. 12, U.S. 20 and U.S. 41.[92] Several Chicago Transit Authority 
(CTA) bus and train lines and Metra train lines link the South Side to 
rest of the city. The South Side is served by the Red, Green and Orange 
lines of the CTA and the Rock Island District, Metra Electric and South 
Shore Metra lines and a few stops on the SouthWest Service Metra line. 
Standard local metropolitan bus service and CTA express service bus routes 
provide service to the Loop.[93] Chicago's African American community, 
concentrated on the South Side, experienced an artistic movement following 
the Harlem Renaissance in New York City. From the 1930s until the 1950s, 
the movement was concentrated in and around the Hyde Park community area. 
Prominent writers and artists included Gwendolyn Brooks, Margaret Burroughs, 
Elizabeth Catlett, Eldzier Cortor, Gordon Parks and Richard Wright.[94] 
Other Chicago Black Renaissance artists included Willard Motley, William 
Attaway, Frank Marshall Davis and Margaret Walker. St. Clair Drake and 
Horace R. Cayton represented the new wave of intellectual expression in 
literature by depicting the culture of the urban ghetto rather than the 
culture of blacks in the South in the monograph Black Metropolis.[23][95] 
In 1961, Burroughs founded the DuSable Museum of African American History. 
By the late 1960s the South Side had a resurgent art movement led by Jim 
Nutt, Gladys Nilsson and Karl Wirsum, who became known as the Chicago Imagists. 
Music in Chicago flourished, with musicians bringing blues and gospel influences 
up from Mississippi and stops along the way and creating a Chicago sound 
in blues and jazz. There was opportunity for independent companies because 
labels with studios in New York City or Los Angeles only kept regional 
distribution offices in Chicago.[96] In 1948, Blues was introduced by Aristocrat 
Records (later Chess Records). Muddy Waters and Chess Records quickly followed 
with Chuck Berry, Bo Diddley, Little Walter, Jimmy Rogers and Howlin' Wolf.[23][97] 
Vee-Jay, the largest black-owned label before Motown Records, was among 
the post-World War II companies that formed "Record Row" on Cottage Grove 
between 47th and 50th Streets. In the 1960s, it was located along South 
Michigan Avenue.[96][97] Rhythm and blues continued to thrive after Record 
Row became the hub of gospelized rhythm and blues, known as soul. Chicago 
continues as a prominent musical city.[97] Many other artists have left 
their mark on Chicago's South Side. These include Upton Sinclair and James 
Farrell via fiction, Archibald Motley, Jr. via painting, Henry Moore and 
Lorado Taft via sculpture and Thomas Dorsey and Mahalia Jackson via gospel 
music.[6] The South Side has numerous art museums and galleries such as 
the DuSable Museum of African American History,[98] National Museum of 
Mexican Art,[99] National Vietnam Veterans Art Museum,[100] and the David 
and Alfred Smart Museum of Art (known as the Smart Museum).[101] In addition, 
cultural centers such as the South Shore Cultural Center, South Side Community 
Art Center, Harold Washington Cultural Center and Hyde Park Art Center 
bring art and culture to the public while fostering opportunities for artists.[102] 
The Bronzeville Children's Museum is the only African American Children's 
museum in the U.S.[103] The Chicago Park District boasts 7,300 acres (30 km2) 
of parkland, 552 parks, thirty-three beaches, nine museums, two world-class 
conservatories, sixteen historic lagoons and ten bird/wildlife gardens.[104] 
Many of these are on the South Side, including several large parks that 
are part of the legacy of Paul Cornell's service on the South Parks Commission. 
He was also the father of Hyde Park. Chicago Park District parks serving 
the South Side include Burnham Park,[105] Jackson Park,[106] Washington 
Park,[107] Midway Plaisance,[108] and Harold Washington Park.[109] Away 
from the Hyde Park area, large parks include the 69-acre (28 ha) McKinley 
Park,[110] 323-acre (131 ha) Marquette Park,[111] the 198-acre (80 ha) 
Calumet Park,[112] and the 173-acre (70 ha) Douglas Park.[113] The parks 
of Chicago foster and host tremendous amounts of athletic activities. The 
South Side has the only Illinois state park within the city of Chicago: 
William W. Powers State Recreation Area. Other opportunities for more "natural" 
recreation are provided by the Cook County Forest Preserve's Dan Ryan Woods 
and the Beaubien Woods on the far south side, along the Little Calumet 
River[114] Various events cause the closure of parts of Lake Shore Drive. 
Although the Chicago Marathon causes many roads to be closed in its route 
that goes as far north as Wrigleyville and to Bronzeville on the South 
Side, it does not cause closures to the drive.[115] However, on the South 
Side, the Chicago Half Marathon necessitates closures[116] and the entire 
drive is closed for Bike The Drive.[117] Beginning in 1905, the White City 
Amusement Park, located on 63rd Street provided a recreational area to 
the citizens of the area.[118][119] Until the early 1920s, a dirigible 
service ran from the park, which was also where Goodyear Blimps were first 
produced, to Grant Park. This service was discontinued after the Wingfoot 
Air Express Crash.[120] A fire destroyed much of the park in the late 1920s 
and more was torn down in the 1930s. The park filed for bankruptcy in 1933 
and 1943. Despite attempts to resurrect the park in 1936 and 1939, by 1946 
all the remaining equipment was auctioned off.[121] The South Side hosts 
two major professional athletic teams: Major League Baseball's Chicago 
White Sox play at U.S. Cellular Field in the Armour Square neighborhood, 
while the National Football League's Chicago Bears play at Soldier Field, 
adjacent to the Museum Campus on the Near South Side.[122][123] Seven other 
teams—three now defunct, two playing in other media markets, one playing 
in a Chicago suburb and one now playing in another part of Chicago—have 
called the South Side home. The defunct Chicago American Giants baseball 
club of the Negro National Leagues played at Schorling's Park from 1911 
to 1940,[6] and then at Comiskey Park until 1952. In football, the Chicago 
Cardinals of the National Football League originally played at Normal Park 
but eventually moved to Comiskey Park in the late 1920s.[6] The Cardinals 
left Chicago for St. Louis in 1960 and in 1988 for Phoenix, where they 
became the Arizona Cardinals.[124] In hockey, the Chicago Cougars of the 
WHA played in the International Amphitheatre, located next to the Union 
Stock Yards, from 1972 until their demise in 1975.[125] Two NBA teams also 
briefly played on the South Side. The Chicago Packers played at the Amphitheatre 
in their inaugural season of 1961–62. The following season, they changed 
their name to the Zephyrs and played at the Chicago Coliseum on the Near 
South Side. The team moved to Baltimore after that season and now plays 
in Washington, D.C. as the Washington Wizards.[126] Chicago's current NBA 
team, the Bulls, played at the Amphitheatre during their first season[127] 
before moving away from the South Side to Chicago Stadium and eventually 
to United Center. The Chicago Fire of Major League Soccer played at Soldier 
Field from 1997 until the team relocated to Bridgeview, a southwest suburb 
adjacent to the city, in 2006[128] and the defunct Chicago Sting soccer 
club played at Soldier Field and Comiskey Park from 1974 to 1984.[129][130] 
The South Side played a prominent role in Chicago's bid for the 2016 Summer 
Olympics. The Olympic Village was planned in the Douglas (#35) community 
area across Lake Shore Drive from Burnham Park.[131] In addition, the Olympic 
Stadium was expected to be located in the Chicago Park District's Washington 
Park located in the Washington Park (#40) community area.[132] Many Olympic 
events were planned for these community areas as well as other parts of 
the South Side.[133] The South Side's gritty reputation often makes its
