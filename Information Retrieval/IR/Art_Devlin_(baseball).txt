Arthur McArthur Devlin (October 16, 1879 – September 18, 1948) was an American 
athlete and coach. He is most known for his Major League Baseball career 
from 1904 to 1913. Devlin attended Georgetown University in Washington, 
D.C., where he played baseball and football. As a senior in 1900, he served 
as the team captain.[1] He was a standout back, and in 1900 was considered 
competitive for the Walter Camp All-American team if it had not been restricted 
to Harvard, Yale, and Princeton players.[2] He served as the head football 
coach at North Carolina A&M, now North Carolina State, for the 1902 and 
1903 seasons. During that time, Devlin's teams compiled a 7–8–2 record 
for a winning percentage of .471.[3] In the early 1920s, Devlin served 
as the head baseball coach at Fordham University.[4][5] In the late 1920s, 
Devlin served as a basketball coach at the Naval Academy.[6] Devlin spent 
most of his 9-year baseball career with the New York Giants, where he started 
as their third baseman in 1904. In 1905 Devlin stole 59 bases, sharing 
the National League lead with Billy Maloney of the Chicago Cubs. Devlin 
was traded to the Boston Braves in 1911, where he played for two years 
as a backup infielder until his retirement in 1913. Devlin had a short 
temper and on one occasion in 1910, jumped into the grandstand at the Polo 
Grounds to beat up a fan who called him a "dog".[7] Art Devlin died in 
Jersey City, New Jersey a month before his 69th birthday. Pound sign (#)
