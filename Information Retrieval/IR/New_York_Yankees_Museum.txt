The New York Yankees Museum is a sports museum located at Yankee Stadium 
on the main level at Gate 6. It is sponsored and presented by Bank of America[1] 
and is dedicated to baseball memorabilia for the New York Yankees.[2] It 
is a key attraction at the stadium, which opened in 2009.[3] When the Yankees 
developed the new stadium, the museum was in its plans. Bronx Borough President 
Adolfo Carrión, Jr. called for the museum to function as a "Cooperstown 
South".[4] A "Ball Wall" features hundreds of balls autographed by past 
and present Yankees, and there are plans to eventually add autographs for 
every living player who has played for the Yankees.[2][5] The Yankees Ball 
Finder, a touch-screen computer in the museum, allows the viewer to look 
for Yankees alphabetically to find the location of their ball on the "Ball 
Wall".[6] The centerpiece of the museum is a tribute to Don Larsen's perfect 
game in the 1956 World Series, with a commemorative home plate in the floor 
and statues of Larsen pitching to Yogi Berra.[2][7] Along with a facsimile 
of a current locker from the Yankees' clubhouse, fans can view the locker 
of the late Thurman Munson, which sat unoccupied in the previous stadium's 
Yankee clubhouse in honor of Munson.[2][8] The final pitcher's plate and 
home plate used at the old stadium was the first at the new stadium; following 
its use, it was moved to the museum.[9] For the 2011 season, the Yankees 
added a showcase of World Series rings.[10] During the season they opened 
an exhibit to honor George Steinbrenner.[11][12] The jersey Derek Jeter 
wore during the game he achieved his 3,000th hit is in the Yankees Museum.[1]
