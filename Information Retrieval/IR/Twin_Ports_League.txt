The Twin Ports League was an American minor baseball league that existed 
for six weeks (May 30 through July 13) during the wartime 1943 season. 
Comprising four teams based in Duluth, Minnesota, and Superior, Wisconsin, 
the TPL was the only league to be designated "Class E"—one level below 
the previously lowest minor league level, Class D—by the National Association 
of Professional Baseball Leagues. According to Baseball America's Encyclopedia

reached Major League Baseball—Ernie Rudolph, who pitched in seven games 
for the 1945 Brooklyn Dodgers. Former major league player Wally Gilbert
