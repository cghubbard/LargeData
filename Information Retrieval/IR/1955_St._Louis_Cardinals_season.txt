The 1955 St. Louis Cardinals season was the team's 74th season in St. Louis, 
Missouri and the 64th season in the National League. The Cardinals went 
68–86 during the season and finished seventh in the National League, 30½ 
games behind the Brooklyn Dodgers. Outfielder Bill Virdon won the Rookie 
of the Year Award this year, batting .281, with 17 home runs and 68 RBIs. 
This was the second consecutive year a Cardinal won the Rookie of the Year 
Award, with Wally Moon winning the previous season. The Cardinals would 
have this occur again in 1985 and 1986, with Vince Coleman and Todd Worrell, 
respectively. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] Infielders Coaches Note:
