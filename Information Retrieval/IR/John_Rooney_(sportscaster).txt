John Rooney (born 1954) is an American sportscaster, currently best known 
for his role as a play-by-play announcer for radio broadcasts of Major 
League Baseball's St. Louis Cardinals. A Richmond, Missouri native,[1] 
Rooney began his broadcast career in the 1970s, doing a number of assignments 
for various radio stations in Missouri and Oklahoma. In 1980, he began 
calling play-by-play for the Oklahoma City 89ers, a minor league baseball 
team. He broadcast for the Louisville Redbirds beginning in 1983. He also 
called Missouri Tigers men's basketball for many years and did Chicago 
Bulls radio from 1989 to 1991. Rooney broadcast for the Minnesota Twins 
in the mid-1980s. In 1988, he joined the Chicago White Sox' television 
crew; the following year, he switched to the team's radio booth, where 
he teamed up with Wayne Hagin (1989 to 1991) and Ed Farmer (1992 to 2005). 
In September 2005, it was announced that Rooney would be leaving the White 
Sox' radio crew after 18 years, due to a salary dispute with their new 
flagship station.[2] His final broadcast with the team was Game 4 of the 
2005 World Series, which ended in the White Sox' first Series championship 
since 1917. The following season, he joined the Cardinals' radio crew on 
KTRS, teaming with former player and veteran broadcaster Mike Shannon. 
The Cardinals won the 2006 World Series, so Rooney has the unusual distinction 
of having called successive championship seasons for different teams, a 
major league first. Rooney worked for CBS Radio from 1984 to 2003, nationally 
broadcasting various sports events including Major League Baseball, the 
National Football League, college football, and college basketball. He 
called Saturday baseball telecasts for Fox Sports from 1996 to 1998, and 
postseason Division Series games for ESPN Radio in 2003 and 2004. In 2004, 
he was inducted into the Missouri Sports Hall of Fame.[3] Rooney continues 
to work the occasional baseball broadcast for ESPN Radio, and is also a 
play-by-play announcer for NFL coverage on the Sports USA Radio Network. 
Rooney typically punctuates team victories with catchphrases, such as "That's 
a Cardinals/White Sox winner!" His signature home run call is "It's a goner!".
