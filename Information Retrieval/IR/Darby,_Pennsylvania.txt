Darby is a borough in Delaware County, Pennsylvania, United States, along 
Darby Creek 5 miles (8.0 km) southwest of downtown Philadelphia. Darby 
was settled about 1654[1] and inhabited by Quakers early in the colonial 
era. Incorporated on March 3, 1852, it had 3,429 residents in 1900, 6,305 
in 1910, 10,334 in 1940, and 10,687 at the 2010 census. The name Darby 
is derived from the English city of Derby (pronounced "Darby"), the county 
town of Derbyshire (pronounced "Darbyshire"), the origin of many early 
settlers.[2] Comedian and actor W.C. Fields was born in 1880 at the Arlington 
Hotel, then located at 832 Main Street. Darby is home to the fifth-oldest 
all-volunteer Fire Department and second-oldest free library in the United
