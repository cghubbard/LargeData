Spring is a census-designated place (CDP) within the extraterritorial jurisdiction 
of Houston in Harris County, Texas, United States, part of the Houston–The 
Woodlands–Sugar Land metropolitan area.[3] The population was 54,298 at 
the 2010 census.[4] While the name "Spring" is applied to a large area 
of northern Harris County and a smaller area of southern Montgomery County, 
the original town of Spring, now known as Old Town Spring, is located at 
the intersection of Spring-Cypress and Hardy roads and encompasses a relatively 
small area of perhaps 1 km2. The large geographic area now known as Spring 
was originally inhabited by the Orcoquiza Native Americans. In 1836, the 
Texas General Council of the Provisional Government placed what is now 
the town of Spring in the Harrisburg municipality. In 1838, William Pierpont 
placed a trading post on Spring Creek. In 1840, the town of Spring had 
153 residents. By the mid-1840s, many German immigrants, including Gus 
Bayer and Carl Wunsche, moved to the area and began farming. People from 
Louisiana and other parts of the post-Civil War Southern U.S. settled in 
Spring. The main cash crops in Spring were sugar cane and cotton; area 
residents also grew vegetables.[3] In 1871, the International and Great 
Northern Railroad, built through Spring, opened, which caused Spring to 
expand. In 1873, Spring received a post office. By 1884, Spring had 150 
residents, two steam saw and grist mills, two cotton gins, three churches, 
and several schools. In 1901–1903, the International-Great Northern Railroad 
opened, connecting Spring to Fort Worth. Spring, now with a roundhouse, 
became a switchyard with 200 rail workers and fourteen trackyards. The 
population increased to 1,200 by 1910. The Spring State Bank opened in 
1912. In 1923, the roundhouse relocated to Houston, causing Spring to enter 
a decline; by 1931, Spring had 300 people. The bank was robbed several 
times in the 1930s; it was stated that Bonnie and Clyde robbed the bank 
once. The bank consolidated with Tomball Bank in 1935.[3] By 1947, Spring 
had 700 residents. In the 1970s, Houston's suburbs began to expand to the 
north, and more subdivisions and residential areas opened in the Spring 
area. Some older houses in the town of Spring received restorations and 
housed shops. The Old Town Spring Association opened in 1980 to promote 
the Old Town Spring shopping area, which consists of the restored houses. 
In 1984 and 1989, the Spring area had 15,000 residents. By 1989, Old Town 
Spring became a tourist area. In 1990, the Spring area had 33,111 residents. 
From 1969 to 1992, the Goodyear airship America was based in Spring from 
its large hangar visible just off Interstate 45. Takeoffs and landings 
were a major attraction and motorists continually pulled off to the interstate's 
shoulders to watch. In 1992 the America was moved to Akron, Ohio,[3] and 
the massive hangar was eventually torn down. In 2016, the hangar's concrete 
foundation was still visible at the intersection of Holzwarth Road and 
Meadow Edge Lane west of Lowe's Home Improvement Center. The 1992 Log Cabin 
Republicans convention was held in Spring. Spring is located at 30°3′15″N

ExxonMobil planned to build a corporate campus in unincorporated Harris 
County along Interstate 45, adjacent to the Spring CDP.[30] According to

Houston and Fairfax County, Virginia into the facility; employees from 
over two dozen locations in Greater Houston are expected to be consolidated 
into the new facility.[30] All areas within the Spring CDP are within the 
Spring Independent School District.[9] Several elementary schools, George 
E. Anderson, Chet Burchett, Pearl M. Hirsch, Mildred I. Jenkins, McNabb, 
Northgate Crossing, Salyers, Lewis Eugene Smith, and John A. Winship, are 
within the CDP and serve sections of the CDP.[31] Marshall Elementary School

Spring Common School District. In 1935 that district and the Harrell Common 
School District merged, forming the Spring Independent School District. 
The Southwell School, the segregated African-American school, served Spring 
from the early 1900s until 1945. In 1932 the Wunsche family donated land 
to the Spring school district, and the Carl Wunsche School, serving middle 
and high school, opened. In 1947 an addition opened and elementary school 
students began to be served by Wunsche.[37] Salyers, opened in 1959 as 
Spring Elementary School, was the first dedicated elementary school of 
Spring ISD.[38] As a result of Salyers opening, elementary school classes 
were removed from Wunsche School. Spring High School opened in 1969, taking 
high school students from Wunsche. As a result, Wunsche became SISD's first 
dedicated middle school.[37] Winship Elementary School's classes began 
in fall 1972; the Winship campus opened on December 15 of that year.[39]

Harris County Public Library (HCPL) operates several library branches. 
HCPL operates the Baldwin Boettcher Branch Library at Mercer Park at 22248 
Aldine Westfield Road, south of the Spring CDP.[54][55] The 10,137-square-foot 
(941.8 m2) branch opened in 1986.[54] It was constructed on donated land. 
It was named after Baldwin Boettcher, a German settler. His descendants 
deeded the homestead to Harris County. The plans stated that the Boettcher 
staff would assist the Mercer Park staff in finding any botanical reference 
books that they or the public need.[56] The Barbara Bush Branch Library 
at Cypress Creek is located in at 6817 Cypresswood Drive in an area with 
a Spring address west of the Spring CDP. The 32,000-square-foot (3,000 m2) 
branch originally opened in June 1976. The Library was upgraded and expanded 
in 2002.[57] Construction of the current library began in the northern 
hemisphere summer of 2000. The current branch was anticipated to house 
over 120,000 books and materials, making it twice as large as the previous 
branch. Jesse Sendejas of the Houston Chronicle said there was "a need 
to provide a more spacious and accommodating facility to Spring and its 
surrounding areas. That was apparent when county voters approved a $15 
million bond for library improvements in November 1997."[58] Harris County 
Precinct 4 operates parks in the Spring CDP. Southwell Park, a 5-acre (2.0 ha) 
facility located at 27419 Nelson Street, includes the B.F. Clark Community
