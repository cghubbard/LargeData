As player As coach Kenneth Jerry Adair (December 17, 1936 – May 31, 1987) 
was a professional baseball player for the Baltimore Orioles, Chicago White 
Sox, Boston Red Sox, and Kansas City Royals.[1] His last name was commonly 
pronounced "A'-dare". Adair was born in Sand Springs, Oklahoma, and graduated 
from Sand Springs High School in Sand Springs, Oklahoma. He played college 
baseball and basketball (under Hank Iba) at Oklahoma State University. 
Adair also played one year in a work/play program for the McPherson (Kansas) 
BJs in the Ban Johnson League. That year McPherson went to the National 
Ban Johnson League tournament finals played in Wichita. He pitched many 
games as well as playing the infield. [2] Adair was signed by the Baltimore 
Orioles out of Oklahoma State University on September 2, 1958 for a $40,000 
bonus. He made his Major League Baseball debut with the club that day against 
the Washington Senators, coming into the game in the bottom of the 8th 
inning as a defensive replacement for shortstop Chuck Oertel. He did not 
get an at bat in the game. Adair's first big league at bat came on September 
5 against the Boston Red Sox. After drawing a walk and scoring in the 8th 
inning, Adair reached base again in the ninth inning on a fielder's choice. 
He picked up his first big league hit (a single to left field) in a 3–2 
Orioles win over the visiting New York Yankees on September 21. That season, 
he hit .105 (2-for-19) in 11 games with the Orioles, primarily playing 
shortstop. He hit .314 (11-for-35) in 12 games in 1959 and went 1-for-5 
(.200) in 3 games in 1960.[3] Adair's first full season in the big leagues 
came in 1961 with the Orioles, hitting .264 with 9 home runs and 37 RBI 
in 133 games. Although the majority of his time was spent at second base, 
he also played some shortstop and third base that year. Once, during the 
1964 season, he was struck in the mouth by a bad throw during the first 
game of a doubleheader with the Detroit Tigers. The resulting laceration 
required 11 stitches, but Adair was back in the park in uniform in time 
to play the entire second game. In 1965, 28-year-old Adair hit .259 with 
7 home runs and a career-high 66 RBI in 157 games with the Orioles. He 
was among American League leaders with 157 games (8th in the AL), 582 at 
bats (10th in the AL), 26 doubles (7th in the AL), 115 singles (10th in 
the AL) and 6 sacrifice flies (8th in the AL). As a result, Adair finished 
17th in the AL MVP vote that was won by Zoilo Versalles of the Minnesota 
Twins. On June 13, 1966, Adair was traded by the Orioles with John Riddle 
to the Chicago White Sox for Eddie Fisher. On June 2, 1967, Adair was traded 
by the White Sox to the Boston Red Sox for Don McMahon and minor leaguer 
Bob Snow. Adair played well down the stretch with the Red Sox, hitting 
.291 with 3 homers and 26 RBI in 89 games, rounding out his season stats 
to .271 with 3 HR and 35 RBI in 117 games. With his pennant push performance 
at the plate, coupled with stellar defensive play, Adair finished 15th 
in the AL MVP balloting. Teammate Carl Yastrzemski won the award that year 
after claiming the elusive triple crown. Adair was taken by the Kansas 
City Royals with the 51st pick of the 1968 MLB expansion draft. In the 
Royals' inaugural season of 1969, the 32-year-old Adair hit .250 with 5 
home runs and 48 RBI in 126 games. In 1970, Adair hit just .148 (4-for-27) 
before being abruptly released on May 5 as he was about to board a plane 
to make a road trip to Baltimore with the team. Adair had spent much of 
spring training that year with a young daughter who had terminal cancer 
and eventually died[4] and claimed the Royals let him go without taking 
the family's problems into consideration. Royals General Manager Cedric 
Tallis defended the team's decision to release Adair saying "We just felt 
he couldn't help the club".[5] While having only a .254 career batting 
average, he was considered a good clutch hitter (Carl Yastrzemski wrote 
in his autobiography Baseball, The Wall, and Me "That man was one of the 
coolest clutch hitters I had seen"). However, his greatest strength was 
his defensive ability. Adair set then-major league records for single-season 
fielding percentage (.994) and fewest errors (5) in 1964, and followed 
that up by leading the league in fielding percentage again in 1965. He 
also set a record for consecutive errorless games by a second baseman (89), 
and consecutive chances handled without an error (458) from July 22, 1964 
through May 6, 1965. In addition, he was considered a "gamer" who would 
often play when injured. After leaving Major League Baseball, Adair played 
in Japan for a year, and later coached for the Oakland Athletics (1972–74) 
and the California Angels (1975), working under his former Oriole teammate 
and manager in Boston Dick Williams. Adair died of liver cancer on May
