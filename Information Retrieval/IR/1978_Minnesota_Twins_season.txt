The 1978 Minnesota Twins finished 73-89, fourth in the American League 
West. On May 7, shortstop Roy Smalley set a Twins record by drawing five 
walks in a 15-9 win over the Baltimore Orioles. Smalley went 1 for 1 and 
scored three times.[7] Third baseman Mike Cubbage, on July 27, became the 
fifth Twin to hit for the cycle (following Rod Carew, 1970; César Tovar, 
1972; Larry Hisle, 1976 and Lyman Bostock, 1976). Cubby went double, homer, 
single, triple off Toronto Blue Jays' pitching. In subsequent years, five 
others will match the feat: Gary Ward, 1980; Kirby Puckett, 1986; Carlos 
Gómez, 2008; Jason Kubel, 2009; and Michael Cuddyer, 2009. 787,878 fans 
attended Twins games, the second lowest total in the American League. Only 
one Twins player made the All-Star Game: first baseman Rod Carew. In that 
game at San Diego Stadium, Carew—in his twelfth consecutive All-Star appearance—performed 
an All-Star first by hitting two triples in the game. Carew won his seventh 
AL batting title[8] with a .333 average, leading the team in hits and runs 
scored. Shortstop Roy Smalley hit 19 HR and collected 77 RBI. Dan Ford 
hit 11 HR and collected 82 RBI. Reliever Mike Marshall was signed in May 
and replaced Tom Johnson and Bill Campbell as manager Gene Mauch's all-purpose 
reliever. Marshall went on to rack up 10 relief wins along with 21 saves. 
Three starters had double digit wins: Dave Goltz (15-10), Roger Erickson 
(14-13), Geoff Zahn (14-14). [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11]
