Kerry Lee Wood (born June 16, 1977) is an American former baseball pitcher 
who played 14 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Chicago Cubs, 
Cleveland Indians, and New York Yankees. Wood first came to prominence 
as a 20-year-old rookie when he recorded 20 strikeouts in a one-hit shutout 
against the Houston Astros, which some have argued may be the greatest 
single-game pitching performance in MLB history.[1][2] The game also made 
Wood the co-holder of the MLB record for strikeouts in a single game (20), 
and earned Wood the nickname Kid K. He was later named the 1998 National 
League Rookie of the Year. Wood would go on to record over 200 strikeouts 
in four out of his first five seasons, with a high of 266 in 2003, and 
holds several MLB strikeout records. In particular, in MLB history, he 
is second only to Randy Johnson in career strikeouts per nine innings pitched. 
Though he struggled with injuries throughout his career, Wood was twice 
named an All-Star.[3] Wood transitioned to a relief pitcher in 2007 due 
to continued struggles with injuries, ultimately reviving his career as 
a closer. During his career Wood was placed on the disabled list 14 times 
in 14 major league seasons, which included missing the entire 1999 season 
due to Tommy John surgery. After a slow start to the 2012 season, Wood 
retired on May 18, 2012.[4] Wood attended MacArthur High School in Irving, 
Texas, for his first three seasons of high school baseball. He continued 
his education at Grand Prairie High School for his final season as a high 
school player.[5] The Chicago Cubs drafted Wood as the fourth overall selection 
in the 1995 Amateur Draft. He spent three years playing in the Minor Leagues. 
His best season in the Minors came in 1996, when he posted a 10-2 record 
for the Daytona Cubs.[6] He also played for the Triple-A Iowa Cubs.[6] 
In 1997, he led all minor league pitchers in walks, with 131.[7] Wood made 
his first appearance in the Major Leagues on April 12, 1998. In his fifth 
career start, on May 6, he threw a one-hit, no walk, 20-strikeout shutout 
against the Houston Astros in Wrigley Field, tying Roger Clemens' record 
for strikeouts in a nine-inning game and breaking Bill Gullickson's single-game 
rookie record of 18 strikeouts in 1980. Wood allowed only two baserunners: 
Ricky Gutiérrez on an infield single and Craig Biggio who was hit by a 
pitch with a count of two strikes and one ball. (Biggio had led the league 
in that category each of the previous three years.) Only seven balls reached 
fair territory. Five were grounders that never left the infield (including 
Gutierrez's hit), one was a short fly along the right field line, and another 
was a fly to center. A foul pop was caught by first baseman Mark Grace 
and the remaining twenty putouts were credited to catcher Sandy Martínez, 
who caught the entire game. Wood had no special advantages – the Astros 
went on to lead the league in on-base-percentage, and all of the regulars 
were in the lineup, including the four who finished the season batting 
over 300. Not surprisingly, the performance garnered a game score of 105 
– the highest number ever calculated for a pitcher in a nine-inning game.[8][9] 
Wood finished the 1998 season with a 13–6 record; despite missing the last 
month of the season with elbow soreness, he easily won the National League 
Rookie of the Year award. He pitched one game in the playoffs, losing against 
the Atlanta Braves.[3] During spring training of 1999, Wood underwent Tommy 
John surgery to repair damage to the ulnar collateral ligament in his right 
elbow, and missed the entire season. Wood returned in 2000 and struggled 
to an 8–7 record, but the following season, he returned to form. In 2001, 
Wood went 12-6 with a 3.36 ERA. The following season, Wood finished 12–11 
with a 3.67 ERA, but perhaps more important was the fact he did not miss 
a start all year long, setting career highs with 213.6 innings pitched 
and 33 starts. He rang up 217 strikeouts in both seasons.[3] In 2003, Wood 
continued to improve, setting career highs with 266 strikeouts, 14 wins 
(as part of a 14–11 record), a 3.20 ERA, and two shutouts. He threw the 
fastest fastball in the majors among starters, averaging 95.4 miles per 
hour.[10] He also walked 100 batters and surrendered 24 home runs, also 
career highs, but was selected as a National League All-Star and helped 
lead the Cubs to the playoffs as one half of "Chicago Heat" along with 
fellow pitcher Mark Prior.[3] Wood earned two wins in the Divisional Series 
against the Atlanta Braves and was the starter in Game 3 of the 2003 National 
League Championship Series, which the Cubs won in extra innings. However, 
the Cubs lost in seven games to the eventual World Series champion Florida 
Marlins. In the decisive Game 7, Wood hit the first home run by a pitcher 
in an NLCS game since another Cub, Rick Sutcliffe, did so in Game 1 in 
1984. However, the Marlins won the game 9-6. Wood was the losing pitcher 
and the Cubs were eliminated.[3] Wood went just 8-9 during the 2004 season 
and was sidelined for nearly two months with a strained triceps.[3] In 
2005, Wood continued to struggle. On August 31, 2005, Wood underwent surgery 
and missed the remainder of the season. During Spring training in 2006, 
Wood suffered several injuries which required an additional surgery (on 
his knee). On May 18, 2006, Wood returned to the Cubs' pitching rotation 
when he started and lost a home game against the Washington Nationals. 
In June, Wood returned to the DL with a sore shoulder. The following month, 
the Cubs announced that Wood had sustained a partially torn rotator cuff 
which was likely to keep him from pitching again for the rest of the year. 
At the end of the 2006 season, the Cubs exercised their option on Wood's 
contract and bought out the remaining $13M.[11] With his long history of 
injuries and inability to stay in the starting rotation, Wood accepted 
the Cubs' offer to return as a relief pitcher in 2007. Wood attempted to 
sustain a regular throwing schedule and appearances during Spring training 
games. However, Wood was placed on the 15-day DL with soreness in his elbow 
and was then moved to the 60-day DL. Wood considered retiring if he continued 
to have pain in his throwing arm.[12] He began playing catch on May 21. 
In his first rehab assignment in Cubs Rookie Ball, he struck out all three 
batters he faced. On July 24, he pitched 1 inning with the Single-A Peoria 
Chiefs, throwing 9 pitches. He made back-to-back appearances on July 26 
and July 27, throwing his fastball between 92-94 mph with no discomfort.[13] 
The Cubs activated Wood from the 60-Day Disabled List on August 3, causing 
many to believe that he would make his actual return on that day.[14] In 
the seventh inning, however, Lou Piniella opted to send Bob Howry to the 
mound, and most fans, eager to see Kerry back on the hill, mistakenly gave 
Howry a standing ovation, only to realize moments later it was actually 
not Wood.[15] Piniella later stated he wanted Wood to receive a "softer 
landing", or in other words, make his return in a game where the Cubs have 
a comfortable lead over their opponents.[16] Wood made his return on August 
5, with the Cubs trailing the New York Mets by four runs.[17] He pitched 
a single inning, during which he allowed one hit, and struck out another 
batter.[17] Piniella praised Wood's performance, stating "He threw the 
ball real good", and "His breaking ball had some bite to it, and he threw 
it up there about 93-94, about what we expected".[18] He remained healthy 
appearing in 22 games and posting a 1-1 record with a solid 3.33 ERA.[3] 
He was generally limited to one inning per outing, not appearing in games 
on back to back days, though he did pitch in both halves of a double header 
on September 15. Wood was a major contributor to the Cubs' NL Central Division 
Championship down the stretch in late September, earning a win and 8 holds. 
Wood filed for free-agency on November 11, 2007, though he suggested that 
he wanted to remain in pinstripes for the 2008 season. Despite multi-year 
offers from other teams, Wood agreed to a one-year, $4.2 million deal with 
the Cubs.[19] Wood, along with Bob Howry and Carlos Mármol, competed for 
the role as the Cubs' closer after Ryan Dempster was moved to the starting 
rotation.[19] After posting a 2.84 ERA in the spring, Wood won the job. 
He recorded his first career save April 3, 2008 with a win over the Brewers.[20][21] 
Wood recorded 34 saves in 39 opportunities, 82 strike-outs and a 1.12 WHIP. 
He was selected to the 2008 MLB All-Star Game as a relief pitcher on July 
6, 2008 along with six other teammates.[22] Wood was placed on the 15-day 
DL on July 24, 2008 with a blister on his right index finger.[23] On November 
13, 2008, after acquiring closer Kevin Gregg from the Florida Marlins, 
Cubs general manager Jim Hendry announced that the organization did not 
plan to re-sign Wood.[24] He had previously requested a multi-year contract 
with the team, but was deferred due to financial reasons. Wood stated he 
wished to remain with the Cubs, but also wanted to continue playing baseball.[25] 
On December 13, 2008, Wood signed a two-year contract with the Cleveland 
Indians.[26] Cubs fans showed their appreciation for him by giving him 
a standing ovation when the Cleveland Indians played at Wrigley Field on 
June 19, 2009.[27] During the 2010 season, Wood was placed on the disabled 
list until May 8 due to an upper back muscle strain.[28] On July 17, 2010, 
Wood was placed on the disabled list for the 14th time in his major league 
career, this time due to a blister on his right index finger.[28] Wood 
was traded from the Cleveland Indians to the New York Yankees on July 31, 
2010 for Andrew Shive, Matt Cusick, and cash.[29] With the Yankees, he 
went 2-0 with a 0.69 ERA in 24 games, including 21 straight scoreless appearances, 
and served as the bridge to Mariano Rivera in the 2010 postseason.[12][30] 
During the 2010 postseason, Wood had a 2.25 ERA appearing in 7 games overall. 
The Yankees won the 2010 ALDS against the Minnesota Twins in 3 games but 
lost to the Texas Rangers in 6 games of the 2010 ALCS. The Yankees announced 
on October 27 that the club had declined to exercise their option for Wood 
for 2011.[31] On December 16, 2010, Wood agreed to a one-year deal worth 
$1.5 million with the Cubs.[32] Wood reportedly turned down offers for 
long-term deals from several other teams worth more money due to his desire 
to keep his family in Chicago.[33] Wood re-signed with the Cubs on January 
13, 2012 for a 1-year, $3 million deal with a team option for 2013.[34] 
On May 18, 2012, Wood retired, striking out the only (and therefore final) 
batter he faced, Dayán Viciedo of the Chicago White Sox. The fans at Wrigley 
Field gave Wood a long standing ovation as his son, Justin, ran out to 
greet him as he exited the field. On his baseball career: "I had fun, I 
had a blast", Wood said. "I wouldn't trade anything in."[35] Wood is married 
to Sarah Pates of Waukegan, Illinois.[36] The couple has one son, Justin, 
and two daughters, Katie and Charlotte.[37] Until 2008, the family resided 
in the Old Town neighborhood of Chicago.[38] While playing for the Cubs, 
the Woods hosted a celebrity bowling tournament called Kerry Wood's Strike 
Zone, which also featured a silent auction that raised over two million 
dollars.[39][40] On June 24, 2013, while paddleboarding in waters near 
Chicago, Wood happened upon a corpse floating in Belmont Harbor. He immediately 
reported the discovery to local authorities, who determined the deceased 
to be a 40-year-old man who had been reported missing by a North Side nursing
