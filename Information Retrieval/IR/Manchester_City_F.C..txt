Manchester City Football Club is a football club in Manchester, England. 
Founded in 1880 as St. Mark's (West Gorton), they became Ardwick Association 
Football Club in 1887 and Manchester City in 1894. The club moved to the 
City of Manchester Stadium in 2003, having played at Maine Road since 1923. 
The club's most successful period was in the late 1960s and early 1970s 
when they won the League Championship, FA Cup, League Cup and European 
Cup Winners' Cup under the management team of Joe Mercer and Malcolm Allison. 
After losing the 1981 FA Cup Final, the club went through a period of decline, 
culminating in relegation to the third tier of English football for the 
only time in their history in 1998. Having regained their Premier League 
status in the early 2000s, the club was purchased in 2008 by Abu Dhabi 
United Group and has become one of the wealthiest in the world. Since 2011 
the club have won six major honours, including the Premier League in 2012 
and 2014. By 2014–15, Manchester City had the sixth-highest revenue in 
the footballing world with an annual revenue of €463.5 million.[3] In 2016, 
Forbes magazine estimated they were the world's sixth most valuable football 
club, worth $1.92 billion.[4] City gained their first honours by winning 
the Second Division in 1899; with it came promotion to the highest level 
in English football, the First Division. They went on to claim their first 
major honour on 23 April 1904, beating Bolton Wanderers 1–0 at Crystal 
Palace to win the FA Cup; City narrowly missed out on a League and Cup 
double that season after finishing runners-up in the League but City became 
the first club in Manchester to win a major honour.[6] In the seasons following 
the FA Cup triumph, the club was dogged by allegations of financial irregularities, 
culminating in the suspension of seventeen players in 1906, including captain 
Billy Meredith, who subsequently moved across town to Manchester United.[7] 
A fire at Hyde Road destroyed the main stand in 1920, and in 1923 the club 
moved to their new purpose-built stadium at Maine Road in Moss Side.[8] 
In the 1930s, Manchester City reached two consecutive FA Cup finals, losing 
to Everton in 1933, before claiming the Cup by beating Portsmouth in 1934.[9] 
During the 1934 cup run, Manchester City broke the record for the highest 
home attendance of any club in English football history, as 84,569 fans 
packed Maine Road for a sixth round FA Cup tie against Stoke City in 1934 
– a record which still stands to this day.[10] The club won the First Division 
title for the first time in 1937, but were relegated the following season, 
despite scoring more goals than any other team in the division.[11] Twenty 
years later, a City team inspired by a tactical system known as the Revie 
Plan reached consecutive FA Cup finals again, in 1955 and 1956; just as 
in the 1930s, they lost the first one, to Newcastle United, and won the 
second. The 1956 final, in which Manchester City beat Birmingham City 3–1, 
is one of the most famous finals of all-time, and is remembered for City 
goalkeeper Bert Trautmann continuing to play on after unknowingly breaking 
his neck.[12] After relegation to the Second Division in 1963, the future 
looked bleak with a record low home attendance of 8,015 against Swindon 
Town in January 1965.[13] In the summer of 1965, the management team of 
Joe Mercer and Malcolm Allison was appointed. In the first season under 
Mercer, City won the Second Division title and made important signings 
in Mike Summerbee and Colin Bell.[14] Two seasons later, in 1967–68, Manchester 
City claimed the League Championship for the second time, clinching the 
title on the final day of the season with a 4–3 win at Newcastle United 
and beating their close neighbours Manchester United into second place.[15] 
Further trophies followed: City won the FA Cup in 1969, before achieving 
European success by winning the European Cup Winners' Cup in 1970, beating 
Górnik Zabrze 2–1 in Vienna.[16] City also won the League Cup that season, 
becoming the second English team to win a European trophy and a domestic 
trophy in the same season. The club continued to challenge for honours 
throughout the 1970s, finishing one point behind the league champions on 
two occasions and reaching the final of the 1974 League Cup.[17] One of 
the matches from this period that is most fondly remembered by supporters 
of Manchester City is the final match of the 1973–74 season against arch-rivals 
Manchester United, who needed to win to have any hope of avoiding relegation. 
Former United player Denis Law scored with a backheel to give City a 1–0 
win at Old Trafford and confirm the relegation of their rivals.[18][19] 
The final trophy of the club's most successful period was won in 1976, 
when Newcastle United were beaten 2–1 in the League Cup final. A long period 
of decline followed the success of the 1960s and 1970s. Malcolm Allison 
rejoined the club to become manager for the second time in 1979, but squandered 
large sums of money on unsuccessful signings, such as Steve Daley.[20] 
A succession of managers then followed – seven in the 1980s alone. Under 
John Bond, City reached the 1981 FA Cup final but lost in a replay to Tottenham 
Hotspur. The club were twice relegated from the top flight in the 1980s 
(in 1983 and 1987), but returned to the top flight again in 1989 and finished 
fifth in 1991 and 1992 under the management of Peter Reid.[21] However, 
this was only a temporary respite, and following Reid's departure Manchester 
City's fortunes continued to fade. City were co-founders of the Premier 
League upon its creation in 1992, but after finishing ninth in its first 
season they endured three seasons of struggle before being relegated in 
1996. After two seasons in Division One, City fell to the lowest point 
in their history, becoming the second ever European trophy winners to be 
relegated to their country's third league tier, after 1. FC Magdeburg of 
Germany. After relegation, the club underwent off-the-field upheaval, with 
new chairman David Bernstein introducing greater fiscal discipline.[22] 
Under manager Joe Royle, City were promoted at the first attempt, achieved 
in dramatic fashion in a play-off against Gillingham. A second successive 
promotion saw City return to the top division, but this proved to have 
been a step too far for the recovering club, and in 2001 City were relegated 
once more. Kevin Keegan replaced Royle as manager in the close season, 
and achieved an immediate return to the top division as the club won the 
2001–02 Division One championship, breaking club records for the number 
of points gained and goals scored in a season in the process.[23] The 2002–03 
season was the last at Maine Road, and included a 3–1 derby victory over 
rivals Manchester United, ending a run of 13 years without a derby win.[24] 
City also qualified for European competition for the first time in 25 years. 
In the 2003 close season the club moved to the new City of Manchester Stadium. 
The first four seasons at the stadium all resulted in mid-table finishes. 
Former England manager Sven-Göran Eriksson became the club's first manager 
from overseas when appointed in 2007.[25] After a bright start performances 
faded in the second half of the season, and Eriksson was sacked in June 
2008.[26] Eriksson was replaced by Mark Hughes two days later on 4 June 
2008.[27] By 2008, the club was in a financially precarious position. Thaksin 
Shinawatra had taken control of the club a year before, but his political 
travails saw his assets frozen.[28] Then, in August 2008, the club was 
purchased by the Abu Dhabi United Group. The takeover was immediately followed 
by a flurry of bids for high-profile players; the club broke the British 
transfer record by signing Brazilian international Robinho from Real Madrid 
for £32.5 million.[29] Performances were not a huge improvement on the 
previous season despite the influx of money however, with the team finishing 
tenth, although they did well to reach the quarter-finals of the UEFA Cup. 
During the summer of 2009, the club took transfer spending to an unprecedented 
level, with an outlay of over £100 million on players Gareth Barry, Roque 
Santa Cruz, Kolo Touré, Emmanuel Adebayor, Carlos Tevez and Joleon Lescott.[30] 
In December 2009, Mark Hughes – who had been hired shortly before the change 
in ownership but was originally retained by the new board – was replaced 
as manager by Roberto Mancini.[31] City finished the season in fifth position 
in the Premier League, narrowly missing out on a place in the Champions 
League, and competed in the UEFA Europa League in season 2010–11. Continued 
investment in players followed in successive seasons, and results began 
to match the upturn in player quality. City reached the 2011 FA Cup Final, 
their first major final in over thirty years, after defeating derby rivals 
Manchester United in the semi-final,[32] the first time they had knocked 
their rival out of a cup competition since 1975. They defeated Stoke City 
1–0 in the final, securing their fifth FA Cup, the club's first major trophy 
since winning the 1976 League Cup. In the same week, the club qualified 
for the UEFA Champions League for the first time since 1968 with a 1–0 
Premier League win over Tottenham Hotspur.[33] On the last day of the 2010–11 
season, City passed Arsenal for third place in the Premier League, thereby 
securing qualification directly into the Champions League group stage. 
Strong performances continued to follow in the 2011–12 season, with the 
club beginning the following season in commanding form, including beating 
Tottenham 5–1 at White Hart Lane and humbling Manchester United by a 6–1 
scoreline in United's own stadium. Although the strong form waned halfway 
through the season, and City at one point fell eight points behind their 
arch rivals with only six games left to play, a slump by United allowed 
the blue side of Manchester to draw back level with two games to go, setting 
up a thrilling finale to the season with both teams going into the last 
day equal on points. Despite City only needing a home win against a team 
in the relegation zone, they fell a goal behind by the end of normal time, 
leading some of United's players to finish their game celebrating in the 
belief that they had won the league. Two goals in injury time – including 
one scored almost five minutes after normal time had elapsed – resulted 
in an almost-literal last-minute title victory, City's first in 44 years, 
and became only the fifth team to win the Premier League since its creation 
in 1992. In the aftermath that followed, the event was described by media 
sources from the UK and around the world as the greatest moment in Premier 
League history.[34][35] The game was also notable for former player Joey 
Barton's sending off, where he committed three separate red card-able incidents 
on three different players in the space of only a few seconds, resulting 
in a 12-game ban.[36] The following season City failed to capitalise on 
the gains made in the first two full seasons of Mancini's reign. While 
City rarely seemed likely to drop below second in the table, they posed 
little title challenge all season. In the UEFA Champions League, the club 
was eliminated at the group stage for a second successive season, while 
a second FA Cup final in three seasons ended in a 1–0 defeat to relegated 
Wigan Athletic.[37] Mancini was dismissed two days later, ostensibly as 
he had failed to reach his targets for the season,[38] but BBC Sports Editor 
David Bond reported that he had been sacked for his poor communication 
and relationships with players and executives.[39] In his place was appointed 
the Chilean Manuel Pellegrini.[40] In Pellegrini's first season, City won 
the League Cup[41] and regained the Premier League title on the last day 
of the season.[42] L1 = Level 1 of the football league system; L2 = Level

Manchester City's home colours are sky blue and white. Traditional away 
kit colours have been either maroon or (from the 1960s) red and black; 
however, in recent years several different colours have been used. The 
origins of the club's home colours are unclear, but there is evidence that 
the club has worn blue since 1892 or earlier. A booklet entitled Famous 
Football Clubs – Manchester City published in the 1940s indicates that 
West Gorton (St. Marks) originally played in scarlet and black, and reports 
dating from 1884 describe the team wearing black jerseys bearing a white 
cross, showing the club's origins as a church side.[43] The red and black 
away colours used infrequently yet recurrently come from former assistant 
manager Malcolm Allison, who believed that adopting the colours of A.C. 
Milan would inspire City to glory.[44] Allison's theory worked, with City 
winning the 1969 FA Cup Final, 1970 League Cup Final and the 1970 European 
Cup Winners' Cup Final in red and black stripes as opposed to the club's 
home kit of sky blue. City have previously worn three other badges on their 
shirts, prior to their current badge which was implemented in 2016. The 
first, introduced in 1970, was based on designs which had been used on 
official club documentation since the mid-1960s. It consisted of a circular 
badge which used the same shield as the current badge, inside a circle 
bearing the name of the club. In 1972, this was replaced by a variation 
which replaced the lower half of the shield with the red rose of Lancashire. 
On occasions when Manchester City plays in a major cup final, the usual 
badge has not been used; instead shirts bearing a badge of the arms of 
the City of Manchester are used, as a symbol of pride in representing the 
city of Manchester at a major event. This practice originates from a time 
when the players' shirts did not normally bear a badge of any kind, but 
has continued throughout the history of the club.[45] For the 2011 FA Cup 
Final, City used the usual badge with a special legend, but the Manchester 
coat of arms was included as a small monochrome logo in the numbers on 
the back of players' shirts.[46] A new club badge was adopted in 1997, 
as a result of the previous badge being ineligible for registration as 
a trademark. This badge was based on the arms of the city of Manchester, 
and consisted of a shield in front of a golden eagle. The eagle is an old 
heraldic symbol of the city of Manchester; a golden eagle was added to 
the city's badge in 1958 (but has since been removed), representing the 
growing aviation industry. The shield features a ship on its upper half 
representing the Manchester Ship Canal, and three diagonal stripes in the 
lower half symbolise the city's three rivers – the Irwell, the Irk and 
the Medlock. The bottom of the badge bears the motto Superbia in Proelio, 
which translates as Pride in Battle in Latin. Above the eagle and shield 
are three stars, which are purely decorative. On 15 October 2015, following 
years of criticism from the fans over the design of the 1997 badge,[47] 
the club announced that they intended to carry out a fan consultation on 
whether to disregard the club badge and institute a new design.[47] After 
the consultation, the club announced in late November 2015 that the current 
club badge would be replaced in due course by a new version which would 
be designed in the style of the older, circular variants.[48] A design 
purporting to be the new badge was unintentionally leaked two days early 
prior to the official unveiling on 26 December 2015 by the IPO when the 
design was trademarked on 22 December.[49] The new design was officially 
unveiled at the club's home match on 26 December against Sunderland.[50] 
Manchester City's shirts have been sponsored by Etihad Airways since 2009. 
Previous sponsors have been Saab (1982–84), Philips (1984–87), Brother 
(1987–99), Eidos (1999–2002), First Advice (2002–04), and Thomas Cook (2004–07). 
Their kits have been manufactured by Nike since 2013. Prior manufacturers 
have been Umbro (1974–97, 2009–13), Kappa (1997–99), Le Coq Sportif (1999–2003, 
2007–09), and Reebok (2003–07). Note: Flags indicate national team as defined

City has a large fanbase in relation to its comparative lack of success 
on the pitch. Since moving to the City of Manchester Stadium, Manchester 
City's average attendances have been in the top six in England,[64] usually 
in excess of 40,000. Even in the late 1990s, when the club were relegated 
twice in three seasons and playing in the third tier of English football 
(then Division Two, now Football League One), home attendances were in 
the region of 30,000, compared to an average for the division of fewer 
than 8,000.[65] Research carried out by Manchester City in 2005 estimates 
a fanbase of 886,000 in the United Kingdom and a total in excess of 2 million 
worldwide, although since the purchase of the club by Sheikh Mansour and 
the club's recent trophies, that figure has ballooned to many times that 
size.[66] Manchester City's officially recognised supporters club is the 
Manchester City FC Supporters Club (1949), formed from a merger of two 
existing organisations in 2010: the Official Supporters Club (OSC) and 
the Centenary Supporters Association (CSA).[67] There have been several 
fanzines published by supporters; the longest running is King of the Kippax 
and it is the only one still published.[68] The City fans' song of choice 
is a rendition of "Blue Moon", which despite its melancholic theme is belted 
out with gusto as though it were a heroic anthem. City supporters tend 
to believe that unpredictability is an inherent trait of their team, and 
label unexpected results "typical City".[69][70] Events that fans regard 
as "typical City" include City's being the only reigning English champions 
ever to be relegated (in 1938), the only team to score and concede over 
100 goals in the same season (1957–58),[71] or the more recent example 
that City were the only team to beat Chelsea in the 2004–05 Premier League, 
yet in the same season City were knocked out of the FA Cup by Oldham Athletic, 
a team two divisions lower. Manchester City's biggest rivalry is with neighbours 
Manchester United, against whom they contest the Manchester derby. Before 
the Second World War, when travel to away games was rare, many Mancunian 
football fans regularly watched both teams even if considering themselves 
"supporters" of only one. This practice continued into the early 1960s 
but as travel became easier, and the cost of entry to matches rose, watching 
both teams became unusual and the rivalry intensified. A common stereotype 
is that City fans come from Manchester proper, while United fans come from 
elsewhere. A 2002 report by a researcher at Manchester Metropolitan University 
found that while it was true that a higher proportion of City season ticket 
holders came from Manchester postcode areas (40% compared to United's 29%), 
there were more United season ticket holders, the lower percentage being 
due to United's higher overall number of season ticket holders (27,667 
compared to City's 16,481); not highlighted in the report was that within 
the City of Manchester itself, there were more City season ticket holders 
(approximately 4 for every 3 United). The report noted that since the compiling 
of data in 2001, the number of both City and United season ticket holders 
had risen; expansion of United's ground and City's move to the City of 
Manchester Stadium have caused season ticket sales to increase further.[72] 
In the late 1980s, City fans started a craze of bringing inflatable objects 
to matches, primarily oversized bananas. One disputed explanation for the 
craze is that in a match against West Bromwich Albion chants from fans 
calling for the introduction of Imre Varadi as a substitute mutated into 
"Imre Banana". Terraces packed with inflatable-waving supporters became 
a frequent sight in the 1988–89 season as the craze spread to other clubs 
(inflatable fish were seen at Grimsby Town), with the phenomenon reaching 
a peak at City's match at Stoke City on 26 December 1988, a match declared 
by fanzines as a fancy dress party.[73] In 2010, City supporters adopted 
an exuberant dance, dubbed The Poznań, from fans of Polish club Lech Poznań.[74] 
The holding company of Manchester City F.C., Manchester City Limited, is 
a private limited company, with approximately 54 million shares in issue. 
The club has been in private hands since 2007, when the major shareholders 
agreed to sell their holdings to UK Sports Investments Limited (UKSIL), 
a company controlled by former Thailand prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra. 
UKSIL then made a formal offer to buy the shares held by several thousand 
small shareholders. Prior to the Thaksin takeover, the club was listed 
on the specialist independent equity market PLUS (formerly OFEX),[75] where 
it had been listed since 1995. On 6 July 2007, having acquired 75% of the 
shares, Thaksin de-listed the club and re-registered it as a private company.[76] 
By August UKSIL had acquired over 90% of the shares, and exercised its 
rights under the Companies Act to "squeeze out" the remaining shareholders, 
and acquire the entire shareholding. Thaksin Shinawatra became chairman 
of the club and two of Thaksin's children, Pintongta and Oak Chinnawat 
also became directors. Former chairman John Wardle stayed on the board 
for a year, but resigned in July 2008 following Nike executive Garry Cook's 
appointment as executive chairman in May.[77] The club made a pre-tax loss 
of £11m in the year ending 31 May 2007, the final year for which accounts 
were published as a public company.[78] Thaksin's purchase prompted a period 
of transfer spending at the club,[79] spending in around £30 million,[80] 
whereas over the previous few seasons net spending had been among the lowest 
in the division. A year later, this investment was itself dwarfed by larger 
sums. On 1 September 2008, Abu Dhabi-based Abu Dhabi United Group Investment 
and Development Limited completed a takeover of Manchester City. The deal, 
worth a reported £200 million, was announced on the morning of 1 September. 
It sparked various transfer "deadline-day" rumours and bids such as the 
club's attempt to gazump Manchester United's protracted bid to sign Dimitar 
Berbatov from Tottenham Hotspur for a fee in excess of £30 million.[81][82] 
Minutes before the transfer window closed, the club signed Robinho from 
Real Madrid for a British record transfer fee of £32.5 million.[83] The 
wealth of the new owners meant that in the summer of 2009, the club was 
able to finance the purchase of several experienced international players 
prior to the new season, spending more than any other club in the Premier 
League.[84] Created in the 2013–14 season to manage the global footballing 
interests of Abu Dhabi United Group, the City Football Group is an umbrella 
corporation owning stakes in a network of global clubs for the purposes 
of resource sharing, academy networking and marketing. Through the City 
Football Group, City owns stakes in a number of clubs: Manchester City's 
stadium is the City of Manchester Stadium, also known as Eastlands and 
the Etihad Stadium since July 2011 because of sponsorship commitments. 
The stadium is situated in East Manchester and is part of a 200-year operating 
lease from Manchester City Council after the 2002 Commonwealth Games. The 
stadium has been City's home since the end of the 2002–03 season, when 
the club moved from Maine Road.[88] Before moving to the stadium, Manchester 
City spent in excess of £30 million to convert it to football use. The 
field of play was lowered by several metres, adding another tier of seating 
around the entire pitch. A new North Stand was also built.[89] The inaugural 
match at the new stadium was a 2–1 win over FC Barcelona in a friendly 
match.[90] In August 2015, a 7,000 seat third tier on the South Stand was 
completed, in time for the start of the 2015–16 football season. Current 
capacity stands at 55,097. A North Stand third tier has planning approval 
and work on it is expected to begin by 2017, increasing capacity to around 
61,000.[91] Manchester City have used several grounds during their history: 
after playing home matches at five stadiums between 1880 and 1887, the 
club settled at Hyde Road Football Stadium, its home for 36 years.[92] 
After a fire destroyed the Main Stand in 1920, the club started to seek 
a new site and moved to the 84-000 capacity Maine Road three years later. 
Maine Road, nicknamed the "Wembley of the North" by its designers, hosted 
the largest-ever crowd at an English club ground when 84,569 attended an 
FA Cup tie against Stoke City on 3 March 1934.[93] Though Maine Road was 
redeveloped several times over its 80-year lifespan, by 1995 its capacity 
was restricted to 32,000, prompting the search for a new ground which culminated
