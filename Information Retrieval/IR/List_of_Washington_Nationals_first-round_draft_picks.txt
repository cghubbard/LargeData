The Washington Nationals are a Major League Baseball (MLB) franchise based 
in Washington, D.C. Prior to 2005, they were known as the Montreal Expos 
and based in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. The Nationals play in the National 
League East division. Since the institution of MLB's Rule 4 Draft, the 
Expos/Nationals have selected 67 players in the first round. Officially 
known as the "First-Year Player Draft",[2] the Rule 4 Draft is MLB's primary 
mechanism for assigning amateur baseball players from high schools, colleges, 
and other amateur baseball clubs to its teams. The draft order is determined 
based on the previous season's standings, with the team possessing the 
worst record receiving the first pick.[2] In addition, teams which lost 
free agents in the previous off-season may be awarded compensatory or supplementary 
picks.[3] The First-Year Player Draft is unrelated to the 1968 expansion 
draft in which the Expos initially filled their roster. Of the 67 players 
picked in the first round by Montreal or Washington, 33 have been pitchers, 
the most of any position; 23 of them were right-handed, while 10 were left-handed. 
Thirteen outfielders, nine shortstops, five third basemen, four catchers, 
and three first basemen were also taken. The team has never drafted a player 
at second base.[4] Thirteen of the players came from high schools or universities 
in the state of California, and Florida follows with eight players.[4] 
They have also drafted two players from Puerto Rico: Josue Estrada (1993) 
and Hiram Bocachica (1994).[4] None of the Expos' or Nationals' first-round 
picks have won a World Series championship with the franchise (which has 
never won a World Series championship), and no pick has been elected to 
the Hall of Fame. None of these picks have won the MLB Rookie of the Year 
award, although Bill Gullickson (1977), Delino DeShields (1987), and Brad 
Wilkerson (1998) placed second in the voting in 1980,[5] 1990,[6] and 2002,[7] 
respectively. The Nationals had the first overall selection twice in the 
draft, which they used on Stephen Strasburg (2009) and Bryce Harper (2010).[4] 
Condredge Holloway (1971) was drafted as a shortstop, but ended up becoming 
a quarterback in the Canadian Football League, and was inducted into the 
Canadian Football Hall of Fame in 1999.[8] The Expos/Nationals have made 
19 selections in the supplemental round of the draft and six compensatory 
picks since their entry into the league in 1969.[4] These additional picks 
are provided when a team loses a particularly valuable free agent in the 
previous off-season,[3][9][V] or, more recently, if a team fails to sign 
a draft pick from the previous year.[10] The Expos/Nationals have failed 
to sign four of their first-round picks: Condredge Holloway (1971), Charles 
Johnson (1989), John Patterson (1996), and Aaron Crow (2008). The Expos 
received no compensation for failing to sign Holloway, but received the 
40th pick in 1990, the 52nd pick in 1997, and the 10th pick in 2009 for
