William Edward Kamm (February 2, 1900 – December 21, 1988) was an American 
professional baseball player.[1] He played as a third baseman in Major 
League Baseball from 1923 to 1935.[1] Kamm played most of his career for 
the Chicago White Sox before finishing his playing days with the Cleveland 
Indians.[1] He was the dominant defensive third baseman in the American 
League for most of his career.[2] Born in San Francisco, California, Kamm 
was the first player in major league baseball history to be contracted 
from the minor leagues for $100,000.[2] He made his major league debut 
with the Chicago White Sox in 1923, hitting 39 doubles with 89 runs batted 
in.[1] He increased his runs batted in total to 93 in 1924, and led American 
League third basemen in putouts, assists and fielding percentage.[3] Kamm 
had his best season offensively in 1928 when he posted a .308 batting average 
along with 84 runs batted in. He finished fifth in the 1928 American League 
Most Valuable Player Award voting, despite the fact that the White Sox 
finished the year in fifth place.[4] He was traded to the Cleveland Indians 
in the middle of the 1931 season, where he continued to perform well in 
the field.[5] In 1933, Kamm set a single-season record for third basemen 
with a .984 fielding percentage, which stood for fourteen years until it 
was surpassed by Hank Majeski in 1947.[6] He retired as a player after 
the 1935 season. Kamm was considered a master of the hidden ball trick.[7] 
On April 30, 1929, in a game against the Cleveland Indians, Kamm was involved 
in a rare triple play that involved a hidden ball trick.[8] The Indians 
had baserunners on second and third bases when Carl Lind grounded out to 
the shortstop, who then threw to first base to retire the batter. Johnny 
Hodapp, who had been the baserunner on second base, erroneously thought 
the runner on third base, Charlie Jamieson had scored, so he advanced to 
third base on the ground out. Kamm retrieved the ball from the first baseman 
and tagged both runners at third base, whereupon the umpire ruled Hodapp 
out. Kamm then hid the ball under his arm and waited for Jamieson to step 
off the base. When he did so, Kamm tagged him out to complete the triple 
play.[9] In a thirteen-year major league career, Kamm played in 1,693 games, 
accumulating 1,643 hits in 5,851 at bats for a .281 career batting average 
along with 29 home runs and 826 runs batted in.[1] At the time of his retirement, 
only Heinie Groh had a higher career fielding percentage among retired 
major league third basemen, and as of 2010, his .967 career fielding percentage 
is the 15th highest by a third baseman in major league baseball history.[10] 
Kamm led the league in fielding average eight times, including six times 
in a row, and in putouts seven times.[11] Kamm still holds the American 
League single-season record for putouts by a third baseman with 243 set 
in 1928, and ranks eighth overall in putouts by third basemen.[12][13] 
He also led American League third basemen four times in assists and twice 
in range factor.[1] Kamm is one of only 18 players in major league baseball 
history to have more than 60 runs batted in during a season, without hitting 
a home run.[14] He is the only player to have ever accomplished the feat 
twice, with 62 runs batted in during the 1926 season, and 75 runs batted 
in during the 1931 season.[14] Sabermetrician Bill James, in his baseball 
reference book The New Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract, noted that 
after trading Willie Kamm, the Chicago White Sox did not stabilize the 
third base position until 1989—a period of 58 years. After his retirement 
as a player, Kamm became the manager of the Mission Reds in the Pacific 
Coast League from 1936 to 1937.[15] Kamm died at age 88 in Belmont, California.[16]
