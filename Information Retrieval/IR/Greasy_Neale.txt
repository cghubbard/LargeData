Alfred Earle "Greasy" Neale (November 5, 1891 – November 2, 1973) was an 
American football and baseball player and coach. Neale was born in Parkersburg, 
West Virginia.[1] Although writers eventually assumed that Neale got his 
nickname, "Greasy", from his elusiveness on the football field, it actually 
arose during his youth, from a name-calling joust with a friend.[2] He 
played Major League Baseball as an outfielder with the Cincinnati Reds 
between 1916 and 1924 and briefly with the Philadelphia Phillies for part 
of the 1921 season. Neale was the starting right fielder for the 1919 Cincinnati 
Reds. He batted .357 in the 1919 World Series and led the Reds with ten 
hits in their eight-game series win over the scandalous White Sox. Neale 
spent all but 22 games of his baseball career with the Cincinnati Reds. 
He had a career batting average of .259 and finished in the top ten in 
stolen bases in the National League four times. When football season came 
around, often he would leave baseball and fulfill his football duties (albeit 
playing about 90% of a baseball season most years, with the exception of 
1919 when he played the entire season, including the 1919 World Series). 
Neale also played professional football in the Ohio League with the Canton 
Bulldogs in 1917, the Dayton Triangles in 1918, and the Massillon Tigers 
in 1919. He starred as an end on Jim Thorpe's pre-World War I Canton Bulldogs 
as well as the Dayton Triangles in 1918 and Massillon Tigers in 1919. He 
coached the Triangles in 1918. Neale began his coaching career while still 
a professional player. He served as the head football coach at Muskingum 
College (1915), West Virginia Wesleyan College (1916–1917), Marietta College 
(1919–1920), Washington & Jefferson College (1921–1922), the University 
of Virginia (1923–1928), and West Virginia University (1931–1933), compiling 
a career college football record of 82–54–11. He coached basketball for 
two seasons at Marietta (1919–1921) as well, amassing a record of 26–11. 
He also served as an assistant football coach at Yale Bulldogs football 
for seven seasons (1934-1940). At Washington & Jefferson, he led his 1921 
squad to the Rose Bowl, where the Presidents played the California Golden 
Bears to a scoreless tie. At Virginia, Neale was also the head baseball 
coach from 1923 to 1929, tallying a mark of 80–73–2. Neale later coached 
the independent professional Ironton Tanks with his legendary style, flair 
and winning ways. He and Tanks quarterback Glenn Presnell claimed victories 
against the NFL's second place New York Giants and third place Chicago 
Bears in 1930. The team folded in 1931. Neale moved to the National Football 
League (NFL), serving as head coach of the Philadelphia Eagles from 1941 
to 1950. Although it took Neale a while to pull together the needed talent 
to build a winning team, once he had the right ingredients, they stayed 
among the league's best for nearly a decade. From 1944 through 1949, Neale's 
Eagles finished second three times and in first place three times. The 
Eagles won the NFL Championship in 1948 and again in 1949, and were the 
only team to win back-to-back titles by shutting out their opponents, beating 
the Chicago Cardinals 7–0 in the snow ridden 1948 NFL Championship Game 
and the Los Angeles Rams 14–0 in the 1949 NFL Championship Game in a driving 
rain storm. It was the last championship for the Eagles until 1960. His 
offense was led by the passing of quarterback Tommy Thompson, the pass 
catching of future Hall of Fame end Pete Pihos, and the running of another 
Hall of Famer, Steve Van Buren. He tallied a mark of 66–44–5 including 
playoff games in his ten seasons with the club. Neale was inducted into 
the College Football Hall of Fame in 1967 and the Pro Football Hall of 
Fame in 1969. Both inductions recognized his coaching career. Neale died 
in Florida at the age of 81 and is buried at Parkersburg Memorial Gardens 
in West Virginia. Pound sign (#) denotes interim head coach. Pound (#) sign denotes interim head coach.
