In baseball, when the ball is alive (or in play), the game can proceed. 
The pitcher may pitch the ball, the batter may attempt to hit such a pitch, 
baserunners may attempt to advance at their own risk, and the defense may 
attempt to put the batter or baserunners out. The ball becomes live when 
the pitcher is on the pitcher's plate ready to pitch; the batter, catcher, 
and the umpire are all ready; and the umpire calls or signals "Play". The 
ball remains alive until it becomes dead by a number of different occurrences. 
Thus, the ball often remains alive even after playing action ends. Technically, 
the ball remains alive between half-innings, though no action can occur 
after the end of a half-inning until the first pitch of the next half-inning. 
Participants must always be alert and attentive when the ball is alive; 
vigilance can be relaxed when the ball is dead. Thus it is important for 
players to always know whether the ball is alive. One infamous incident 
occurred in Game 2 of the 1998 American League Championship Series, which 
featured the New York Yankees against the Cleveland Indians. With Enrique 
Wilson on first base and no outs, the Indians' Travis Fryman laid down 
a bunt that first baseman Tino Martinez fielded inside the line. Martinez's 
throw to Chuck Knoblauch, covering first base, hit Fryman in the back and 
caromed 20 feet away. Instead of chasing down the ball, Knoblauch ignored 
it to argue with umpire Ted Hendry, claiming interference by Fryman. During 
the debate, Wilson rounded the bases to score the go-ahead run. Knoblauch 
later confessed that he saw the play as a "no-brainer" interference call, 
and he likely assumed that the ball would become dead. However, this interference 
call was the very call in dispute, and the umpire saw it differently. The
