The 2012 Minnesota Twins season was the 52nd season for the franchise in 
Minnesota, and the 112th overall in the American League. The Twins wound 
up with a 66-96 record, 5th (last) place in AL Central. On May 2, the Twins 
were no-hit for the fifth time in their history. Jered Weaver of the Anaheim 
Angels threw 121 pitches, striking out nine, walking one and allowing no 
hits.[1] Four of the Twins' no-hit losses have occurred in California. 
Two of the no-hitters were perfect games (Catfish Hunter, 1968 and David 
Wells, 1998). Joe Mauer is the lone Minnesota selection to the All-Star 
Game, played July 10 in Kauffman Stadium. As a reserve catcher, he enters 
the game in the top of the eighth as a replacement first baseman and goes 
1 for 1 with a single. On September 8, the Twins retired former manager 
Tom Kelly's number '10'.[2] He is the seventh Twin so honored, joining 
Harmon Killebrew [3], Rod Carew [29], Tony Oliva [6], Kent Hrbek [14], 
Kirby Puckett [34] and Bert Blyleven [28]. The number '42' is retired across 
all of the major leagues in honor of Jackie Robinson. Outfielder Josh Willingham 
wins the Silver Slugger Award for the only time in his career. â€  No Hitter
