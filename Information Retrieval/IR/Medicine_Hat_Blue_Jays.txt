The Medicine Hat Blue Jays were the Toronto Blue Jays rookie-level affiliate 
in the Pioneer League located in Medicine Hat, AB, Canada. They began play 
in 1978 and remained with their parent club for 25 seasons. They played 
their home games at Athletic Park. Over the years, the club generally struggled 
on the field and with attendance, but the Jays did have some noteworthy 
seasons. In 1982, they captured their only championship. They reached the 
championship series again in 1995 but lost the title to the Helena Brewers. 
The Blue Jays only reached the playoffs one other time, losing to the Great 
Falls Dodgers in 2000. After the 2002 season, Toronto ended their affiliation 
with the club (switching to the Pulaski Blue Jays), and the Pioneer League 
abandoned Medicine Hat. The team arrived in Medicine Hat in 1977 as an 
affiliate of the Oakland A's, relocated from Boise, Idaho, where they played 
two seasons as the Boise A's in the Northwest League.[1] The A's were previously 
in the Northwest League at Lewiston, Idaho, as the Lewiston Broncos.[2] 
Greg Morrison, a native of Medicine Hat, played for the Medicine Hat Blue 
Jays in 1997. That season, he won the Pioneer Baseball League's Triple 
Crown by recording a .448 batting average, 23 home runs, and 88 runs batted 
in. He also won league MVP and his 23 home runs set a league record for 
the most in a single season. This accomplishment remains the Pioneer League 
single season record.[3][4] Drafted by the Los Angeles Dodgers in 1994, 
Greg played in Great Falls and Savannah within the Dodgers system in 1995 
and 1996. After his stint with the Medicine Hat Blue Jays in 1997, he played 
in Hagerstown and Dunedin in 1998 and 1999 within the Blue Jays system.[3] 
From 2000-2006 Greg played for a number of teams in the independent Northern 
League.[5] Greg is currently the owner and general manager of the Medicine 
Hat Mavericks of the Western Major Baseball League.[6] Over the years, 
some of the most notable players to wear a Medicine Hat uniform included:
