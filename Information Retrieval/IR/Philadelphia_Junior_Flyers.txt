The Philadelphia Junior Flyers are an USA Hockey-sanctioned Tier III Junior 
A ice hockey team from West Chester, Pennsylvania. They play in the South 
Conference of the Eastern Hockey League (EHL) - Premier Division at the 
Ice Line Quad Rinks[1] The players, ages 16â€“20, carry amateur status under 
Junior A guidelines and hope to earn a spot on higher levels of junior 
hockey in the United States and Canada, Canadian Major Junior, Collegiate, 
and eventually professional teams. The Philadelphia Junior Flyers were 
members of the Atlantic Junior Hockey League (AJHL) from 2008 until 2013 
when Tier III junior hockey leagues went through a reorganization, which 
included the AJHL re-branding itself as the Eastern Hockey League (EHL). 
In 2015, the EHL added a lower level of Tier III junior hockey for player 
development called the EHL-Elite Division and all the current EHL members, 
including the Jr. Flyers, were added to the EHL-Premier Division. The organization 
currently fields a team at the former Tier III Junior B level in the EHL's 
19U Elite Division (and formerly in the Metropolitan Junior Hockey League). 
It also currently fields youth hockey select teams at the Midget U18, Midget 
16U, Bantam, Peewee, and Squirt and Mite levels.[2][3] The Jr. Flyers 18
