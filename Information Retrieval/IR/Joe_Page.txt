Joseph Francis Page (October 28, 1917 – April 21, 1980), nicknamed Fireman 
and The Gay Reliever,[1] was a Major League Baseball relief pitcher. Page, 
who was left-handed, played with the New York Yankees from 1944 to 1950 
and with the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1954. Page was signed by the New York 
Yankees as an amateur free agent in 1940. After spending time in the Yankees 
farm system, Page made his Major League Baseball debut on April 19, 1944 
where he began his career as a starter. In his rookie season (starting 
16 games, and relieving in three others), Page was voted to play in the 
All-Star Game and ended his season with over 100 innings pitched and a 
4.56 ERA.[1] The next season, Page suffered a shoulder injury, which led 
him to start only nine of the twenty games he pitched. That season, Page 
improved his ERA to 2.82, along with a 6–3 record. In 1946, Page split 
his time between closing and starting games, and he picked up three saves 
while posting a 3.57 ERA and a 9–8 record. In 1947, Page spent practically 
the whole season in the bullpen and only started twice. He was voted to 
play in the All-Star Game once again, because of his 2.48 ERA and a 14–8 
record.[1] He also led the American League with 17 saves this season. (Note 
that the save statistic was not an official baseball statistic until 1969, 
and had not even entered common usage until well after Page did this; this 
feat is something that is only retroactively appreciated.[2] However, it 
was certainly appreciated at the time that Page played a greater than average 
role as the Yankees relief pitcher, at a time when there was no generally 
acknowledged "closing pitcher" role in baseball, and when starting pitchers 
were more often expected to finish complete games.) His fourteen relief 
wins in 1947 was an American League record until Luis Arroyo broke it in 
1961. He was fourth in the league in American League MVP voting. In the 
seventh game of the 1947 World Series he earned the save by inducing Brooklyn 
Dodgers hitter Eddie Miksis to hit into a series-ending double play. In 
1948, Page finished second in the American League in saves. He also struck 
out 77 in 107.7 innings, pitched in the All-Star game for the third time, 
and led the league with 55 appearances.[1] The following season, Page had 
a 13–8 record and a 2.59 ERA. He finished first in the American League 
in saves with 27, again with no fanfare at the time because the save was 
not a recognized baseball statistic. He gave up 103 hits in 135.3 innings 
and struck out 99 batters. He was again named to play in the All-Star Game, 
and finished first in the league in three categories: games finished, games 
pitched, and saves. Page won the inaugural Babe Ruth Award for his performance 
in the 1949 World Series against the Brooklyn Dodgers, winning game three 
of the Series.[1] He also finished third in the American League MVP voting. 
In 1950, Page was sent back to the minors. On May 16, 1951, he was released 
by the Yankees. On April 12, 1954, Page was signed as a free agent by the 
Pittsburgh Pirates, appearing in seven games, posting an 11.17 ERA. Page 
was released by the Pirates on June 1, one week after his final appearance. 
Page finished his eight-year career in the majors with a career record 
of 57–49, a 3.53 ERA, 76 saves, and 519 strikeouts in 790.0 innings pitched.
