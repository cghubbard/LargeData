The Boston Globe is an American daily newspaper based in Boston, Massachusetts. 
Founded in 1872 by Charles H. Taylor, it was privately held until 1973, 
when it went public as Affiliated Publications. The company was acquired 
in 1993 by The New York Times Company; two years later Boston.com was established 
as the newspaper's online edition. In 2011, a BostonGlobe.com subscription 
site was launched. In 2013, the newspaper and websites were purchased by 
John W. Henry, a businessman whose other holdings include the Boston Red 
Sox and Liverpool F.C. The Boston Globe has been awarded 23 Pulitzer Prizes 
since 1966, and its chief print rival is the Boston Herald.[4] The Boston 
Globe was founded in 1872 by six Boston businessmen, including Charles 
H. Taylor and Eben Jordan, who jointly invested $150,000 (worth $2,967,917 
today). The first issue was published on March 4, 1872, and cost four cents. 
Originally a morning daily, it began a Sunday edition in 1877, which absorbed 
the rival Boston Weekly Globe in 1892.[5] In 1878, The Boston Globe started 
an afternoon edition called The Boston Evening Globe, which ceased publication 
in 1979. By the 1890s, The Boston Globe had become a stronghold, with an 
editorial staff dominated by Irish Catholics.[6] In 1964, Tom Winship succeeded 
his father, Larry Winship, as editor. The younger Winship transformed The 
Globe from a mediocre local paper into a regional paper of national distinction. 
He served as editor until 1984, during which time the paper won a dozen 
Pulitzer Prizes, the first in the paper's history.[citation needed] The 
Boston Globe was a private company until 1973 when it went public under 
the name Affiliated Publications. It continued to be managed by the descendants 
of Charles H. Taylor. In 1993, The New York Times Company purchased Affiliated 
Publications for US$1.1 billion, making The Boston Globe a wholly owned 
subsidiary of The New York Times' parent.[7][8] The Jordan and Taylor families 
received substantial New York Times Company stock, but the last Taylor 
family members left management in 2000–2001.[citation needed] Boston.com, 
the online edition of The Boston Globe, was launched on the World Wide 
Web in 1995.[9] Consistently ranked among the top ten newspaper websites 
in America,[10] it has won numerous national awards and took two regional 
Emmy Awards in 2009 for its video work.[11] Under the helm of editor Martin 
Baron and then Brian McGrory, The Globe shifted away from coverage of international 
news in favor of Boston-area news.[12] Globe reporters Michael Rezendes, 
Matt Carroll, Sacha Pfeiffer and Walter Robinson and editor Ben Bradlee 
Jr. were an instrumental part of uncovering the Roman Catholic Church sex 
abuse scandal in 2001–2003, especially in relation to Massachusetts churches. 
They were awarded the Pulitzer Prize for their work, one of several the 
paper has received for its investigative journalism,[13] and their work 
was dramatized in the 2015 Academy Award winning film Spotlight, named 
after the paper's in-depth investigative division. The Boston Globe is 
credited[by whom?] with allowing Peter Gammons to start his Notes section 
on baseball, which has become a mainstay in all major newspapers nationwide. 
In 2004, Gammons was selected as the 56th recipient of the J. G. Taylor 
Spink Award for outstanding baseball writing, given by the BBWAA, and was 
honored at the Baseball Hall of Fame on July 31, 2005.[citation needed] 
In 2007, Charlie Savage, whose reports on President Bush's use of signing 
statements made national news, won the Pulitzer Prize for National Reporting.[citation 
needed] The Boston Globe has consistently been ranked in the forefront 
of American journalism. Time magazine listed it as one of the ten best 
US daily newspapers in 1974 and 1984, and the Globe tied for sixth in a 
national survey of top editors who chose "America's Best Newspapers" in 
the Columbia Journalism Review in 1999.[citation needed] The Boston Globe 
hosts 28 blogs covering a variety of topics including Boston sports, local 
politics and a blog made up of posts from the paper's opinion writers.[14] 
On April 2, 2009, The New York Times Company threatened to close the paper 
if its unions did not agree to $20,000,000 of cost savings.[15][16] Some 
of the cost savings include reducing union employees' pay by 5%, ending 
pension contributions, ending certain employees' tenures.[15][16] The Boston 
Globe eliminated the equivalent of fifty full-time jobs; among buy-outs 
and layoffs, it swept out most of the part-time employees in the editorial 
sections. However, early on the morning of May 5, 2009, The New York Times 
Company announced it had reached a tentative deal with the Boston Newspaper 
Guild, which represents most of the Globe's editorial staff, that allowed 
it to get the concessions it demanded. The paper's other three major unions 
had agreed to concessions on May 3, 2009, after The New York Times Company 
threatened to give the government 60-days notice that it intended to close 
the paper.[17] Despite the cuts helping to "significantly [improve]" its 
financial performance by October of that year, the The Globe's parent company 
indicated that it was considering strategic alternatives for the paper, 
but did not plan to sell it.[18] In September 2011, The Boston Globe launched 
a dedicated, subscription-based website at bostonglobe.com.[19] In February 
2013, The New York Times Company announced that it would sell the New England 
Media Group, which encompasses the Globe ; bids were received by six parties, 
of them included John Gormally (owner of television stations in Western 
Massachusetts), another group included members of former Globe publishers, 
the Taylor family, and Boston Red Sox principal owner John W. Henry, who 
bid for the paper through the New England Sports Network (majority owned 
by Fenway Sports Group alongside the Boston Bruins). However, after the 
NESN group dropped out of the running to buy the paper, Henry made his 
own separate bid to purchase The Globe in July 2013.[20][21] On October 
24, 2013, he took ownership of The Globe, at a $70 million purchase price.[22][23] 
On January 30, 2014, Henry named himself publisher and named Mike Sheehan, 
a prominent former Boston ad executive, to be CEO.[24] In July 2016, the 
815,000-square-foot headquarters located in Dorchester was sold to an unknown 
buyer for an undisclosed price.[25] The Globe will be moving their entire 
operations in early 2017 to Myles Standish Industrial Park located in Taunton, 
Massachusetts. At The Boston Globe, as is customary in the news industry, 
the editorial pages are separate from the news operation. Editorials represent 
the official view of The Boston Globe as a community institution. The publisher 
reserves the right to veto an editorial and usually determines political 
endorsements for high office.[26] Ellen Clegg, a long-time Globe journalist 
and former top spokeswoman for the newspaper, was named editor of the Editorial 
Page in 2015.[27] Describing the political position of The Boston Globe 
in 2001, former editorial page editor Renée Loth told the Boston University 
alumni magazine: The Globe has a long tradition of being a progressive 
institution, and especially on social issues. We are pro-choice; we're 
against the death penalty; we're for gay rights. But if people read us 
carefully, they will find that on a whole series of other issues, we are 
not knee-jerk. We're for charter schools; we're for any number of business-backed 
tax breaks. We are a lot more nuanced and subtle than that liberal stereotype 
does justice to.[28] Appearing in the Sunday paper almost every week is 
The Boston Globe Magazine. As of 2013, Susanne Althoff is the editor. On 
October 23, 2006, The Boston Globe announced the publication of Design 
New England: The Magazine of Splendid Homes and Gardens. The glossy oversized 
magazine is published six times per year.[29] Each year in December since 
2004, the magazine picks a Bostonian of the Year.[31] Past winners include 
Red Sox general manager Theo Epstein (2004), retired judge and Big Dig 
whistleblower Edward Ginsburg (2005), governor Deval Patrick (2006), Neighborhood 
Assistance Corporation of America Founder and CEO Bruce Marks (2007), NBA 
champion Paul Pierce (2008), professor Elizabeth Warren (2009), Republican 
politician Scott Brown (2010), U.S. attorney Carmen Ortiz and ArtsEmerson 
executive director Robert Orchard[32] (2011), Olympic gold medalists Aly 
Raisman and Kayla Harrison (2012),[33] three people who were near the Boston 
Marathon bombings, Dan Marshall, Natalie Stavas, and Larry Hittinger (2013),[34] 
and Market Basket employees (2014).[35] In 1998, columnist Patricia Smith 
was forced to resign after it was discovered that she had fabricated people 
and quotations in several of her columns.[52] In August of that year, columnist 
Mike Barnicle was discovered to have copied material for a column from 
a George Carlin book, Brain Droppings. He was suspended for this offense, 
and his past columns were reviewed. In their review, The Boston Globe editors 
found that Barnicle had fabricated a story about two cancer patients, and 
Barnicle was forced to resign.[53] In 2004, the Globe apologized for printing 
graphic photographs that the article represented as showing U.S. soldiers 
raping Iraqi women during the Iraq war. The photos had already been found 
by other news organizations to be from an internet pornography site.[54][55] 
In the spring of 2005, The Boston Globe retracted a story describing the 
events of a seal hunt near Halifax, Nova Scotia that took place on April 
12, 2005. Written by freelancer Barbara Stewart, a former The New York 
Times staffer, the article described the specific number of boats involved 
in the hunt and graphically described the killing of seals and the protests 
that accompanied it. In reality, weather had delayed the hunt, which had 
not yet begun the day the story had been filed, proving that the details 
were fabricated.[56][57] The Boston Globe maintains two distinct major 
websites: BostonGlobe.com is a subscriber-supported site with a paywall 
and content from the printed paper; and Boston.com, one of the first regional 
news portals,[citation needed] is supported by advertising. Between September 
2011 and March 2014, the Globe gradually withdrew stories written by Globe 
journalists from Boston.com, making the sites more and more separated.[58] 
BostonGlobe.com was designed to emphasize a premium experience focusing 
on content and emulating the visual appearance of The Boston Globe newspaper; 
the site was one of the first major websites to use a responsive design 
which automatically adapts its layout to a device's screen size. Boston.com 
followed suit in 2014. The two sites are aimed towards different readers; 
while Boston.com became targeted towards "casual" readers and local content, 
the new Boston Globe website is targeted towards the audience of the paper 
itself.[59][60][61] In 2012, the Society for News Design selected BostonGlobe.com 
as the world's best-designed news website.[62] Boston Globe Media Partners, 
which owns the Globe operates a number of websites covering certain niche 
subjects. The sites share many resources, like office space, with the Globe, 
but are often branded separately from the newspaper: BDCwire was launched 
in 2013. It covers local entertainment and similar subjects and is geared 
toward a young audience, from college age to early 30s.[63] Crux was launched 
in September 2014.[58][64][65] It covered the Catholic Church and numerous 
subjects concerning life as a Catholic in the United States, including 
advice columns. Crux featured deep coverage of the Holy See and employed 
a Vatican correspondent in its six-person editorial staff. Its associate 
editor was John L. Allen Jr., a long-time and well-known Vatican watcher. 
At the end of March 2016, The Globe ended its association with Crux, tranferring 
ownership of the website to the Crux staff. With Allen as the new editor, 
Crux entered a partnership with the Knights of Columbus.[65][66] BetaBoston, 
launched in 2014, covers the local technology industry in Boston, its suburbs 
and New England as a whole.[citation needed] Stat, launched in 2015, covers 
health, medicine and life sciences, with a particular focus on the biotechnology 
industry based in and around Boston. Stat employs journalists in Boston, 
Washington, D.C., New York City and San Francisco.[67] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 NBC
