George Joseph Mullin (July 4, 1880 – January 7, 1944) was a right-handed 
pitcher in Major League Baseball who played fourteen seasons with the Detroit 
Tigers (1902–13) and Washington Senators (1913) of the American League 
and the Indianapolis Hoosiers/Newark Pepper (1914–15) of the Federal League. 
Mullin holds the Detroit Tigers franchise record for innings pitched (in 
a career and in a season) and has the second most wins in the team's history. 
He also pitched the team's first no-hitter; had five 20-win seasons (including 
a league-leading 29 wins in 1909); helped the Tigers to three straight 
American League pennants (1907–1909); twice hit over .310 as a batter; 
and ranks 7th in major league history for fielding assists by a pitcher. 
Yet, as one author noted: "The pitching prowess and significant achievements 
of George Mullin seem to have faded away on the brittle pages of baseball 
history. Not even in the Motor City ... is the name of George Mullin, the 
burly right-hander from Wabash, Indiana, mentioned." (Warren Wilbert, "What 
Makes an Elite Pitcher?" (McFarland 2003), p. 25)[1] Mullin was a powerfully 
built right-hander with an intimidating fastball, but imperfect control. 
He was known to try to keep opposing batters off balance by talking to 
them when they came to bat, or even talking to himself. (George Van Dusen, 
Dan Ewald, Jim Hawkins, "The Detroit Tigers Encyclopedia" (2003), p. 169)[2] 
And with a runner on third base at Bennett Park, Mullin was known to fake 
a throw over the head of catcher Boss Schmidt. Schmidt would then fake 
an attempt to run after the "errant" pitch, luring the runner toward the 
plate. Mullin would then toss the ball to Schmidt for an easy out. He compiled 
a career record of 228–196, ranking 65th in wins in major league history. 
Born in Toledo, Ohio, Mullin played semi-pro baseball in Wabash, Indiana, 
earning the nickname "Wabash George." In 1901, at age 20, Mullin signed 
with both the Brooklyn Superbas and Detroit Tigers. Mullin chose the Tigers, 
wishing to stay closer to his home in Indiana. Mullin played his first 
twelve seasons with the Tigers. In his rookie season, 1902, Mullin won 
13 games (and lost 16) for the 7th place Tigers. The following season, 
Mullin won 19 and reduced his ERA to 2.25 (an Adjusted ERA+ of 129). In 
1903, Mullin was among the American League leaders with 6 shutouts (2nd 
in AL), 170 strikeouts (5th in AL), and 41 games (2nd in AL). In 1904, 
Mullin had another strong year, pitching a club record 42 complete games 
(and 7 shutouts) with a 2.40 ERA and 161 strikeouts. However, the Tigers 
in the pre-Cobb era were a weak-hitting team that remained mired in 7th 
place, and Mullin lost 23 games despite a strong individual performance. 
In 1905, Mullin won 21 games for his first 20-win season but also lost 
21 games. He started in a career-high 44 games and pitched in a club record 
382-1/3 innings. He continued to remain below the league average with an 
ERA of 2.51. The Tigers finished in 6th place in 1906, but Mullin had another 
strong year with a record of 21–18 and 35 complete games. Mullin had remarkable 
stamina as a pitcher. He started 428 games and had 353 complete game—25th 
highest total in major league history. He was among the American League 
leaders in complete games nine straight years (1903–11) and innings pitched 
for eight straight years (1903–10). His career highs were 42 complete games 
(1904) and 382⅓ innings (1905), both Tigers team records. To this day, 
Mullin is the Tigers' all-time innings pitched leader, both in a career 
(3394) and in a season (382⅓). Mullin was a powerfully built pitcher with 
an intimidating fastball, perhaps even more so due to his imperfect control. 
He hit batsmen 131 times in his career—the 19th highest total in major 
league history. He also threw 85 wild pitches and gave up 1238 bases on 
balls—45th most in major league history. He led the league in walks allowed 
four times (1903–06), including a career high 138 in 1905, and was among 
the league leaders in walks allowed 11 times. In 1907, the Tigers added 
Hughie Jennings as manager, and with the bats of Ty Cobb and Sam Crawford, 
the team finally had the winning combination, as they won three straight 
American League pennants from 1907 to 1909. During the Tigers' pennant 
years, Mullin won 66 games and pitched 105 complete games and more than 
950 innings. Mullin's best season was 1909, when he started the season 
with a one-hitter on Opening Day and then recorded eleven consecutive wins. 
He did not lose a game until June 15, 1909, and went on to lead the American 
League in both wins (29) and win percentage (.784). His 11-0 start remained 
a Tigers record for 104 years, until it was surpassed in 2013 by Max Scherzer's 
12-0 start.[3] Mullin started 6 World Series games for the 1907–09 Tigers. 
He went the distance, pitching complete games, in all 6 World Series Games 
he started. He gave up only 12 earned runs in 58 innings, for a lifetime 
ERA of 1.86 in World Series play. Despite strong pitching from Mullin, 
the Tigers lost each of the World Series they played in from 1907 to 1909. 
He had a 2.12 ERA in the 1907 World Series, but the Detroit bats went cold, 
and Mullin lost both games he started. Mullin holds the distinction of 
being the only pitcher in World Series history to lose 20 games during 
the regular season, and still appear in the World Series. Mullin posted 
a 20–20 record in the '07 season. In the 1908 Series, Mullin pitched a 
complete game shutout for a win. And in the 1909 World Series, Mullin won 
two games, including a 5-hit, 10-strikeout complete game shutout in Game 
4 against Honus Wagner's Pittsburgh Pirates. In November 1909, a group 
of Detroit Tigers players toured Cuba and played 12 exhibition games against 
two integrated Cuban teams, Habana and Almendares. Mullin was among the 
Tigers players who toured Cuba. The tour drew wide attention in Cuba, where 
baseball was already very popular. Demonstrating the high level of play 
in Cuba, the Tigers lost 8 of the 12 games to the integrated Cuban baseball 
teams.[4] On November 27, 1909, Mullin shut out the Cuban Almendares team 
in a 4–0 victory for the touring Tigers.[5] An all around athlete, Mullin 
had great range and ability to get to the ball. He contributed 1244 assists 
as a pitcher, the 7th highest total of any pitcher in major league history, 
behind legends such as Cy Young, Christy Mathewson, Grover Cleveland Alexander, 
and Walter Johnson. His career record of 2.56 assists per game also ranks 
7th in major league history for pitchers. He had a career-high 163 assists 
in 1904 and twice led the league in assists by a pitcher. Mullin also excelled 
as a batter. He had a career .262 batting average with a .319 on-base percentage. 
He had 96 extra base hits, 122 bases on balls, and 18 stolen bases. He 
hit three doubles in his first major league start and batted .325 in his 
rookie season. He was such a reliable hitter that he was used 101 times 
(with 21 hits) as a pinch hitter. (Paul Votano, Stand and Deliver: A History 
of Pinch-Hitting (McFarland 2003), p. 33)[6] On September 18, 1906, Mullin 
even pinch hit for Ty Cobb. Cobb was slumping and manager Bill Armour summoned 
Mullin to bat for Cobb in the bottom of the 9th inning. According to the 
next day's account in the Detroit Free Press, Mullin "hit center field 
with a triple." (Paul Votano, "Stand and Deliver: A History of Pinch-Hitting" 
(McFarland 2003), p. 29)[7] Mullin continued as a winner and a workhorse 
in 1910 and 1911, with records of 21–12 and 18–10. On April 20, 1912, Mullin 
was given the honor of pitching the first game at the new Navin Field, 
beating the Indians 6–5 in 11 innings. Mullin won his own game with an 
RBI single. On May 21, 1912, Mullin shut out the Washington Senators, earning 
his 200th career win—a 2–0 pitching duel with Walter Johnson. And on July 
4, 1912 (Mullin's 32nd birthday), he pitched the first no-hitter in Detroit 
Tigers history, as Mullin helped himself with 3 hits and 2 RBIs in the 
game. In 1913, Mullin got off to a shaky 1–6 start, and he was sold to 
the Washington Senators on May 17, 1913. That season he also pitched four 
games for the Montreal Royals in the International League (records). In 
1914, Mullin jumped to the newly formed Federal League and played for the 
Indianapolis Hoosiers. He enjoyed a one-year revival pitching for the Hoosiers 
in his home state of Indiana. His 2.70 ERA was among the Federal League 
leaders, and he also hit .312 with a .404 on-base percentage and 21 RBIs 
in 77 at bats. In 1915, the Hoosiers moved east and became the Newark Pepper, 
and Mullin played in only five games. His last major league game was with 
the Pepper on May 23, 1915. At least for that season he continued to work 
in the industry, pitching for Chester, Pennsylvania in the semiprofessional 
Delaware County League.[8] Mullin died in 1944 at age 63 in Wabash, Indiana. 
He was posthumously inducted into the Michigan Sports Hall of Fame in 1962.
