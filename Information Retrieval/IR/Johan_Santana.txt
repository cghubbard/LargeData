Johan Alexander Santana Araque (/ˈjoʊhɑːn sænˈtænə/; born March 13, 1979) 
is a Venezuelan professional baseball starting pitcher who is a free agent. 
Santana pitched in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Minnesota Twins 
from 2000 to 2007 and for the New York Mets from 2008 to 2012, sidelined 
by injury challenges since the 2012 season. A two-time Cy Young Award winner 
with the Twins, Santana is a four-time All-Star and earned a pitching triple 
crown in 2006. On June 1, 2012, Santana threw a no-hitter against the St. 
Louis Cardinals, the first no-hitter in New York Mets then 51-year franchise 
history. Santana was discovered in 1994 by Andres Reiner, who was a scout 
working for the Houston Astros at the time.[1] Santana's parents agreed 
to let him attend Houston's academy in Valencia. When O’Brien called Reiner 
and asked if he had signed Santana to a contract, Reiner reported that 
he was still deciding if Santana was a better prospect as an outfielder 
or a pitcher. After six weeks of training, Santana was told he was going 
to pitch. Santana did not like it and almost left, but Reiner convinced 
him to stay. While originally a center fielder, Santana was converted to 
a pitcher at the academy due to his arm speed. In 1999 he was named the 
Tovar Mérida Athlete of the Year. After the 1999 major league season, he 
was left unprotected by the Houston Astros and eligible in the Rule 5 draft. 
The Minnesota Twins had the first pick that year, the Florida Marlins had 
the second. The Twins made a deal with the Marlins: the Twins would draft 
Jared Camp with their first pick and the Marlins would draft Santana. The 
teams would exchange the two players with the Twins receiving $50,000 to 
cover their pick.[2][3] Santana made his Major League debut with the Twins 
on April 3, 2000, coming from the bullpen vs. Tampa Bay. He made his first 
MLB start on April 7, 2000, at Kansas City and recorded his first Major 
League win in a relief appearance at Houston on June 6. He put up a 6.49 
ERA in 86 innings pitched in 2000, his rookie year. In 2002, the Twins 
sent Santana to the minors for 2 months to work almost exclusively on perfecting 
his changeup. He did this for 10 starts and came back up to the majors 
with a terrific changeup to complement his very good fastball. While in 
the minors, pitching coach Bobby Cuellar made Santana throw at least one 
changeup to every batter. According to Cuellar, Santana would sometimes 
throw 20 in a row during games.[4] Santana was used as a long reliever 
early in his career after finding little success as a starter. In 2002 
he led the majors in wild pitches, with 15. In 2003, Santana transitioned 
from relief to the Twins' starting rotation after spending the first four 
months of the season in the bullpen. He won his last eight decisions and 
pitched the ALDS opening game against the Yankees. Due to Santana's early 
major-league success with the Twins, a young minor-league pitcher in the 
Anaheim Angels' farm system also named Johan Santana changed his name to 
Ervin Santana in 2003 and has also achieved major league success. Santana 
underwent minor elbow surgery following the season.[5] In 2004, Santana 
enjoyed one of the great second halves of modern times. He became the first 
pitcher since 1961 to give up four or fewer hits in 10 straight starts, 
and his 13–0 record broke the old Major League second-half mark shared 
between Burt Hooton and Rick Sutcliffe. Santana's other second-half numbers 
were equally impressive: 11.13 strikeouts per nine innings, 1.21 ERA, 4.74 
hits per nine innings, and 6.73 baserunners per nine innings. In addition, 
Santana set a team season record with 265 strikeouts, surpassing the old 
258 mark registered by Bert Blyleven in 1973. Santana finished in good 
form with a 20–6 record and led the American League (AL) in strikeouts 
(265), ERA (2.61), strikeouts per nine innings pitched (10.46), WHIP (0.92), 
batting average allowed (.192), OBP (.249), SLG (.315), and OPS (.564) 
and walked only 54 batters in 228 innings. Opponents stole just six bases 
in seven attempts against him, and his 20 victories ranked him second behind 
only Curt Schilling's 21. He easily won the AL Cy Young Award with all 
28 first-place votes. Santana struggled in his first outing of 2005, giving 
up four runs in the first inning, but quickly regained his composure and 
returned to Cy Young-winning form in an 8–4 victory over the Seattle Mariners. 
In his second game, he recorded 11 strikeouts against the Chicago White 
Sox as the Twins won 5–2. Santana finished the season with an ERA of 2.87, 
second-lowest in the AL behind Indians pitcher Kevin Millwood (2.86). However, 
the weak Twins club of the 2005 season cost him several otherwise-winnable 
games, and his winning percentage fell considerably in his second full 
year as a starter. He threw 238 strikeouts during the season, leading the 
majors. He finished third in the Cy Young voting, finishing behind winner 
Bartolo Colón and closer Mariano Rivera. Santana won the pitching Major 
League Triple Crown, the first pitcher to do so since Dwight Gooden in 
1985. He completed the season leading the majors in ERA (2.77) and strikeouts 
(245), and tied Chien-Ming Wang in wins (19). He is the first pitcher to 
win the triple crown with fewer than 20 wins, and the first to win the 
MLB triple crown with an ERA above 2.60. Santana also led the AL in WHIP 
(1.00), opposing batting average (.216), and innings pitched (233.2). He 
continued to add to his reputation as a great second-half pitcher, losing 
only one game after the All-Star break while winning 10 and posting a 2.54 
ERA. A brief slump cost him the opportunity to make his 20th win of the 
season. No pitcher in Major League Baseball won 20 games in the 2006 season, 
the first time in modern major league history this occurred. Santana won 
his second Cy Young Award in 2006, becoming the 14th player in MLB history 
to win the award multiple times. He is the fifth pitcher to win the award 
by a unanimous vote twice, joining Roger Clemens, Pedro Martínez, and Greg 
Maddux; Sandy Koufax accomplished the feat three times. From 2004 to 2006, 
Santana led the league in strikeouts all three years, in ERA twice, and 
also led in several other key statistical areas. In this three-year span, 
he compiled a 55–19 record with an ERA of 2.75 and WHIP of 0.96, while 
striking out 748 batters. After a slow start, with his record falling to 
6–6 at one point, Santana jump-started his season with a four-hit shutout, 
followed by two wins. On July 1, 2007, Santana was named as a member of 
the 2007 All-Star Game, his third straight appearance. On June 19, 2007, 
on the team bus to a game at Shea Stadium, Bert Blyleven said he would 
have his head shaved if that night's starting pitcher, Santana, threw a 
complete-game shutout. The Twins won, 9–0, and Santana went the distance 
on a four-hitter. Santana shaved Blyleven's head the following day.[6] 
Santana had perhaps his best career game on August 19 against the Texas 
Rangers in which he struck out 17 batters over eight innings. He walked 
none and allowed only two hits, both to Sammy Sosa. His 17 strikeouts set 
a Twins club record for strikeouts in a game.[7] Santana's game score of 
95 is the highest by any pitcher in MLB history in a non-complete game.[8] 
He led the major leagues in home runs allowed (33) and had the most losses 
of his career (13). Santana finished the season with only 15 wins, his 
lowest total since 2003. However, Santana led the AL in WHIP, was second 
in strikeouts with 235, and seventh in ERA. On the last game of the season, 
a rain delay in a road game against the Detroit Tigers that lasted over 
an hour caused Santana to pitch only three innings. This ended a 123 consecutive 
start streak in which he pitched five innings or more. This is the third 
longest consecutive-game streak for a pitcher in the past half century. 
In November, it was announced Santana was awarded the AL Gold Glove Award 
for pitcher, his first selection.[9] He was also honored with a Fielding 
Bible Award as the best fielding pitcher in MLB.[10] On February 2, 2008, 
Santana was traded from the Twins to the New York Mets for Carlos Gómez, 
Philip Humber, Deolis Guerra, and Kevin Mulvey.[11] The Mets and Santana 
agreed to a six-year, $137.5 million contract.[12] Santana was named the 
Opening Day starter, throwing 100 pitches in seven innings to earn the 
win against the Florida Marlins. On May 10, 2008, he earned his first win 
at Shea Stadium as a member of the New York Mets. On June 1, 2008, Santana 
earned his 100th career victory, going 7.2 innings and allowing one run 
in a 6–1 win over the Los Angeles Dodgers.[13] On July 27, the day after 
the Mets played a 14-inning game where every pitcher in the bullpen was 
used, Johan pitched a complete game against the St. Louis Cardinals. He 
struck out five and also got his first RBI as a Met. He won this game, 
improving his record to 9–7. On August 17, 2008 Santana pitched his second 
complete game and his 11th win of the season, allowing only three hits 
while walking none and striking out 7 in a 3–0 Mets win over the Pittsburgh 
Pirates. On September 23, Santana threw 125 pitches, a career-high to that 
point, in eight innings to beat the Chicago Cubs. On September 27, in the 
thick of a playoff race and on the final weekend of the season, Santana 
pitched a complete game three-hit shutout in a 2–0 win against the Florida 
Marlins on three-days rest. It was later revealed that Santana had pitched 
that day, and perhaps in many other starts, with a torn meniscus in his 
left knee. He underwent successful surgery on it on October 1, 2008. Santana 
finished the 2008 regular season with a 16–7 record, posting a 2.53 ERA 
with 206 strikeouts, which set a Mets' single-season record for strikeouts 
by a left-handed pitcher, breaking Jon Matlack's 35-year record of 205 
in 1973. His 2.53 ERA led the majors and was a career best. He also set 
a career high in innings pitched and was undefeated in the second half 
of the season. However, he was also the victim of seven blown saves, tying 
for first in the majors.[14] Santana finished in third place in the NL 
Cy Young Award race behind Brandon Webb and winner Tim Lincecum. On April 
7, 2009, Johan Santana started the first game for the New York Mets in 
the 2009 season against the Cincinnati Reds. He went 5.2 innings allowing 
only one earned run, going on to win. In his second start on April 12 against 
the Florida Marlins Santana struck out 13 batters and surrendered two unearned 
runs over seven innings only to lose for the first time since June 28, 
2008, against the New York Yankees. On August 25 Santana was placed on 
the 15-day disabled list and missed the remainder of the season after having 
to undergo season ending arthroscopic surgery to remove bone chips in his 
left elbow. Santana finished the season at a record of 13–9 with a 3.13 
ERA.[15] In 2009 he was named # 3 on the Sporting News' list of the 50 
greatest current players in baseball. A panel of 100 baseball people, many 
of them members of the Baseball Hall of Fame and winners of major baseball 
awards, was polled to arrive at the list.[16] In a start on May 2, 2010 
against Philadelphia, Santana gave up 10 runs in 3 2⁄3 innings, the worst 
start in his MLB career, surpassing his previous worst start on June 14, 
2009 versus the Yankees, where he allowed nine runs and nine hits in just 
three innings. However, in the next five starts after that, Santana gave 
up only seven earned runs, striking out 21 and improving his record to 
4–2 with a 3.03 ERA. Santana hit his first major league home run off of 
Matt Maloney of the Cincinnati Reds on July 6, finishing the game with 
a complete game shutout. From July 1 – 23, Santana was 3–0 with a 0.71 
ERA in five starts. Santana, who was struggling to keep his 10–9 record 
through September 2, strained his pectoral muscle in a 65 pitch start versus 
Atlanta,[17] for the second time in his career.[18] His last game of the 
season was a win against the Atlanta Braves on September 2. On September 
14, he underwent surgery to repair a torn anterior capsule in his left 
shoulder.[19] Santana ended his season with a record of 11–9 and an ERA 
of 2.98. This was the third consecutive year that Johan had gotten injured. 
Johan Santana missed the entire 2011 major league season while he recovered 
from his shoulder surgery, pitching only in the minors.[20] On April 5, 
2012, Santana was tabbed as the Mets Opening Day starter. This marked the 
first time Santana pitched in the majors since September 2, 2010 when he 
tore the anterior capsule in his left shoulder.[21] He went five scoreless 
innings against the Atlanta Braves, striking out five batters. On May 26, 
Santana pitched a complete game shut-out against the San Diego Padres, 
the ninth of his career. He struck out seven over nine innings and improved 
to 2–2 with a 2.75 ERA over his first 10 starts. Then on June 1, Santana 
pitched a no-hitter against the St. Louis Cardinals. After a few starts 
on July 21, Santana was placed on the 15-day disabled list by the Mets 
after spraining his right ankle. Santana was again put on the 15-day disabled 
list with inflammation in his lower back on August 22. He did not pitch 
for the remainder of the 2012 season.[22] Santana finished the season 6–9 
with a 4.85 ERA and 111 strikeouts in 21 starts and 117 innings pitched.[23] 
On June 1, in only the 11th start since returning from shoulder surgery, 
Santana threw a no-hitter against the St. Louis Cardinals, the defending 
World Series champions. This was the first no-hitter in Mets franchise 
history, coming in their 51st season and 8,020th regular season game. It 
marked only the eighth no-hitter in MLB history against a defending World 
Series champion team, the first since former Met Nolan Ryan blanked the 
Oakland Athletics in 1990.[24][25] Santana walked five batters, recorded 
eight strikeouts, and lowered his season ERA to 2.38. He also threw a career-high 
134 pitches, and earned the new nickname "No-han". Notable moments in the 
game included a liner in the sixth inning by former Met Carlos Beltrán, 
which hit the foul line behind third base but was ruled foul. In the seventh 
inning, Mike Baxter made a difficult catch in left field, preserving the 
no-hitter, and then violently crashed into the wall. He left the game with 
a bruised left shoulder and was subsequently placed on the DL.[26][27] 
For throwing the no-hitter, Santana was named National League Player of 
the Week for the week ending June 3, 2012.[28] It was his fifth such award 
and followed his teammate R.A. Dickey who won it the prior week.[29] His 
pitching feat earned him the Key to the City, which was bestowed by Mayor 
Michael Bloomberg.[30] Santana re-tore his shoulder capsule during early 
2013. His surgery was performed on April 3, 2013, by Dr. David Altchek.[31] 
He missed the entire 2013 season amid questions about if his career would 
continue.[32] On November 1, 2013, the Mets bought out his 2014 option, 
paying Santana a $5.5 million buyout to avoid being responsible for a $25 
million option for 2014, making Santana a free agent.[33] On March 4, 2014, 
he signed a minor league contract with the Baltimore Orioles, that included 
an invitation to Major League spring training.[34] He would earn $3 million 
if he were to make the Major League roster.[35] On June 2, the Orioles 
selected Santana's contract from the Triple-A Norfolk Tides and placed 
him on the disabled list.[36] On June 6, Santana tore his Achilles tendon 
during an extended spring training start and missed the rest of the 2014 
MLB season.[37] He became a free agent after the conclusion of the season. 
On February 26, 2015, Santana signed a minor league contract with the Toronto 
Blue Jays.[38] The contract would have paid him $2.5 million if he made 
the 25-man roster, and included bonuses for active days and games started.[39] 
He started the season on the disabled list of the Triple-A Buffalo Bisons, 
while rehabbing the shoulder muscles in his throwing arm.[40] On April 
23, it was reported that Santana planned on staying with the Blue Jays 
organization past his April 28 opt-out.[41] On June 27, Santana announced 
that he was ending his 2015 season due to a toe infection, and plans to 
resume his comeback in 2016.[42] Santana began the 2016 season as a free 
agent. In April, MLB Network's Jon Heyman tweeted that Santana was eyeing 
a "mid-year comeback".[43] On May 11 2016, his agent, Peter Greenberg, 
stated in an interview with Venezuelan radio show Los Cronistas that his 
client would aim to pitch in the majors during the second half of the season. 
If that didn't work out, Greenberg said, Santana would pitch in the Venezuelan 
Professional Baseball League.[44] Santana's pitch repertoire includes an 
88–94 mph fastball along with a circle changeup, generally considered his 
best pitch, and a slider. It was reported on February 25, 2014, that Santana's 
fastball velocity had dropped to 77–81 mph after his second left shoulder 
capsule surgery.[45] As a child playing in Little League, Santana wanted 
to play shortstop until coaches told him he couldn't play shortstop because 
he was a lefty. He then taught himself to throw right-handed so he could 
play shortstop.[46] Santana is the second of five children. He attended 
Liceo Jose Nucete Sardi High School, where he played center field. He and 
his wife, Yasmile, whom he has known since he was nine years old, have 
two daughters and a son. Santana missed the New York Mets' first regular 
season game at Citi Field due to the birth of his son. He and his family 
reside in the Miromar Lakes community in Estero, Florida in Lee County. 
In 2006, he started The Johan Santana Foundation to provide assistance 
to hospitals and bought new gloves and bats for children in surrounding 
areas. Also in 2006, Santana, as well as the Minnesota Twins, purchased 
a yellow firetruck for Tovar's fire department. Santana has held a party 
the past two offseasons called El Cy Youngazo (the Great Cy Young) which 
includes a toy drive, musical groups, and beer from Santana's sponsor, 
Regional.[47] Proceeds from Johan's charity wine, Santana's Select, also 
support his foundation in entirety. In 2012, the Johan Santana Foundation 
expanded their efforts to reach the Hispanic community of New York by contributing 
to Tuesday's Children, an organization that has made a commitment to families 
impacted by 9/11, First Responders and their families, and most recently, 
individuals who have lost loved ones to terrorism around the world. Johan 
contributed $10,000 dollars, matched with $10,000 by the Mets through the 
New York Mets Foundation, to expand Tuesday's Children programming to include 
more resources for Spanish-speaking individuals and families impacted by 
9/11.[48] In the off-season, Santana uses Florida Gulf Coast University's
