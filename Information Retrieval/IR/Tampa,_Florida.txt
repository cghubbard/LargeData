Tampa /ˈtæmpə/[10] is a city in and the county seat of Hillsborough County, 
Florida, United States.[11] It is located on the west coast of Florida 
on Tampa Bay, near the Gulf of Mexico, and is part of the Tampa Bay Metropolitan 
Area. The city had a population of 346,037 in 2011.[12][13] The current 
location of Tampa was once inhabited by indigenous peoples of the Safety 
Harbor culture (most notably the Tocobaga and the Pohoy, who lived along 
the shores of Tampa Bay). The area was explored by Spanish explorers in 
the 16th century, resulting in violent conflicts and the introduction of 
European diseases, which wiped out the original native cultures. Although 
Spain claimed Florida as part of New Spain, it did not found a colony in 
the Tampa area, and there were no permanent American or European settlements 
within today's city limits until after the United States acquired Florida 
from Spain in 1819. In 1824, the United States Army established a frontier 
outpost called Fort Brooke at the mouth of the Hillsborough River, near 
the site of today's Tampa Convention Center. The first civilian residents 
were pioneers who settled near the fort for protection from the nearby 
Seminole population, and the small village was first incorporated as "Tampa" 
in 1849. The town grew slowly until the 1880s, when railroad links, the 
discovery of phosphate, and the arrival of the cigar industry jump-started 
its development, helping it to grow from a quiet village of less than 800 
residents in 1880 to a bustling city of over 30,000 by the early 1900s. 
Today, Tampa is part of the metropolitan area most commonly referred to 
as the "Tampa Bay Area". For U.S. Census purposes, Tampa is part of the 
Tampa-St. Petersburg-Clearwater, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area. 
The four-county area is composed of roughly 2.9 million residents, making 
it the second largest metropolitan statistical area (MSA) in the state, 
and the fourth largest in the Southeastern United States, behind Miami, 
Washington, D.C. and Atlanta.[14] The Greater Tampa Bay area has over 4 
million residents and generally includes the Tampa and Sarasota metro areas. 
The Tampa Bay Partnership and U.S. Census data showed an average annual 
growth of 2.47 percent, or a gain of approximately 97,000 residents per 
year. Between 2000 and 2006, the Greater Tampa Bay Market experienced a 
combined growth rate of 14.8 percent, growing from 3.4 million to 3.9 million 
and hitting the 4 million population mark on April 1, 2007.[15] A 2012 
estimate shows the Tampa Bay area population to have 4,310,524 people and 
a 2017 projection of 4,536,854 people.[16] Tampa was ranked as the 5th 
best outdoor city by Forbes in 2008.[17] Tampa also ranks as the fifth 
most popular American city, based on where people want to live, according 
to a 2009 Pew Research Center study.[18] A 2004 survey by the NYU newspaper 
Washington Square News ranked Tampa as a top city for "twenty-somethings."[19] 
Tampa is ranked as a "Gamma+" world city by Loughborough University, ranked 
alongside other world cities such as Phoenix, Charlotte, Rotterdam, and 
Santo Domingo.[20] The word "Tampa" may mean "sticks of fire" in the language 
of the Calusa, a Native American tribe that once lived south of today's 
Tampa Bay. This might be a reference to the many lightning strikes that 
the area receives during the summer months. Other historians claim the 
name means "the place to gather sticks".[21] Toponymist George R. Stewart 
writes that the name was the result of a miscommunication between the Spanish 
and the Indians, the Indian word being "itimpi", meaning simply "near it".[22] 
The name first appears in the "Memoir" of Hernando de Escalante Fontaneda 
(1575), who had spent 17 years as a Calusa captive. He calls it "Tanpa" 
and describes it as an important Calusa town. While "Tanpa" may be the 
basis for the modern name "Tampa", archaeologist Jerald Milanich places 
the Calusa village of Tanpa at the mouth of Charlotte Harbor, the original 
"Bay of Tanpa". A later Spanish expedition did not notice Charlotte Harbor 
while sailing north along the west coast of Florida and assumed that the 
current Tampa Bay was the bay they sought. The name was accidentally transferred 
north.[23] Map makers were using the term Bay or Bahia Tampa as early as 
1695.[24] People from Tampa are known as "Tampans" or "Tampanians". Local 
authorities consulted by Michael Kruse of the Tampa Bay Times suggest that 
"Tampan" was historically more common, while "Tampanian" became popular 
when the former term came to be seen as a potential insult.[5] Latin Americans 
from Tampa are known as "tampeños", or "tampeñas" for females. These terms 
of Spanish origin emerged after 1900 for the immigrant communities in West 
Tampa and Ybor City. The tampeño, or "Tampa Latin", community is a mix 
of Cuban, Italian, Spanish, and American influences, with Cuban influence 
being dominant.[5][25][26] Not much is known about the cultures who called 
the Tampa Bay area home before European contact. When Spanish explorers 
arrived in the 1520s, they found Tocobaga villages around the northern 
half of Tampa Bay and Calusa villages along the southern portion of the 
bay.[27] Expeditions led by Pánfilo de Narváez and Hernando de Soto landed 
near Tampa, but neither conquistador stayed long. The native inhabitants 
repulsed any Spanish attempt to establish a permanent settlement or convert 
them to Catholicism. The newcomers brought with them infectious disease, 
resulting in a total collapse of the native cultures of Florida. The Tampa 
area was depopulated and ignored for more than 200 years.[21] In the mid-18th 
century, events in American colonies drove the Seminole Indians into northern 
Florida.[28] During this period, the Tampa area had only a handful of residents: 
Cuban and Native American fishermen.[29] They lived in a small village 
at the mouth of Spanishtown Creek on Tampa Bay, in today's Hyde Park neighborhood 
along Bayshore Boulevard.[29] After purchasing Florida from Spain in 1821, 
the United States built forts and trading posts in the new territory.[30] 
Fort Brooke was established in January 1824 at the mouth of the Hillsborough 
River on Tampa Bay, in Downtown Tampa.[31] Tampa was initially an isolated 
frontier outpost. The sparse civilian population practically abandoned 
the area during the Second Seminole War from 1835 to 1842, after which 
the Seminoles were forced out and many settlers returned.[32] Florida became 
the 27th state in 1845. On January 18, 1849, Tampa was officially incorporated 
as the "Village of Tampa". Tampa was home to 185 civilians, or 974 total 
residents including military personnel, in 1850.[33][34] Tampa was reincorporated 
as a town on December 15, 1855.[35] During the Civil War, Florida seceded 
along with most of the southern states to form the Confederate States of 
America, and Fort Brooke was manned by Confederate troops. Martial law 
was declared in Tampa in January 1862, and Tampa's city government ceased 
to operate for the duration of the war.[36] In 1861, the Union Navy set 
up a blockade around many southern ports to cut off the Confederacy, and 
several ships were stationed near the mouth of Tampa Bay.[37][38][39] The 
Battle of Fort Brooke on October 16 and the Battle of Ballast Point on 
October 18, 1863 damaged the Confederates, with Union troops destroying 
Confederate blockade runners.[40] The Civil War ended in April 1865 with 
a Confederate defeat. In May 1865, federal troops arrived in Tampa to occupy 
the fort and the town as part of Reconstruction. They remained until August 
1869. Tampa was a fishing village with very few people and little industry, 
and limited prospects for development. Tampa's chronic yellow fever epidemics, 
borne by mosquitoes from the swampland, were widespread during the late 
1860s and 1870s, and many residents left.[41] In 1869, residents voted 
to abolish the city of Tampa government.[42] The population of "Tampa Town" 
was below 800 by 1870, and had fallen further by 1880. Fort Brooke was 
decommissioned in 1883, and except for two cannons displayed on the University 
of Tampa campus, all traces of the fort are gone.[citation needed] In the 
mid-1880s, Tampa's fortunes took several sudden turns for the better. First, 
phosphate was discovered in the Bone Valley region southeast of Tampa in 
1883. The mineral, vital for the production of fertilizers and other products, 
was soon being shipped out from the Port of Tampa in great volume. Tampa 
is still a major phosphate exporter. The discovery of phosphate, the arrival 
of Plant's railroad, and the founding of Ybor City and West Tampa—all in 
the mid-1880s—were crucial to Tampa's development. The once-struggling 
village of Tampa became a bustling boomtown almost overnight, and had grown 
into one of the largest cities in Florida by 1900.[43] Henry B. Plant's 
narrow-gauge South Florida Railroad reached Tampa and its port in late 
1883, finally connecting the small town to the nation's railroad system 
after years of efforts by local leaders. Previously, Tampa's overland transportation 
links had consisted of sandy roads stretching across the Florida countryside. 
Plant's railroad made it much easier to get goods in and out of the Tampa 
Bay area. Phosphate and commercial fishing exports could be sent north 
by rail[44] and many new products were brought into the Tampa market, along 
with the first tourists. The new railroad link enabled another important 
industry to come to Tampa. In 1885, the Tampa Board of Trade enticed Vicente 
Martinez Ybor to move his cigar manufacturing operations to Tampa from 
Key West. Proximity to Cuba made importation of "clear Havana tobacco" 
easy by sea, and Plant's railroad made shipment of finished cigars to the 
rest of the US market easy by land.[43] Since Tampa was still a small town 
at the time (population less than 5000), Ybor built hundreds of small houses 
around his factory to accommodate the immediate influx of mainly Cuban 
and Spanish cigar workers. Ybor City's factories rolled their first cigars 
in 1886, and many different cigar manufacturers moved their operations 
to town in ensuing years. Many Italian and a few eastern European Jewish 
immigrants arrived starting in the late 1880s, opening businesses and shops 
that catered to cigar workers. By 1900, over 10,000 immigrants had moved 
to the neighborhood. Several thousand more Cuban immigrants built West 
Tampa, another cigar-centric suburb founded a few years later by Hugh MacFarlane. 
Between them, two "Latin" communities combined to exponentially expand 
Tampa's population, economic base, and tax revenues, as Tampa became the 
"Cigar Capital of the World".[45] During the first few decades of the 20th 
century, the cigar-making industry was the backbone of Tampa's economy. 
The factories in Ybor City and West Tampa made an enormous number of cigars—in 
the peak year of 1929, over 500,000,000 cigars were hand rolled in the 
city.[46] In 1904, a local civic association of local businessmen dubbed 
themselves Ye Mystic Krewe of Gasparilla (named after local mythical pirate 
Jose Gaspar), and staged an "invasion" of the city followed by a parade. 
With a few exceptions, the Gasparilla Pirate Festival has been held every 
year since.[47] Beginning in the late 19th century, illegal bolita lotteries 
were very popular among the Tampa working classes, especially in Ybor City. 
In the early 1920s, this small-time operation was taken over by Charlie 
Wall, the rebellious son of a prominent Tampa family, and went big-time. 
Bolita was able to openly thrive only because of kick-backs and bribes 
to key local politicians and law enforcement officials, and many were on 
the take.[48] Profits from the bolita lotteries and Prohibition-era bootlegging 
led to the development of several organized crime factions in the city. 
Charlie Wall was the first major boss, but various power struggles culminated 
in consolidation of control by Sicilian mafioso Santo Trafficante, Sr., 
and his faction in the 1950s. After his death in 1954 from cancer, control 
passed to his son Santo Trafficante, Jr., who established alliances with 
families in New York City and extended his power throughout Florida and 
into Batista-era Cuba.[49][50] The era of rampant and open corruption ended 
in the 1950s, when the Estes Kefauver's traveling organized crime hearings 
came to town and were followed by the sensational misconduct trials of 
several local officials. Although many of the worst offenders in government 
and the mob were not charged, the trials helped to end the sense of lawlessness 
which had prevailed in Tampa for decades.[48] Tampa grew considerably as 
a result of World War II. Prior to the United States' involvement in the 
conflict, construction began on MacDill Field, the predecessor of present-day 
MacDill Air Force Base. MacDill Field served as a main base for Army Air 
Corps and later Army Air Forces operations just before and during World 
War II, with multiple auxiliary airfields around the Tampa Bay area and 
surrounding counties. At the end of the war, MacDill remained as an active 
military installation while the auxiliary fields reverted to civilian control. 
Two of these auxiliary fields would later become the present day Tampa 
International Airport and St. Petersburg-Clearwater International Airport. 
With the establishment of an independent U.S. Air Force in 1947, MacDill 
Field became MacDill AFB. During the 1950s and 1960s Tampa saw record-setting 
population growth that has not been seen since. This amazing growth spurred 
major expansion of the city's highways and bridges bringing thousands into 
the city and creating endless possibilities for Tampa business owners who 
welcomed tourists and new citizens alike into their neighborhoods. It was 
during this time period in the city's history that two of the most popular 
tourist attractions in the area were developed – Busch Gardens and Lowry 
Park. Many of the well-known institutions that play an important role in 
the economic development of the city were established during this time 
period.[51] The University of South Florida was established in North Tampa 
in 1956 and opened for students in September 1960.[52] The school spurred 
the construction of several residential and commercial development in the 
previously agriculture-dominated area around the new campus. Overall, Tampa 
continued to expand away from the city center during the 1960s as new hospitals, 
schools, churches and subdivisions all began appearing to accommodate the 
growth. Many business offices began moving away from the traditional downtown 
office building into more convenient neighborhood office plazas.[51] In 
1970, the Census Bureau reported city's population as 80.0% white and 19.7% 
black.[53] Four attempts have been made to consolidate the municipal government 
of the city of Tampa with the county government of Hillsborough County 
(1967, 1970, 1971, and 1972), all of which failed at the ballot box; the 
greatest loss was also the most recent attempt in 1972, with the final 
tally being 33,160 (31%) in favor and 73,568 (69%) against the proposed 
charter.[54] The biggest recent growth in the city was the development 
of New Tampa, which started in 1988 when the city annexed a mostly rural 
area of 24 square miles (62 km2) between I-275 and I-75. East Tampa, historically 
a mostly black community, was the scene of several race riots during and 
for some time after the period of racial segregation, mainly due to problems 
between residents and the Tampa Police Department. According to the United 
States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 170.6 square miles (442 km2) 
including 112.1 square miles (290 km2) of land and 58.5 square miles (151.5 km2) 
(34.31%) of water. The highest point in the city is only 48 feet (15 m). 
Tampa is bordered by two bodies of water, Old Tampa Bay and Hillsborough 
Bay, both of which flow together to form Tampa Bay, which in turn flows 
into the Gulf of Mexico. The Hillsborough River flows out into Hillsborough 
Bay, passing directly in front of Downtown Tampa and supplying Tampa's 
main source of fresh water. Palm River is a smaller river flowing from 
just east of the city into McKay Bay, which is a smaller inlet, sited at 
the northeast end of Hillsborough Bay[55] Tampa's geography is marked by 
the Interbay Peninsula which divides Hillsborough Bay (the eastern) from 
Old Tampa Bay (the western). Tampa's climate displays characteristics of 
a tropical climate, but is situated on the southern fringe of the humid 
subtropical climate (Köppen Cfa) zone. Tampa's climate generally features 
hot summer days with frequent thunderstorms in the summer (rain is less 
frequent in the fall and winter), and a threat of a light winter freeze 
from November 15 through March 5 caused by occasional cold fronts from 
the north. Average highs range from 70 to 90 °F (21 to 32 °C) year round, 
and lows 52 to 76 °F (11 to 24 °C).[56] Tampa's official recorded high 
has never hit 100 °F (37.8 °C) – the all-time record high temperature is 
99 °F (37 °C), recorded on June 5, 1985.[56] Because of Tampa Bay, Tampa 
is split between two USDA climate zones. According to the 2012 USDA Plant 
Hardiness Zone Map, Tampa is listed as USDA zone 9b north of Kennedy Boulevard 
away from the bay and 10a south of Kennedy Boulevard and along the bay, 
Zone 10a is about the northern limit of where coconut palms and royal palms 
can be grown, although some specimens do grow in northern Tampa. Southern 
Tampa has much more tropical foliage than the northern parts of the city. 
Temperatures are warm to hot from around mid-May through mid-October, which 
roughly coincides with the rainy season. Summertime weather is very consistent 
from June through September, with daytime highs near 90 °F (32 °C), lows 
in the mid-70s °F (23–24 °C), and high humidity. Afternoon thunderstorms, 
usually generated by the interaction of the Gulf and Atlantic sea breezes, 
are such a regular occurrence during the summer that the Tampa Bay area 
is recognized as the "Lightning Capital of North America". Every year, 
Florida averages 10 deaths and 30 injuries from lightning strikes, with 
several of these usually occurring in or around Tampa.[57] Because of the 
frequent summer thunderstorms, Tampa has a pronounced wet season, receiving 
an average of 26.1 inches (663 mm) of rain from June to September but only 
about 18.6 inches (472 mm) during the remaining eight months of the year. 
The historical averages during the late summer, especially September, are 
augmented by passing tropical systems, which can easily dump many inches 
of rain in one day. Tropical Storm Debby in 2012 dropped 8.57 inches (218 mm) 
of rain at Tampa International Airport on June 24, 2012 and amounts up 
to 10.36 inches (263 mm) was reported by a CoCoRaHS observer in NW Tampa.[58] 
Outside of the summer rainy season, most of the area's precipitation is 
delivered by the occasional passage of a weather front.[56] The regular 
summertime afternoon thundershowers occasionally intensify into a severe 
thunderstorm, bringing heavy downpours, frequent lightning, strong straight-line 
winds, and sometimes hail. Though it is affected by tropical storms every 
few years and threatened by tropical systems almost annually, Tampa has 
not taken a direct hit from a hurricane since 1921.[59] That seemed about 
to change in 2004, when Hurricane Charley was forecast to make landfall 
near downtown Tampa, with potentially devastating effects for the entire 
region. The danger prompted one of the largest evacuations in state history.[citation 
needed] But Charley never reached Tampa Bay. After paralleling Florida's 
southwest coastline, the storm swerved to the east and slammed into Punta 
Gorda instead. In the winter, average temperatures range from the low to 
mid 70s °F (21–24 °C) during the day to the low to mid 50s °F (10–13 °C) 
at night. However, sustained colder air pushes into the area on several 
occasions every winter, dropping the highs and lows to 15 °F (8 °C) or 
more below the seasonal averages for several days at a time. The temperature 
can fall below freezing an average of 2 to 3 times per year, though this 
does not occur every season.[60] Since the Tampa area is home to a diverse 
range of freeze-sensitive agriculture and aquaculture, hard freezes, although 
very infrequent, are a major concern. Since Tampa has some characteristics 
of a tropical climate, hard freezes (defined as below 28 °F (−2.2 °C)) 
happen rarely (every 5 to 20 years depending on location). The last officially 
recorded freeze at Tampa International Airport took place on the morning 
of January 13, 2011, when the temperature dropped to 31 °F (−1 °C).[61] 
The lowest temperature ever recorded in Tampa was 18 °F (−8 °C) on December 
13, 1962.[56] The last measurable snow in Tampa fell on January 19, 1977, 
with a total accumulation of 0.2 inches (0.5 cm). Three major freezes occurred 
in the 1980s: in January 1982, January 1985, and December 1989. The losses 
suffered by farmers forced many to sell off their citrus groves, which 
helped fuel a boom in subdivision development in the 1990s and 2000s.[62][63] 
In January 2010, a prolonged cold snap was the longest stretch of cold 
weather in the history of Tampa.[64] Temperatures did not get above 49 °F 
(9.4 °C) for 5 days and there were freezes every night in northern Tampa 
for a week straight, causing significant damage to tropical foliage. The 
city is divided into many neighborhoods, many of which were towns and unincorporated 
communities annexed by the growing city. Generally, the city is divided 
into the following areas: Downtown Tampa, New Tampa, West Tampa, East Tampa, 
North Tampa, and South Tampa. Well-known neighborhoods include Ybor City, 
Forest Hills, Ballast Point, Sulphur Springs, Seminole Heights, Tampa Heights, 
Palma Ceia, Hyde Park, Davis Islands, Tampa Palms, College Hill, and non-residential 
areas of Gary and the Westshore Business District. Tampa displays a wide 
variety of architectural designs and styles. Most of Tampa's high rises 
demonstrate Post-modern architecture. The design for the renovated Tampa 
Museum of Art, displays Post-modern architecture, while the city hall and 
the Tampa Theatre belong to Art Deco architecture. The Tampa mayor Pam 
Iorio made the redevelopment of Tampa's downtown, especially residential 
development, a priority.[69] Several residential and mixed-development 
high-rises have been constructed. Another of Mayor Iorio's initiatives 
was the Tampa Riverwalk, a mixed use path along the Hillsborough River 
in downtown and Channelside (Channelside was recently approved[70] to undergo 
major renovations by Tampa Bay Lightning owner Jeff Vinik along with other 
investors). Several museums are part of the plan, including new homes for 
the Tampa Bay History Center, the Tampa Children's Museum, and the Tampa 
Museum of Art.[71] Mayor Bob Buckhorn has continued these developments. 
Tampa is the site of several skyscrapers. Overall, there are 18 completed 
buildings that rise over 250 feet (76 m) high. The city also has 69 high-rises,[72] 
second only to Miami in the state of Florida. The tallest building in the 
city is 100 North Tampa, formerly the AmSouth Building, which rises 42 
floors and 579 feet (176 m) in Downtown Tampa.[73] The structure was completed 
in 1992, and is the tallest building in Florida outside of Miami and Jacksonville.[73] 
100 North Tampa (1992) Bank of America Plaza (1986) One Tampa City Center 
(1981) SunTrust Financial Centre (1992) The Element (2009) Park Tower (1972) 
Rivergate Tower (1988) The Sunshine Skyway Bridge (1987) The Sulphur Springs 
Water Tower, a landmark in Sulphur Springs section of the city, dates back 
to the late 1920s. This boom period for Florida also saw the construction 
of an ornate movie palace, the Tampa Theatre, a Mediterranean revival on 
Davis Islands, and Bayshore Boulevard, which borders Hillsborough Bay from 
downtown Tampa to areas in South Tampa. The road has a 6-mile (10 km) continuous 
sidewalk on the eastern end, the longest in the world.[74][75] The Ybor 
City District is home to several buildings on the National Register of 
Historic Places and has been declared a National Historic Landmark. Notable 
structures include El Centro Español de Tampa, Centro Asturiano de Tampa 
and other social clubs built in the early 1900s. Babe Zaharias Golf Course 
in the Forest Hills area of Tampa has been designated a Historical Landmark 
by the National Register of Historic Places. It was bought in 1949 by the 
famous 'Babe', who had a residence nearby, and closed upon her death. In 
1974, the city of Tampa opened the golf course to the public.[76] The Story 
of Tampa, a public painting by Lynn Ash, is a 4-by-8-foot (1.2 m × 2.4 m) 
oil on masonite mural that weaves together many of the notable aspects 
of Tampa's unique character and identity. It was commissioned in 2003 by 
the city's Public Art Program and can be found in the lobby of the Tampa 
Municipal Office Building.[77] Park Tower (originally the First Financial 
Bank of Florida) is the first substantial skyscraper in downtown Tampa. 
Completed in 1973, it was the tallest skyscraper in Tampa until the completion 
of One Tampa City Center in 1981.[78] The Rivergate building, a cylindrical 
building known as the "Beer Can building", was featured in the movie "The 
Punisher". Spanning the southern part of Tampa Bay, is the massive steel-span 
Sunshine Skyway Bridge. Tampa is home to the Bro Bowl, one of the last 
remaining skateparks built during skateboarding's "Golden Era" in the 1970s. 
It opened in 1979 and was constructed by Tampa Parks and Recreation. It 
was the first public skatepark to be constructed in Florida and the third 
on the East Coast.[citation needed] As of 2000, the largest European ancestries 
in the city were German (9.2%), Irish (8.4%), English (7.7%), Italian (5.6%), 
and French (2.4%).[12] As of 2010, there were 157,130 households out of 
which 13.5% were vacant. In 2000, 27.6% households had children under the 
age of 18 living with them, 36.4% were married couples living together, 
16.1% had a female householder with no husband present, and 42.9% were 
non-families. 33.7% of all households were made up of individuals and 10.2% 
had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average 
household size was 2.36 and the average family size was 3.07. In 2000, 
the city's population was spread out with 24.6% under the age of 18, 10.0% 
from 18 to 24, 32.3% from 25 to 44, 20.5% from 45 to 64, and 12.5% who 
were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 34.7 years old. For every 
100 females there were 95.3 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, 
there were 92.1 males. In 2006, the median income for a household in the 
city was $39,602, and the median income for a family was $45,823. Males 
had a median income of $40,461 versus $29,868 for females. The per capita 
income for the city was $26,522. 20.1% of the population and 16.4% of families 
were below the poverty line. 31.0% of those under the age of 18 and 13.6% 
of those 65 and older are living below the poverty level. As of 2000, those 
who spoke only English at home accounted for 77.4% of all residents, while 
22.6% spoke other languages in their homes. The most significant was Spanish 
speakers who made up 17.8% of the population, while French came up as the 
third most spoken language, which made up 0.6%, and Italian was at fourth, 
with 0.6% of the population.[84] There is a large gay population and a 
gay cultural center known as the GaYbor District. Communities of faith 
have organized in Tampa from 1846, when a Methodist congregation established 
the city's first church,[85] to 1939, when a 21-year-old Billy Graham began 
his career as a spiritual evangelist and preacher on downtown's Franklin 
Street,[86] and through to today. Among Tampa's noteworthy religious structures 
are Sacred Heart Catholic Church, a 1905 downtown landmark noted for its 
soaring, Romanesque revival construction in granite and marble with German-crafted 
stained glass windows,[87] the distinctive rock and mortar St. James Episcopal 
House of Prayer, listed with the U.S. historic registry,[88] and the St. 
Paul AME church, which has seen the likes of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.,[86] 
and President Bill Clinton speak from its pulpit.[89] The later two have 
been designated by the city government as Local Landmark Structures.[90] 
Tampa's religious community includes a broad representation of Christian 
denominations, including those above, and Presbyterian, Lutheran, Christian 
Science, Church of God, United Church of Christ, Philippine Independent 
Church, Unitarian Universalist, Metropolitan Community Church, Seventh-day 
Adventist, Eastern Orthodox (Greek, Coptic, Syrian, and OCA), various Pentecostal

which is projected to increase to 922,000 by 2015.[101] Several large corporations, 
such as banks and telecommunications companies, maintain regional offices 
in Tampa. Several Fortune 1000 companies are headquartered in the metropolitan 
area,[102] including OSI Restaurant Partners, WellCare, TECO Energy, and

and redevelopment in line with a general national trend toward urban residential 
development. As of April 2007, the Tampa Downtown Partnership noted development 
proceeding on 20 residential, hotel, and mixed-use projects.[104] Many 
of the new downtown developments are nearing completion in the midst of 
a housing market slump, which has caused numerous projects to be delayed 
or revamped, and some of the 20 projects TDP lists have not broken ground 
and are being refinanced. Nonetheless several developments are nearing 
completion, which city leaders hope will make downtown into a 24-hour neighborhood 
instead of 9 to 5 business district.[105] As of 2010, Tampa residents faced 
a decline in rent of 2%. Nationally rent had decreased 4%.[106] The Tampa 
Business Journal found Tampa to be the number two city for real estate 
investment in 2014.[107] Tampa's port is now the seventh largest in the 
nation and Florida's largest tonnage port, handling nearly half of all 
seaborne commerce that passes through the state. Tampa currently ranks 
second in the state behind Miami in terms of cruise ship travel. Besides 
smaller regional cruise ships such as Yacht Starship and SunCruz Casino, 
Tampa also serves as a port of call for three cruise lines: Holland America's 
MS Ryndam, Royal Caribbean's Grandeur of the Seas and Radiance of the Seas, 
and Carnival's Inspiration and Legend.[108] The main server farm for Wikipedia 
and other Wikimedia Foundation projects is located in Tampa.[109] MacDill 
Air Force Base remains a major employer as the parent installation for 
over 15,000 active uniformed military, Department of Defense (DoD) civil 
service and DoD contractor personnel in the Tampa Bay area. A significant 
majority of the civil service and contractor personnel are, in fact, themselves 
retired career military personnel. In addition to the 6th Air Mobility 
Wing, which is "host wing" for the base, MacDill is also home to Headquarters, 
United States Central Command (USCENTCOM), Headquarters, United States 
Special Operations Command (USSOCOM), the 927th Air Refueling Wing, Headquarters, 
United States Marine Forces Central Command (USMARCENT), Headquarters, 
United States Special Operations Command Central (USSOCCENT), and numerous 
other military activities of the active and reserve components of the armed 
forces. Since the year 2000, Tampa has seen a notable upsurge in high-market 
demand from consumers, signaling more wealth concentrated in the area.[110] 
Tampa is home to a variety of stage and performing arts venues and theaters, 
including The David A. Straz Jr. Center for the Performing Arts, Tampa

is rated sixth on Maxim magazine's list of top party cities.[111] The area 
has become a "de facto" headquarters of professional wrestling, with many 
pros living in the area.[112][113][114][115] WWE's developmental territory, 
Florida Championship Wrestling, is also based in Tampa. Tampa is home to 
several death metal bands, an extreme form of heavy metal music that evolved 
from thrash metal. Many of the genre's pioneers and foremost figures are 
based in and around the city. Chief among these are Deicide, Six Feet Under, 
Obituary, Cannibal Corpse, and Morbid Angel. The Tampa scene grew with 
the birth of Morrisound Recording, which established itself as an international 
recording destination for metal bands.[116] The underground rock band, 
the Baskervils, got their start in Tampa. They played the Tampa Bay area 
between 1994 and 1997 and then moved to New York City. Underground hip-hop 
group Equilibrium is based out of Tampa, as well as the Christian metalcore 
band, Underoath. In 2009, the new Frank Wildhorn musical Wonderland: Alice's 
New Musical Adventure hosted its world premiere at the Straz Center. The

area holds the record for the world's largest food truck rally. In addition 
to Ybor, the areas of Seminole Heights and South Tampa are known for their 
restaurants. Tampa is most famous though for the Cuban sandwich and Deviled 
crab. Tampa is considered to be where the Cuban sandwich started, though 
it is disputed by Miami. Historian Andrew Huse states that "the old 'mixtos' 
coalesced into something more distinct – the Cuban sandwiches we know and 
love – an original Tampa creation."[117] In April 2012, the "Historic Tampa 
Cuban Sandwich" was designated as the "signature sandwich of the city of 
Tampa" by Tampa's city council.[118] Tampa's Cuban sandwiches are different 
from other regional versions because Genoa salami is usually added to Cubans 
in the Tampa area, which derived from Italian immigrants living next to 
Cubans and Spaniards in Ybor City.[119][120] Tampa is also where many restaurant 
chains have either started out or are headquartered, such as Outback Steakhouse, 
Melting Pot, Front Burner Brands, Carrabba's, Fleming's Prime Steakhouse 
& Wine Bar, Bonefish Grill, Columbia Restaurant, Checkers and Rally's, 
Taco Bus, and PDQ. The city of Tampa operates over 165 parks and beaches

has announced plans to sail out of Tampa for the first time. The 2,240 
passenger MS Norwegian Star will be Tampa's largest cruise ship when it 
debuts a seasonal schedule in 2011. Cruise itineraries from Tampa include 
stops in the Eastern and Western Caribbean islands, Honduras, Belize, and 
Mexico.[126] Perhaps the most well known and anticipated events are those 
from Tampa's annual celebration of "Gasparilla", particularly the Gasparilla 
Pirate Festival, a mock pirate invasion held since 1904 in late January 
or early February. Often referred to as Tampa's "Mardi Gras", the invasion 
flotilla led by the pirate ship, Jose Gasparilla, and subsequent parade 
draw over 400,000 attendees, contributing tens of millions of dollars to 
the city's economy. Beyond the initial invasion, numerous Gasparilla festivities 
take place each year between January and March, including the Gasparilla 
Children's Parade, the more adult-oriented Sant'Yago Knight Parade, the 
Gasparilla Distance Classic, Gasparilla Festival of the Arts, and the Gasparilla 
International Film Festival, among other pirate themed events.[127] Other 
notable events include the Outback Bowl, which is held New Year's Day at 
Raymond James Stadium. Each February, The Florida State Fair brings crowds 
from across the state, while "Fiesta Day" celebrates Tampa's Cuban, Spanish, 
German, Italian, English, Irish, Jewish, and African-Cuban immigrant heritage. 
The India International Film Festival (IIFF) of Tampa Bay also takes place 
in February. In April the MacDill Air Fest entertains as one of the largest 
military air shows in the U.S. Guavaween, a nighttime street celebration 
infuses Halloween with the Latin flavor of Ybor City.[128] Downtown Tampa 
hosts the largest anime convention in Florida, Metrocon, a three-day event 
held in either June or July at the Tampa Convention Center.[129] Ybor also 
hosts "GaYbor Days", an annual street party in the GLBT-friendly GaYbor 
district.[130] The Tampa International Gay and Lesbian Film Festival, held 
annually since 1989, is the city's largest film festival event,[131] and 
one of the largest independent gay film festivals in the country.[132] 
Tampa hosted the 2012 Republican National Convention and the 15th International 
Indian Film Academy Awards in April 2014.[133][134] Tampa is represented 
by teams in three major professional sports leagues: the National Football 
League, the National Hockey League, and Major League Baseball. The NFL's 
Tampa Bay Buccaneers and the NHL's Tampa Bay Lightning call Tampa home, 
while the Tampa Bay Rays of the MLB play across the bay in St. Petersburg. 
As indicated by their names, these teams, plus several other sports teams, 
represent the entire Tampa Bay metropolitan area. The Tampa Bay Buccaneers 
began in 1976 as an expansion team of the NFL. They struggled at first, 
losing their first 26 games in a row to set a league record for futility. 
After a brief taste of success in the late 1970s, the Bucs again returned 
to their losing ways, and at one point lost 10+ games for 12 seasons in 
a row. The hiring of Tony Dungy in 1996 started an improving trend that 
eventually led to the team's victory in Super Bowl XXXVII in 2003 under 
coach Jon Gruden. Tampa has hosted four Super Bowls: Super Bowl XVIII (1984), 
Super Bowl XXV (1991), Super Bowl XXXV (2001), and Super Bowl XLIII (2009). 
The first two events were held at Tampa Stadium, and the other two at Raymond 
James Stadium. The Tampa Bay Storm of the Arena Football League moved to 
Tampa from Pittsburgh in 1991 and won ArenaBowl V that year. They have 
won 4 more ArenaBowls since then: ArenaBowl VII, IX, X, and XVII, and also 
appeared in ArenaBowl I, III, XII and XXIII.[135] They are tied for the 
most Arena Bowl titles. Tampa was also home to the Tampa Bay Bandits of 
the United States Football League. The Bandits were moderately successful, 
making the playoffs two of the three years they existed before the league 
folded in 1987.[136] They played at Tampa Stadium and hosted the 1984 USFL 
Championship Game.[137] The Tampa Bay area has long been home to spring 
training, minor league, and excellent amateur baseball. The Tampa Bay Rays 
(originally "Devil Rays") began playing in 1998 at Tropicana Field in St. 
Petersburg. After a decade of futility, the Rays won the 2008 American 
League Pennant and made it to the World Series. As of 2015, this is still 
the teams only appearance in the World Series. They also won the American 
League East in 2008 and 2010. In 2007, the team began the process of searching 
for a stadium site closer to the center of the area's population, possibly 
in downtown Tampa, and in January 2016, the St. Petersburg City Council 
approved a plan to allow the Rays to leave the stadium early.[138][139] 
Several Major League baseball teams conduct spring training in the area, 
and most also operate minor league teams in the Class-A Florida State League. 
The New York Yankees and the affiliated Tampa Yankees use George M. Steinbrenner 
Field across Dale Mabry Highway from Raymond James Stadium. The NHL's Tampa 
Bay Lightning was established in 1992, and currently play their home games 
in the Amalie Arena, located in downtown Tampa. In 2004, the team won their 
first Stanley Cup. The Lightning made the Eastern Conference Final in 2011 
and were Eastern Conference Champions in 2015. They returned to the Eastern 
Conference Final in 2016. The Tampa Bay Rowdies compete in the North American 
Soccer League (2nd Division). The team began play in 2010, and have played 
at Al Lang Field in St. Petersburg in 2011. The Rowdies were crowned NASL 
champions in 2012. Previously, Tampa had hosted two top-level soccer teams. 
The Tampa Bay Rowdies of the original North American Soccer League was 
the area's first major sports franchise, beginning play in 1975. The Rowdies 
were an immediate success, drawing good crowds and winning Soccer Bowl 
'75 in their first season to bring Tampa its first professional sports 
championship. Though the NASL ceased operations in 1984, the Rowdies continued 
to compete in various soccer leagues until folding in 1993. The city was 
home to the Major League Soccer team Tampa Bay Mutiny. The Mutiny were 
the first MLS club to win the Supporters' Shield in the league's history. 
The club operated from 1996 until 2001 when local ownership could not be 
secured. The city has no current representation in MLS. The University 
of South Florida is the only NCAA Division I sports program in Tampa. USF 
began playing intercollegiate sports in 1965. The South Florida Bulls established 
a basketball team in 1971 and a football team in 1997. The Bulls joined 
the Big East in 2005, and the football team rose to as high as #2 in the 
BCS rankings in 2007. They are now part of the American Athletic Conference.

County from Tampa city limits: the Howard Frankland Bridge (I-275), the 
Courtney Campbell Causeway (SR 60), and the Gandy Bridge (U.S. 92). The 
old Gandy Bridge was completely replaced by new spans during the 1990s, 
but a span of the old bridge was saved and converted into a pedestrian 
and biking bridge renamed The Friendship Trail. It is the longest overwater 
recreation trail in the world.[148] However, the bridge was closed in 2008 
due to structural problems.[149] There are two major expressways (toll) 
bringing traffic in and out of Tampa. The Lee Roy Selmon Expressway (SR 
618) (formerly known as the Crosstown Expressway), runs from suburban Brandon 
at its eastern terminus, through Downtown Tampa, to the neighborhoods in

at Tampa Union Station, a historic facility, adjacent to downtown between 
the Channel District and Ybor City. The station is served by Amtrak's Silver 
Star, which calls on Tampa twice daily: southbound to Miami and northbound 
for New York City.[157] Union Station also serves as the transfer hub for 
Amtrak Thruway Motorcoach service, offering bus connections to several 
cities in Southwest Florida and to Orlando.[157] Uceta Rail Yard on Tampa's 
east side services CSX as a storage and intermodal freight transport facility. 
Freight and container cargo operations at the city's seaports also depend
