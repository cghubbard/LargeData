The 1921 Detroit Tigers finished in sixth place in the American League, 
27 games behind the Yankees, with a record of 71–82. Despite their sixth-place 
finish, the 1921 Tigers amassed 1,724 hits and a team batting average of 
.316—the highest team hit total and batting average in American League 
history. Detroit outfielders Harry Heilmann and Ty Cobb finished No. 1 
and No. 2 in the American League batting race with batting averages of 
.394 and .389, and all three Detroit outfielders (Heilmann, Cobb, and Bobby 
Veach) ranked among the league leaders in batting average and RBIs. As 
early proof of the baseball adage that "Good Pitching Beats Good Hitting", 
the downfall of the 1921 Tigers was the absence of good pitching. The team 
ERA was 4.40, they allowed nine or more runs 28 times, and only one pitcher 
(Dutch Leonard) had an ERA below 4.24. Catcher Johnny Bassler had a career 
on-base percentage of .416 in nine major league seasons, the second highest 
all time among major league catchers. He was considered the best catcher 
in baseball from 1921 to 1925, finishing in the top seven in the American 
League MVP voting three straight years: 6th in 1922, 7th in 1923, and 5th 
in 1924. Bassler was an outstanding offensive and defensive player. Baseball 
historian Bill James wrote that, "if his major league career wasn’t so 
short he would rank among the top 20 catchers of all time."[1] Because 
of the brevity of his major league career, James ranked Bassler as the 
47th best catcher of all time. Bassler was a career .304 hitter who walked 
437 times, while striking out only 81 times. That is a ratio of 5.4 walks 
per strikeout – one of the highest in major league history. His 1925 total 
of 57.3 at bats per strikeout is one of the highest in American League 
history. First baseman Lu Blue was a switch-hitter who had a career on-base 
percentage of .402. The 1921 season was Blue's first in the major leagues, 
and he hit .308 with a .416 on-base percentage and 131 runs scored. Blue 
was the Tigers' starting first baseman from 1921 to 1927, hitting above 
.300 four times, including a .311 season in 1924. He finished among the 
top vote getters in the American League Most Valuable Player voting three 
times for the Tigers: 10th in 1922, 19th in 1924, and 12th in 1925. Blue 
was among the league leaders in bases on balls ten times in his career 
(1921–1923, 1925–1931). With his ability to get on base, Blue was also 
a top run scorer, with 1151 runs scored in his career, including six seasons 
with 100 or more runs. Blue was also one of the best fielding first basemen 
of his era. In 1571 games at first base, Blue had 15,644 putouts and a 
career range factor of 10.60 – almost 3.00 full points above the league 
average of 7.64 for first basemen in his era. Second baseman Ralph Young 
played for the Tigers from 1915 to 1921. At 5'5", Young was one of the 
shortest players ever to wear the Tigers' uniform. His small stature, and 
correspondingly small strike zone, assisted him in both collecting walks 
and avoiding strikeouts. In nine seasons, Young collected 495 bases on 
balls and struck out only 254 times (in 3,643 at bats). In 1921, he hit 
.299 and was the only Detroit position player at the end of the season 
who fell short of the .300 mark. Shortstop Donie Bush was Detroit's starting 
shortstop for thirteen seasons from 1909 to 1921. In 1914, Bush had 425 
putouts (still the major league record for shortstops) and 969 chances 
(still the American League record). During the decade from 1910 to 1919, 
no one had more bases on balls than Bush. Bush also ranked among the league 
leaders in stolen bases nine times. With his ability to get on base, Bush 
was also among the league leaders in runs scored ten times. Bush was released 
by the Tigers in late August 1921 and signed by the Washington Senators. 
After Bush was released, Ira Flagstead and Herm Merritt played shortstop 
for Detroit during the balance of the 1921 season. Despite batting .370 
in his rookie season, Merritt did not make the team in 1922 and never played 
another major league game. Merritt died in 1927 at age 26. Left fielder 
Harry Heilmann won the first of his four American League batting crowns 
in 1921, hitting .394. On July 8, 1921, Heilmann hit a home run in Detroit 
that the New York Tribune reported measured 610 feet – one of the longest 
home runs ever hit by a Tiger. In addition to winning the batting crown, 
Heilmann also led the league with 237 hits and was among the league leaders 
with a .444 on-base percentage (3rd best), .606 slugging percentage (2nd 
best), 365 total bases (2nd best), 43 doubles (3rd best), 139 RBIs (2nd 
best), and 76 extra base hits (3rd best). Heilmann also won batting crowns 
in 1923, 1925, and 1927. Heilmann and Ted Williams are the last two American 
League players to hit .400, Heilmann having accomplished the feat in 1923 
with a batting average of .403. As of the end of the 2009 season, Heilmann's 
career batting average of .342 is the 12th highest in major league history.[2] 
In 1921, the Tigers' owner, Frank Navin, signed center fielder Ty Cobb 
to take over for Hughie Jennings as the team's manager. The signing caught 
the baseball world off-guard. Universally disliked (even by the members 
of his own team) but a legendary player, Cobb's management style left a 
lot to be desired. He expected as much from his players as he gave, and 
most of the men did not meet his standard.[3][4] As a player, Cobb continued 
to excel, finishing second in the AL batting race to Heilmann with a .389 
batting average, with a .596 slugging percentage (3rd in the AL), 124 runs 
(5th in the AL), 22 stolen bases (4th in the AL), 197 hits (8th in the 
AL), 65 extra base hits (7th in the AL), and 101 RBIs (9th in the AL). 
Bobby Veach was Detroit's starting left fielder for eleven years from 1913 
to 1923. Despite being one of the most productive hitters in baseball during 
his years in Detroit, Veach played in the shadows of three Detroit outfielders 
who won 16 batting titles and were inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame: 
Ty Cobb, Sam Crawford, and Harry Heilmann. Veach had 128 RBIs (4th in the 
AL) and hit .338 (9th in the AL) in 1921. He led the league in RBIs three 
times (1915, 1917, and 1918) and was among the league leaders 10 times. 
Nobody in baseball hit as many RBIs or extra base hits as Veach did during 
his prime from 1915 to 1922. Veach also ranked among the league leaders 
in batting average six times and had a career batting average of .311. 
Veach was also a superior left fielder. His 384 putouts in 1921 and 26 
assists in 1920 are among the highest ever by a left fielder. In 1921, 
Veach was the subject of an unusual motivational tactic by new player-manager 
Ty Cobb. Cobb believed that Veach, who came to bat with a smile and engaged 
in friendly conversation with umpires and opposing pitchers, was too easygoing. 
Detroit Tigers historian, Fred Lieb, described Veach as a "happy-go-lucky 
guy, not too brilliant above the ears", who "was as friendly as a Newfoundland 
pup with opponents as well as teammates."[5] Hoping to light a fire in 
Veach, Cobb persuaded Harry Heilmann, who followed Veach in the batting 
order, to taunt Veach from the on-deck circle. "I want you to make him 
mad. Real mad. . . . [W]hile you’re waiting, call him a yellow belly, a 
quitter and a dog. … Take that smile off his face." The tactic may have 
worked, as Veach had career-highs in RBIs (126) and home runs (16), and 
his batting average jumped from .308 to .338. Cobb had promised to tell 
Veach about the scheme when the season was over, but he never did. When 
Heilmann tried to explain, Veach reportedly snarled, "Don’t come sucking 
around me with that phony line." Veach never forgave Heilmann.[6] Dutch 
Leonard was the "ace" of the Tigers' pitching staff in 1921 with a 3.75 
ERA—the only pitcher with an ERA below 4.00. In 1914, Leonard set the major 
league record for the lowest single-season ERA of all time–0.96. Through 
his years in Detroit, Leonard fought with manager Ty Cobb. Even before 
their player-manager feud, Leonard and Cobb had a history. In 1914, Leonard 
hit Cobb in the ribs with a fastball. In the next at bat, Cobb dragged 
a bunt down the first base line and ran directly at Leonard who was covering 
the bag. Cobb later called Leonard a "damned coward" for running toward 
the dugout to avoid being cut by Cobb's spikes.[7] During a 1922 argument, 
Leonard cursed Cobb to his face and ended up quitting the team, calling 
Cobb a "horse's ass."[8] When Leonard returned to the Tigers in 1924, the 
feud resumed. In 1925, Leonard had an 11–3 record, but Cobb called him 
shirker. Leonard accused Cobb of over-working him, and Cobb responded in 
July 1925 by leaving Leonard on the mound for an entire game despite Leonard's 
giving up 20 hits and taking a 12–4 beating. After that, Leonard refused 
to pitch for Cobb, and the Tigers put Leonard on waivers, ending Leonard's 
career.[9] In 1926, Leonard sought his revenge, accusing Cobb of being 
involved in fixing games with Tris Speaker. To corroborate his story, Leonard 
produced letters (including one written by Cobb) that obliquely referred 
to gambling or game fixing. When Judge Landis made Leonard's letters public, 
it touched off a scandal. However, Leonard declined to appear and testify 
at a hearing called by Judge Landis, saying he feared a physical attack 
from "that wild man." In the absence of Leonard's testimony, Landis found 
Cobb and Speaker not guilty. Hooks Dauss played his entire fifteen-year 
career with the Tigers and is the team's all time wins leader. Though he 
was among top five in wins five times, Dauss had a 10–15 record in 1921 
with a 4.33 ERA. Dauss was an excellent fielding pitcher. His career range 
factor of 2.28 is 0.65 points higher than the average pitcher of his era. 
He had 1128 assists in his career, and is career fielding percentage of 
.968 was also 20 points higher than the average pitcher of his era. Dauss 
committed only one error in the combined 1923 and 1924 seasons in nearly 
100 games pitched. Howard Ehmke led the 1921 team with 13 wins but had 
an overall record of 13–14 with a 4.54 ERA. Ehmke ranks No. 16 on the all 
time major league list for hitting batsmen with a pitch. He hit 137 batters 
in his career and led the AL in the category in 1921 and six other times, 
including a career-high 23 in 1922. On August 8, 1920, Ehmke shut out the 
Yankees 1–0 in one of the shortest games in AL history, lasting only 1 
hour‚ 13 minutes. In 1923, he was traded to the Boston Red Sox, where he 
won 20 games and set the AL record (still standing) for allowing the fewest 
hits (one) in two consecutive starts. The team's fourth starter, Red Oldham, 
had an 11–14 record. As an indicator of how bad the team's pitching was 
in 1921, Oldham's 4.27 ERA was the second lowest on the team. Shortly after 
an interview in which new manager Ty Cobb told a reporter that "his aim 
was to use tact and diplomacy" in dealing with players, Cobb publicly embarrassed 
Oldham, as he called time-out from his position in center field, "ran in, 
wrested the ball from Oldham's hand, and gave him a dressing-down before 
calling in a reliever."[10] Oldham appeared in the final inning of the 
1925 World Series for the Pittsburgh Pirates pitching a masterful 1–2–3 
inning against three future Hall of Famers: Sam Rice (strikeout), Bucky 
Harris, and Goose Goslin (strikeout). The Pirates won the game and the 
World Series with Oldham on the mound. Suds Sutherland was one of the most 
interesting stories of the Tigers' 1921 season. Sutherland had pitched 
a no-hitter in the Pacific Coast League and made the Tigers' team in 1921. 
One month into the season, he had a record of 5–0. He was 6–2 in his first 
eight starts. On top of his fine pitching, Sutherland was batting .407 
in the first two months of the season. However, Sutherland's career came 
to an abrupt end in June 1921, as Sutherland found himself in the middle 
of the Babe Ruth–Ty Cobb feud. In a game against the Yankees, Babe Ruth 
reportedly hit a 3–0 pitch off Sutherland into the upper deck. Cobb ran 
in from center field and took out his anger on the rookie pitcher. Though 
he had the best record on the pitching staff, Cobb never forgave Sutherland 
for giving up a mammoth blast to the Babe. As a result, Sutherland did 
not pitch for the Tigers (or for any major league team) after June 1921. 
[1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] Infielders Other batters Coaches The 1921 
Tigers were one of the best hitting teams in baseball history. Their team 
batting average of .316 is the highest in American League history and the 
second highest in modern major league history, trailing only the 1930 New 
York Giants, who had a team batting average of .319. (The American League 
batting average in 1921 was .302, and the National League batting average 
in 1930 was .309. So measured against the league batting average for their 
respective seasons, the 1921 Tigers were 14 points above average, and the 
1930 Giants were ten points above league average.) The Tigers also amassed 
1724 hits in 1921—the highest single season total by any team in American 
League history. Only one other American League team and four National League 
teams (all during an aberrant 1930 season when the National League batting 
average was .309) have had 1700 hits in a single season. They are: The 
1921 Tigers had six starters with batting averages of .300 or higher: All 
three Tigers outfielders were among the league leaders in RBIs in 1921. 
Despite having one of the best batting lineups in baseball history, the 
1921 Tigers finished in sixth place with a losing record. As early proof 
of the baseball adage that "Good Pitching Beats Good Hitting", the downfall 
of the 1921 Tigers was the absence of good pitching. The team ERA was 4.40, 
no Detroit pitcher won more than 13 games, and only one pitcher (Dutch
