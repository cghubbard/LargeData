The Military history of African Americans spans from the arrival of the 
first black slaves during the colonial history of the United States to 
the present day. In every war fought by or within the United States, African 
Americans participated, including the Revolutionary War, the War of 1812, 
the Mexican–American War, the Civil War, the Spanish–American War, the 
World Wars, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, the Gulf War, and the wars 
in Afghanistan and Iraq as well as other minor conflicts. Atlantic slave

African people African-Americans as slaves and free blacks served on both 
sides during the war. Gary Nash reports that recent research concludes 
there were about 9000 black Patriot soldiers, counting the Continental 
Army and Navy, and state militia units, as well as privateers, wagoneers 
in the Army, servants to officers, and spies.[1] Ray Raphael notes that 
while thousands did join the Loyalist cause, "A far larger number, free 
as well as slave, tried to further their interests by siding with the patriots."[2] 
Black soldiers served in northern militias from the outset, but this was 
forbidden in the South, where slave-owners feared arming slaves. Lord Dunmore, 
the Royal Governor of Virginia, issued an emancipation proclamation in 
November 1775, promising freedom to runaway slaves who fought for the British; 
Sir Henry Clinton issued a similar edict in New York in 1779.[3] Over 100,000 
slaves escaped to the British lines, although possibly as few as 1,000 
served under arms. Many of the rest served as orderlies, mechanics, laborers, 
servants, scouts and guides, although more than half died in smallpox epidemics 
that swept the British forces, and many were driven out of the British 
lines when food ran low. Despite Dunmore's promises, the majority were 
not given their freedom.[citation needed] Many Black Loyalists' descendants 
now live in Canada and Sierra Leone. Many of the Black Loyalists performed 
military service in the British Army, particularly as part of the only 
Black regiment of the war the Black Pioneers, and others served non-military 
roles. In response, and because of manpower shortages, Washington lifted 
the ban on black enlistment in the Continental Army in January 1776. All-black 
units were formed in Rhode Island and Massachusetts; many were slaves promised 
freedom for serving in lieu of their masters; another all-African-American 
unit came from Haiti with French forces. At least 5,000 African-American 
soldiers fought as Revolutionaries, and at least 20,000 served with the 
British. Peter Salem and Salem Poor are the most noted of the African American 
Patriots during this era, and Colonel Tye was perhaps the most noteworthy 
Black Loyalist. Black volunteers also served with various of the South 
Carolina guerrilla units, including that of the "Swamp Fox", Francis Marion,[4] 
half of whose force sometimes consisted of free Blacks. These Black troops 
made a critical difference in the fighting in the swamps, and kept Marion's 
guerrillas effective even when many of his White troops were down with 
malaria or yellow fever.[citation needed] The first black American to fight 
in the Marines was John Martin, also known as Keto, the slave of a Delaware 
man, recruited in April 1776 without his owner's permission by Captain 
of the Marines Miles Pennington of the Continental brig USS Reprisal. Martin 
served with the Marine platoon on the Reprisal for a year and a half and 
took part in many ship-to-ship battles including boardings with hand-to-hand 
combat, but he was lost with the rest of his unit when the brig sank in 
October 1777.[5] At least 12 other black men served with various American 
Marine units in 1776–1777; more may have been in service but not identified 
as blacks in the records. However, in 1798 when the United States Marine 
Corps (USMC) was officially re-instituted, Secretary of War James McHenry 
specified in its rules: "No Negro, Mulatto or Indian to be enlisted".[5] 
Marine Commandant William Ward Burrows instructed his recruiters regarding 
USMC racial policy, "You can make use of Blacks and Mulattoes while you 
recruit, but you cannot enlist them."[5] This policy was in line with long-standing 
British naval practice which set a higher standard of unit cohesion for 
Marines, the unit to be made up of only one race, so that the members would 
remain loyal, maintain shipboard discipline and help put down mutinies.[5] 
The USMC maintained this policy until 1942.[6][7] During the War of 1812, 
about one-quarter of the personnel in the American naval squadrons of the 
Battle of Lake Erie were black, and portrait renderings of the battle on 
the wall of the Nation's Capitol and the rotunda of Ohio's Capitol show 
that blacks played a significant role in it. Hannibal Collins, a freed 
slave and Oliver Hazard Perry's personal servant, is thought to be the 
oarsman in William Henry Powell's Battle of Lake Erie.[9] Collins earned 
his freedom as a veteran of the Revolutionary War, having fought in the 
Battle of Rhode Island. He accompanied Perry for the rest of Perry's naval 
career, and was with him at Perry's death in Trinidad in 1819.[10] No legal 
restrictions regarding the enlistment of blacks were placed on the Navy 
because of its chronic shortage of manpower. The law of 1792, which generally 
prohibited enlistment of blacks in the Army became the United States Army's 
official policy until 1862. The only exception to this Army policy was 
Louisiana, which gained an exemption at the time of its purchase through 
a treaty provision, which allowed it to opt out of the operation of any 
law, which ran counter to its traditions and customs. Louisiana permitted 
the existence of separate black militia units which drew its enlistees 
from freed blacks. A militia unit, The Louisiana Battalion of Free Men 
of Color, and a unit of black soldiers from Santo Domingo offered their 
services and were accepted by General Andrew Jackson in the Battle of New 
Orleans, a victory that was achieved after the war was officially over.[11] 
A number of African Americans in the Army during the Mexican–American War 
were servants of the officers who received government compensation for 
the services of their servants or slaves. Also, soldiers from the Louisiana 
Battalion of Free Men of Color participated in this war. African Americans 
also served on a number of naval vessels during the Mexican–American War, 
including the USS Treasure, and the USS Columbus.[11] The history of African 
Americans in the U.S. Civil War is marked by 186,097 (7,122 officers, 178,975 
enlisted)[12] African American men, comprising 163 units, who served in 
the Union Army during the Civil War, and many more African Americans served 
in the Union Navy. Both free African Americans and runaway slaves joined 
the fight. On the Confederate side, blacks, both free and slave, were used 
for labor. In the final months of the war, the Army was so desperate for 
additional soldiers that the Confederate Congress voted to recruit black 
troops for combat; they were to be promised their freedom. Units were in 
training when the war ended, and none served in combat.[13] From 1863 to 
the early 20th century, African American units were utilized by the Army 
to combat the Native Americans during the Indian Wars.[14] The most noted 
among this group were the Buffalo Soldiers: At the end of the U.S. Civil 
War the army reorganized and authorized the formation of two regiments 
of black cavalry (the 9th and 10th US Cavalry). Four regiments of infantry 
(the 38th, 39th, 40th and 41st US Infantry) were formed at the same time. 
In 1869, the four infantry regiments were merged into two new ones (the 
24th and 25th US Infantry). These units were composed of black enlisted 
men commanded by white officers such as Benjamin Grierson, and occasionally, 
an African-American officer such as Henry O. Flipper. The "Buffalo Soldiers" 
served a variety of roles along the frontier from building roads to guarding 
the U.S. mail.[15] These regiments served at a variety of posts in the 
southwest United States and Great Plains regions. During this period they 
participated in most of the military campaigns in these areas and earned 
a distinguished record. Thirteen enlisted men and six officers from these 
four regiments earned the Medal of Honor during the Indian Wars.[16] After 
the Indian Wars ended in the 1890s, the regiments continued to serve and 
participated in the Spanish–American War (including the Battle of San Juan 
Hill), where five more Medals of Honor were earned.[17] They took part 
in the 1916 Punitive Expedition into Mexico and in the Philippine–American 
War. In addition to the African Americans who served in Regular Army units 
during the Spanish–American War, five African American Volunteer Army units 
and seven African American National Guard units also served. Volunteer 
Army: National Guard: Of these units, only the 9th U.S., 8th Illinois, 
and 23rd Kansas served outside the United States during the war. All three 
units served in Cuba and suffered no losses to combat. After the Treaty 
of Paris, the islands of the Philippines became a colony of the United 
States. When the U.S. Military started to send soldiers into the islands, 
most of the native population who have already been fighting their former 
Spanish rulers, opposed U.S. colonization and retaliated, causing an insurrection. 
In what would be known as the Philippine-American War, the U.S. Military 
also sent colored regiments and units to stop the insurrection. However, 
due to the discrimination of African-American soldiers, many of them defected 
to the Philippine Army. One of those who defected was David Fagen, who 
was given the rank of Captain in the Philippine Army. Fagen served in the 
24th Regiment of the U.S. Army, but on November 17, 1899,[19] he defected 
to the Filipino army.[20] He became a successful guerrilla leader and his 
capture became an obsession to the U.S. military and American public. His 
defection was likely the result of differential treatment by American occupational 
forces toward black soldiers, as well as common American forces derogatory 
treatment and views of the Filipino occupational resistance, who were frequently 
referred to as "niggers" and "gugus".[21] After two other black deserters 
were captured and executed, President Theodore Roosevelt announced he would 
stop executing captured deserters.[22] As the war ended, the US gave amnesties 
to most of their opponents. A substantial reward was offered for Fagen, 
who was considered a traitor. There are two conflicting versions of his 
fate: one is that his was the partially decomposed head for which the reward 
was claimed, the other is that he took a local wife and lived peacefully 
in the mountains.[23] The U.S. armed forces remained segregated through 
World War I. Still, many African Americans eagerly volunteered to join 
the Allied cause following America's entry into the war. By the time of 
the armistice with Germany on November 11, 1918, over 350,000 African Americans 
had served with the American Expeditionary Force on the Western Front. 
Most African American units were largely relegated to support roles and 
did not see combat. Still, African Americans played a notable role in America's 
war effort. One of the most distinguished units was the 369th Infantry 
Regiment, known as the "Harlem Hellfighters", which was on the front lines 
for six months, longer than any other American unit in the war. 171 members 
of the 369th were awarded the Legion of Merit. Corporal Freddie Stowers 
of the 371st Infantry Regiment that was seconded to the 157th French Army 
division called the Red Hand Division in need of reinforcement under the 
command of the General Mariano Goybet was posthumously awarded a Medal 
of Honor[24]—the only African American to be so honored for actions in 
World War I. During action in France, Stowers had led an assault on German 
trenches, continuing to lead and encourage his men even after being twice 
wounded. Stowers died from his wounds, but his men continued the fight 
and eventually defeated the German troops. Stowers was recommended for 
the Medal of Honor shortly after his death, but the nomination was, according 
to the Army, misplaced. Many believed that the recommendation was intentionally 
ignored due to institutional racism in the Armed Forces. In 1990, under 
pressure from Congress, the Department of the Army launched an investigation. 
Based on findings from this investigation, the Army Decorations Board approved 
the award of the Medal of Honor to Stowers. On April 24, 1991–73 years 
after he was killed in action—Stowers' two surviving sisters received the 
Medal of Honor from President George H.W. Bush at the White House. The 
success of the investigation leading to Stowers' Medal of Honor later sparked 
a similar review that resulted in six African Americans being posthumously 
awarded the Medal of Honor for actions in World War II. Vernon Baker was 
the only recipient who was still alive to receive his award.[25] Some of 
the most notable African American units which served in World War I were: 
Support units included: A complete list of African-American units that 
served in the war is published in the book Willing Patriots: Men of Color 
in World War One. The book is cited in the "Further Reading" section of 
this article. Even though the U.S. government was nominally neutral in 
the wars waged by Fascists against Ethiopia and Fascists and Nazis against 
the Spanish Republic in the mid-1930s, African Americans found it hard 
to be neutral and many became Antifascist.[30] On October 4, 1935, Fascist 
Italy invaded Ethiopia. Being the only non-colonized African country besides 
Liberia, the invasion of Ethiopia caused a profound response amongst African 
Americans.[31] African Americans organized to raise money for medical supplies, 
and many volunteered to fight for the African kingdom.[32] Within eight 
months, however, Ethiopia was overpowered by the advanced weaponry and 
mustard gas of the Italian forces. Many years later Haile Selassie I would 
comment on the efforts: "We can never forget the help Ethiopia received 
from Negro Americans during the crisis. ... It moved me to know that Americans 
of African descent did not abandon their embattled brothers, but stood 
by us."[32] When General Franco rebelled against the newly established 
secular Spanish Republic, a number of African Americans volunteered to 
fight for Republican Spain. Many African Americans who were in the Abraham 
Lincoln Brigade had Communist ideals. Among these, there was Vaughn Love 
who went to fight for the Spanish loyalist cause because he considered 
Fascism to be the "enemy of all black aspirations." African-American activist 
and World War I veteran Oliver Law, fighting in the Abraham Lincoln Brigade 
during the Spanish Civil War, is believed to have been the first African-American 
officer to command an integrated unit of soldiers.[33] James Peck was an 
African American man from Pennsylvania who was turned down when he applied 
to become a military pilot in the US. He then went on to serve in the Spanish 
Republican Air Force until 1938.[34] Peck was credited with shooting down 
5 Aviación Nacional planes, 2 Heinkel He-51s from the Legion Condor and 
3 Fiat CR.32 Fascist Italian fighters. Salaria Kea was a young African 
American nurse from Harlem Hospital who served as a military nurse with 
the American Medical Bureau in the Spanish Civil War. She was one of the 
two only African American female volunteers in the midst of the war-torn 
Spanish Republican areas.[35] When Salaria came back from Spain she wrote 
the pamphlet ‘A Negro Nurse in Spain’ and tried to raise funds for the 
beleaguered Spanish Republic.[36] We call upon the president and congress 
to declare war on Japan and racial prejudice in our country. Certainly 
we should be strong enough to whip them both. Despite a high enlistment 
rate in the U.S. Army, African Americans were not treated equally. Racial 
tensions existed. At parades, church services, in transportation and canteens 
the races were kept separate. The Women's Army Corps (WAC) changed its 
enlistment policies in January 1941, allowing for African American women 
to join the ranks of Army nurses to strengthen the war effort. Much like 
with male soldiers, Black women were given separate training, inferior 
living quarters and rations. Black nurses were integrated into every day 
life with their white sisters and often felt the pain of discrimination 
and slander from the wounded soldiers they cared for and the leadership 
assigned to them.[38] The Navy did not follow suit in changing its policies 
to include women of color until January 25, 1945. The first African woman 
sworn into the Navy was Phyllis Mae Dailey, a nurse and Columbia University 
student from New York. She was the first of only four African American 
women to serve in the navy during WW2.[39] Many soldiers of color served 
their country with distinction during World War II. There were 125,000 
African Americans who were overseas in World War II. Famous segregated 
units, such as the Tuskegee Airmen and 761st Tank Battalion and the lesser-known 
but equally distinguished 452nd Anti-Aircraft Artillery Battalion[40] proved 
their value in combat, leading to desegregation of all U.S. Armed Forces 
by order of President Harry S. Truman in July 1948 via Executive Order 
9981. Benjamin O. Davis, Jr. served as commander of the famed Tuskegee 
Airmen during the War. He later went on to become the first African American 
general in the United States Air Force. His father, Benjamin O. Davis, 
Sr., had been the first African American Brigadier General in the Army 
(1940). Doris Miller, a Navy mess attendant, was the first African American 
recipient of the Navy Cross, awarded for his actions during the attack 
on Pearl Harbor. Miller had voluntarily manned an anti-aircraft gun and 
fired at the Japanese aircraft, despite having no prior training in the 
weapon's use. In 1944, the Golden Thirteen became the Navy's first African 
American commissioned officers. Samuel L. Gravely, Jr. became a commissioned 
officer the same year; he would later be the first African American to 
command a US warship, and the first to be an admiral. The Port Chicago 
disaster on July 17, 1944, was an explosion of about 2,000 tons of ammunition 
as it was being loaded onto ships by black Navy sailors under pressure 
from their white officers to hurry. The explosion in Northern California 
killed 320 military and civilian workers, most of them black. It led a 
month later to the Port Chicago Mutiny, the only case of a full military 
trial for mutiny in the history of the U.S. Navy against 50 African-American 
sailors who refused to continue loading ammunition under the same dangerous 
conditions. The trial was observed by the then young lawyer Thurgood Marshall 
and ended in conviction of all of the defendants. The trial was immediately 
and later criticized for not abiding by the applicable laws on mutiny, 
and it became influential in the discussion of desegregation. During World 
War II, most male African American soldiers still served only as truck 
drivers and as stevedores (except for some separate tank battalions and 
Army Air Forces escort fighters).[41] African American women in uniform 
answered the call of duty by tending the wounded as nurses, or working 
as riveters, mail clerks, file clerks, typists, stenographers, supply clerks, 
or motor pool drivers.[42] In the midst of the Battle of the Bulge in December 
1944, General Eisenhower was severely short of replacement troops for existing 
all-white companies. Consequently, he made the decision to allow 2000 black 
servicemen volunteers to serve in segregated platoons under the command 
of white lieutenants to replenish these companies.[43] These platoons would 
serve with distinction and, according to an Army survey in the summer of 
1945, 84% were ranked "very well" and 16% were ranked "fairly well". No 
black platoon received a ranking of "poor" by those white officers or white 
soldiers that fought with them. Unfortunately, these platoons were often 
subject to racist treatment by white military units in occupied Germany 
and were quickly sent back to their old segregated units after the end 
of hostilities in Germany. Despite their protests, these brave African 
American soldiers ended the war in their old non-combat service units. 
Though largely forgotten after the war, the temporary experiment with black 
combat troops proved a success - a small, but important step toward permanent 
integration during the Korean War.[44][45] A total of 708 African Americans 
were killed in combat during World War II.[46] In 1945, Frederick C. Branch 
became the first African-American United States Marine Corps officer. In 
1965 Marcelite J. Harris Became the first female African American United 
States Air Force officer. Some of the most notable African American Army 
units which served in World War II were: Two segregated units were organized 
by the United States Marine Corps: On January 13, 1997, President Bill 
Clinton, in a White House ceremony, awarded the nation's highest military 
honor—the Medal of Honor—to seven African-American servicemen who had served 
in World War II.[57] The only living recipient was: The posthumous recipients 
were: African American troops faced discrimination in the form of the disproportionate 
issuance of blue discharges. The blue discharge (also called a "blue ticket") 
was a form of administrative discharge created in 1916 to replace two previous 
discharge classifications, the administrative discharge without honor and 
the "unclassified" discharge. It was neither honorable nor dishonorable.[58] 
Of the 48,603 blue discharges issued by the Army between December 1, 1941 
and June 30, 1945, 10,806 were issued to African Americans. This accounts 
for 22.2% of all blue discharges, when African Americans made up just 6.5% 
of the Army in that time frame.[59] Blue discharge recipients frequently 
faced difficulties obtaining employment[60] and were routinely denied the 
benefits of the G. I. Bill by the Veterans Administration (VA).[61] In 
October 1945, Black-interest newspaper The Pittsburgh Courier launched 
a crusade against the discharge and its abuses. Calling the discharge "a 
vicious instrument that should not be perpetrated against the American 
Soldier", the Courier rebuked the Army for "allowing prejudiced officers 
to use it as a means of punishing Negro soldiers who do not like specifically 
unbearable conditions". The Courier specifically noted the discrimination 
faced by homosexuals, another group disproportionately discharged with 
blue tickets, calling them "'unfortunates' of the Nation...being preyed 
upon by the blue discharge" and demanded to know "why the Army chooses 
to penalize these 'unfortunates' who seem most in need of Army benefits 
and the opportunity to become better citizens under the educational benefits 
of the GI Bill of Rights".[62] The Courier printed instructions on how 
to appeal a blue discharge and warned its readers not to quickly accept 
a blue ticket out of the service because of the negative effect it would 
likely have on their lives.[63] The House Committee on Military Affairs 
held hearings in response to the press crusade, issuing a report in 1946 
that sharply criticized its use and the VA for discriminating against blue 
discharge holders.[64] Congress discontinued the blue discharge in 1947,[65] 
but the VA continued its practice of denying G. I. Bill benefits to blue-tickets.[61] 
On July 26, 1948, President Harry S. Truman signed Executive Order 9981 
integrating the military and mandating equality of treatment and opportunity. 
It also made it illegal, per military law, to make a racist remark. Desegregation 
of the military was not complete for several years, and all-black Army 
units persisted well into the Korean War. The last all-black unit wasn't 
disbanded until 1954. In 1950, Lieutenant Leon Gilbert of the still-segregated 
24th Infantry Regiment was court martialed and sentenced to death for refusing 
to obey the orders of a white officer while serving in the Korean War. 
Gilbert maintained that the orders would have meant certain death for himself 
and the men in his command. The case led to worldwide protests and increased 
attention to segregation and racism in the U.S. military. Gilbert's sentence 
was commuted to twenty and later seventeen years of imprisonment; he served 
five years and was released. The integration commanded by Truman's 1948 
Executive Order extended to schools and neighborhoods as well as military 
units. Fifteen years after the Executive Order, Secretary of Defense Robert 
McNamara issued Department of Defense Directive 5120.36. "Every military 
commander", the Directive mandates, "has the responsibility to oppose discriminatory 
practices affecting his men and their dependents and to foster equal opportunity 
for them, not only in areas under his immediate control, but also in nearby 
communities where they may gather in off-duty hours."[66] While the directive 
was issued in 1963, it was not until 1967 that the first non-military establishment 
was declared off-limits. In 1970 the requirement that commanding officers 
first obtain permission from the Secretary of Defense was lifted, and areas 
were allowed to be declared housing areas off limits to military personnel 
by their commanding officer.[67] Since the end of military segregation 
and the creation of an all-volunteer army, the American military saw the 
representation of African Americans in its ranks rise precipitously.[68] 
Jesse L. Brown became the U.S. Navy's first black aviator in October 1948. 
He was killed when his plane was shot down during the Battle of Chosin 
Reservoir in North Korea. He was unable to parachute from his crippled 
F4U Corsair and crash-landed successfully. His injuries and damage to his 
aircraft prevented him from leaving the plane. A white squadron mate, Thomas 
Hudner, crash-landed his F4U Corsair near Brown and attempted to extricate 
Brown but could not and Brown died of his injuries. Hudner was awarded 
the Medal of Honor for his efforts. The U.S. Navy honored Jesse Brown by 
naming a frigate after him—the USS Jesse L. Brown (FF-1089).[69] Two enlisted 
men from the 24th Infantry Regiment (still a segregated unit), Cornelius 
H. Charlton and William Thompson, posthumously received the Medal of Honor 
for actions during the war. The Vietnam War saw many great accomplishments 
by many African Americans, including twenty who received the Medal of Honor 
for their actions. African Americans during the conflict suffered disproportionately 
higher casualty rates during the early years, but after reforms were implemented 
in 1967–68 the casualty rate dropped to slightly higher than their percentage 
of the total population.[70][71] In 1967, President Lyndon B. Johnson presented 
the Medal of Honor to U.S. Army Specialist Five Lawrence Joel, for a "very 
special kind of courage—the unarmed heroism of compassion and service to 
others." Joel was the first living African American to receive the Medal 
of Honor since the Mexican–American War. He was a medic who in 1965 saved 
the lives of U.S. troops under ambush in Vietnam and defied direct orders 
to stay to the ground, walking through Viet Cong gunfire and tending to 
the troops despite being shot twice himself. The Lawrence Joel Veterans 
Memorial Coliseum in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, is dedicated to his 
honor.[72] On August 21, 1968, with the posthumous award of the Medal of 
Honor, U.S. Marine James Anderson, Jr. became the first African American 
U.S. Marine recipient of the Medal of Honor for his heroic actions and 
sacrifice of life.[citation needed] On December 10, 1968, U.S. Army Captain 
Riley Leroy Pitts became the first African American commissioned officer 
to be awarded the Medal of Honor. His medal was presented posthumously 
to his wife, Eula Pitts, by President Lyndon B. Johnson. Three out of the 
twenty-one African American Medal of Honor recipients who served in Vietnam 
were members of the 5th Special Forces Group otherwise known as The Green 
Berets. These men are as follows: Sergeant First Class Melvin Morris, SFC. 
Eugene Ashley, Jr., and SFC. William Maud Bryant. Melvin Morris received 
the Medal of Honor 44 years after the action in which he earned the Distinguished 
Service Cross. Sergeant Ashley's medal was posthumously awarded to his 
family at the White House by Vice President Spiro T. Agnew on December 
2, 1969. In 1989, President George H. W. Bush appointed Army General Colin 
Powell to the position of Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, making 
Powell the highest-ranking officer in the United States military. Powell 
was the first, and is so far the only, African American to hold that position. 
The Chairman serves as the chief military adviser to the President and 
the Secretary of Defense. During his tenure Powell oversaw the 1989 United 
States invasion of Panama to oust General Manuel Noriega and the 1990 to 
1991 Gulf War against Iraq. General Powell's four-year term as Chairman 
ended in 1993. General William E. "Kip" Ward was officially nominated as 
the first commander of the new United States Africa Command on July 10, 
2007 and assumed command on October 1, 2007. The previous Sergeant Major 
of the Marine Corps, Carlton W. Kent, is African American; as were the 
previous two before him. On January 20, 2009, Barack Obama was inaugurated 
as President of the United States, making him ex officio the first African 
American Commander-in-Chief of the United States Armed Forces. The following 
is a list of notable African American military members or units in popular
