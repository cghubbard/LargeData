Fred Hofmann (June 10, 1894 – November 19, 1964), nicknamed "Bootnose", 
was a catcher, coach and scout in Major League Baseball, as well a player 
and manager in the Minor Leagues. Listed at 5 feet 11.5 inches (1.816 m), 
175 pounds (79 kg), Hofmann batted and threw right-handed. He was born 
in St. Louis, Missouri. Hofmann began his baseball career as a grade school 
catcher in St. Louis. In the minors, he not only served as a catcher, but 
also as a manager. He started at a professional level with the Cedar Rapids 
team of the Central Association in 1915, then he served in the U.S. Navy 
during World War I from 1918 through 1919. Following his service discharge, 
Hofmann entered the majors in 1919 with the New York Yankees, sharing duties 
with Muddy Ruel and Wally Schang. He was a member of the Yankees teams 
who won the American League pennants from 1921–23, but only was used twice 
as a pinch-hitter in the 1923 World Series won by the Yankees over the 
NY Giants in six games. His most productive seasons for New York came in 
1922 (.297 in 37 games) and in 1923, when he appeared in 72 games while 
hitting .290 with career-highs in runs (24), RBI (26), hits (69) and extrabases 
(17). He also was one of three Yankee players selected to the Major League 
All-Star Team who made a tour of Japan in 1922. During the 1925 midseason, 
Hofmann was sent by the Yankees to the St. Paul Saints of the American 
Association in the same transaction that brought Mark Koenig to New York. 
Hofmann last saw major league action with the Boston Red Sox, hitting .272 
in a career-high 87 games in 1927, and .226 in 78 games in 1928. In a nine-season 
career, Hofmann was a .247 hitter (247-for-1000) with seven home runs and 
93 RBI in 378 games, including 98 runs, 49 doubles, 11 triples, six stolen 
bases, and a .308 on-base percentage. In 340 catching appearances, he committed 
just 42 errors in 1363 chances for a .969 fielding percentage. Following 
his playing career, Hofmann managed in the minors for the Mission Reds 
(PCL, 1932–33), Memphis Chicks (SA, 1935–36 [start]), Union City Greyhounds 
(1936 [end]) and Columbus Red Birds (AA, 1937), winning two pennants with 
Union City and Columbus. After that, he coached for the St. Louis Browns 
for over a decade (1938–49), remaining with them as a scout (1950–53) and 
later when the team moved to Baltimore as the Orioles in 1954. Two of his 
top finds for the Orioles were All-Star slugger Boog Powell and pitcher 
Wally Bunker, who won 19 games during his rookie season. He also was in 
a large measure responsible for the signing of third baseman Brooks Robinson, 
a future Hall of Famer. Hofmann died in St. Helena, California, at age
