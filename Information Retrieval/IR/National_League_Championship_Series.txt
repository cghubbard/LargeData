The National League Championship Series (NLCS) is a best-of-seven series 
played in October in the Major League Baseball postseason that determines 
the winner of the National League (NL) pennant. The winner of the series 
advances to play the winner of the American League (AL) Championship Series 
(ALCS) in the World Series, Major League Baseball's championship series. 
Prior to 1969, the National League champion (the "pennant winner") was 
determined by the best win-loss record at the end of the regular season. 
There were four ad hoc three-game playoff series due to ties under this 
formulation (in 1946, 1951, 1959, and 1962). (The American League had to 
resolve a tie in 1948, but used a single-game playoff.) A structured postseason 
series began in 1969, when both the National and American Leagues were 
reorganized into two divisions each, East and West. The two division winners 
within each league played each other in a best-of-five series to determine 
who would advance to the World Series. In 1985, the format changed to best-of-seven. 
The NLCS and ALCS, since the expansion to seven games, are always played 
in a 2–3–2 format: games 1, 2, 6, and 7 are played in the stadium of the 
team that has home field advantage, and games 3, 4, and 5 are played in 
the stadium of the team that does not. Home field advantage is given to 
the team that has the better record, with the exception that the team that 
made the postseason as the Wild Card team cannot get home field advantage. 
From 1969 to 1993, home field advantage was alternated between divisions 
each year regardless of regular season record and from 1995 to 1997 home 
field advantage was predetermined before the season. In 1981, a divisional 
series was held due to a split season caused by a players' strike. In 1994, 
the league was restructured into three divisions, with the three division 
winners and a wild-card team advancing to a best-of-five postseason round, 
the National League Division Series (NLDS). The winners of that round advance 
to the best-of-seven NLCS. Every current National League franchise has 
appeared in the NLCS at least once. The Houston Astros made four NLCS appearances 
before moving to the AL in 2013. As of the 2015 season, the Milwaukee Brewers 
are the only franchise to play in both the NLCS (in 2011) and the ALCS 
(in 1982). No franchise has won both the National and American League Championship 
Series. The Warren C. Giles Trophy, named for the president of the NL from 
1951 to 1969, is awarded to the NLCS winner.[1] A Most Valuable Player 
(MVP) award is given to the outstanding player in each series, though voters 
can consider performances made during the divisional series. The MVP award 
has been given to a player on the losing team twice, in 1986 to Mike Scott 
of the Houston Astros and in 1987 to Jeff Leonard of the San Francisco 
Giants. Although the National League began its LCS MVP award in 1977, the
