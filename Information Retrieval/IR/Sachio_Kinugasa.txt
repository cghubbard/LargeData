Records Sachio Kinugasa (衣笠 祥雄, born January 18, 1947 in Kyoto, Japan) 
is a former Japanese baseball player with Hiroshima Carp. He is nicknamed 
Tetsujin, meaning "Iron Man". He played in a then world-record 2,215 consecutive 
games, passing Lou Gehrig's mark in 1987. (This record was later broken 
by Cal Ripken, Jr. in 1996.) Kinugasa is mostly remembered for his consecutive 
game streak, but he ranks 7th in Nippon Professional Baseball in career 
home runs (504), 5th in career hits (2543), and 10th in career RBIs (1448), 
showing that he was one of the most consistent hitters in Japanese baseball. 
He was inducted into the Japanese Baseball Hall of Fame in 1996. Kinugasa's 
father was an African American serviceman stationed in Japan after World 
War II. Kinugasa's mother was Japanese, and she raised him by herself.[1] 
Kinugasa entered the Heian high school in Kyoto, and advanced to the Japanese 
National High School Baseball Championship twice in his senior year as 
a catcher. He was signed by the Hiroshima Carp in 1965, and spent several 
years in the minors before being converted to first base in 1968. He became 
the team's regular first baseman, hitting 21 home runs with a .276 batting 
average. In 1975, he moved to third base at the suggestion of manager Joe 
Lutz, and his efforts helped the Hiroshima Carp win their first ever league 
championship. He led the league in stolen bases in 1976, and won the MVP 
award in 1984 as his team won the Japanese championship series. Kinugasa's 
solid hitting and defense made him one of the central players of the Carp's 
golden age in the late 70s and early 80s. His jersey number (28, later 
changed to 3) gave him the nickname, Tetsujin (Iron Man), after the robot 
manga "Tetsujin 28" (Known as Gigantor in the United States). Kinugasa 
was worthy of his nickname, playing in games even when he was badly injured. 
His consecutive game streak began in October, 1970, and ended when he retired 
in 1987, passing Lou Gehrig's record in the major leagues to become the 
world record. His streak of 2215 consecutive games played was broken in 
1996 by Cal Ripken, Jr., who played in 2632 straight games in the major 
leagues. Kinugasa currently writes baseball related articles for newspapers, 
and sometimes appears on variety television shows. His eldest son, Tomoaki, 
has had a successful career as an actor. Kinugasa was given the People's 
Honour Award for his performance in the professional leagues. He and Sadaharu 
Oh are the only baseball players to have received the award. His jersey 
number (3) was retired by the Carp in 1987. There is a baseball stadium
