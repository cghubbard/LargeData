WPIX, channel 11, is a television station located in New York City. Owned 
and operated by the Tribune Company, WPIX is an affiliate of the CW Television 
network. The station's studios and offices are located in Midtown Manhattan, 
and its transmitter is based at the Empire State Building. WPIX is also 
available as a regional superstation via satellite and cable in the United 
States and Canada. The station first signed on the air on June 15, 1948; 
it was the fifth television station to sign on in New York City and was 
the market's second independent station.[2] It was also the second of three 
stations to launch in the New York market during 1948, debuting one month 
after Newark-based independent WATV (channel 13, now PBS member station 
WNET) and two months before ABC-owned WJZ-TV (channel 7, now WABC-TV). 
Like its longtime Chicago sister station WGN-TV (which first signed on 
two months before in April 1948), WPIX's call letters come from the slogan 
of the newspaper that founded the station – in this case, the Tribune-owned 
New York Daily News, whose tagline was "New York's Picture Newspaper". 
Since 1948, WPIX's studios and offices have been located in the Daily News 
Building at Second Avenue and East 42nd Street (alternatively called "11 
WPIX Plaza") in Midtown Manhattan. In its earliest years, WPIX maintained 
a secondary studio (called "Studio Five") at 110 Central Park South, where 
programs shot in front of a studio audience were produced. Until becoming 
owned by Tribune outright in 1991, WPIX operated separately from the company's 
other television and radio outlets through the News-owned license holder, 
WPIX, Incorporated – which in 1963, purchased New York radio station WBFM 
(101.9 FM, now WFAN-FM), and soon changed that station's call letters to 
WPIX-FM (which then became WQCD in 1988). British businessman Robert Maxwell 
bought the Daily News in 1991. Tribune retained WPIX and WQCD; the radio 
station was sold to Emmis Communications in 1997. WPIX initially featured 
programming that was standard among independents: children's programs, 
movies, syndicated reruns of network programs, public affairs programming, 
religious programs and sports – specifically, the New York Yankees, whose 
baseball games WPIX carried from 1951 to 1998. To generations of New York 
children, channel 11 was also the home of memorable personalities. In 1955, 
original WPIX staffer and weather forecaster Joe Bolton, donned a policeman's 
uniform and became "Officer Joe," hosting several programs based around 
Little Rascals, Three Stooges, and later Popeye shorts. Another early WPIX 
personality, Jack McCarthy, also hosted Popeye and Dick Tracy cartoons 
as "Captain Jack" in the early 1960s, though he was also the longtime host 
of channel 11's St. Patrick's Day parade coverage from 1949 to 1992. WPIX 
aired a local version of Bozo the Clown (with Bill Britten in the role) 
from 1959 to 1964; comic performers Chuck McCann and Allen Swift also hosted 
programs on WPIX during the mid-1960s before each moved to other entertainment 
work in Hollywood. Jazz singer Joya Sherrill hosted a weekday children's 
show, Time for Joya (later known as Joya's Fun School). Channel 11 produced 
the Magic Garden series, which ran on the station from 1972 to 1984. In 
the late 1970s and 1980s, "PIX Games" (including basketball and Tic Tac 
Toe) were played during commercial breaks of afternoon programs, in which 
kids would call into the station for the chance to play for prizes. From 
its early years through the 1960s, WPIX, like the other two major independents 
in New York – WOR-TV (channel 9, now WWOR-TV) and WNEW-TV (channel 5, now 
WNYW) – struggled to acquire other programming. In 1966, WPIX debuted The 
Yule Log, which combines Christmas music with a film loop of logs burning 
inside a fireplace. Airing on Christmas Eve and/or Christmas morning initially 
until 1989, the film was made in 1966 and was shot at the Gracie Mansion, 
with the cooperation of then-Mayor John V. Lindsay. WPIX revived the Yule 
Log due to viewer demand in 2001, and has proven to be just as popular. 
Several of Tribune's other television stations (as well as WGN America 
and Antenna TV) have carried the WPIX version, complete with its audio 
soundtrack, on Christmas morning since the late 2000s. Channel 11 also 
airs a live broadcast of Midnight Mass from St. Patrick's Cathedral every 
Christmas Eve. The station's famous "Circle 11" logo – predating the existence 
of the World Trade Center, which it closely resembled – was first unveiled 
in 1969 (an advertising billboard for WPIX with the "Circle 11" logo began 
appearing that year at Yankee Stadium). By the mid-1970s, WPIX emerged 
as the second highest-rated independent station in the area, behind WNEW-TV. 
WPIX dropped the "Circle 11" when it rebranded as "11 Alive" in September 
1976, though it continued to appear during station editorials until around 
1982 (the "Alive" slogan was popularized by such stations as Atlanta's 
WXIA-TV, which itself has branded as "11 Alive" ever since that point, 
with the exception of a brief removal in 1995); the "Circle 11" logo returned 
as part of the "11 Alive" branding in 1984, before becoming used full-time 
in the fall of 1986. Its relaunch featured a series of humorous promos 
in which a fictional station employee, "Henry Tillman," was searching for 
a "big idea" for something uniquely New York in nature to serve as the 
perfect WPIX symbol. The running gag in these ads was the fact that Tillman 
was constantly surrounded by – but never noticed – objects resembling a 
giant "11", most notably the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center. In 
1978, WPIX was uplinked to satellite and became a superstation that was 
distributed to cable providers throughout the U.S. (many providers carried 
WPIX's signal until the early 1990s, when most systems outside of the Northeastern 
United States began replacing WPIX with the superstation feed of WGN-TV,[3] 
though the station continues to be distributed through Dish Network domestically 
(which since it halted sales of the package to new subscribers in September 
2013, is available only to grandfathered subscribers of its a la carte 
superstation tier) and on most cable and satellite providers throughout 
Canada). Two years later, WPIX began operating on a 24-hour programming 
schedule. During the late 1980s, WPIX fell to sixth place in the ratings 
among New York's VHF stations, behind WNYW (which was now owned by Fox) 
and a resurgent WWOR (then owned by MCA–Universal).[citation needed] After 
president Leavitt Pope stepped down as general manager (though he remained 
as president and CEO of WPIX), Michael Eigner was transferred from Los 
Angeles sister station KTLA to become WPIX's general manager; in 1989, 
the station engineered a slow turnaround that eventually resulted in WPIX 
becoming the leading independent station in the market. In 1994, the station 
became the exclusive home of the New York City Marathon, carrying the event 
for the next five years. It was during the initial broadcast of that event 
that WPIX unveiled a stylized "11" logo; the new numerical look eventually 
became the full-time logo, augmented with The WB's logo after the station 
affiliated with that network in 1995. On November 2, 1993, the Warner Bros. 
Television division of Time Warner and the Tribune Company announced the 
formation of The WB Television Network. Due to the company's ownership 
interest in the network (initially a 12.5% stake, before expanding to 22%), 
Tribune signed the majority of its independent stations to serve as The 
WB's charter affiliates, resulting in WPIX becoming a network affiliate 
for the first time upon its January 11, 1995 debut.[4][5] WPIX could have 
been considered The WB's "flagship" station (even though WGN-TV is actually 
the flagship station of Tribune Broadcasting) – however this is a designation 
in name only. The station was verbally branded as "The WB, Channel 11" 
(simply adding The WB name to the "Channel 11" branding in use since 1986), 
until it was simplified to "WB11" in 1997. Initially, WPIX's programming 
remained unchanged, as The WB had broadcast only primetime shows on Wednesday 
nights at its launch. Like with other WB-affiliated stations during the 
network's first four years, WPIX ran feature films and select first-run 
scripted series prior to its 10:00 p.m. newscast on nights when The WB 
did not offer network programs. WB network and syndicated daytime programs 
(such as Maury and Jerry Springer) became more prominent on channel 11's 
schedule starting in 1996 at the expense of most of its local-interest 
programming outside of news. Movies were limited to Saturday evenings and 
weekend afternoons by September 1999, when The WB completed its prime time 
expansion, at which time the network ran its programming on Sunday through 
Friday nights. On September 11, 2001, the transmitter facilities of WPIX, 
and several other New York City area television and radio stations were 
destroyed when two hijacked Boeing 767 airplanes crashed into the World 
Trade Center; both of the complex's main towers collapsed due to fires 
caused by the impact. WPIX lead engineer Steve Jacobson was among those 
who were killed in the terrorist attack.[6] WPIX's satellite feed froze 
on the last video frame received from the WTC mast, an image of the North 
Tower burning and the start of the impact of the South Tower; the image 
remained on-screen for much of the day until WPIX was able to set up alternate 
transmission facilities (the microwave relay for WPIX's satellite feed 
was also located at the World Trade Center).[7] Since then, WPIX has transmitted 
its signal from the Empire State Building.[8] On January 24, 2006, the 
Warner Bros. unit of Time Warner and CBS Corporation announced that the 
two companies would shut down The WB and UPN and in their place, would 
combine the two networks' respective programming to create a new "fifth" 
network called The CW.[9][10] As part of the announcement, Tribune signed 
a ten-year affiliation agreements with the network for 16 of its 19 WB-affiliated 
stations, including WPIX.[11] Tribune chose not to exercise an ownership 
interest in The CW – making WPIX the largest CW affiliate that is not owned 
by either CBS or Time Warner (although WPIX is the network's largest station 
by market size, CBS-owned WPSG/Philadelphia is The CW's official flagship 
station), and the largest English-language network affiliated station that 
is not an owned-and-operated station of its respective network, as well 
as the only major New York City television station that is not network-owned. 
WPIX began transitioning its on-air branding to "CW11" during the summer 
of 2006; prior to the start of the station's 10:00 p.m. newscast on September 
17, 2006 (which aired following The WB's final night of programming and 
the night prior to The CW's official launch), the station aired a video 
montage of past WPIX logos, starting with a 1948 test pattern and concluding 
with the official unveiling of the new "CW11" logo.[12] On April 2, 2007, 
investor Sam Zell announced plans to purchase the Tribune Company, with 
intentions to take the publicly traded firm private. The deal was completed 
on December 20, 2007.[13] Prior to the sale's closure, WPIX had been the 
only commercial television station in New York City to have never been 
involved in an ownership transaction (Tribune subsequently filed for Chapter 
11 bankruptcy protection in 2008, due to debt accrued from Zell's leveraged 
buyout and costs from the company's privatization; it emerged from bankruptcy 
in December 2012 under the control of its senior debt holders Oaktree Capital 
Management, Angelo, Gordon & Co. and JPMorgan Chase).[14][15] The station 
began gradually adopting a modernized "Circle 11" logo in mid-October 2008, 
featuring a slimmer version of the WB-era "11" (the CW logo is sometimes 
used next to the "Circle 11", primarily in station promos for CW programs). 
The station's branding was then changed to "PIX11" on December 1, 2008 
(the "PIX" in the call letters are pronounced phonetically, similar to 
the word "picks").[16] On August 17, 2012, Cablevision removed the station 
from its New York area systems, part of a carriage dispute with Tribune 
in which WPIX's Hartford, Philadelphia and Denver sister stations were 
removed from Cablevision's systems in those markets.[17] Cablevision accused 
Tribune of demanding higher carriage fees (claiming to total in the tens 
of millions of dollars) for use to help pay off debt, and alleged that 
it illegally bundled carriage agreements for WPIX and Hartford's WTIC-TV 
(which was later pulled as well, but unlike co-owned WCCT, was initially 
unaffected due to a separate carriage agreement); the company denied the 
claims, stating its approach complied with FCC regulations.[18] The stations 
and WGN America were restored in an agreement reached on October 26, following 
a plea by Connecticut State Senator Gayle Slossberg for the FCC to intervene 
in the dispute.[19] On May 23, 2016, WPIX owner Tribune Broadcasting and 
The CW reached a five-year affiliation agreement that renewed the network's 
affiliations with twelve of Tribune's CW-affiliated stations (including 
WPIX) through the 2020-21 television season; the deal came after a year-long 
disagreement between The CW's managing partner CBS Corporation and Tribune 
concerning financial terms, specifically the amount of reverse compensation 
that The CW had sought from the group's CW affiliates. [20][21] The station's 
digital channel is multiplexed: On January 1, 2011, Tribune launched its 
new digital broadcast network, Antenna TV, which affiliated with WPIX through 
a new fourth digital subchannel. In May 2012, WPIX moved Antenna TV to 
digital subchannel 11.2, while digital channel 11.4 was removed (Estrella 
TV, which was carried on 11.4 at the time, is now affiliated with Port 
Jervis low-power station WASA-LD, which is owned by the network's parent 
company Liberman Broadcasting). WPIX discontinued regular programming on 
its analog signal, over VHF channel 11, at 12:30 p.m. on June 12, 2009, 
as part of the federally mandated transition from analog to digital television.[23] 
The station's digital signal relocated from its pre-transition UHF channel 
33 to VHF channel 11.[24][25] WPIX airs the entire CW network schedule 
including the network's educational programming block One Magnificent Morning 
and the daytime talk show The Robert Irvine Show. WPIX serves as the flagship 
station for Springer, Maury and The Steve Wilkos Show. As most stations 
did in the late 1940s and early 1950s, WPIX aired filmed coverage of news 
events. The station's first news program, TelePIX Newsreel, was the first 
in New York City to consist entirely of filmed coverage. From 1948 to 1965, 
WPIX produced Three Star News, a 6:30pm newscast which employed a three-anchor 
format – with Kevin Kennedy reading world and national news, John Tillman 
reporting local stories and Joe Bolton as the weatherman. Bolton was later 
assigned to host children's programming and was replaced by Gloria Okon. 
The program was cancelled after an FCC complaint that some of Tillman's 
"man on the street" interviews were staged with paid actors, most notable 
of which was a "pro-Castro sympathizer", who was "interviewed" with a copy 
of the Daily Worker newspaper conveniently tucked under his arm.[citation 
needed] WPIX also produced many acclaimed[by whom?] news documentaries 
during the 1950s and early 1960s through its WPIX International production 
arm. Among its productions were The Secret Life of Adolf Hitler; Cuba, 
Castro and Communism; and the Eva Perón profile The Most Powerful Woman 
of the Century. Channel 11's efforts first got attention when the station 
covered the collision and sinking of the New York-bound oceanliner SS Andrea 
Doria off the coast of Nantucket in 1956. From 1977 to 1984, WPIX used 
the Action News title and format for its local news programs. The station 
aired a half-hour newscast at 7:30pm, and a one-hour program (which at 
some points, also ran for 30 minutes) at 10pm.[citation needed] WPIX produced 
the Independent Network News, a national newscast that was syndicated to 
independent stations from June 1980 to June 1990. The program – whose live 
feed was transmitted nationally weeknights at 9:30pm (EST) – featured the 
same on-air staff as channel 11's newscasts and was broadcast from the 
same news studio, with INN logos covering the station's own logo on various 
set pieces.[26] In New York City, WPIX paired a 10pm replay of the national 
news with a live local newscast at 10:30pm, called the Action News Metropolitan 
Report. As part of a midday expansion of INN, starting in 1981, channel 
11 also launched a newscast at 12:30pm. During the decade, WPIX also produced 
two other programs syndicated to stations that carried the INN program: 
the business-oriented Wall Street Journal Report; and From the Editor's 
Desk, a Sunday news discussion program hosted by Richard D. Heffner, host 
of the long-running public-affairs program The Open Mind. WPIX was also 
famous[citation needed] for the many post-news editorials that were delivered 
by Richard N. Hughes, vice president of news operations from 1969 to 1995. 
His editorials ended with the tagline "What's your opinion? We'd like to 
know". Periodically, he would read excerpts from viewers' letters in response 
to the editorials, invariably closing each excerpt by saying, "And that 
ends that quote." In 1984, the station renamed its local and syndicated 
news programs as The Independent News. In 1986, the national INN newscast 
was renamed USA Tonight and aired at 10pm, while the 7:30pm program retained 
the Independent News title and the 10:30 local newscast was renamed New 
York Tonight. When INN was cancelled, the 7:30 pm program ended as well, 
and WPIX focused its efforts on the 10pm newscast. Over the years, channel 
11 has won many news awards,[citation needed] and was the first independent 
station to win a New York-area Emmy Award for outstanding newscast, first 
earning the statuette in 1979 and again in 1983. It was a significant comeback 
for a news operation that was accused of falsifying news reports in the 
late 1960s, such as labeling stock footage as being shown "via satellite", 
and claiming a voice report was live from Prague when it had actually been 
made from a pay telephone in Manhattan.[citation needed] As a result, Forum 
Communications – led by future PBS and NBC News president Lawrence Grossman 
– approached the Federal Communications Commission to challenge WPIX Inc.'s 
license to operate channel 11. WPIX and the Daily News prevailed in 1979 
after years of litigation. On June 5, 2000, WPIX launched a weekday morning 
newscast, the WB11 Morning News (now the PIX Morning News),[27] which has 
grown to challenge the established network morning programs as well as 
its more direct competitor, WNYW's Good Day New York. On April 26, 2008, 
WPIX became the fourth television station in New York City to begin broadcasting 
its local newscasts in high definition. The station resumed a half-hour 
early evening newscast on September 14, 2009, that ran nightly at 6:30pm,[28][29] 
until it was replaced by syndicated reruns on June 27, 2010.[30] Three 
months later, on September 11, the station launched a weekend evening 6pm 
newscast (making WPIX one of the few U.S. television stations to carry 
an early evening newscast on weekends, without an existing weekday news 
program in that daypart).[31] On September 20, 2010, WPIX expanded its 
weekday morning newscast to five hours, with the addition of an hour at 
4am.[32] On October 11, 2010, newly appointed news director Bill Carey 
instituted controversial format changes for the newscasts in an attempt 
to boost the station's ratings. Carey made the newscasts flashier than 
they had previously been; Kaity Tong and Jim Watkins were replaced as anchors 
of the weeknight 10:00 pm broadcasts by Jodi Applegate, and multiple commentators 
and an edgy graphics and music package were introduced. The revamped newscast's 
first week was not well received by most viewers or critics, with the station 
fielding numerous complaints through phone calls, emails and Facebook comments,[33] 
as well as a scathing review in the Daily News.[33] A Facebook page was 
created calling for Tong and Watkins's return to the 10pm news.[34] WPIX's 
sports department was shut down in March 2011, with sports segments being 
reduced to a two-minute feature presented by the station's news anchors. 
In September 2011, WPIX relieved Watkins of his duties as weekend anchor, 
replacing him with Tong (who now solo anchors the 5 pm and 10 pm newscasts 
on Saturdays and Sundays). By late 2011, the station's newscast ratings 
would fall to last place. Carey, who stepped down on October 3, 2012, was 
replaced as news director by Mark Effron in April 2013.[35][36] On September 
12, 2011, WPIX restored an early evening newscast to its weeknight schedule 
with the debut of an hour-long 5:00pm broadcast, which was originally aimed 
at women between the ages of 18 and 49.[37] On December 19, 2012, Jodi 
Applegate left WPIX, to prepare for the birth of her child through a gestational 
surrogate. Morning anchor Tamsen Fadal was later named her replacement; 
the station later restored a two-anchor format with the hiring of WNBC 
sports anchor Scott Stanford as Fadal's co-anchor on the 5pm and 10pm newscasts 
in September 2013.[38] In March 2014, WPIX hired consumer reporter Arnold 
Diaz (who was fired by WNYW two months earlier due to the shutdown of its 
consumer investigative unit) to head up a new four-person investigative 
unit.[39] On April 5, 2014, WPIX moved its weekend early evening newscast 
one hour earlier, from 6:00 to 5:00pm[40] On April 23, 2014, the station 
debuted a new graphics package during its 5:00 pm newscast (the opening 
sequences used in this package had previously debuted in January 2014, 
but were updated with the revamp); along with the change, the station brought 
back Non-Stop Music's "WPIX Custom News Package", which had previously 
been used as the theme for WPIX's evening newscasts from 1994 until the 
2010 format change. On June 9, the station reduced the morning newscast 
to four hours (with the 4:00am hour replaced with syndicated programs) 
to allow the station "the flexibility to invest more resources into the 
key morning hours".[41] On July 14, 2014, John Muller (who joined WPIX 
in 1999 and served as anchor of the morning newscast from its launch until 
he left for ABC News in 2011) returned to the station as evening co-anchor; 
Scott Stanford was reassigned to lead sports anchor (as part of a gradual 
reformation of the sports department that included the launch of the highlight 
program PIX11 Sports Desk).[42] During the July 2014 ratings period and 
again during the August 2014 ratings period, WPIX beat WNYW and WNBC, earning 
3rd place in ratings only behind WABC and WCBS in the 5:00pm timeslot among 
adults 25–54 (as well as in certain other demographics) for the first time 
since 2011; it was the only newscast in the market to make year-to-year 
gains in key demographics. WPIX's newscasts also saw increases in the morning 
and at 10pm in the 25–54 demographic.[43] On April 20, 2015, WPIX debuted 
a 6pm newscast on weekdays with current evening anchors John Muller and 
Tamsen Fadal.[44] On December 8, 2015, WPIX announced the hiring of former 
WWOR anchor Brenda Blackmon, and the addition of a new 6:30pm program, 
to rival the network news on the other main stations. Kaity Tong and Blackmon 
began anchoring the broadcast on January 11, 2016. The 6:30pm newscast 
was cancelled in September 2016.[45] On April 13, 2016, WPIX made an announcement 
of more anchor changes preceding May Sweeps. This includes Scott Stanford 
moving from evening sports anchor to morning news anchor with Sukanya Krishnan. 
Kori Chambers, formally on the morning show, will move to weekends where 
he will solo anchor and handle political coverage for the station. Andy 
Adler, who handled weekend sports duties, will become the primary sports 
anchor. In addition, Kala Rama and Craig Treadway, who anchored on the 
weekends, will now anchor the first portion of the morning news (5–6 am). 
WPIX served as the longtime over-the-air television broadcaster of New 
York Yankees baseball from 1951 to 1998. For most of that time, Phil Rizzuto 
served as the primary announcer for the broadcasts; Rizzuto, with his "Holy 
Cow!" call, became very popular especially through the 1970s. At various 
points, WPIX also aired the Major League Baseball New York Giants, the 
New York Giants of the NFL and New York Jets football teams, Pro Wrestling 
such as Pro Wrestling U.S.A., AWA, UWF, NWA / WCW and briefly WWE, the 
NHL's New York Rangers and local college basketball. However, it was through 
its coverage of Yankees baseball that WPIX gained perhaps its greatest 
fame and identity. WPIX lost the broadcast rights for the Yankees to WNYW 
in 1998, more so the result of regional cable sports networks (in this 
case, the Madison Square Garden Network) gaining team broadcast rights, 
leaving broadcast stations with fewer games to air.[46] In 1999, the station 
acquired rights to New York Mets games, which up until that point had spent 
their entire televised history with WOR/WWOR.[47] As of 2015, WPIX is the 
television broadcast home of both of New York's baseball teams after signing 
an agreement with the Yankees. The two teams' flagship stations, SportsNet 
New York and the YES Network, will produce the games with their respective 
production units. The Yankees will be carried twenty times on WPIX in 2015.[48] 
In December 2014 PIX11, Tribune Broadcasting’s New York flagship station, 
Barclays Center, the Brooklyn Nets and the New York Islanders in Brooklyn 
announced a multi-year exclusive marketing partnership. WPIX was a leader 
in public affairs and special event programming, inspired by its roots 
under the ownership of the Daily News. Early on, it offered the first in-depth 
program to look at New York City government, City Hall. WPIX children's 
show personality Jack McCarthy anchored the station's coverage of the annual 
St. Patrick's Day Parade; the station later added the Columbus Day and 
National Puerto Rican Day Parade to its stable. Later on, the station produced 
Essence, a series inspired by Essence magazine and hosted by the publication's 
chief editor, Susan L. Taylor. The station also formerly aired the Macy's 
Independence Day fireworks event. Along with the New York City Marathon, 
these events moved to WNBC (channel 4) after the station joined The WB. 
Since 2013, the Macy's fireworks event is currently carried nationally 
on NBC, while WABC-TV and ESPN2 (except within the New York City region) 
broadcast the Marathon.[citation needed] Editor's Desk host Richard D. 
Heffner served as host of The Open Mind, which was produced by WPIX (and 
was concurrently aired on PBS member stations), before moving to other 
New York studios. Since 1992, WPIX has produced PIX News Closeup (hosted 
by WPIX senior correspondent Marvin Scott since its debut), a half-hour 
public affairs and interview program on Sunday mornings that focuses on 
domestic and international issues in the news, and discussions on political
