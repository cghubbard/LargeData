school districts of Clarion County have low enrollment. The Pennsylvania 
Department of Education projects that they will continue to experience 
steadily declining enrollment through 2019. A new school district composed 
of Clarion Area School District, Clarion-Limestone Area School District 
and North Clarion County School District would have a student population 
of 2500 with declining enrollment projected in all three former districts 
through 2019. A new district composed of Union School District (Pennsylvania), 
Keystone School District and adding Perry Township and Richland Township 
would have a student population under 2000 pupils. Consolidation would 
bring the elimination of costly main office, administrator positions. This 
would assist the district residents with the rising school administrator, 
employee and teachers' pension costs by controlling the need to raise taxes. 
Over the next 10 years, rural Pennsylvania school enrollment is projected 
to decrease 8 percent. The most significant enrollment decline is projected 
to be in western Pennsylvania, where rural school districts may have a 
16 percent decline. More than 40 percent of elementary schools and more 
than 60 percent of secondary schools in western Pennsylvania are projected 
to experience significant enrollment decreases (15 percent or greater).[11] 
As the enrollment declines, per pupil administrative costs of the schools 
will continue to rise. Pennsylvania has one of the highest numbers of school 
districts in the nation. In Pennsylvania, 80% of the school districts serve 
student populations under 5,000, and 40% serve less than 2,000. Less than 
95 of Pennsylvania's 501 school districts have enrollment below 1250 students, 
in 2007.[12] This results in excessive school administration bureaucracy 
and not enough course diversity.[13] In a survey of 88 superintendents 
of small districts, 42% of the 49 respondents stated that they thought 
consolidation would save money without closing any schools.[14] Property 
taxes in Pennsylvania are relatively high on a national scale. According
