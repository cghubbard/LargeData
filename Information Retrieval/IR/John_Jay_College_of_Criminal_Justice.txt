The John Jay College of Criminal Justice (John Jay) is a senior college 
of the City University of New York in Midtown Manhattan, New York City. 
John Jay was founded as the only liberal arts college with a criminal justice 
and forensic focus in the United States.[3][4] The college is known for 
its criminal justice, forensic science, forensic psychology, and public 
affairs programs. In 1964, a committee convened by the Board of Higher 
Education recommended the establishment of an independent, degree-granting 
school of police science. The College of Police Science (COPS) of the City 
University of New York was subsequently founded and admitted its first 
class in September 1965. Within a year, the school was renamed John Jay 
College of Criminal Justice to reflect broader education objectives.[5] 
The school's namesake, John Jay, was the first chief justice of the United 
States Supreme Court and one of the founding fathers of the United States. 
Jay was a native of New York City and served as governor of New York State. 
Classes were originally held at the Police Academy on East 20th Street. 
Leonard E. Reisman served as college president from 1964 to 1970, succeeded 
by Donald Riddle, president from 1970–1975. In the spring of 1970, after 
President Nixon announced that the Cambodian Campaign would be extended, 
the college held two "heated" teach-ins about the conflict.[6] Many other 
college campuses were home to student strikes across the nation. On May 
7, 1970, the faculty voted 52-39 in favor of closing the college in protest 
of President Nixon's handling of the Vietnam War and the killing of students 
by National Guardsmen at Kent State University and Jackson State College. 
But the closing of John Jay College would ultimately be up to its students, 
the faculty decided. At an impassioned student meeting, the final vote 
was 865–791 in favor of keeping the college open.[7] In the summer of 1970, 
Professor Abe Blumberg made some criticisms of the FBI and the Director 
J. Edgar Hoover in a graduate course on the sociology of law. One of his 
students, an FBI agent named Jack Shaw, examined the agency's role in American 
society in his master's thesis, granting that some of Blumberg's criticisms 
may have been valid. His paper found its way to Hoover's hands, who ordered 
that Shaw resign and told President Riddle that as long as Blumberg (a 
tenured professor) remained on the faculty, no FBI agents would attend 
John Jay. Riddle defended Blumberg, citing academic freedom.[8] After Hoover's 
death in 1972, FBI agents began to enroll again at the college.[9] The 
FBI later paid former agent Shaw $13,000 in back pay.[7] CUNY's open admissions 
Program came into effect in the fall of 1970. The program had been slated 
to begin in 1975, but was sparked into early enforcement after a group 
of students at City College demonstrated against the overwhelming whiteness 
of CUNY's student body, demanding greater access for black and Latino students. 
Adopting the Open Admissions policy meant that the University would now 
provide a place for any high school graduate who desired to attend.[10] 
Across CUNY, student enrollment ballooned. At John Jay, undergraduates 
numbered 2,600 in 1969; 4,400 in 1970; 6,700 in 1972; and 8,600 in 1973. 
The size of the faculty grew by over 200% between 1970–1972.[7] Moreover, 
the policy brought many more "civilian" (non-law enforcement) students 
to the College. The school's massive and sudden growth had a profound effect. 
More of the college's budget went toward remedial programs to help transition 
underprepared freshmen. In addition, the college broadened its curriculum, 
expanding into liberal arts. Majors including English, Math, American Studies, 
and Chemistry were introduced during this period in the early 1970s. The 
SEEK program developed during this time as well, supporting students from 
underprivileged backgrounds who showed academic promise.[7] President Riddle 
resigned to become chancellor of the University of Illinois at Chicago.[11] 
From 1975–1977, Gerald W. Lynch served as acting president, and in 1977, 
he was sworn in as college president, a position he would hold until 2004. 
As the school grew, its space constraints were felt, despite having acquired 
the Miles Shoe Building on West 59th Street (North Hall) in 1969. In 1973, 
John Jay rented the former 20th Century Fox building (South Hall) a few 
blocks from North Hall. In 1976, City University Board of Trustees threatened 
to shut down the college during a time of fiscal crisis for CUNY and New 
York City as a whole. Throughout the campaign to "save John Jay," the faculty 
and administration united to advocate the sentiment voiced by President 
Lynch in a memo: "John Jay can contribute to the city as a unique resource 
to help solve the problems of crime, public productivity, manpower needs, 
and budget management."[7] After weeks of turmoil, the college decided 
to trim its budget to remain independent rather than merge with Baruch 
College. On April 5, the Board of Higher Education voted to preserve John 
Jay. Though the budget cuts were still painful, the college community's 
efforts were successful. In 1980, at President Lynch's urging, the college 
established its first doctorate program, offering a Ph.D. in Criminal Justice 
on the heels of several Master's programs. In the next two decades of Lynch's 
presidency, enrollment and the faculty grew, the school's external activities 
expanded, and its curriculum continued to evolve. John Jay continued to 
pursue an approach to education more attuned to the liberal arts. The college 
supported more curricular cultural diversity, establishing an Ethnic Studies 
track and strengthening its Women's Studies program. Between 1985 and 1988, 
as faculty pursued more research opportunities, the amount of grant money 
given to John Jay faculty increased by over 500%.[7] Again, the college 
felt the constraints of space, and in 1986 acquired Haaren Hall (formerly 
DeWitt Clinton High School) across the intersection from North Hall.[12] 
After renovation, Haaren Hall was opened to students in 1988. The new hall 
included a spacious two-level library, christened Lloyd Sealy Library in 
1991 for Lloyd Sealy, a John Jay alumnus. In 1995, CUNY suffered another 
fiscal crisis when Governor George Pataki announced a $162 million cut 
in state financing for the university.[13] The CUNY board of trustees declared 
a state of financial emergency. By June, in response to the threat of budget 
cuts, CUNY had adopted a stricter admissions policy for its senior colleges: 
students deemed unprepared for college would not be admitted, a departure 
from the 1970 Open Admissions program, in order to save money spent on 
remedial programs.[14] The proposed $162 million in cuts was reduced to 
$102 million, which CUNY absorbed by increasing tuition by $750 and offering 
a retirement incentive plan for faculty. (In May 1996, a State Supreme 
Court justice ruled that CUNY misused their emergency financial authority 
to lay off professors, close departments, and cut remedial aid.[15]) On 
September 11, 2001, John Jay lost 67 alumni and students, many of them 
firefighters, in the World Trade Center attacks. The school resumed class 
on September 13, providing additional counseling for students, many of 
whom saw their studies and career aspirations in a new light.[16][17] In 
September 2011, John Jay dedicated a memorial to the fallen members of 
its community who died on 9/11. The memorial, a large steel fragment from 
the World Trade Center ruins, was officially unveiled in September 2013.[18][19] 
In 1998, the New York State Legislature had approved a five-year capital 
budget of $352 million for the college to improve its facilities. The college 
continued to expand its campus as enrollment grew. The "New Building," 
a 13-story tower connected to Haaren Hall's west side, opened in 2011, 
dramatically increasing the college's square footage and adding green space 
to the campus.[20] President Lynch retired in 2004, having headed the longest 
senior-level administration in City University of New York history.[21] 
He was succeeded by Jeremy Travis, who was previously a Senior Fellow at 
the Justice Policy Center and had directed the National Institute of Justice. 
John Jay joined the Macaulay Honors College, an advising program for top 
students, in September 2012.[22] In December 2012, the college received 
its largest ever donation: $5 million from adjunct professor and alumnus 
Dr. Andrew Shiva.[23] John Jay College of Criminal Justice is fully accredited 
by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education. The school is primarily 
known for its criminal justice studies, forensic psychology, and forensic 
science programs, supported by a liberal arts curriculum. The student-faculty 
ratio is 16:1, and the average freshman retention rate is 78%.[24] The 
college offers a variety of in-person, online, and hybrid courses. There

scholarship and PhDs), and service (encouraging students to give something 
back to their country).[26] The Economist ranked John Jay as the #465 best 
college in the nation.[27] As of 2016, U.S. News and World Report ranked 
John Jay's Criminology graduate program #10 nationally and its Public Affairs 
graduate program #56 in the country (in the top 20%). The same publication 
also ranked John Jay College of Criminal Justice #108 in the Regional Universities 
North Category, as well as the #34 top public school in the same region.[28] 
In an alternative ranking of the top public universities in New York for 
2016, Niche ranked John Jay #9. Niche's rankings were based on "key statistics 
and student reviews" and "the top ranked public colleges are elite academic 
institutions that provide a good value for in-state students and offer 
an exceptional college experience" according to Niche's assessment.[29]

campus as the "New Building" it has been recognized as an "overlooked architectural 
masterpiece" by The Real Deal, a leading New York City real estate news 
publication, which recently listed the building among the “ten best buildings 
to see in America” and one of “coolest works of architecture in the country.[58] 
Haaren Hall, also known as the 'Tenth Avenue building or, simply, the T 
building, is the main campus building of John Jay. Located at 899 10th 
Avenue, it houses the majority of the administrative departments and classrooms. 
Originally designed by Charles B.J. Snyder to house De Witt Clinton High 
School, the building was erected in 1903.[59] In 1988, Haaren Hall was 
acquired by John Jay and now contains the Lloyd Sealy Library, the Gerald 
W. Lynch Theater, a gymnasium, and a swimming pool. North Hall, also known 
as the N building, is located at 445 West 59th Street, diagonally across 
the intersection from Haaren Hall. Prior to the acquisition in 1973, the 
building was a shoe factory.[60] Westport Building, also referred as the 
W building, is a 24-story residential/commercial skyscraper located at 
500 West 56th Street. Constructed in 2003 by The Related Companies, the 
first two floors of Westport Building are occupied by John Jay. It was 
also the location of the John Jay branch of Barnes & Noble College Booksellers, 
until the summer of 2014, in which the bookstore was closed as the campus 
switched to a digital service.[citation needed] The BMW Building is a commercial 
skyscraper on 555 West 57th Street, opened in 1992.[citation needed] Located

and denoted "NB".) The New Building is located at 11th Avenue between West 
58th and 59th Streets. The modernistic 240 ft. tall, 13-story structure 
was designed by Skidmore, Owings and Merrill,[61] and structurally engineered 
by Leslie E. Robertson Associates. The New Building was opened on November 
2, 2011, at a cost of $600 million. The tower is directly connected to 
the western side of Haaren Hall and includes classrooms, conference rooms, 
a black box theater, a mock court, a 9/11 memorial, and an exterior roof
