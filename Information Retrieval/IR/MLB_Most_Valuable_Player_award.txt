The Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award (MVP) is an annual 
Major League Baseball (MLB) award, given to one outstanding player in the 
American League and one in the National League. Since 1931, it has been 
awarded by the Baseball Writers' Association of America (BBWAA). The winners 
receive the Kenesaw Mountain Landis Memorial Baseball Award, which became 
the official name of the award in 1944,[1] in honor of the first MLB commissioner, 
who served from 1920 until his death on November 25, 1944.[1][2] MVP voting 
takes place before the postseason, but the results are not announced until 
after the World Series. The BBWAA began by polling three writers in each 
league city in 1938, reducing that number to two per league city in 1961.[3] 
The BBWAA does not offer a clear-cut definition of what "most valuable" 
means, instead leaving the judgment to the individual voters.[4][5] First 
basemen, with 34 winners, have won the most MVPs among infielders, followed 
by second basemen (16), third basemen (15), and shortstops (15). Of the 
24 pitchers who have won the award, 15 are right-handed while 9 are left-handed. 
Walter Johnson, Carl Hubbell, and Hal Newhouser are the only pitchers who 
have won multiple times, Newhouser winning consecutively in 1944 and 1945.[6][7] 
Hank Greenberg, Stan Musial, Alex Rodriguez, and Robin Yount have won at 
different positions,[6] while Rodriguez is the only player who has won 
the award with two different teams at two different positions.[8] Barry 
Bonds has won the most often (seven times) and the most consecutively (2001–04).[9] 
Jimmie Foxx was the first player to win multiple times;[10] 9 players have 
won three times, and 19 have won twice.[11] Frank Robinson is the only 
player to win the award in both the American and National Leagues. The 
award's only tie occurred in the National League in 1979, when Keith Hernandez 
and Willie Stargell received an equal number of points.[6][12] There have 
been 17 unanimous winners, who received all the first-place votes.[3] The 
New York Yankees have the most winning players with 22, followed by the 
St. Louis Cardinals with 17 winners. The award has never been presented 
to a member of the following four teams: Arizona Diamondbacks, Miami Marlins, 
New York Mets, and Tampa Bay Rays. The most recent recipients are Josh 
Donaldson in the American League and Bryce Harper in the National League. 
In recent decades, pitchers have rarely won the award. When Justin Verlander 
won the AL award in 2011, he became the first pitcher in either league 
to be named the MVP since Dennis Eckersley in 1992. Verlander also became 
the first starting pitcher to win this award since Roger Clemens had accomplished 
the feat in 1986.[13] The National League went even longer without an MVP 
award to a pitcher—after Bob Gibson won in 1968, no pitcher in that league 
was named MVP until Clayton Kershaw in 2014.[14] Before the 1910 season, 
Hugh Chalmers of Chalmers Automobile announced he would present a Chalmers 
Model 30 automobile to the player with the highest batting average in Major 
League Baseball at the end of the season. The 1910 race for best average 
in the American League was between the Detroit Tigers' widely disliked[3][15][16] 
Ty Cobb and Nap Lajoie of the Cleveland Indians. On the last day of the 
season, Lajoie overtook Cobb's batting average with seven bunt hits against 
the St. Louis Browns. American League President Ban Johnson said a recalculation 
showed that Cobb had won the race anyway, and Chalmers ended up awarding 
cars to both players.[3] The following season, Chalmers created the Chalmers 
Award. A committee of baseball writers were to convene after the season 
to determine the "most important and useful player to the club and to the 
league". Since the award was not as effective at advertising as Chalmers 
had hoped, it was discontinued after 1914.[3] In 1922 the American League 
created a new award to honor "the baseball player who is of the greatest 
all-around service to his club".[21] Winners, voted on by a committee of 
eight baseball writers chaired by James Crusinberry,[22] received a bronze 
medal and a cash prize.[23] Voters were required to select one player from 
each team and player-coaches and prior award winners were ineligible. These 
incredible flaws resulted in Babe Ruth only winning 1 MVP as the award 
was dropped after 1928. Under the All-Star Formula, Ruth would have won 
the MVP in 1920, 1921, 1923, 1925, 1928 and 1930. The National League award, 
without these restrictions, lasted from 1924 to 1929.[3] The BBWAA first 
awarded the modern MVP after the 1931 season, adopting the format the National 
League used to distribute its league award. One writer in each city with 
a team filled out a ten-place ballot, with ten points for the recipient 
of a first-place vote, nine for a second-place vote, and so on. In 1938, 
the BBWAA raised the number of voters to three per city and gave 14 points 
for a first-place vote. The only significant change since then occurred 
in 1961, when the number of voters was reduced to two per league city.[3]
