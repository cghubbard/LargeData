Rally Squirrel is the name given to an American gray squirrel (Sciurus 
carolinensis) which appeared on the field and ran across home plate at 
Busch Stadium during a 2011 National League Division Series (NLDS) Major 
League Baseball game between the Philadelphia Phillies and St. Louis Cardinals 
on October 5, 2011. The squirrel captured American media attention,[1] 
and was adopted as an unofficial mascot by the Cardinals and the populace 
of St. Louis.[2] The Cardinals would go on to win the 2011 World Series 
in dramatic fashion.[2] On October 4, a gray squirrel appeared in the outfield 
during Game 3 of the Phillies–Cardinals National League Division Series,[3] 
causing an interruption in play.[4] During the fifth inning of Game 4 on 
October 5, a squirrel again appeared on the field.[5] Play was not interrupted, 
but the squirrel caused considerable confusion,[6] running across home 
plate as Phillies pitcher Roy Oswalt was delivering a pitch to Skip Schumaker. 
The squirrel then jumped into the stands.[7] Umpire Ángel Hernández called 
the pitch a ball; Oswalt and Philadelphia manager Charlie Manuel argued, 
unsuccessfully, that Oswalt had been distracted by the squirrel[8] and 
that "no pitch" should be called.[9] Manuel later avowed that, if he had 
a firearm, he would have shot the obstreperous rodent.[10][11][12] Some 
commentators speculated that the October 4 and October 5 squirrels were 
the same animal, but this was not proven.[3][13] Before Game 5 of the NLDS 
in Philadelphia, Oswalt was again accosted by a squirrel near the warning 
track at Citizens Bank Park.[14] Philadelphia fans taunted the Cardinals 
by throwing a stuffed squirrel into the team's bullpen. Cardinals pitcher 
Octavio Dotel retrieved it, and kept it in his locker. The Cardinals defeated 
the Phillies in five games, and Dotel said he would keep the squirrel through 
the World Series. "They didn't know that it's our good luck; they gave 
us good luck to our bullpen and that's why the bullpen has been so great 
lately", commented Dotel about the Philadelphia fans.[15][16] On October 
16 in Milwaukee, Dotel and teammates toasted the stuffed squirrel and sprayed 
it with champagne and beer while celebrating their NLCS victory over the 
Milwaukee Brewers, which sent them to the World Series against the Texas 
Rangers. On June 19, 2015, the Cardinals were once again playing the Philadelphia 
Phillies at Citizens Bank Park in Philadelphia. During the fifth inning, 
a squirrel started climbing up the net behind home plate, ran along the 
guide wire, jumped on top of the Phillies dugout, and then appeared to 
jump at Chase Utley, the Phillies second baseman. [17] Soon after, the 
appearance of the squirrel was called the return of the Rally Squirrel. 
The Cardinals won this game 12-4. [18] A Twitter account purporting to 
be that of the Rally Squirrel was activated on October 4, 2011;[3][5] by 
October 6 it had 11,000 followers[19] and 27,000 by late October.[20] By 
October 5, the squirrel had his own theme song,[21] and by October 6 Rally 
Squirrel T-shirts were in production.[22] Within a few days, these were 
reported as "flying off the shelves" with "thousands" being sold,[23] while 
Rally Squirrel costumes were reported as becoming "one of the hot Halloween 
costumes" of the season.[24] On October 11, 2011, a different Rally Squirrel 
appeared at a press conference in Kiener Plaza, where Cardinal Glennon 
Children's Foundation announced that it had adopted the Rally Squirrel 
as its mascot for a fundraising drive.[25][26] On the same date, the Cardinals 
announced that the Rally Squirrel would be participating in an October 
12 team rally[27] and that 40,000 rally towels with a squirrel motif would 
be distributed at that day's game of the 2011 National League Championship 
Series (which was Game 3, a 4-3 Cardinals victory). The Rally Squirrel, 
in the form of a performer wearing a squirrel costume with a Cardinals 
jersey, indeed joined the existing Cardinals costumed mascot Fredbird at 
pre-game rally events during the remainder of the postseason; this Rally 
Squirrel also assisted Fredbird and Team Fredbird in passing out T-shirts 
in the stands at Busch Stadium between innings. By October 14, 2011, sales 
of Rally Squirrel T-shirts had generated approximately $210,000 for the 
Cardinal Glennon Children's Foundation.[28] The Rally Squirrel gained notoriety 
again in late January 2012 when it was announced that it would be immortalized 
with a Topps baseball card. The special-edition card is actually that of 
Cardinals player Skip Schumaker but instead of the traditional "face shot" 
the card features only Schumaker's pant leg in the photo background as 
the Rally Squirrel is seen dashing across the batters box.[29] The Rally 
Squirrel was also immortalized on the St. Louis World Series rings.[30] 
A squirrel believed to be the Rally Squirrel was captured at Busch Stadium 
on October 8 and turned over to the Wildlife Rescue Center for eventual 
release in Castlewood State Park.[31][32] As of October 11, four squirrels 
had been captured at Busch Stadium.[33] The squirrel believed to be the 
actual Rally Squirrel was eventually released near the Wildlife Rescue 
Center's facility in Ballwin, Missouri.[34] On September 4, 2007, a squirrel 
darted onto the field at Busch Stadium. That squirrel, which was captured 
and released into the wild, was also nicknamed Rally Squirrel.[3] A squirrel 
which held up play several times at Progressive Field in Cleveland on August 
25, 2004 was also called Rally Squirrel.[35][36][37] Other squirrels have 
appeared on baseball playing fields from time to time, occasionally interrupting
