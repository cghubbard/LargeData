George John Mitchell Jr. (born August 20, 1933) is an American lawyer, 
businessman and politician. A Democrat, Mitchell served as a United States 
Senator from Maine from 1980 to 1995 and as Senate Majority Leader from 
1989 to 1995. Since retiring from the Senate, Mitchell has taken up a variety 
of positions in politics and business. He has taken a leading role in negotiations 
for peace in Northern Ireland and the Middle East, being specifically appointed 
United States Special Envoy for Northern Ireland (1995–2001) by President 
Clinton and as United States Special Envoy for Middle East Peace (2009–2011) 
by President Obama. He was a primary architect of the 1996 Mitchell Principles 
and the 1998 Good Friday Agreement in Northern Ireland, and was the main 
investigator in two "Mitchell Reports", one on the Arab–Israeli conflict 
(2001) and one on the use of performance-enhancing drugs in baseball (2007). 
Mitchell served as chairman of The Walt Disney Company from March 2004 
until January 2007, and later as chairman of the international law firm 
DLA Piper. He was the Chancellor of Queen's University in Belfast, Northern 
Ireland, from 1999 to 2009. Mitchell currently serves as a co-chair of 
the Housing Commission at the Bipartisan Policy Center.[2] Mitchell was 
born in Waterville, Maine. His father, George John Mitchell, Sr. (born 
Joseph Kilroy), was of ethnic Irish descent but was adopted by a Lebanese 
family when he was orphaned.[3] Mitchell's father was a janitor at Colby 
College in Waterville, where Mitchell was raised. Mitchell's mother, Mary 
(née Saad), was a textile worker who emigrated to the United States in 
1920 from Bkassine, Lebanon, at the age of eighteen. Because of his origin, 
Mitchell is recognized as a prominent Arab-American.[4] He is currently 
Penn State's Athletic Integrity Monitor.[5] Mitchell was raised a Maronite 
Catholic and in his childhood served as an altar boy at St. Joseph's Maronite 
Church in Maine.[6] Throughout junior high school and high school, Mitchell 
worked as a janitor.[7] In a family of five children, all three of Mitchell's 
brothers were athletes and though a talented student, as a child, he found 
himself overshadowed by his brothers' athletic achievements.[7] After graduating 
from high school at the age of sixteen,[3] Mitchell attended Bowdoin College 
in Brunswick, Maine, where he worked several jobs and played on the basketball 
team.[3] He graduated in 1954, intending to attend graduate school and 
then teach, but instead served in the United States Army from 1954 to 1956, 
rising to First Lieutenant. In 1961, Mitchell received his law degree from 
Georgetown University Law Center by attending its part-time program at 
night. He has since received an honorary LL.D. from Bates College. After 
having performed well academically at Georgetown, Mitchell served as a 
trial attorney for the Antitrust Division of the United States Department 
of Justice in Washington from 1960 to 1962, and then as executive assistant 
to Senator Edmund S. Muskie from 1962 to 1965, where he first gained interest 
in the political world.[7] Afterwards, Mitchell practiced law in Portland, 
Maine, from 1965 to 1977 and was assistant county attorney for Cumberland 
County, Maine, in 1971. In 1974 Mitchell won the Democratic nomination 
for governor of Maine, defeating Joseph Brennan. He lost in the general 
election to independent candidate James B. Longley, but was appointed United 
States Attorney for Maine by President Jimmy Carter in 1977. Mitchell served 
in that capacity from 1977 to 1979 when he was appointed to the United 
States District Court for the District of Maine. Mitchell served as a federal 
judge until he was appointed to the United States Senate in May 1980 by 
the governor of Maine, Joseph Brennan, when Edmund Muskie resigned to become 
U.S. Secretary of State. After serving out the remainder of Muskie's term, 
Mitchell was elected to his first full term in 1982 with approximately 
61% of the vote against Congressman David Emery, and rose quickly in the 
Senate Democratic leadership. He was elected as the chair of the Democratic 
Senatorial Campaign Committee in 1984, helping the Democrats regain control 
of the Senate in 1986 with a net eight new seats and a 55–45 majority in 
the Senate. He served as Deputy President pro tempore in the 100th United 
States Congress, because of the illness of President pro tempore John C. 
Stennis, and remains the only Senator other than Hubert Humphrey to have 
held that post. In 1988 Mitchell was reelected with 81% of the vote, the 
largest margin of victory in a Senate election that year and the largest 
majority ever for a Senator from Maine. Mitchell served as Senate Majority 
Leader from 1989 to 1995. While in this role, Mitchell led the movement 
to reauthorize the Clean Air Act in 1990 and pass the Americans with Disabilities 
Act of 1990. Additionally, under his leadership, the Senate approved the 
North American Free Trade Agreement and the formation of the World Trade 
Organization. In 1994, he turned down an offer of appointment by President 
Bill Clinton to the United States Supreme Court,[3] to replace the retiring 
Harry A. Blackmun so that he could continue helping with efforts in the 
Senate to pass significant health-care legislation. The seat ultimately 
went to Stephen Breyer. Nevertheless, Congress was not able to pass any 
significant health-care legislation at the time and Mitchell did not run 
for reelection in 1994. For 1994, Mitchell's last year in the Senate, the 
American Conservative Union gave him a rating of 0.00 on a scale of 0 to 
100, with 100 being most conservative.[8] For the same year, the Americans 
for Democratic Action gave him a score of 90 on a scale of 0 to 100, with 
100 being most liberal.[9] In the business world, Mitchell has served as 
a director of the Walt Disney Company; Federal Express Corporation; Xerox 
Corporation; Unilever; Staples, Inc.; Starwood Hotels and Resorts; and 
the Boston Red Sox baseball team. After leaving the Senate, Mitchell joined 
the Washington, D.C., law firm Verner, Liipfert, Bernhard, McPherson and 
Hand; he later became the firm's chairman. He was criticized for lobbying 
on behalf of the firm's Big Tobacco clients.[10][11] He is also senior 
counsel to Preti, Flaherty, Beliveau, Pachios, Orlick & Haley in Portland, 
Maine. He is Partner and Chairman of the Global Board of DLA Piper, US 
LLP, a global law firm. Mitchell also serves as an Advisor of ZeniMax Media 
Inc.[12] In 2007, Mitchell joined fellow former Senate Majority Leaders 
Howard Baker, Bob Dole, and Tom Daschle to found the Bipartisan Policy 
Center, a non-profit think tank that works to develop policies suitable 
for bipartisan support.[13] Mitchell was reportedly among those considered 
by Al Gore as a running mate for his 2000 presidential run. Gore, however, 
ultimately selected Joe Lieberman.[14] Had Mitchell been nominated and 
the Democratic ticket won that year, he would have been the first Arab 
American to serve as the Vice President of the United States and just the 
second Vice President from Maine after Hannibal Hamlin. He also was mentioned 
in both 2000 and in 2004 as a potential Secretary of State for a Democratic 
administration, due to his role as Senate Leader and the Good Friday agreements. 
Mitchell endorsed Mike Michaud for Governor of Maine in the 2014 election.[15] 
Since 2002, Mitchell has been a Senior Fellow and Senior Research Scholar 
at Columbia University's Center for International Conflict Resolution, 
where he works to help end or avert conflicts between nations. He was the 
Chancellor of the Queen's University of Belfast, Northern Ireland, until 
his resignation in April 2009, and namesake of the George J. Mitchell Scholarship, 
which sponsors graduate study for twelve Americans each year in the Republic 
of Ireland and Northern Ireland. He is the founder of the Mitchell Institute, 
in Portland, Maine, whose mission is to increase the likelihood that young 
people from every community in Maine will aspire to, pursue and achieve 
a college education.[16] In 2007, he became a visiting Professor in Leeds 
Metropolitan University's School of Applied Global Ethics, and the University 
is developing a new Centre for Peace and Conflict Resolution bearing his 
name.[17] Mitchell led an American fact-finding commission initiated under 
President Bill Clinton in 2000 intended to find solutions for solving the 
situation between Israel and the Palestinians. Mitchell's report, published 
in 2001, stressed the need for Israel to halt the expansion of its settlements 
in the Palestinian territories and for the Palestinians to prevent violence. 
Interest in the report was renewed when Mitchell was named Special Envoy 
for Middle East Peace in 2009.[18] Mitchell served as co-chairman (with 
Newt Gingrich) of the Congressionally mandated Task Force on the United 
Nations, which released its findings and recommendations on June 15, 2005, 
after having been formed that January. George J. Mitchell serves as an 
Honorary Co-Chair for the World Justice Project. The World Justice Project 
works to lead a global, multidisciplinary effort to strengthen the Rule 
of Law for the development of communities of opportunity and equity. Since 
1995, Mitchell has been active in the Northern Ireland peace process, having 
served as the United States Special Envoy for Northern Ireland under President 
Bill Clinton. He first led a commission that established the principles 
on non-violence to which all parties in Northern Ireland had to adhere 
and subsequently chaired the all-party peace negotiations, which led to 
the Belfast Peace Agreement signed on Good Friday 1998 (known since as 
the "Good Friday Agreement"). Mitchell's personal intervention with the 
parties was crucial to the success of the talks. He was succeeded as special 
envoy by Richard Haass. For his involvement in the Northern Ireland peace 
negotiations, Mitchell was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom (on 
March 17, 1999) and the Liberty Medal (on July 4, 1998). In accepting the 
Liberty Medal, he stated: "I believe there's no such thing as a conflict 
that can’t be ended. They’re created and sustained by human beings. They 
can be ended by human beings. No matter how ancient the conflict, no matter 
how hateful, no matter how hurtful, peace can prevail."[19] On March 4, 
2004, Disney's board of directors, on which Mitchell had served since 1995, 
named him Michael Eisner's replacement as Chairman of the Board after 43% 
of the company's shares were voted against Eisner's reelection (35% was 
the minimum for disposal). Mitchell himself received a 24% negative vote,[20] 
a fact that led dissident Disney shareholders Roy E. Disney and Stanley 
Gold to criticize the appointment of Mitchell, whom they saw as Eisner's 
puppet. Having already served on the boards of such companies as Xerox, 
Starwood, FedEx, and Staples, Mitchell assumed his new role at a particularly 
tumultuous time in the company's history, needing to face such issues as 
Comcast's hostile takeover attempts and a possible split with Pixar.[20] 
Mitchell played an important role in the selection of Robert A. Iger as 
Eisner's successor as CEO in 2005.[20] On June 28, 2006, Disney announced 
that its board had elected one of its members, John Pepper, Jr., former 
CEO of Procter & Gamble, to replace Mitchell as chairman effective January 
1, 2007.[21] In 2006, Mitchell was tapped by MLB Commissioner Bud Selig 
to lead an investigation into the use of performance-enhancing drugs by 
Major League Baseball players. The investigation derived largely from charges 
against Barry Bonds, and revelations in the Bay Area Laboratory Co-Operative 
(BALCO) trials of Victor Conte and Greg Anderson. Selig has said that revelations 
brought forth in the 2005 book Game of Shadows were, by way of calling 
attention to the issue, in part responsible for the league's decision to 
commission an independent investigation. To this day Mitchell is known 
to have held meetings with only two active players, Jason Giambi, who was 
ordered to meet Mitchell by Commissioner Selig in light of his public admissions 
on the issue, and one additional player whose name was initially not made 
public but was later revealed to be Frank Thomas.[22] Mitchell did however 
hold extensive meetings with several known steroid dealers, club attendants, 
personal trainers, and others who had ties to all players named in the 
report. Even though the union that protects the players had pressured all 
but Giambi and Thomas into maintaining the culture of silence that had 
helped the drug problem remain a secret, there was plenty of other evidence 
against those named in his report. Mitchell released a 409-page report 
of his findings on December 13, 2007.[23] The report includes the names 
of 89 former and current players for whom it claims evidence of use of 
steroids or other prohibited substances exists. This list includes names 
of Most Valuable Players and All-Stars, such as Roger Clemens, Andy Pettitte, 
Miguel Tejada, Denny Neagle, Paul Lo Duca, David Justice, Barry Bonds, 
Éric Gagné, Todd Hundley, Randy Velarde, and Benito Santiago. Mitchell 
was criticized for having a conflict of interest with the report as he 
was a director of the Boston Red Sox, especially because no prime Red Sox 
players were named in the report,[24] despite the fact that Red Sox stars 
David Ortiz and Manny Ramirez were later accused to have used performance-enhancing 
substances during the 2003 season, as reported by the New York Times on 
July 30, 2009.[25] Likewise, the report was commissioned by Selig, and 
no members of the Milwaukee Brewers, whom Selig once owned, appeared in 
the report. The Los Angeles Times reported that Mitchell acknowledged that 
his "tight relationship with Major League Baseball left him open to criticism".[26] 
Mitchell responded to the concerns by stating that readers who examined 
the report closely "will not find any evidence of bias, of special treatment 
of the Red Sox".[26] On January 22, 2009, President Barack Obama and Secretary 
of State Hillary Clinton appointed Mitchell as the administration's Special 
Envoy to the Arab-Israeli peace process, formally known as the "Special 
Envoy for Middle East Peace".[27] The appointment was seen as an indication 
of the new Obama administration's increased focus on the Israeli–Palestinian 
conflict. The choice of Mitchell allowed Obama to demonstrate the seriousness 
and sincerity of his intentions regarding the peace process, without forcing 
him to immediately embark on a specific initiative before conditions were 
yet ripe. An analyst at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars 
said Mitchell's appointment "says to the world, 'I care about this issue; 
be patient with me.'"[27] Abraham Foxman, the National Director of the 
Anti-Defamation League, has stated that, "Sen. Mitchell is fair. He's been 
meticulously even-handed".[28] Within the first week of his appointment, 
Mitchell was dispatched to visit Israel, the West Bank, Egypt, Jordan, 
Turkey, and Saudi Arabia for peace discussions in light of the 2008-09 
Gaza War between Israel and the Gaza Strip, in which both sides had recently 
entered into unilateral ceasefires. Mitchell began his meetings in Cairo 
on January 27, and Obama said his visit was part of the President's campaign 
promise to listen to both sides of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict and 
negotiate a peace deal. However, in a continuation of a George W. Bush 
administration policy, Mitchell did not plan to talk to Hamas, a group 
Israel and the US consider a terrorist organization, but instead focus 
on talks with the Palestinian National Authority.[29] Mitchell first met 
with new Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in February 2009[30] 
and has met with many notable figures of the Middle East since. In 2010 
he led the U.S. delegation to the Palestine Investment Conference.[31][32] 
On May 13, 2011, George Mitchell tendered his resignation from the post 
of Special Envoy to the Middle East.[33] President Obama praised Mitchell, 
stating, "His deep commitment to resolving conflict and advancing democracy 
has contributed immeasurably to the goal of two states [Israel and Palestine] 
living side by side in peace and security."[34] In 2012, Mitchell was asked 
to lead talks towards determining fines involved in the 2010 San Bruno 
pipeline explosion.[35] Mitchell was married for 26 years until he and 
his wife, Sally, divorced in 1987. They had a daughter, Andrea. In 1994 
he became engaged to Heather MacLachlan, 35, a sports management consultant,[36] 
whom he subsequently married in December 1994[37] and with whom he has 
a son, Andrew, and daughter called Claire in honour of Claire Bowes (née 
Gallagher) who had so inspired him when she was blinded in the Omagh bombing. 
In 2012 (BBC: George Mitchell: My journey's end) he visited Northern Ireland 
with his son the same age as Claire was when she was blinded and Claire 
was told that he had named his daughter after her because he always remembered 
her.[38] Mitchell was diagnosed with a "small, low grade, and localized" 
prostate cancer in 2007.[39] In 1994, Mitchell received the U.S. Senator 
John Heinz Award for Greatest Public Service by an Elected or Appointed 
Official, an award given out annually by Jefferson Awards.[40] In recognition 
for his role in the Northern Ireland peace process, Mitchell was awarded 
the Presidential Medal of Freedom and the Liberty Medal and was also nominated 
for the Nobel Peace Prize in 1998. For his services to the Northern Ireland 
peace process, in 1999 Mitchell was invested as an Honorary Knight Grand 
Cross of the Order of the British Empire (GBE). As custom dictates, Mitchell 
cannot call himself "Sir George" as he is not a citizen of the United Kingdom 
or a Commonwealth of Nations country. In 2003, he received the Freedom 
Medal.[41] On January 28, 2014, a portrait of Mitchell was unveiled for 
display at the Maine State Capitol alongside those of other notable Mainers.[42]
