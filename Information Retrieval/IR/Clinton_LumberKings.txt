League of Professional Baseball Clubs (1904–1907) The Clinton LumberKings 
are a Midwest League Class A minor league baseball team based in Clinton, 
Iowa, USA, affiliated with the Seattle Mariners. After beginning play in 
1895, Clinton had sporadic teams in various leagues over the next few decades, 
as the Great Depression, World War I and World War II affected many baseball 
franchises. However, Clinton joined the Midwest League in 1956 and is now 
the oldest franchise in the league.[7] The team has had several different 
major league affiliations: the Brooklyn Dodgers (1937–38), New York Giants 
(1939–41), Chicago Cubs (1947–49), Pirates (1954–58 and 1966–68), White 
Sox (1959–65), Pilots/Brewers (1969–70), Tigers (1971–75), Tigers/White 
Sox co-op (1976), Dodgers (1977–79), Giants (1980–94), Padres (1995–98), 
Reds (1999–2000), Expos (2001–02), and the Rangers (2003–08). Since 2009, 
they have been an affiliate of the Mariners.[8] Aside from its time as 
the C-Sox (1960–65) and the Pilots (1966–76), the team used the parent 
major league team's nickname before adopting the LumberKings name for the 
1994 season. The 2010 LumberKings season is the subject of the 2013 book 
"Class A: Baseball in the Middle of Everywhere" by Lucas Mann.[9] In 2016, 
led by first year manager Mitch Canham, the LumberKings won 86 games to 
set the mark for most in a regular season by any team in Clinton franchise 
history. The squad went on to sweep the Peoria Chiefs in the first round 
of the playoffs before defeating the Cedar Rapids Kernels in a thrilling 
three game series. Game three of the Western Division final ended with 
a Ricky Eusebio walk off hit to win 1-0 in extra innings. The LumberKings 
would fall, however, in the Midwest League Championship in four games to 
the Great Lakes Loons. In addition to playing host to the franchise record 
setting LumberKings (86-54), the LumberKings transformed Ashford University 
Field overnight following game two of the Midwest League Championship to 
become a football field. The LumberKings played host to Camanche High School 
Football in the inaugural "LumberBowl." Camanche hosted Williamsburg High 
School in the game on September 16, 2016. The Raiders of Williamsburg defeated 
the Indians 55-7. Pitchers Catchers Infielders Outfielders Manager Coaches
