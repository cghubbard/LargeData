The Fresno Grizzlies are a minor league baseball team based in Fresno, 
California. The team, which plays in the Pacific Coast League (PCL), is 
the Triple-A affiliate of the Houston Astros major league club. The Grizzlies 
play in Chukchansi Park (capacity 12,500), located in downtown Fresno and 
built in 2002. The Fresno Grizzlies' colors are black and orange. All games 
are broadcast on KYNO, with Doug Greenwald handling the play-by-play. Professional 
baseball first came to Fresno in 1898 when it had a team in the original 
California League. The team dropped out of the league after that year, 
but returned in 1905. In 1906, the Tacoma Tigers of the Pacific Coast League 
moved to Fresno, playing as the Fresno Raisin Eaters for one season before 
moving to Sacramento for the 1907 season. In the intervening years before 
the arrival of the Grizzlies, Fresno fielded teams in the California State 
League in 1910 and 1913, and in the current California League from 1941 
through 1988, including the Fresno Cardinals (1941–1956), Fresno Sun Sox 
(1957), Fresno Giants (1958–1987), and Fresno Suns (1988). When Major League 
Baseball awarded an expansion team (the Arizona Diamondbacks) to Phoenix, 
Arizona, that would begin playing in 1998, the Phoenix Firebirds of the 
Pacific Coast League (the San Francisco Giants' Triple-A affiliate) were 
forced to move. The Firebirds moved to Tucson, Arizona and changed their 
name to the Tucson Sidewinders while changing their affiliation to the 
Diamondbacks. That prompted Tucson Toros to move to Fresno, giving Fresno 
its first PCL team since 1906. The Toros were renamed the Grizzlies and 
became the Giants' new Triple-A affiliate.[1] From 1998 through 2001 the 
Grizzlies played at Pete Beiden Field at California State University, Fresno, 
before moving to Chukchansi Park. During the team's 11-year history in 
Fresno, it has had a number of different owners. In October 2005, the team 
was sold again, this time to Fresno Baseball Club LLC, headquartered in 
Delaware. The team hosted such promotions as K-Fed Night and Second Chance 
Night in 2006; The Price Is Right Night in 2007; and Totally Rad 80s Night 
featuring The Karate Kid star Billy Zabka in May 2008. Parker, the Grizzlies 
mascot, was named Best Mascot of 2007 by GameOps, beating out all other 
major and minor league mascots. The Grizzlies former mascot, Wild Thing, 
"retired" in 2006 after eight years as the teams mascot.[2] Chukchansi 
Park is also home to the Drag Kings, the Grizzlies' dancing grounds crew 
who were given an honorable mention by GameOps as Best Entertainment act. 
The Grizzlies won the Minor League Baseball Promotion of the Year award 
in 2008 for their "Mascot Showdown" featuring Parker and the Phillie Phanatic. 
The team's opening day catcher in 2010, Buster Posey, would be the San 
Francisco Giants' starting catcher for the World Series six months later 
(the Giants' starting catcher for most of their World Championship season, 
Bengie Molina, would start for their opponents, the Texas Rangers), resulting 
in his National League Rookie of the Year award that year. The 2012 family 
film Parental Guidance features Billy Crystal as the radio voice of the 
Fresno Grizzlies. The Grizzlies gained national attention in summer 2015 
for playing a game as The Fresno Tacos, which was done to celebrate the 
city of Fresno's annual Taco Truck Throwdown and came complete with a specially 
designed tacos uniform.[3] In 2015, they won the Triple-A Baseball National 
Championship Game by defeating the Columbus Clippers, 7–0, in El Paso, 
Texas. Pitchers Catchers Infielders Outfielders Manager Coaches 60-day
