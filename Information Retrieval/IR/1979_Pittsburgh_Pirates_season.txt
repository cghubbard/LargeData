The 1979 Pittsburgh Pirates had 98 wins and 64 losses and captured the 
National League East Division title by two games over the Montreal Expos. 
The Pirates beat the Cincinnati Reds to win their ninth National League 
title, and the Baltimore Orioles to win their fifth World Series title 
– and also their last playoff series victory to date. The wildly popular 
disco hit "We Are Family" by Sister Sledge was used as the team's theme 
song that season. Infielders Other batters Coaches October 2, Riverfront

Pirates became one of only six teams in the 20th century to have won a 
World Series after trailing three games to one. Two of those teams were 
the Pirates, in 1925 and 1979. The others were the 1903 Boston Red Sox 
(in a best-of-nine series), 1958 New York Yankees, 1968 Detroit Tigers, 
and 1985 Kansas City Royals. Five Pirates had 10 or more hits in this series, 
a World Series record. Chuck Tanner's mother died the morning of Game 5 
(this was mentioned during the telecast by announcer Howard Cosell). 1960 
World Series hero Bill Mazeroski threw out the first ball in Game 5. The 
Pittsburgh Pirates were the last team in the 20th Century to win Game 7 
of the World Series on the road. U.S. President Jimmy Carter made an appearance 
in Game 7, he threw out the first ball, and after the game made a visit 
to the victorious Pittsburgh locker room. Willie Stargell at 39 was the 
oldest player to win MVP honors for both the National League and the World 
Series.[citation needed] In the World Series, he hit .400 with a record 
seven extra-base hits and matched Reggie Jackson's record of 25 total bases, 
set in 1977. Stargell, pitcher Bruce Kison, infielder Rennie Stennett, 
and catcher Manny Sanguillén were the only players left over from the 1971 
World Series, when the Pirates faced the Orioles. Orioles' pitcher Jim 
Palmer, Mark Belanger, and manager Earl Weaver were the only ones who were 
still with the team that faced the Pirates in 1971. As was the case when 
the same two teams played in the 1971 World Series, a game in Baltimore 
was rained out. Game 1 of this series was postponed, while Game 2 of the 
1971 series had to be moved back a day. In this Series, it was the American 
League team's "turn" to play by National League rules, meaning that there 
was no designated hitter and the Orioles' pitchers would have to bat. While 
this resulted in pitcher Tim Stoddard getting his first major league hit 
and RBI in Game 4. Overall, it hurt the Orioles because Lee May, their 
designated hitter for much of the season and a key part of their offense, 
was only able to bat three times in the whole series. The Pirates wore 
four different uniform combinations during the series: gold cap, black 
jersey and gold pants for Games 1 & 5, black cap, gold jersey and black 
pants for Games 2, 6 & 7, black cap and solid white pinstriped uniform 
for Game 3 and a black cap and solid gold uniform for Game 4. October 10,
