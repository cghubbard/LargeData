Brian Michael McCann (born February 20, 1984) is an American professional 
baseball catcher for the New York Yankees of Major League Baseball (MLB). 
He played for the Atlanta Braves from 2005 through 2013. McCann is a seven-time 
All-Star and a six-time Silver Slugger Award winner. McCann was drafted 
by the Atlanta Braves in the second round of the 2002 Major League Baseball 
draft.[1] McCann made his Major League Baseball debut with the Braves on 
June 10, 2005 after playing in the minor leagues for the Rome Braves. A 
personal catcher for John Smoltz for most of the 2005 season, McCann hit 
his first home run in just his second regular-season game and became the 
first Braves player in franchise history to hit a home run in his first 
playoff at-bat on October 6, 2005. He accomplished the feat in the second 
inning of a 7–1 victory over Roger Clemens and the Houston Astros in Game 
2 of the 2005 National League Division Series. McCann was named the everyday 
starter when the Braves traded Johnny Estrada to the Diamondbacks. During 
the 2006 season, McCann hit .333 with 24 homers and 94 RBI. He led all 
Major League catchers in homers, and his RBI total was matched only by 
Jorge Posada and Victor Martinez.[2] The Braves rewarded McCann by buying 
out his arbitration years with a 6-year, $27.8 million contract during 
spring training in 2007.[2] McCann was selected to play in the 2006 MLB 
All-Star Game, in his first full major league season, and then again in 
both 2007 and 2008, making him the first Braves player ever to be selected 
to the National League All-Star team in each of his first three seasons. 
In 2008, he allowed more stolen bases than any other NL catcher, with 93.[1] 
Beginning in April 2009, McCann was bothered by blurry vision in his left 
eye, due to a slight vision change following 2007 LASIK surgery. He decided 
to opt for glasses when contact lenses proved uncomfortable.[3] In May 
2009, Oakley, Inc. made special glasses for McCann to correct the vision 
problem and allow for comfort under the catcher's mask. McCann remarked, 
"I need my Oakleys. I have to have the wraparounds for my peripheral vision."[4] 
In 2009, he had more errors at catcher than any other major leaguer, with 
12, and had the lowest fielding percentage among them (.988).[5] McCann 
was again selected for the All-Star Game in 2009 and 2010. In the latter, 
he was named the MVP after driving in all three of the National League's 
runs with a bases-clearing double in the seventh inning (driving in Scott 
Rolen, Matt Holliday, and Marlon Byrd), off of Chicago White Sox reliever 
Matt Thornton, giving the NL a 3–1 victory, its first in the midsummer 
classic since 1996. On August 23, McCann hit the first walk-off home run 
reviewed by instant replay. McCann hit a line drive to right field. The 
ball struck the top of the right field wall. The umpires called it a double, 
but McCann and Braves bench coach Chino Cadahia argued the call. The umpires 
went to go review instant replay. Replays showed that the ball struck the 
top of the right field wall, bounced into the stands, and then got onto 
the field. Thus, the umpires overturned the call and called it a walk-off 
home run.[6][7] In 2010, he allowed more stolen bases than any other NL 
catcher, with 84.[1] During spring training, on March 9, 2011, McCann hit 
a line drive foul ball which struck minor league manager Luis Salazar, 
blinding him in the left eye.[8] On May 17, 2011, McCann hit a ninth-inning, 
game-tying, pinch-hit home run and an 11th-inning game-winning two-run 
home run to defeat the Houston Astros 3–1.[9] Also in 2011, he allowed 
104 stolen bases, more than any other major league catcher.[10] On July 
27, 2012, he became the first player since Jim Thome in 2007 to homer in 
six straight games versus an opponent. He did this on the same day Chipper 
Jones tied Pete Rose's record for extra base hits by a switch hitter.[11] 
On July 14, 2013, McCann was chosen by National League manager Bruce Bochy 
to replace injured Braves first baseman Freddie Freeman in the 2013 All-Star 
Game. On November 23, 2013, McCann agreed to a five-year, $85 million contract 
with the New York Yankees, with a vesting option for a sixth year.[12] 
The Yankees officially announced the deal on December 3.[13] McCann wears 
the number 34 as number 16 is retired in honor of Whitey Ford. On May 28, 
2014, with limited options at first base, manager Joe Girardi slotted McCann 
into his first career start at first against the St. Louis Cardinals going 
2-4 with one RBI, a run scored, and a walk in a 7-4 Yankee win. On September 
28, 2014, McCann entered the game against the Boston Red Sox as a pinch 
runner for Derek Jeter, after Jeter's final career hit. On September 6, 
2015, McCann hit his career high 25th home run of the season, a game-tying 
3-run shot off of Chris Archer of the Tampa Bay Rays. On November 12, 2015, 
McCann earned his sixth Silver Slugger Award at Catcher, first in the American 
League. McCann struggled early on during the 2016 season. His home run 
pace was not as good as previous years. After the Yankees released Alex 
Rodriguez, rookie catcher Gary Sanchez was brought up to share in catching 
duties. After Sanchez had a big impact both on offense and defense, McCann 
became the primary designated hitter for the team. In 130 games, McCann 
batted .242 with 20 home runs, and 58 RBI. McCann was selected by Team 
USA in the 2009 World Baseball Classic. Brian McCann's father Howie coached 
at Marshall University and currently runs Windward Baseball Academy.[14] 
His older brother, Brad, played in the minor league systems of the Florida 
Marlins and Kansas City Royals before retiring after the 2007 season. McCann 
married Ashley Jarusinski in December 2007. Their first child, Colt Michael, 
was born in July 2012.[15] Their second child, a daughter who was named 
Colbie, was born in September 2013.[16] He resides in Suwanee, Georgia. 
He is not related to Detroit Tigers catcher James McCann, although both 
wear the same uniform number (34). In 2008, McCann released a charity wine 
(The McCann Merlot) with 100% of his proceeds supporting the Rally Foundation 
for Childhood Cancer Research, an organization dedicated to raising funds 
to support pediatric cancer research and treatments. McCann also has baseball
