The 2001 Arizona Diamondbacks, in their fourth year of existence, looked 
to improve on their 2000 season. They had to contend in what was a strong 
National League West Division. Arizona had the best one-two pitching combination 
in the majors: Curt Schilling and Randy Johnson, who combined for 43 victories. 
Outfielder Luis Gonzalez slugged 57 home runs. They finished the regular 
season with a record of 92-70, which was good enough for the division title. 
In the playoffs, they won their NLDS matchup vs. St. Louis on a walk-off 
hit by Tony Womack. They defeated the Braves in five games in the NLCS. 
In the World Series, they won a dramatic seven-game series against the 
New York Yankees on a walk-off hit by Gonzalez, against Yankees closer 
Mariano Rivera. The Arizona Diamondbacks became the fastest expansion franchise 
in Major League Baseball history to win a World Series title in just their 
fourth season. The 2001 Arizona Diamondbacks held their 4th Spring training 
at Tucson Electric Park in Tucson, Arizona. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7]
