The 1924 Washington Senators won 92 games, lost 62, and finished in first 
place in the American League. Fueled by the excitement of winning their 
first AL pennant, the Senators won the World Series in dramatic fashion, 
a 12-inning game 7 victory. The Senators' offense was led by future Hall 
of Famer Goose Goslin, who was one of the youngest players on the team. 
He drove in a league-leading 129 runs. Walter Johnson had another outstanding

pitched. Manager Bucky Harris, who was also the team's starting second 
baseman, was the highest paid player on the team, earning $9,000. [1] [2]
