Kannapolis (Kŭh-nă-pŭh-lŭs) is a city in Cabarrus and Rowan counties, in 
the U.S. state of North Carolina,[1][2] northwest of Concord and northeast 
of Charlotte and is a suburb[6] in the Charlotte metropolitan area. The 
city of Kannapolis was incorporated in 1984. The population was 42,625 
at the 2010 census,[7] which makes Kannapolis the 20th largest city in 
North Carolina. It is the home of the Kannapolis Intimidators, the Class 
A baseball affiliate of the Chicago White Sox, and it is the hometown of 
the Earnhardt racing family. The center of the city is home to the North 
Carolina Research Campus, a public-private venture that focuses on food, 
nutrition, and biotech research. Early meaning and usage of the city's 
name was a direct reference to Cannon Mills Corporation, or James William 
Cannon himself. Early published name variations include "Cannon-opolis" 
and "Cannapolis". A widely accepted origin of the word "Kannapolis" comes 
from the combination of the Greek words kanna (reeds, not looms) and polis 
(city), which some believed meant "City of Looms".[8] Dr. Gary Freeze, 
Catawba College history and politics department chairman, said a Concord 
newspaper used the name "Cannon City" in 1906. After mill workers or newspapers 
called the town "Cannapolis", J.W. Cannon asked Cabarrus County commissioners 
to give the town the name, but starting with a "K". Kannapolis historian 
Norris Dearmon said the K might have been to distinguish the town from 
his Concord mill village. Since, Freeze said, "Jim Cannon didn't study 
Greek," Cannon did not name the town "city of looms".[9]In 1906 J.W. Cannon 
purchased the land that later became Kannapolis, and acquired a total of 
1008 acres in Cabarrus and Rowan Counties. Approximately 808 of those acres 
of farmland, purchased along the historic wagon road between Salisbury 
and Charlotte, became the location of the new textile mill, Cannon Manufacturing. 
Cannon Manufacturing began production in 1908. In 1914 Cannon Manufacturing 
became known as the world’s largest producer of sheets and towels. Shortly 
after, Mr. Cannon opened plants in Rowan County, Concord and in South Carolina 
totaling 20,000 workers. Mill founder J.W. Cannon’s youngest son, Charles 
A. Cannon, consolidated all the separate mills into the giant Cannon Mills 
Company in 1928. The Meek House and Harvey Jeremiah Peeler House are listed 
on the National Register of Historic Places.[10] Kannapolis is located 
on the boundary of Cabarrus and Rowan counties, with a greater portion 
of its area in Cabarrus County. U.S. Route 29 (Cannon Boulevard) passes 
through the city east of the downtown area; U.S. 29 leads northeast 15 
miles (24 km) to Salisbury and south 7 miles (11 km) to Concord. Interstate 
85 bypasses the city on the south and the east, with access from Exits 
54 through 63 (five exits total). I-85 leads northeast 65 miles (105 km) 
to Greensboro and southwest 21 miles (34 km) to Charlotte. According to 
the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 32.5 square 
miles (84.2 km2), of which 31.9 square miles (82.7 km2) is land and 0.58 
square miles (1.5 km2), or 1.73%, is water.[7] Kannapolis City Schools 
is the primary school system for the city. Two additional systems also 
serve its jurisdiction: Cabarrus County Schools and Rowan–Salisbury School 
System. Franklin Heights Christian Academy (FHCA) is a private, non-profit 
Christian educational institution that is operated by Franklin Heights 
Baptist Church. FHCA was organized in 2009. Faith Christian Academy (FCA) 
is a private, non-profit Christian educational institution that is operated 
by Faith Baptist Church. FCA was organized in 1982. Shaw University has 
an extramural site in Kannapolis offering undergraduate, graduate and continuing 
educational programs. The North Carolina Research Campus in Kannapolis 
is a 350-acre (140 ha) research center. Corporations, universities and 
healthcare organizations have forged a public-private partnership at the 
intersection of human health, nutrition and agriculture by focusing on 
food and nutrition and biotech research. The partners include Appalachian 
State University, the David H. Murdock Research Institute, Dole Nutrition 
Research Laboratory, Duke University MURDOCK Study, General Mills, JC Med, 
Monsanto, NC A&T University, NC Central University, NC State University, 
UNC-Chapel Hill, UNC Charlotte, and UNC Greensboro. David H. Murdock, owner 
of the real estate company Castle & Cooke and former CEO of Dole Food Company, 
and Molly Corbett Broad, president of the 16-campus University of North 
Carolina system, unveiled plans on September 12, 2005, for the research 
campus, as an economic revitalization project that encompasses the site 
of the former Cannon Mills plant and entire downtown area of Kannapolis. 
During the next few years, the NC Research Campus was developed by Castle 
and Cooke in collaboration with UNC General Administration and several 
North Carolina universities, including NC State, UNC-Chapel Hill, and others. 
In 2008, faculty from NC State, UNC-Chapel Hill, UNC Charlotte, UNC Greensboro, 
NC A&T, NC Central, and Appalachian State moved into the Nutrition Research 
Institute building, operated by UNC-Chapel Hill, and the Plants for Human 
Health Institute, operated by NC State. The buildings are owned by Castle 
and Cooke, which rents the space to the UNC system in a rent-to-own agreement. 
Funding for research and education activities at NCRC comes from federal 
and private research grants and donations, which support individual laboratories, 
and from the North Carolina State budget, which supplies general operating 
expenses and salaries for faculty and support staff. Funding from the Legislature 
is disbursed to individual universities to support their operations at 
NCRC. The David H. Murdock Research Institute, a not-for-profit research 
institute, operates a Core Lab facility that offers genomic sequencing, 
metabolomics profiling, and other research services. As of the census[3]

behavior of ordinary people, which was made in 1941 by itinerant filmmaker 
H. Lee Waters, was selected by the Library of Congress for listing in the 
United States National Film Registry, as a representative of this kind 
of filmed "town portrait" popular in the 1930s and 1940s.[17] Coordinates:
