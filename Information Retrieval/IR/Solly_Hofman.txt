Arthur Frederick "Solly" Hofman (born October 29, 1882 in St. Louis, Missouri; 
died March 10, 1956 in St. Louis, Missouri) was a Major League Baseball 
player from 1903 to 1916. He played the majority of his 1,175 professional 
games in the outfield. His nickname was "Circus Solly". Some attribute 
this name to a comic strip of the era, while others attribute it to spectacular 
catches while fielding.[1] In the 1906 World Series, Hofman batted leadoff 
and played center field for the Chicago Cubs against their crosstown rivals, 
the Chicago White Sox. He had seven hits and three walks during the Series, 
batting .304. Hofman also was the Cubs' center fielder on Oct. 14, 1908 
when they defeated the Detroit Tigers 2-0 to win the 1908 World Series. 
He hit .316 for the Series. It was the Cubs' last championship to date. 
He is considered by some to be the first great utility player in baseball 
due to his versatility.[citation needed] He was the uncle of Bobby Hofman
