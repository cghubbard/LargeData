Nathaniel Read "Nate" Silver (born January 13, 1978) is an American statistician 
and writer who analyzes baseball (see sabermetrics) and elections (see 
psephology). He is the editor-in-chief of ESPN's FiveThirtyEight and a 
Special Correspondent for ABC News. Silver first gained public recognition 
for developing PECOTA,[3] a system for forecasting the performance and 
career development of Major League Baseball players, which he sold to and 
then managed for Baseball Prospectus from 2003 to 2009.[4] After Silver 
successfully called the outcomes in 49 of the 50 states in the 2008 U.S. 
Presidential election, he was named one of The World's 100 Most Influential 
People by Time in 2009.[5] In 2010, the FiveThirtyEight blog was licensed 
for publication by The New York Times.[6][7] In 2012 and 2013, FiveThirtyEight 
won Webby Awards as the "Best Political Blog" from the International Academy 
of Digital Arts and Sciences. In the 2012 United States presidential election, 
Silver correctly predicted the winner of all 50 states and the District 
of Columbia.[8] In July 2013, FiveThirtyEight was sold to ESPN, and Silver 
became its Editor in Chief.[9] The ESPN-owned FiveThirtyEight launched 
on March 17, 2014. The site focused on a broad range of subjects under 
the rubric of "data journalism".[10] Silver's book, The Signal and the 
Noise, was published in September 2012. It subsequently reached The New 
York Times best seller list for nonfiction, and was named by Amazon.com 
as the No. 1 best nonfiction book of 2012.[11] The Signal and the Noise 
won the 2013 Phi Beta Kappa Award in Science.[12] The book has been translated 
into nine languages: Chinese (separate editions in traditional and simplified 
characters), Czech, German, Italian, Polish, Portuguese, Spanish, Russian, 
and Romanian. Having earned a bachelor's degree from The University of 
Chicago in 2000, Silver has since been awarded four honorary doctoral degrees: 
from Ripon College (2013), The New School (2013), The University of Leuven 
(2013), and Amherst College (2014). Silver was born in East Lansing, Michigan, 
the son of Sally (née Thrun), a community activist, and Brian David Silver, 
a former chair of the political science department at Michigan State University.[13][14] 
Silver's mother's family, of English and German descent, includes several 
distinguished men and women, including his maternal great-grandfather, 
Harmon Lewis, who was president of the Alcoa Steamship Company, Inc.[15] 
Silver has described himself as "half-Jewish".[15][16] Silver showed a 
proficiency in math from a young age.[17] According to journalist William 
Hageman, "Silver caught the baseball bug when he was 6.... It was 1984, 
the year the Detroit Tigers won the World Series. The Tigers became his 
team and baseball his sport. And if there's anything that goes hand in 
glove with baseball, it's numbers, another of Silver's childhood interests 
("It's always more interesting to apply it to batting averages than algebra 
class").[18] As a student at East Lansing High School, in 1996 Silver won 
first place in the State of Michigan in the 49th annual John S. Knight 
Scholarship Contest for senior high school debaters.[19] Silver first showed 
his journalism skills as a writer and opinion page editor for The Portrait, 
East Lansing High School's student newspaper, from 1993–1996.[20] In 2000, 
Silver graduated with Honors with a Bachelor of Arts degree in economics 
from the University of Chicago. He also wrote for the Chicago Weekly News 
and the Chicago Maroon. He spent his third year at the London School of 
Economics.[21] After college graduation in 2000, Silver worked for three 
and a half years as a transfer pricing consultant with KPMG in Chicago. 
When asked in 2009, "What is your biggest regret in life?" Silver responded, 
"Spending four years of my life at a job I didn't like".[22] While employed 
at KPMG, Silver continued to nurture his lifelong interest in baseball 
and statistics, and on the side he began to work on his PECOTA system for 
projecting player performance and careers. He quit his job at KPMG in April 
2004 and for a time earned his living mainly by playing online poker.[23] 
In 2003, Silver became a writer for Baseball Prospectus (BP), after having 
sold PECOTA to BP in return for a partnership interest. After resigning 
from KPMG in 2004, he took the position of Executive Vice-President, later 
renamed Managing Partner of BP. Silver further developed PECOTA and wrote 
a weekly column under the heading "Lies, Damned Lies". He applied sabermetric 
techniques to a broad range of topics including forecasting the performance 
of individual players, the economics of baseball, metrics for the valuation 
of players, and developing an Elo rating system for Major League baseball.[24] 
Between 2003 and 2009, Silver co-authored the Baseball Prospectus annual 
book of Major League Baseball forecasts,[25] as well as other books, including 
Mind Game: How the Boston Red Sox Got Smart, Won a World Series, and Created 
a New Blueprint for Winning,[26] Baseball Between the Numbers,[27] and 
It Ain't Over 'til It's Over: The Baseball Prospectus Pennant Race Book.[28] 
He contributed articles about baseball to ESPN.com, Sports Illustrated, 
Slate, the New York Sun, and The New York Times.[29] Silver authored more 
than 200 articles for Baseball Prospectus.[30] PECOTA (Player Empirical 
Comparison and Optimization Test Algorithm) is a statistical system that 
projects the future performance of hitters and pitchers. It is designed 
primarily for two uses: fans interested in fantasy baseball, and professionals 
in the baseball business trying to predict the performance and valuation 
of major league players. Unlike most other baseball projection systems, 
PECOTA relies on matching a given current player to a set of "comparable" 
players whose past performance can serve as a guide to how the given current 
player is likely to perform in the future. Unlike most other such systems, 
PECOTA also calculates a range of probable performance levels rather than 
a single predicted value on a given measure such as earned run average 
or batting average. PECOTA projections were first published by Baseball 
Prospectus in the 2003 edition of its annual book as well as online by 
BaseballProspectus.com. Silver produced the PECOTA forecasts for each Major 
League Baseball season from 2003 through 2009.[4] On November 1, 2007, 
while still employed by Baseball Prospectus, Silver began publishing a 
diary under the pseudonym "Poblano" on the progressive political blog Daily 
Kos.[31] Silver set out to analyze quantitative aspects of the political 
game to enlighten a broader audience. Silver reports that "he was stranded 
in a New Orleans airport when the idea of FiveThirtyEight.com came to him. 
'I was just frustrated with the analysis. ... I saw a lot of discussion 
about strategy that was not all that sophisticated, especially when it 
came to quantitative things like polls and demographics'".[32] His forecasts 
of the 2008 United States presidential primary elections drew a lot of 
attention, including being cited by The New York Times Op-Ed columnist 
William Kristol.[33] On March 7, 2008, while still writing as "Poblano," 
Silver established his own blog, FiveThirtyEight.com. Often colloquially 
referred to as just 538, the website takes its name from the number of 
electors in the United States electoral college.[34] On May 30, 2008, Poblano 
revealed his identity to FiveThirtyEight.com readers.[35] On June 1, 2008, 
Silver published a two-page Op-Ed article in the New York Post outlining 
the rationale underlying his focus on the statistical aspects of politics.[36] 
He first appeared on national television on CNN's American Morning on June 
13, 2008.[37] Silver described his partisan orientation as follows in the 
FAQ on his website: "My state [Illinois] has non-partisan registration, 
so I am not registered as anything. I vote for Democratic candidates the 
majority of the time (though by no means always). This year, I have been 
a supporter of Barack Obama".[38] With respect to the impartiality of his 
electoral projections, Silver stated, "Are [my] results biased toward [my] 
preferred candidates? I hope not, but that is for you to decide. I have 
tried to disclose as much about my methodology as possible".[38] Shortly 
after the November 4 election, ESPN writer Jim Caple observed, "Forget 
Cole Hamels and the Phillies. No one in baseball had a more impressive 
fall than Nate Silver.... [R]ight now Silver is exhausted. He barely slept 
the last couple weeks of the campaign—'By the end, it was full-time plus'—and 
for that matter, he says he couldn't have kept it up had the campaign lasted 
two days longer. Plus, he has his Baseball Prospectus duties. 'We write 
our [Baseball Prospectus 2009] book from now through the first of the year,' 
[Silver] said. 'I have a week to relax and then it gets just as busy again. 
In February 2009 I will just have to find an island in the Caribbean and 
throw my BlackBerry in the ocean'".[39] Later in November 2008, Silver 
signed a contract with Penguin Group USA to write two books, reportedly 
for a $700,000 advance.[40] Silver was invited to be a speaker at TED 2009 
in February 2009,[41] and keynote speaker at the 2009 South by Southwest 
(SXSW) Interactive conference (March 2009).[42] While maintaining his FiveThirtyEight.com 
website, in January 2009 Silver began a monthly feature column, "The Data", 
in Esquire[43] as well as contributed occasional articles to other media 
such as The New York Times[44] and the Wall Street Journal.[45] He also 
tried his luck in the 2009 World Series of Poker.[46] The success of his 
FiveThirtyEight.com blog marked the effective end of Silver's career as 
baseball analyst, though he continued to devote some attention to sports 
statistics and sports economics in his blog. In March 2009, he stepped 
down as Managing Partner of Baseball Prospectus and handed over responsibility 
for producing future PECOTA projections to other Baseball Prospectus staff 
members.[4] In April 2009, he appeared as an analyst on ESPN's Baseball 
Tonight. After March 2009, he published only two "Lies, Damned Lies" columns 
on BaseballProspectus.com. In November 2009, ESPN introduced a new Soccer 
Power Index (SPi),[47] designed by Nate Silver, for predicting the outcome 
of the 2010 FIFA World Cup.[48] He published a post-mortem after the tournament, 
comparing his predictions to those of alternative rating systems.[49] In 
April 2010, in an assignment for New York magazine, Silver created a quantitative 
index of "The Most Livable Neighborhoods in New York".[50] On June 3, 2010, 
Silver announced on FiveThirtyEight.com, In the near future, the blog will 
"re-launch" under a NYTimes.com domain. It will retain its own identity 
(akin to other Times blogs like DealBook), but will be organized under 
the News:Politics section. Once this occurs, content will no longer be 
posted at FiveThirtyEight.com on an ongoing basis, and the blog will re-direct 
to the new URL. In addition, I will be contributing content to the print 
edition of The New York Times, and to the Sunday Magazine. The partnership 
agreement, which is structured as a license, has a term of three years.[6][51] 
The New York Times "FiveThirtyEight: Nate Silver's Political Calculus" 
commenced on August 25, 2010, with the publication of "New Forecast Shows 
Democrats Losing 6 to 7 Senate Seats".[52] From that date the blog focused 
almost exclusively on forecasting the outcomes of the 2010 U.S. Senate 
and U.S. House of Representatives elections as well as state gubernatorial 
contests. Silver's Times Sunday Magazine feature first appeared on November 
19, 2010, under the heading "Go Figure".[53] It was later titled "Acts 
of Mild Subversion".[54] While blogging for The Times, Silver also worked 
on his book about prediction, which was published in September 2012. At 
that time, Silver began to drop hints that after 2012 he would turn his 
attention to matters other than detailed statistical forecasting of elections. 
As reported in New York magazine: " 'I view my role now as providing more 
of a macro-level skepticism, rather than saying this poll is good or this 
poll is evil,' he says. And in four [years], he might be even more macro, 
as he turns his forecasting talents to other fields. 'I’m 97 percent sure 
that the FiveThirtyEight model will exist in 2016,' he says, 'but it could 
be someone else who’s running it or licensing it.'"[55] During the last 
year of FiveThirtyEight's license to The Times, it drew a very large volume 
of online traffic to the paper: The Times does not release traffic figures, 
but a spokesperson said yesterday that Silver’s blog provided a significant—and 
significantly growing, over the past year—percentage of Times pageviews. 
This fall, visits to the Times’ political coverage (including FiveThirtyEight) 
have increased, both absolutely and as a percentage of site visits. But 
FiveThirtyEight’s growth is staggering: where earlier this year, somewhere 
between 10 and 20 percent of politics visits included a stop at FiveThirtyEight, 
last week that figure was 71 percent. But Silver’s blog has buoyed more 
than just the politics coverage, becoming a significant traffic-driver 
for the site as a whole. Earlier this year, approximately 1 percent of 
visits to the New York Times included FiveThirtyEight. Last week, that 
number was 13 percent. Yesterday, it was 20 percent. That is, one in five 
visitors to the sixth-most-trafficked U.S. news site took a look at Silver’s 
blog.[56] In an online chat session a week after the 2012 election Silver 
commented: "As tempting as it might be to pull a Jim Brown/Sandy Koufax 
and just mic-drop/retire from elections forecasting, I expect that we'll 
be making forecasts in 2014 and 2016. Midterm elections can be dreadfully 
boring, unfortunately. But the 2016 G.O.P. primary seems almost certain 
to be epic."[57] In late November 2012, Times executive editor Jill Abramson 
declared her wish to keep Silver and his blog: "We would love to have Nate 
continue to be part of the New York Times family, and to expand on what 
he does", she said. "We know he began in sports anyway, so it is not an 
exclusively political product. I am excited to talk to Nate when he finishes 
his book tour about ways to expand that kind of reporting."[58] On July 
22, 2013, ESPN announced that it had acquired ownership of the FiveThirtyEight 
website and brand, and that "Silver will serve as editor-in-chief of the 
site and will build a team of journalists, editors, analysts and contributors 
in the coming months."[59] The New York Times public editor Margaret Sullivan 
wrote upon Silver's decision to leave for ESPN: I don’t think Nate Silver 
ever really fit into the Times culture and I think he was aware of that. 
He was, in a word, disruptive. Much like the Brad Pitt character in the 
movie “Moneyball” disrupted the old model of how to scout baseball players, 
Nate disrupted the traditional model of how to cover politics.[60] She 
added, "A number of traditional and well-respected Times journalists disliked 
his work."[61] Later, Sullivan wrote in The Times that "I don’t feel so 
good about not being able to investigate every complaint from every individual 
reader fully, or about making some misjudgments in individual posts — my 
Nate Silver commentary, among others, has probably been off-base...".[62] 
New York magazine reported that executive editor Jill Abramson "put on 
a full-court press" to keep Silver at The Times and that "for Abramson, 
Silver was a tentpole attraction for her favorite subject, national politics, 
and brought the kind of buzz she thought valuable", but the company's CEO 
and President Mark Thompson "confirmed that keeping Silver was not at the 
top of his agenda". The article stated that "the major reason Silver left 
was because he felt it was Thompson who had not committed to building his 
franchise. The mixed signals from Thompson and Abramson—his lack of enthusiasm 
for committing resources to Silver, her desire to keep a major star—frustrated 
Silver and his lawyer".[63] When FiveThirtyEight was relaunched under ESPN's 
ownership on March 17, 2014, Silver outlined the scope of topics that would 
be covered under the rubric of "data journalism":[10] We’ve expanded our 
staff from two full-time journalists to 20 and counting. Few of them will 
focus on politics exclusively; instead, our coverage will span five major 
subject areas — politics, economics, science, life and sports. Our team 
also has a broad set of skills and experience in methods that fall under 
the rubric of data journalism. These include statistical analysis, but 
also data visualization, computer programming and data-literate reporting. 
So in addition to written stories, we’ll have interactive graphics and 
features. Within a couple of months we’ll launch a podcast, and we’ll be 
collaborating with ESPN Films and Grantland to produce original documentary 
films. In March 2008, Silver established his blog FiveThirtyEight.com, 
in which he developed a system for tracking polls and forecasting the outcome 
of the 2008 general election. At the same time, he continued making forecasts 
of the 2008 Democratic primary elections. That several of his forecasts 
based on demographic analysis proved to be substantially more accurate 
than those of the professional pollsters gained visibility and professional 
credibility for "Poblano," the pseudonym that Silver was then using.[64] 
After the North Carolina and Indiana primaries on May 6, the popularity 
of FiveThirtyEight.com surged. Silver recalls the scenario: 'I know the 
polls show it's really tight in NC, but we think Obama is going to win 
by thirteen, fourteen points, and he did. ... Any time you make a prediction 
like that people give you probably too much credit for it.... But after 
that [Silver's and the website's popularity] started to really take off. 
It's pretty nonlinear, once you get one mention in the mainstream media, 
other people [quickly follow suit]'".[65] As a CNET reporter wrote on election 
eve, "Even though Silver launched the site as recently as March, its straightforward 
approach, daring predictions, and short but impressive track record has 
put it on the map of political sites to follow. The Washington Post featured 
Silver in its 14th annual election prediction contest this year, and he'll 
be reporting on Tuesday night's results with Dan Rather on HDNet".[66] 
Silver's final 2008 presidential election forecast accurately predicted 
the winner of 49 of the 50 states as well as the District of Columbia (missing 
only the prediction for Indiana). As his model predicted, the races in 
Missouri and North Carolina were particularly close. He also correctly 
predicted the winners of every U.S. Senate race. The accuracy of his predictions 
won him further acclaim, including abroad,[67] and added to his reputation 
as a leading political prognosticator.[68] Barack Obama's 2008 presidential 
campaign signed off on a proposal to share all of its private polling with 
Silver. After signing a confidentiality agreement, Silver was granted access 
to hundreds of polls the campaign had conducted.[69][70] Shortly after 
FiveThirtyEight relocated to The New York Times, Silver introduced his 
prediction models for the 2010 elections to the U.S. Senate, the U.S. House 
of Representatives, and state governorships. Each of these models relied 
initially on a combination of electoral history, demographics, and polling. 
Silver eventually published detailed forecasts and analyses of the results 
for all three sets of elections. He correctly predicted the winner in 34 
of the 37 contested Senate races. His 2010 congressional mid-term predictions 
were not as accurate as those made in 2008, but were still within the reported 
confidence interval. Silver predicted a Republican pickup of 54 seats in 
the House of Representatives; the GOP won 63 seats. Of the 37 gubernatorial 
races, FiveThirtyEight correctly predicted the winner of 36.[71] Although 
throughout 2011 Silver devoted a lot of attention on his blog to the 2012 
Republican party primaries, his first effort to handicap the 2012 Presidential 
general election appeared as the cover story in The New York Times Magazine 
a year prior to the election: "Is Obama Toast? Handicapping the 2012 Election".[72] 
Accompanying the online release of this article, Silver also published 
"Choose Obama's Re-Election Adventure", an interactive toy that allowed 
readers to predict the outcome of the election based on their assumptions 
about three variables: President Obama's favorability ratings, the rate 
of GDP growth, and how conservative the Republican opponent would be.[73] 
This analysis stimulated a lot of critical discussion.[74] While publishing 
numerous stories on the Republican primary elections, in mid-February 2012 
Silver reprised and updated his previous Magazine story with another one, 
"What Obama Should Do Next".[75] This story painted a more optimistic picture 
of President Obama's re-election chances. A companion article on his FiveThirtyEight 
blog, "The Fundamentals Now Favor Obama", explained how the model and the 
facts on the ground had changed between November and February.[76] Silver 
published the first iteration of his 2012 general election forecasts on 
June 7, 2012. According to the model, at that time Barack Obama was projected 
to win 291 electoral votes—21 more than the 270 required for a majority. 
Obama then had an estimated 61.8% chance of winning a majority.[77] On 
the morning of the November 6, 2012, presidential election, the final update 
of Silver's model at 10:10 A.M. gave President Barack Obama a 90.9% chance 
of winning a majority of the 538 electoral votes.[78] Both in summary tables 
and in an electoral map, Silver forecast the winner of each state. At the 
conclusion of that day, when Mitt Romney had conceded to Barack Obama, 
Silver's model had correctly predicted the winner of every one of the 50 
states and the District of Columbia.[79][80] Silver, along with at least 
three[81] academic-based analysts—Drew Linzer,[82] Simon Jackman,[83] and 
Josh Putnam[84]—who also aggregated polls from multiple pollsters—thus 
was not only broadly correct about the election outcome, but also specifically 
predicted the outcomes for the nine swing states.[85] In contrast, individual 
pollsters were less successful. For example, Rasmussen Reports "missed 
on six of its nine swing-state polls".[86][87][88] Silver's team at FiveThirtyEight 
projected that Donald Trump had a 46% chance of claiming victory in the 
Iowa primaries while Ted Cruz had a 39% chance of winning.[89] The FiveThirtyEight 
team predicted that Hillary Clinton had a 71% chance to win the 2016 United 
States presidential election.[90] while other major forecasters had predicted 
Clinton to win with at least an 85% to 99% probability.[91][92] Donald 
Trump won the election. FiveThirtyEight projected a much higher chance 
of Donald Trump winning the presidency than other pollsters,[91] a projection 
which was criticized by Ryan Grim of the Huffington Post as "unskewing" 
too much in favor of Trump.[93] The Signal and The Noise was published 
in the United States on September 27, 2012. It reached the New York Times 
Best Sellers List as #12 for non-fiction hardback books after its first 
week in print. It dropped to #20 in the second week, before rising to #13 
in the third, and remaining on the non-fiction hardback top 15 list for 
the following 13 weeks, with a highest weekly ranking of #4.[94] Sales 
increased after the election on November 6, jumping 800% and becoming the 
second best seller on Amazon.com.[95] The book describes methods of mathematical 
model building using probability and statistics. Silver takes a big-picture 
approach to using statistical tools, combining sources of unique data (e.g., 
timing a minor league ball player's fastball using a radar gun), with historical 
data and principles of sound statistical analysis; Silver argues that many 
of these are violated by many pollsters and pundits who nonetheless have 
important media roles. Case studies in the book include baseball, elections, 
climate change, the financial crash, poker, and weather forecasting. These 
different topics illustrate different statistical principles. As a reviewer 
in The New York Times notes: "It’s largely about evaluating predictions 
in a variety of fields, from finance to weather to epidemiology. We learn 
about a handful of successes: when, for instance, meteorologists predict 
a hurricane’s landfall 72 hours in advance.... But mostly we learn about 
failures. It turns out we’re not even close to predicting the next catastrophic 
earthquake or the spread of the next killer bird flu, despite the enormous 
amounts of brainpower trained on these questions in the past few decades".[96] 
Silver's self-unmasking at the end of May 2008 brought him a lot of publicity 
focused on his combined skill as both baseball statistician-forecaster 
and political statistician-forecaster, including articles about him in 
the Wall Street Journal,[97] Newsweek,[98] Science News,[99][100] and his 
hometown Lansing State Journal.[101] In early June he began to cross-post 
his daily "Today's Polls" updates on "The Plank" in The New Republic.[102] 
Also, Rasmussen Reports began to use the FiveThirtyEight.com poll averages 
for its own tracking of the 2008 state-by-state races.[103] In 2009 through 
2012, Silver appeared as a political analyst on MSNBC,[104] CNN[105] and 
Bloomberg Television,[106][107] PBS,[108] NPR,[109] Democracy Now!,[110] 
The Charlie Rose Show,[111] ABC News,[112] and Current TV.[113] Silver 
also appeared on the The Colbert Report (October 7, 2008 and November 5, 
2012),[114] The Daily Show (October 17, 2012 and November 7, 2012),[115] 
and Real Time with Bill Maher (October 26, 2012).[116] That Silver accurately 
predicted the outcome of the 2012 presidential race, in the face of numerous 
public attacks on his forecasts by critics, inspired many articles in the 
press, ranging from Gizmodo,[117] to online and mainstream newspapers,[118] 
news and commentary magazines,[119] business media,[120] trade journals,[121] 
media about media,[122] and Scientific American,[123] as well as a feature 
interview on The Today Show,[124] a return appearance on The Daily Show,[125] 
and an appearance on Morning Joe.[126] Silver's first appearance on ABC 
News as Editor-in-Chief of the new FiveThirtyEight.com was on George Stephanopoulos's 
This Week on November 3, 2013.[127] Silver has been criticized for inaccurate 
predictions. In January 2010, journalist and blogger Colby Cosh criticized 
Silver's performance during the Massachusetts special Senate election, 
saying he was "still arguing as late as Thursday afternoon that Coakley 
was the clear favourite; he changed his mind at midnight that evening and 
acknowledged that Scott Brown had a puncher’s chance."[165] (Brown won 
the election.) Silver's quantitative focus on polling data, without insight 
from experience in political organizing or journalism, has been a recurring 
critique from experienced commentators. Huffington Post columnist Geoffrey 
Dunn described Silver as someone who "has never organized a precinct in 
his life, much less walked one, pontificating about the dynamics in the 
electoral processes as if he actually understood them."[166] Considerable 
criticism during the 2012 elections came from political conservatives, 
who argued that Silver's election projections were politically biased against 
Mitt Romney, the Republican candidate for President.[167] For example, 
Silver was accused of applying a double standard to his treatment of Rasmussen 
Reports polls, such as a 2010 analysis asserting a statistical bias in 
its methodology.[168] Mendy Finkel of Daily Caller wrote that "Silver rigged 
his entire pollster ratings for the sole purpose of lowering Rasmussen's 
rank".[169] Josh Jordan wrote in National Review that Silver clearly favored 
Obama and adjusted the weight he gave polls "based on what [he] think[s] 
of the pollster and the results and not based on what is actually inside 
the poll".[170] On MSNBC's Morning Joe, host Joe Scarborough stated that 
Silver's prediction that day of a 73.6% chance of a win for Obama greatly 
exceeded the confidence of the Obama campaign itself, which Scarborough 
equated to that of the Romney campaign, both believing "they have a 50.1 
percent chance of winning", and calling Silver an "ideologue" and a "joke". 
Silver responded with the offer of a $1,000 wager (for charity) over the 
outcome of the election. The New York Times public editor Margaret Sullivan, 
while defending Silver's analysis, characterized the wager as "a bad idea" 
as it gave the appearance of a partisan motive for Silver, and "inappropriate" 
for someone perceived as a Times journalist (although Silver was not a 
member of the newspaper's staff).[171][172] After a post-election appearance 
by Silver on Joe Scarborough's Morning Joe, Scarborough published what 
he called a "(semi) apology," in which he concluded: I won’t apologize 
to Mr. Silver for predicting an outcome that I had also been predicting 
for a year. But I do need to tell Nate I’m sorry for leaning in too hard 
and lumping him with pollsters whose methodology is as rigorous as the 
Simpsons’ strip mall physician, Dr. Nick. For those sins (and a multitude 
of others that I’m sure I don’t even know about), I am sorry. Politics 
is a messy sport. And just as ball players who drink beer and eat fried 
chicken in dugouts across America can screw up the smartest sabermetrician’s 
forecast, Nate Silver’s formula is sure to let his fervent admirers down 
from time to time. But judging from what I saw of him this morning, Nate 
is a grounded guy who admits as much in his book. I was too tough on him 
and there’s a 84.398264% chance I will be less dismissive of his good work 
in the future".[173] Silver's nondisclosure of the details of his analytical 
model has resulted in some skepticism. Washington Post journalist Ezra 
Klein wrote: "There are good criticisms to make of Silver's model, not 
the least of which is that, while Silver is almost tediously detailed about 
what's going on in the model, he won’t give out the code, and without the 
code, we can't say with certainty how the model works."[174] Colby Cosh 
wrote that the model "is proprietary and irreproducible. That last feature 
makes it unwise to use Silver's model as a straw stand-in for "science", 
as if the model had been fully specified in a peer-reviewed journal".[175] 
On August 13, 2014, Silver was criticized for comparing his own experience 
of being arrested with those of journalists and members of the public during 
protests and riots in response to the shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, 
Missouri [176][177][178] In a series of eight consecutive postings to Twitter, 
Silver recounted a story of being arrested but later placating officers 
with the words "sorry guys, was just stressed out and having a rough day 
... my bad!", after which he was given back his burrito to eat in his cell 
and received a ride home from officers.[176][178] Silver later publicly 
apologized, describing his posts as being "misguided and naive".[177] In 
a 2012 interview with Charlie Rose he stated, "I'd say I am somewhere in-between 
being a libertarian and a liberal. So if I were to vote it would be kind 
of a Gary Johnson versus Mitt Romney decision, I suppose."[179] Silver 
is a grandnephew of geologists Caswell Silver and Leon Silver.[180] Silver 
is openly gay.[181] "I've always felt like something of an outsider. I've 
always had friends, but I've always come from an outside point of view. 
I think that's important. If you grow up gay, or in a household that's 
agnostic, when most people are religious, then from the get-go, you are 
saying that there are things that the majority of society believes that 
I don't believe," he told an interviewer in 2012.[182] "When asked what 
made you feel more of a misfit, being gay or being a geek, he replied, 
'Probably the numbers stuff since I had that from when I was six.'"[182] 
When asked in 2008 if he had noticed people looking at him as a "gay icon," 
he responded, "I've started to notice it a little bit, although so far 
it seems like I'm more a subject of geek affection than gay affection".[183] 
Silver discussed his sexuality in the context of growing up in East Lansing, 
in an article about the Supreme Court ruling Obergefell v. Hodges in favor 
of recognizing same-sex marriage on the date of its announcement. He analysed 
the speed of the change of public sentiment, pointing out that the change 
over only several decades has been palpable to the current generations.[184] 
Silver has long been interested in fantasy baseball, especially Scoresheet 
Baseball. While in college he served as an expert on Scoresheet Baseball 
for BaseballHQ.[185] When he took up political writing, Silver abandoned 
his blog, The Burrito Bracket,[186] in which he ran a one-and-done competition 
among the taquerias in his Wicker Park neighborhood in Chicago.[187] Silver
