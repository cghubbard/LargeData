A wall climb is a play in baseball where a fielder makes an out by catching 
a fly ball or pop up while climbing a wall. The play is generally made 
by outfielders robbing hitters of hits that otherwise would have been home 
runs, or at the very least a double. A wall climb can also be made by outfielders 
or other position players by climbing the wall in foul territory to make 
an out. Under MLB rules, the catch is ruled an out when the fielder making 
the out has at least one foot over legal playing territory during the catch 
and no feet touching the ground of an out of play area, regardless of whether 
he lands in fair territory or out of play.[1] One of the most notorious 
MLB players with a reputation for wall climbing is Minnesota Twins outfielder 
Torii Hunter. He has won nine Gold Gloves in his sixteen-year major league 
career. He once robbed Barry Bonds of a home run in right-center field
