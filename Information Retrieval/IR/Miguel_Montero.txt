Miguel Angel Montero Fernandez (born July 9, 1983) is a Venezuelan professional 
baseball catcher for the Chicago Cubs of Major League Baseball (MLB). He 
previously played in MLB for the Arizona Diamondbacks. Montero is a two-time 
MLB All-Star. He was signed as an undrafted free agent in 2001. Montero 
made his major league debut on September 6, 2006, against the Florida Marlins. 
In that same game, Aníbal Sánchez of the Marlins would throw a no-hitter 
against the Diamondbacks. Montero would play in a total of 6 games that 
year, recording a .250 batting average. In 2007 and 2008, Montero platooned 
with Chris Snyder at the catching position for the D-Backs and batted a 
.224 average with 10 home runs in 2007 and batting .255 with 5 home runs 
in 2008. Montero began the 2009 season slowly, hitting just three home 
runs and having just a .200 batting average through the first two months. 
However, when Snyder was put on the disabled list in June, Montero's playing 
time increased markedly and he finished the season with a career-high .294 
batting average. Montero caught Edwin Jackson's no-hitter on June 25, 2010.[1] 
He would finish the season with a .266 batting average and 9 home runs. 
In 2011, after hitting .272 with 10 home runs and 45 RBI, Montero was selected 
to his first All-Star Game. He also threw out 40% of baserunners trying 
to steal, a career high. Montero was named to his second All-Star game 
in July 2014, replacing the injured Yadier Molina for the National League.[2] 
Following the 2014 season, the Diamondbacks traded Montero to the Chicago 
Cubs for minor leaguers Jeferson Mejia and Zack Godley.[3][4] Before a 
hand injury in mid-July, Montero had appeared in 73 games for the Cubs 
with 217 at bats. He had 10 home runs and 32 runs-batted-in with a batting 
average of .230. On August 12, 2015, Montero hit a walk-off home run to 
give the Cubs a 3-2 victory over the Milwaukee Brewers in the 10th inning 
to extend the Cubs winning streak to 6 games. On August 30, 2015, Montero 
caught Jake Arrieta's no-hitter against the Los Angeles Dodgers. On October 
15, 2016, during Game 1 of the 2016 NLCS, Montero hit a pinch-hit grand 
slam in the 8th inning to break a 3-3 tie and lead the Cubs to a 8-4 victory 
over the Los Angeles Dodgers. It was only the third pinch-hit grand slam 
in postseason history. On November 2, 2016, Montero entered Game 7 of the 
2016 World Series in the bottom of the 9th inning as a defensive replacement 
for Cubs backup catcher David Ross. In the top of the 10th inning, having 
batted only .091 (1-11) in the postseason to that point, Montero hit a 
single to left field which drove in Cubs first baseman Anthony Rizzo and 
improved the team's lead to 8-6. Since the Cleveland Indians only scored 
one run in the bottom of the 10th inning to make the score 8-7, Montero's 
RBI provided the game's decisive run and sealed the Cubs' victory.[5] After 
the series, Montero expressed his disappointment in losing playing time
