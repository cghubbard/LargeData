The Olean Oilers were a minor league baseball team located in Olean, New 
York. The team played in the New York–Pennsylvania League from 1939 to 
1951 and from 1955 to 1958. The league was known as the Pennsylvania–Ontario–New 
York League from 1939 to 1956. The Oilers were affiliated with the Brooklyn 
Dodgers from 1939 to 1948, the St. Louis Browns in 1949, and the Philadelphia 
Phillies from 1956 to 1958. The Oilers played their home games at Bradner 
Stadium. Starting in 2012, the Olean Oilers name was revived as a member 
of the New York Collegiate Baseball League. The team began play in the 
summer of 2012, initially playing on the campus of Saint Bonaventure University 
before returning to a renovated Bradner Stadium in 2014; a crowd of nearly 
2,000 fans watched the Oilers during their first game back at Bradner.[1] 
In their fourth year of play as an amateur squad, the Oilers won the 2015 
NYCBL championship; the next year, the team went on a 24-game winning streak 
near the beginning of the season, doubling the previous league record, 
en route to a league record 39 wins and a second consecutive championship, 
won before a league record 2,876 fans at Bradner. Despite concerns over 
competitive balance as well as admitted discussions with the Perfect Game 
Collegiate Baseball League, the Oilers have shown a general preference 
to stay in the NYCBL for 2017.[2] This article is based on the "Olean Oilers"
