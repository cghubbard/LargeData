Thompson is a rural town in Windham County, Connecticut, United States. 
The town was named after Sir Robert Thompson, an English landholder.[1] 
The population was 9,458 at the 2010 census.[2] Thompson is located in 
the northeastern corner of the state and is bordered on the north by Webster, 
Massachusetts and Dudley, Massachusetts, on the east by Douglas, Massachusetts 
and Burrillville, Rhode Island, on the west by Woodstock, Connecticut, 
and on the south by Putnam, Connecticut. Thompson has the highest-banked 
race track (Thompson Speedway Motorsports Park, a 5/8 mile oval and a restored 
1.7 mile road course) in New England. This speedway holds one of the biggest 
race programs in New England, The World Series of Auto Racing, where 16 
divisions and about 400 cars show up each fall. Another claim to fame is 
that the Tri-State Marker is located just on the border of Thompson. The 
term "Swamp Yankee" is thought to have originated in Thompson during the 
American Revolution in 1776. Thompson was the site of the Great East Thompson 
Train Wreck in 1891, one of the worst train wrecks in American history 
and the only one to involve four trains. According to the United States

River, which also runs through Thompson. One of the highest points in Thompson

Thompson has a public school system in which the elementary, middle, and 
high school buildings are connected. The Mary R. Fisher Memorial Elementary 
School has students in pre-K through 4th grade, Thompson Middle School 
consists of grades 5-8, and Tourtellotte Memorial High School has students 
in grades 9-12.[7] Also in town are several private schools, the Catholic 
St Joseph's School, currently serving pre-K - grade 8, and Marianapolis 
Preparatory, a Marian high school located on historic Thompson Hill.[8][9] 
The original Tourtellotte Memorial High School building, which exists today 
as administrative offices for the school system, was built in the Greek 
Revival style. The cornerstone was laid in 1907 and the school opened in 
1909. The school is named in memory of Dr. Jacob F. Tourtellotte. Tourtellotte 
was a ship's surgeon in the U.S. Navy during the Civil War. The school 
also houses a small museum, called the "Memorial Room" which contains portraits 
of Tourtellotte and his family, and some of their possessions. It is maintained 
by the local historical society, and is usually open to the public for 
tours one Sunday per month.[10] Marianapolis Preparatory School was established 
in 1926, sponsored by the Congregation of Marians of the Immaculate Conception.[11] 
The school is located on the former Ream Estate, built by Norman Bruce 
Ream, a Director of The Pullman Company, U.S. Steel, and The National Biscuit 
Company, which is now known as Nabisco. The Estate, including the circa 
1900 mansion "Carolyn Hall," named after Ream's wife, was sold to the Marians 
in 1931, but the Mansion burned down in 1964 and a new main school building 
was built in its place.[12] The Thompson Public Library[13] is located 
at 934 Riverside Drive, North Grosvenordale. It is combined with the town's 
Community Center, and contains 20,400 square feet (1,900 m2) holding 55,000 
items, including books, magazines, CDs, DVDs, audio tapes, video tapes, 
and online resources. The library was started in 1902 with 1,370 books 
in a small building on Thompson Hill, now known as the Ellen Larned Memorial 
Library. Two branches were created, the Quinebaug Branch, in operation 
from 1961 to 1994, and the Grosvenordale Branch, in operation from 1958 
to 1966. Thompson was the first small town in Connecticut to have a bookmobile 
service, operating from 1966 to 1993. The current library in North Grosvenordale
