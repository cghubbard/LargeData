Baldwin is a hamlet and census-designated place (CDP) located in the town 
of Hempstead in Nassau County, New York, United States. The population 
was 24,033 at the 2010 census.[1] Baldwin is also a station on the Babylon 
Branch of the Long Island Rail Road. Original inhabitants of the area between 
Parsonage Creek near Oceanside and Milburn Creek near Freeport were Native 
Americans known as Merokes, or Merrick, an Algonquian tribe indigenous 
to most of the South Shore of Long Island, who lived in two villages along 
Milburn Creek. In 1643, the land became known as Hick's Neck after two 
of Hempstead's early settlers, John Spragg from England and John Hicks 
from Flushing, who extended Hempstead village south to the salt meadows. 
The grist mill built by John Pine in 1686 on Milburn Creek attracted more 
settlers who engaged in fishing, farming, marshing, raising longwood, and 
breeding and raising sheep. Between the American Revolutionary War and 
the War of 1812, growing Hick's Neck came to be called the village of Milburn. 
The first churches were built in 1810 and 1872, and the first school was 
built in 1833.[2][3] After the area was previously regarded as Hick's Neck 
and later Milburn, Baldwin was founded in 1855 (as Baldwinsville) and named 
in honor of Thomas Baldwin (1795–1872), who was a sixth-generation member 
of the Baldwin family of Hempstead and the leading merchant of Milburn 
at the time. Mr. Baldwin owned a general store named T. Baldwin and Sons, 
as well as a hotel at a location that would now be considered the northwest 
corner of Merrick Road and Grand Avenue. He also owned and operated a sawmill 
by Silver Lake just southeast of the hotel.[4] In 1867, the South Side 
Rail Road began operating with a station in Baldwinsville. In 1870, one 
of Thomas Baldwin's sons, Francis Baldwin, became a member of the New York 
State Assembly representing Queens County's 2nd District; he later served 
as the Queens County treasurer.[2] (During this time, Baldwinsville was 
part of Queens County.) A year later, the name of the village was changed 
from Baldwinsville to Baldwins by the U.S. Postal Service so as to not 
confuse it with the village of Baldwinsville in upstate New York. By 1892, 
by an act of local government, the village was officially named Baldwin.[4] 
Shortly after Hempstead separated from Queens County in 1899, people began 
to move to "Beautiful Baldwin", as it was called by Charles Luerssen, a 
village realtor, for the village's fine boating, bathing, and fishing. 
By 1939, ten years after the opening of Sunrise Highway, Baldwin became 
the largest unincorporated village in New York State—a title that was lost 
to Levittown by 1960.[4] In 1990, the area south of Atlantic Avenue was 
designated as Baldwin Harbor,a hamlet (and census-designated place) with 
the 1990 United States Census. Baldwin Harbor remains a part of the town 
of Baldwin's ZIP code, school district, and library system. In May 1910, 
near the current Plaza Elementary School on Seaman Avenue and Rockville 
Drive in Baldwin, a breakthrough in American aviation history was made. 
The first all-American monoplane was designed, built, and successfully 
flown at this location by brothers Arthur and Albert Heinrich. In the plane's 
initial and subsequent models, its unique designs featured controls that 
were combined into one stick which allowed the pilot to fly the plane using 
one hand. The community is located in the southwest part of Nassau County. 
It is located on what is known as the South Shore of Long Island. Baldwin

officially named the Baldwin Union Free School District (formerly Union 
Free School District No. 10, Town of Hempstead). The boundaries of the 
Baldwin School District are not identical with those of Baldwin itself, 
also containing the Stearns Park neighborhood of Freeport, up to Knollwood 
Road in Rockville Centre and a few blocks from other neighboring villages. 
On the other hand, a small portion of Baldwin, located to the West of Silver 
Lake, is included in the Oceanside Union Free School District. As of September 
2012, the Baldwin Public Schools consist of seven schools with a total 
enrollment of approximately 5500 students. There is one high school, Baldwin 
Senior High School, and one middle school, Baldwin Middle School. There 
are five elementary schools spaced throughout the town: Brookside, Lenox, 
Meadow, Plaza, and Steele. Baldwin Senior High School is a Nationally Recognized 
School of Excellence, and as of 2011, is the eighth-largest high school 
in Nassau County, New York.[11] Baldwin Senior High School was ranked by 
Newsweek in its annual list of America's Best High Schools. In 2010, it 
was ranked #837 in the entire United States, #804 in 2008, #971 in 2007, 
and #602 in 2006.[12] The high school offers a multitude of extracurricular 
clubs, varsity sports, and a robotics team. Baldwin Senior High School 
offers Advanced Placement courses that may enable students to earn college 
credit, and the school produced two National Merit Commended Students, 
who achieved scores in the top 5% of the more than 1.5 million students 
who took the PSAT in 2009. The high school is located near the north-central 
part of town, and the middle school near the south end. Buses are run to 
both of these schools. Most students are able to walk to their elementary 
schools. The elementary schools contain kindergarten to fifth grade. The 
middle school contains grades six through eight—but the sixth graders spend 
most of their time in a separate wing except for music, gym, lunch, arts, 
computers, technology, and language. The high school contains grades nine 
through twelve. Three former elementary schools were closed in June 1980: 
Prospect School was torn down, along with the former Baldwin Junior High 
School and former Baldwin Senior High School which were combined in one 
building in the 1980s to make way for a housing complex; Coolidge School 
on Grand Avenue has been converted to condominiums; Harbor Elementary School 
on Hastings Street is now the school district office building. Two additional 
elementary schools, Milburn and Shubert, were closed in June 2012 as the 
result of enrollment changes and cuts in state funding. The district is 
governed by a five-member elected board of education. Dr. Shari Camhi is 
the superintendent of schools. Baldwin also has one Catholic school, St. 
Christopher's. This school was established in 1925 as part of St. Christopher's 
parish. The school serves students from Baldwin, Freeport, and surrounding 
areas, and it ranges from kindergarten to eighth grade. Although originally 
staffed by nuns, most of the school's faculty consists of lay people. Originally 
the school was one building that housed all classes, however it has been 
expanded twice. The school now consists of the "original building" (now 
housing classrooms, a gym, stage, computer lab, and music room), the "middle 
building" (housing the school and religious education offices, classrooms 
and an art room), and the "new building" (housing a cafeteria, library, 
and classrooms). Over the years the school has gained a highly regarded 
reputation in the Baldwin community. Students from the school participate 
in a wide variety of both Catholic and community events. For example, students 
take religion classes from kindergarten to the eighth grade, as well as 
march in the Baldwin Memorial Day Parade and help out at Baldwin's Big 
Sweep (a community event in which volunteers clean up Grand Avenue). Baldwin 
is the hometown of two soldiers who were posthumously awarded the Medal 
of Honor. First Lieutenant Bernard J. Ray deliberately gave his life to 
spare his men of Company F, 8th Infantry, 4th Infantry Division on November 
17, 1944 in the Hurtgen Forest. Specialist Five John J. Kedenburg (BHS 
'64) was serving with a long-range reconnaissance team of South Vietnamese 
irregular troops while a member of the U.S. Army 5th Special Forces Group 
(Airborne). When his group came under attack and was encircled by a battalion-size 
North Vietnamese Army force, Kedenberg conducted a rear-guard action which 
allowed his group to break out of their encirclement and move to a landing 
zone. While in the landing zone, Kedenberg directed the defense of the 
L-Z and ultimately gave up the last chance of evacuation to one of his 
Vietnamese comrades. Baldwin was the initial home of the Grumman Aircraft 
Engineering Company.[15] Baldwin is home to many public parks, including 
Baldwin Park, Coes Neck Park, Baldwin Skate Park (located within Baldwin 
Park), Lofts Pond Park, and Silver Lake Park. Baldwin Park, located at 
the southern terminus of Grand Avenue in Baldwin Harbor, is run by the 
Town of Hempstead, and offers a multitude of recreational facilities, including 
basketball, handball, paddleball, tennis, volleyball, spray pool, soccer, 
softball, baseball, playground, game tables, play equipment, sitting area,
