As Player As Manager Timothy Paul "Ted" Sullivan (March 17, 1851 – July 
5, 1929) was an Irish-American manager and player in Major League Baseball 
who was born in County Clare, Ireland. After attending Saint Louis University,[1] 
he managed four teams during the 1880s, one of which was the 1884 St. Louis 
Maroons of the Union Association, who finished with an astonishing 94-19 
record. He began the year with a 28–3 record, but moved on in midseason 
to manage another UA team, the Kansas City Cowboys; Fred Dunlap took over 
in St. Louis, compiling a 66–16 record as the Maroons won the UA pennant 
in the league's only year of existence. Kansas City was a dismal 3-17 when 
Sullivan took over managerial duties, going 13-46 the rest of way. During 
his time in Kansas City he also made his only three field appearances, 
playing two games in right field and one as a shortstop; he collected 3 
hits in 9 at bats. He didn't manage again until the 1888 Washington Nationals, 
then 10-29, hired him to finish out the season.[2] He led the team to a 
mark of 38-57, and ended his major league career with a record of 132-132. 
Sullivan later managed in the minors, including a stint with the Nashville 
Tigers of the Southern League in 1893.[3] Sullivan is considered a pioneer 
of early baseball; he founded both the Northwest League and the Texas League, 
both minor leagues that still exist and thrive today. Credited with discovering 
Charles Comiskey, he is considered by some to be the first person to emphasize 
the importance of scouting.[4] Comiskey joined the St. Louis Browns in 
1882, and replaced Sullivan as the team's manager in mid-1883; it had been 
Sullivan's first managerial post, as he compiled a record of 53-26 to begin 
the year. Also, Sullivan was a great promoter of the game; he would tell 
stories of baseball's beginnings, and of its many star players. He authored 
books detailing these, including a barnstorming trip around the world in 
1913–1914 by Comiskey's Chicago White Sox and the New York Giants. He also 
credited himself as the originator of the word "fan", as in baseball fan. 
Sullivan later became a team executive and owner. Sullivan died in Washington, 
D.C. at the age of 78, and is interred at Calvary Catholic Cemetery in
