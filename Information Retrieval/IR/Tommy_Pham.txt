Thomas "Tommy" James Pham (born March 8, 1988) is an American professional 
baseball outfielder for the St. Louis Cardinals of Major League Baseball 
(MLB). He made his MLB debut on September 9, 2014. Pham attended Durango 
High School in Spring Valley, Nevada where he was a pitcher and infielder. 
As a senior, Pham was named the Class 4A All-State Player of the Year by 
the Reno Gazette-Journal and a second team All-American after finishing 
with a .633 batting average.[1][2] As a pitcher, Pham's fastball touched 
93 miles per hour but, despite drawing more interest as a pitching prospect, 
Pham wanted to play the field. He originally committed to play college 
baseball at Arizona before switching his choice to Cal State Fullerton.[3] 
Pham was ultimately selected by the St. Louis Cardinals in the 16th round 
of the 2006 Major League Baseball Draft. He received a $325,000 signing 
bonus, higher than most players drafted as late as the 16th round.[3] The 
start to Tommy Pham's professional baseball career has taken a number of 
detours due to injury. He suffered a broken wrist in 2010. In a 2011 game 
while attempting to deny a home run ball, he tore a ligament. He played 
40 games and batted .294. In early 2012, while diving for a baseball, Pham 
noticed a pop in his shoulder. The opinion of team doctors was that it 
not serious. He continued play but it worsened, and later examination showed 
a torn labrum, costing him nearly all of the season. After promotion to 
AAA Memphis Redbirds of the Pacific Coast League (PCL) in 2013, he tore 
his other labrum. He returned to Springfield after rehabilitation and batted 
.301 in 45 games.[4] Pham played most of the 2014 season for Memphis, appearing 
in 104 games, and he batted .324 with a .395 on-base percentage (OBP), 
.491 slugging percentage (SLG), 63 runs scored, 16 doubles, six triples, 
10 home runs (HR) and 44 runs batted in (RBI).[5] He was called up to the 
major leagues with the Cardinals for the first time on September 7, 2014.[6] 
He opened the next season with Memphis but missed the first two months 
with a quadriceps injury.[7] On June 9, Pham hit two home runs and a career-high 
five RBI against the Iowa Cubs.[8] In his first 24 games after returning 
from the disabled list, he batted .338 with a .402 OBP, .625 SLG, five 
home runs and 21 RBI. The Cardinals recalled him to the major league club 
on July 3, 2015,[7] and he was influential in a 2–1 victory over the San 
Diego Padres the next day. He doubled for his first major league hit, then, 
later in the game, pilfered his first stolen base and scored the winning 
run, his first major league run.[9] On July 5, Pham hit his first major 
league home run the day after collecting his first major league hit. He 
hit another double that game, and drove in all three of the Cardinals' 
runs – also his first three major league RBI – as the Cardinals again defeated 
the Padres, 3–1.[10] On September 16, Pham tripled and had his first multi-home 
run game against the Milwaukee Brewers in a 5–4 victory. He had actually 
homered in three consecutive plate appearances spanning his last at bat 
previous to the game, September 13 against the Cincinnati Reds.[11][12] 
In the next game against the Brewers, Pham's line drive ricocheted off 
the head of starting pitcher Jimmy Nelson. Although Nelson had to leave 
the game, he was able to walk off the field in his own ability, and a magnetic 
resonance image (MRI) revealed a contusion. Pham doubled and tripled in 
this game, giving him six hits and eight RBI in consecutive games against 
Milwaukee.[13] He homered in a 4–3 win over the Chicago Cubs on September 
20,[14] and drove in two of the runs in a 3–1 win over the Reds on September 
22. The Cardinals won 100 games and the National League Central division. 
Pham made his major league postseason debut as a pinch hitter during the 
bottom of the eighth inning of Game 1 of the 2015 National League Division 
Series (NLDS) against the Cubs, and hit his first career home run against 
Jon Lester.[15] The Cardinals selected Pham for the Opening Day roster 
in 2016; however, he was the first player in the major leagues after the 
start of the season to be placed on the DL, tearing his left oblique against 
Pittsburgh Pirates in the first inning of the first game.[16] The club 
reactivated him from the DL on May 17 and optioned him back to Memphis.[17] 
His home run on August 2 against the Cincinnati Reds was the Cardinals' 
11th pinch hit home run of the season, establishing a new club record.[18] 
Pham is both of African-American and Vietnamese-American heritage. He is 
the first person of Vietnamese descent to play in Major League Baseball 
since pitcher Danny Graves.[20][21] He and his sister were raised by their 
working mother, Tawana, in Spring Valley, Nevada.[20] Pham suffers from 
keratoconus, a rare eye disorder which causes degenerative vision problems. 
It was not until Pham began wearing contact lenses in 2009 that he became
