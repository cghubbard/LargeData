The 1970 Pittsburgh Pirates season resulted in the team winning their first 
National League East title with a record of 89-73, five games ahead of 
the Chicago Cubs. However, they lost the NLCS to the NL West Champion Cincinnati 
Reds, three games to none. The Pirates were managed by Danny Murtaugh and 
played their home games at Forbes Field during the first part of the year, 
before moving into the brand new Three Rivers Stadium on July 16. Coinciding 
with their move, the Pirates became the first major league team to adopt 
pullover jerseys and sans-a-belt pants for their uniforms, a style copied 
by a majority of the MLB for the next two decades and which the Pirates 
themselves would wear through the 1990 season.[2] In 1958, the Pirates 
had sold Forbes Field to the University of Pittsburgh, who wanted the land 
for expanded graduate facilities. Pitt then leased Forbes back to the Pirates 
until a new multipurpose stadium could be built. The Steelers opted to 
play at Pitt Stadium in the meantime. In June 1970, the Pirates played 
their final game at Forbes Field. It was a doubleheader sweep of the Chicago 
Cubs and Bill Mazeroski got the final hit at Forbes Field.[3] A site on 
the North Side had been chosen earlier in the year, but it took until April 
25, 1968 to finally break ground. Three Rivers Stadium opened on July 16, 
1970, and became the home of the Pirates and the Pittsburgh Steelers. Infielders
