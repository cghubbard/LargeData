Shaun Michal Marcum (born December 14, 1981) is an American former professional 
baseball pitcher, who played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Toronto 
Blue Jays, Milwaukee Brewers, New York Mets, and Cleveland Indians. In 
2015, he became the pitching coach for the Northwestern Oklahoma State 
Rangers. He joined the Missouri Southern Lions as their pitching coach 
in August 2016. Marcum was born in Kansas City, Missouri and raised in 
Excelsior Springs, Missouri, where he attended Excelsior Springs High School. 
Athletically, besides baseball, he was a two-time State Champion in wrestling 
and a standout football player. Marcum initially attended the University 
of Missouri, but transferred to Missouri State University, playing on the 
2003 College World Series team as a pitcher and shortstop. Marcum was drafted 
by the Blue Jays in the third round, 80th overall, of the 2003 Major League 
Baseball Draft. He quickly rose through the minor leagues and made his 
major league debut on September 6, 2005 as a late season call-up when rosters 
expanded. He made his debut against the Baltimore Orioles pitching one 
scoreless inning, giving up a hit and one walk, with one strikeout. Marcum 
pitched 8 innings, giving up six hits, without surrendering a run during 
the month of September.[1] Marcum went 3–4 for the Blue Jays in 2006 in 
21 games, including 14 starts, with an earned run average (ERA) of 5.06. 
In his final seven starts, he had a record of 2–1 with a 3.31 ERA.[1] Marcum 
had a breakthrough season in 2007, going 12–6 with a 4.13 ERA. He struck 
out a total of 122 batters over 159 innings of work. He pitched 6+ scoreless 
innings in seven of his starts, including two instances where he pitched 
6+ no-hit innings before being relieved. One of those instances was against 
the Boston Red Sox.[1] In 2008, Marcum got off to a good start, going 5–4 
with a 2.65 ERA and 86 strikeouts in 98 2⁄3 innings, but an injury, followed 
by a handful of weak starts sent him to Triple-A on August 23. In September 
he was back in the starting rotation and he seemed to have returned to 
form. However, on September 19, days after an abbreviated start in which 
he left with elbow pain, the Jays released the information that Marcum 
would need Tommy John surgery and would miss the rest of the 2008 season 
and likely all of 2009. He finished the 2008 campaign with a 9–7 record, 
3.39 ERA, and 123 strikeouts in 151 1⁄3 innings.[1] As of May 1, 2009, 
Marcum had started to throw again. He made two starts with the Advanced-A 
Dunedin Blue Jays in early July, and pitching successfully on his rehab 
assignment, he then started twice with the Double-A New Hampshire Fisher 
Cats, and once more with Triple-A Las Vegas 51s before being shut down 
for the season to prevent him from injury again.[2] On March 22, Marcum 
was named the Opening Day starter for the 2010 season,[3] succeeding Roy 
Halladay for that role, who had seven consecutive opening day starts for 
the team from 2003 to 2009. On May 2, Marcum got his first win against 
the Oakland Athletics, it was his first win since September 11, 2008 before 
going through Tommy John surgery. On August 4, 2010, Marcum gave up Alex 
Rodriguez's 600th career home run. Marcum ended the season with a 13–8 
win–loss record, 3.64 ERA, and 165 strikeouts in 195 1⁄3 innings pitched.[1] 
On December 6, at the 2010 MLB Winter Meetings, Marcum was traded to the 
Milwaukee Brewers in exchange for infield prospect Brett Lawrie.[4] On 
July 4, 2011, Marcum hit his first Major League home run, a grand slam 
off Daniel Hudson of the Arizona Diamondbacks. Despite the home run, the 
Diamondbacks won the game 8–6. In the 2011 NLDS against Arizona, Marcum 
gave up a grand slam to Paul Goldschmidt, which sealed a win for the Diamondbacks. 
However, the Brewers won the series in 5 games. In 2011 he went 13–7, with 
a 3.54 ERA and 158 strikeouts in a career-high 200 2⁄3 innings.[1] Due 
to injury, Marcum's 2012 season was cut short to just 21 starts. He went 
7–4 with a 3.70 ERA and 109 strikeouts for the Brewers. After the season, 
he elected free agency.[5] On January 30, 2013, Marcum signed a one-year 
contract worth $4 million with the New York Mets.[6] Through his first 
11 games (9 of which were starts) for the Mets, Marcum posted a dismal 
0–9 record with a 5.76 earned run average. He recorded his first win as 
a Met in a game against the Chicago White Sox on June 26, 2013. Marcum 
pitched 8 innings and yielded only 4 hits and 2 walks while striking out 
2. He underwent surgery on his pitching shoulder on July 15, 2013, and 
was ruled out for the rest of the season.[7] Marcum was waived/injured 
by the Mets on July 23, 2013.[8] Marcum finished his lone season in New 
York with a 1–10 record, 5.29 earned run average, and 60 strikeouts in 
78 1⁄3 innings pitched.[1] On December 16, 2013, Marcum signed a minor 
league contract with the Cleveland Indians.[9] While pitching in extended 
spring training, on May 22, 2014, Marcum was shut down after problems with 
his injured shoulder occurred.[10] He pitched in just 8 games for the Triple-A 
Columbus Clippers in 2014. On November 18, 2014, Marcum signed a minor 
league deal to remain with the Indians organization.[11] He started the 
2015 season on the Columbus roster, but was called up to the Indians on 
April 12, 2015, without having pitched for Columbus.[12] The Indians designated 
Marcum for assignment on April 14.[13] He was added back to the Indians' 
roster on May 20.[14] He was subsequently designated for assignment once 
more on June 18. On July 26, 2015, it was announced that Marcum had taken 
a coaching position with the Northwestern Oklahoma State Rangers.[15] Marcum 
was hired by Missouri Southern State University to be the pitching coach 
for the Lions on August 10, 2016.[16] Marcum threw a broad array of pitches. 
He used a four-seam fastball at 86–89 mph, a two-seam fastball at 84-87, 
a cutter in the mid 80s, a changeup in the upper 70s, a slider in the low 
80s, and a slow, looping curveball in the upper-60's to lower-70's. Marcum 
almost never used his two-seamer on right-handed hitters, preferring to 
use his cutter and breaking pitches. Against left-handed hitters, he threw
