Westbury is a neighborhood in the Brays Oaks district of Southwest Houston, 
Texas, United States. It is located east of Bob White Road, north of U.S. 
Highway 90 Alternate (South Main Street), and west of South Post Oak Road, 
adjacent to the Fondren Southwest and Meyerland neighborhoods, just west 
of the southwest corner of the 610 Loop. Westbury was named as the 2007 
"Best Hidden Neighborhood" by the Houston Press [2]. Westbury was also 
listed in the 25 Hottest Houston Neighborhoods in the June 2013 edition 
of Houstonia Magazine. [3]. Westbury was developed in the 1950s and 1960s 
by Ira Berne as part of the post–World War II migration to the suburbs.[citation

named the new community.[1] In 1960 Berne had developed the Westbury Square 
shopping center.[2] In the 1980s the City of Houston Housing Authority 
proposed a 105-unit public housing project in the Westbury area. Thousands 
of residents entered public hearings to protest the concept, so the city 
did not build any public housing in the Westbury area.[3] Around the 1980s 
markets crashed and many of Westbury's businesses either closed or became 
abandoned. Crime increased at this time, but has decreased greatly in recent 
years. As real estate has become more expensive in gentrified areas such 
as Houston Heights and Neartown, Westbury has become an attractive place 
to live for some of Houston's gay and lesbian population.[citation needed] 
Gays and lesbians began moving to Westbury in the 2000s, and some were 
referring to it as "Little Montrose".[4] In April 2010 the City of Houston 
"automated" curbside recycling program was extended to Westbury East.[5] 
In 2011 the Brays Oaks district expanded.[6] Westbury, which was originally 
not a part of the Brays Oaks district,[7] became a part of it.[8] The neighborhood 
is within the Houston Police Department's Southwest Patrol Division [4]. 
The Westbury HPD Storefront Station is located at 5550 Gasmer. Houston 
Fire Department Fire Station 48 Westbury, located in Fire District 59, 
serves the neighborhood.[9] Station 48 relocated to its current location 
in 1961 and was last renovated during the financial year of 1998.[10] Westbury 
is now a part of Houston City Council District K, currently represented 
by Council Member Larry Green, while a small number of about 100 homes 
remain in District C, currently represented by Council Member Ellen Cohen 
(as of 2012).[11] The area was previously served by Houston City Councilmember 
District C (Anne Clutterbuck as of 2009). It is in Harris County Commissioner 
Precinct 1 (El Franco Lee as of 2012) and Harris County Constable Precinct 
5 (Phil Camus as of 2012). The Westbury Civic Club is the area civic club. 
The Community Association Institute, along with Randall's, gave it the 
"1992 Civic Club Community of the Year Award" at the Adam's Mark hotel 
in Westchase.[12] The area is split between Texas's 9th congressional district 
(Al Green as of 2012) and Texas's 7th congressional district (John Culberson 
as of 2012).[13][14] The United States Postal Service operates the Westbury 
Post Office at 11805 Chimney Rock Road.[15] The city of Houston operates 
Westbury Park at 5635 Willowbend ([5]) which features the Westbury Pool 
(street address is 10605 Mullins), a playground, tennis courts, and a multi-sport 
playing field. [6]. In addition, the city operates the Platou Community 
Center located in Chimney Rock Park. Chimney Rock Park has a playground, 
tennis courts, and basketball courts. Hager Park, with its covered basketball 
court, is located next to the Anderson Elementary School between Landsdowne 
Drive and McClearen Dr, and attracts many in the neighborhood for outdoor 
sports.([7]) Hager Park also features a walking trail, a multi-purpose 
sports field, and has a shared playground with Anderson Elementary School. 
The closest YMCA is the Westland YMCA Branch. The neighborhood has a baseball 
little league called Westbury Little League. It won the Little League World 
Series in 1966.[citation needed] The closest Emergency Room and hospital 
is called Westbury Community Hospital located near the high school on Gasmer 
drive. [16] The neighborhood is served by the Houston Independent School 
District. The neighborhood is divided between the following attendance 
zones for elementary school: The neighborhood is divided between the following 
attendance zoned for middle school: Anyone zoned to Johnston may apply 
to Pin Oak Middle School's regular program.[23] Westbury High School serves 
almost all of Westbury.[24] A sliver of Westbury is zoned to Bellaire High 
School.[25] Medical Center Charter School, a pre-kindergarten through 5th 
grade school, is located in the Westbury area. Despite its name, the school 
is not located in the Texas Medical Center area. Parker Elementary opened 
in 1959, and Johnston Middle School opened in its current location in 1959. 
Anderson and Kolter opened in 1960. Westbury High School opened in 1961. 
Fondren Middle opened in 1966.[1] In the late 1990s Anderson Elementary 
was overcrowded due to increasing student populations in Westbury area 
apartment complexes. In 1998 the school had almost 1,600 students.[26] 
Around that time hundreds of students who were zoned to Anderson were bussed 
to relief campuses.[27] Tinsley opened in 2002, relieving Anderson and 
another area school.[1] As of 2006 many middle and upper class residents 
of the Westbury attendance zone would not send their children to Westbury; 
usually they send their children to Bellaire High School, Lamar High School, 
or private schools.[28][29] St. Thomas More School (K-8 [8], operated by 
the Archdiocese of Galveston-Houston), is Westbury's neighborhood Roman 
Catholic school. The neighborhood has or has in close proximity several 
other private schools, such as Westbury Christian School (K–12) and St. 
Nicholas School Southwest Campus (K-8). Trafton Academy and Miss Porter's 
School located in the Willowbend area also serves Westbury residents.[citation

and Meyer Neighborhood Library, serve this area. The Meyer Library opened 
in 1962. In 1994 the library received renovations to accommodate disabled 
people. By 2013 HPL planned to purchase land for a new Meyerland branch 
with $442,000. HPL spokesperson Sandra Fernandez stated that HPL wants 
to build a new facility in order to increase the size and parking capacity. 
There is a proposal to move the library to Westbury Square, supported by 
the Westbury community but opposed by Meyerland residents.[30] As of 2015[update] 
various proposals are being debated.[31] The Houston Chronicle is the area 
regional newspaper. On Thursdays, residents receive the Bellaire/West U/River 
Oaks/Meyerland [9] local section. See also: List of companies in Houston
