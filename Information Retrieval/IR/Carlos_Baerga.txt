Carlos Obed Baerga Ortiz (/baɪˈɛərɡə/; Spanish pronunciation: [baˈerɣa]; 
born November 4, 1968) is a former Major League Baseball player. After 
spending most of his career as a second baseman, he was used at various 
positions late in his career. On November 4, 1985, at the age of sixteen, 
Baerga was signed by the San Diego Padres. On December 6, 1989, San Diego 
traded him to the Cleveland Indians along with Sandy Alomar, Jr. and Chris 
James in exchange for established power-hitter Joe Carter. Baerga debuted 
as a major league baseball player with the Indians, on April 14, 1990. 
That year, he played mostly as a third baseman and shortstop and would 
hit 17 doubles and seven home runs, while averaging .260 at the plate. 
Over the next four years, his home run and batting averages numbers rose 
steadily, hitting 11 home runs, and batting for an average of .288 in 1991 
while playing mostly as a third baseman and second baseman, getting 20 
home runs and averaging .312 in 1992 while becoming a full-time second 
baseman, and with 21 home runs and an average of .321 in 1993. In 1992, 
he reached two hundred hits in one season for the first time, getting 205 
hits that year. In 1993, he duplicated the mark of 200 hits, with exactly 
200. Baerga became the first second baseman since Rogers Hornsby in 1922 
to have back-to-back 200+ hit, 20+ home run, 100+ RBI, and .300+ average 
seasons when he accomplished the feat in 1992–93. He was a 3 time All Star 
in the 1992, 1993, and 1994 seasons. The switch-hitting Baerga was the 
first of three players to have ever hit one home run from both sides of 
the plate in the same inning. He did so on April 8, 1993, at Cleveland 
Municipal Stadium against New York Yankees pitchers Steve Howe and Steve 
Farr in the game's 7th inning. On August 29, 2002, he was joined by Chicago 
Cubs utility player Mark Bellhorn, who completed the feat against the Milwaukee 
Brewers, and on July 30, 2012, Kendrys Morales became the third player 
to accomplish this rare feat against the Texas Rangers. He was the Indians' 
most reliable pinch hitter During the strike-shortened 1994 season, Baerga 
hit 19 home runs and maintained an average of .314 at the plate. In the 
144-game 1995 season, Baerga had 175 hits and 15 home runs in 139 games, 
with a .314 average. The Indians made it to the World Series, where they 
fell to the Atlanta Braves in six games (Baerga flew out to Marquis Grissom 
for the final out). Baerga played 100 games with the Indians in 1996, before 
being traded to the New York Mets on July 29, 1996, with Álvaro Espinoza, 
for Jeff Kent and José Vizcaíno. He collected 129 hits with twelve home 
runs that year, hitting only .193 after being traded to the Mets. He ended 
that year with an average of .254. Over the next two seasons with the Mets, 
Baerga had below average seasons, hitting nine home runs and batting .281 
in 1997, and seven home runs and .266 in 1998. He was granted free agency 
on October 26, 1998. Baerga began to develop problems with his knees. On 
January 27, 1999, Baerga was signed by the St. Louis Cardinals and released 
before the season began. The Cincinnati Reds signed him, but after he hit 
.290 in the minors, released him midseason. The San Diego Padres put him 
in the minors for 21 games where he hit .286, and brought him up for 33 
games where he hit .250. Bought by Cleveland in August, he hit .228 in 
31 games with them.[1] Signed briefly by the Tampa Bay Devil Rays in 2000, 
Baerga did not appear in the majors that year. He felt that he could no 
longer perform as a major leaguer. In 2001, he played for the Long Island 
Ducks and in the Korea Baseball Organization, Samsung Lions(삼성 라이온즈 야구단)).[2] 
Then he retired, and bought the Santurce Crabbers, becoming player-manager 
and realizing his childhood dream.[3] In 2002, Baerga returned to the majors. 
That year, he got 52 hits with the Boston Red Sox, primarily serving as 
a pinch-hitter and designated hitter. In 2003, he was traded to the Arizona 
Diamondbacks, where he collected 71 hits for the team. The Diamondbacks 
re-signed him for 2004, but the aging Baerga, now prone to injury, got 
hurt again and was only able to play in 20 games that season. He was signed 
by the Washington Nationals to a minor league contract before the 2005 
season and played 93 games for them. He also played for Puerto Rico in 
the 2006 World Baseball Classic. Baerga collected 1,543 hits in his MLB 
career, with 134 home runs, and a batting average of .292. As a broadcaster, 
Baerga has enjoyed prominence as a color commentator for Monday Night Baseball 
retransmissions in Spanish on ESPN Dos for the Mexico-Caribbean-Venezuela 
region. He is an analyst on Beisbol Esta Noche (the Spanish version of 
Baseball Tonight) on ESPN Deportes and ESPN Latin America. He is recognized 
by fans and fellow co-workers as "Carlos Obed".[4] During the 2013 World 
Baseball Classic, Baerga served as one of the assistant coaches under Edwin 
Rodríguez.[5] As of January 2014, Baerga is the current manager for the 
Indios de Mayagüez in Puerto Rico's Roberto Clemente Professional Baseball 
League. Baerga became an Evangelical Christian during the early 2000s, 
and he took former world boxing champion and personal friend Alex Sánchez 
with him to church one day. The former world champion also became an Evangelical 
Christian on the day of the visit. In turn, Sanchez brought over Félix 
Trinidad to the church that Baerga attended, and Trinidad became a born-again 
Christian as well. Baerga joined the church where his father-in-law was 
a pastor. Baerga has a wife Myriam, a daughter Karla, and a son Carlos 
Giovanni. Cousin is Elvis Ortiz. And nephew is dereck Ortiz. Baerga agreed 
to sign up as a delegate for Rick Santorum in the 2012 Republican primary.[6]
