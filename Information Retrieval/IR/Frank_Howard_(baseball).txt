As player As manager As coach Frank Oliver Howard (born August 8, 1936), 
nicknamed "Hondo", "The Washington Monument" and "The Capital Punisher", 
is a former All-Star outfielder, coach and manager in Major League Baseball 
who played most of his career for the Los Angeles Dodgers and Washington 
Senators/Texas Rangers franchises. One of the most physically intimidating 
players in the sport, the 6 ft 7 in (2.01 m)/235 lb. Howard was named the 
National League's Rookie of the Year in 1960, and went on to twice lead 
the American League in home runs and total bases and in slugging average, 
runs batted in and walks once each. His 382 career home runs were the eighth 
most by a right-handed hitter when he retired; his 237 home runs and 1969 
totals of 48 HRs and 340 total bases in a Washington uniform are a record 
for any of that city's several franchises. Howard's Washington/Texas franchise 
records of 1,172 games, 4,120 at bats, 246 HRs, 1,141 hits, 701 RBI, 544 
runs, 155 doubles, 2,074 total bases and a .503 slugging average have since 
been broken. An All-American in both basketball and baseball at Ohio State, 
Howard was drafted by the Philadelphia Warriors of the NBA. Listed in college 
at 6'8" and 275 pounds, he instead signed with the Dodgers organization, 
and after a handful of appearances in 1958 and 1959 he succeeded Carl Furillo 
as Los Angeles' right fielder in 1960; he was named the Minor League Player 
of the Year in 1959 by The Sporting News after hitting 43 homers in the 
Pacific Coast League. He was named the NL's Rookie of the Year after batting 
.268 with 23 home runs and 77 RBI, and was nicknamed "Hondo" by teammates 
after a John Wayne film.[citation needed] He belted 98 homers in the following 
four seasons, most prominently in a 1962 campaign in which he batted .296 
with 31 home runs and finished among the NL's top five players in RBI (119) 
and slugging (.560). He won the NL Player of the Month award in July with 
.381 average, 12 HR, and an incredible 41 RBI. The season ended with the 
Dodgers and San Francisco Giants tied for first place, necessitating a 
three-game pennant playoff; Howard had only a single in 11 at-bats and 
struck out three times against Billy Pierce in the first game, including 
the final out; but he had a run and an RBI in the second contest, an 8–7 
win. The Giants took the pennant in three games, but Howard would later 
finish ninth in the MVP voting. In 1963 his production dropped off to a 
.273 average, 28 homers and 64 RBI; but the Dodgers won the pennant, and 
his upper-deck solo home run off Whitey Ford broke a scoreless tie in the 
fifth inning of Game 4 of the World Series, helping Los Angeles to a 2–1 
win and a sweep of the New York Yankees. He again hit over 20 home runs 
in 1964, and on June 4 his three-run home run in the seventh inning provided 
all the scoring in Sandy Koufax's third no-hitter, a 3–0 defeat of the 
Philadelphia Phillies; Howard had also homered for the final run in Koufax's 
first no-hitter on June 30 two years earlier, a 5–0 win over the New York 
Mets. But the team's 1962 move into pitcher-friendly Dodger Stadium hurt 
power hitters, and speedier outfielders like Willie Davis were seen as 
more in line with the club's future; Howard's .226 batting average in 1964—combined 
with regularly high strikeout totals—led to his trade to Washington in 
a seven-player December deal which brought future All-Star starter Claude 
Osteen to Los Angeles. In 2005 Howard recalled welcoming the trade despite 
going from a pennant contender to a weak expansion team, noting, "I was 
essentially a fourth outfielder in L.A., hitting 25 home runs a year in 
the biggest baseball park in America and doing it on 400 at-bats." He added, 
"What could I do if I get 550 at-bats? I had my best years here." Shifted 
to left field in Washington, he was unquestionably the center of the offense, 
leading the team in homers and RBI in each of his seven seasons there. 
But under managers Gil Hodges, Jim Lemon and Ted Williams, the Senators 
were a woeful bunch, achieving only one winning season in that time. In 
1967 he hit 36 homers, third in the AL behind Harmon Killebrew and Carl 
Yastrzemski, as he entered the peak years of his career. During an amazing 
one-week stretch in the spring of 1968 (May 12–18), Howard hammered 10 
home runs in 20 at bats, with at least one in six consecutive games; his 
10 home runs are also the most ever in one week. He would go on to hit 
13 homers in 16 games, a mark that still stands, matched only by Albert 
Belle in 1995. Howard finished the season leading the AL with 44 HR, a 
.552 slugging average and 330 total bases, and was second to Ken Harrelson 
with 106 RBI; he made his first of four consecutive All-Star teams, and 
placed eighth in the MVP balloting, although the Senators finished in tenth 
(last) place with a 65–96 record. Howard wore #9 from the time he joined 
the Senators through 1968. When new owner Bob Short signed retired slugger 
Williams to manage the club, Howard happily surrendered #9 so the Hall 
of Famer could wear it once again; Howard donned #33 for the start of the 
1969 season. Williams played a major role in teaching him to be more patient 
at the plate, asking the slugger, "Can you tell me how a guy can hit 44 
home runs and only get 48 bases on balls?" He encouraged Howard to lay 
off the first fastball he saw, and work pitchers deeper into the count, 
advice which resulted in Howard's walk totals nearly doubling. Beginning 
in 1968, he appeared semi-regularly at first base in order to limit the 
wear and tear of playing the outfield daily. In 1969 he had career highs 
with 48 homers (one behind Killebrew's league lead), 111 runs (second in 
the AL to Reggie Jackson), a .296 batting average and a .574 slugging mark. 
On Howard's broad shoulders, the Senators had their best year ever, 86–76, 
but still finished far behind the Baltimore Orioles in the Eastern Division. 
He again led the AL with 340 total bases, the most ever by a Washington 
player, and added 111 RBI; his fourth-place finish in the MVP vote was 
the highest of his career. In 1970 he led the AL both in HR (44) and RBI 
(126); his 132 walks in that year also topped the league, and remain a 
franchise record. On September 2, he received three intentional walks from 
flamethrowing southpaw Sam McDowell—two of them to lead off an inning. 
He came in fifth in the 1970 MVP race, and received one first-place vote. 
Howard is one of four players (along with Harmon Killebrew, Cecil Fielder, 
and Mark McGwire), to clear the left-field roof at Tiger Stadium.[1] He 
also hit a foul ball out of Yankee Stadium that Yankee outfielder Bobby 
Murcer later claimed was fair.[citation needed] His most memorable home-run 
at RFK Stadium was on April 25, 1970 when he hit a 500 ft homer into the 
upper bleachers in left centerfield. The seat which it hit was painted 
white against the conforming gold to commemorate the event [1]. In a game 
at Fenway Park, he hit a line drive that struck the center field wall 390 
feet from home plate and bounced into Reggie Smith's glove before Howard 
had even reached first base. During his National League days, Howard also 
smashed a ball an estimated 560 feet at Pittsburgh's Forbes Field. Howard 
hit the last regular-season home run for the Senators in RFK Stadium in 
his final at bat on September 30, 1971 off Yankees pitcher Mike Kekich. 
After waving to the cheering fans, Howard tossed his helmet liner into 
the stands, and after the game said "This is utopia for me."[2] The Senators 
moved to Dallas/Fort Worth in 1972, becoming the Texas Rangers. Howard 
batted only .244 with 9 HR's in 95 games before his contract was sold to 
the Detroit Tigers in August; he had just one home run in 33 games for 
Detroit, and did not appear in the postseason for the division champions. 
He ended his major league career in 1973 with a .256 average and 12 home 
runs for the Tigers, playing as their designated hitter. Unable to find 
a job in the majors, in 1974 Howard signed to play in Japan's Pacific League 
for the Taiheiyo Club Lions. In his first at bat for his new team, he swung 
mightily and hurt his back; he never played again in Japan. In 16 seasons, 
Howard was a .273 career hitter with a .499 slugging average, 382 home 
runs and 1,119 RBI in 1,895 games. His lifetime marks included 864 runs, 
1,774 hits, 245 doubles, 35 triples, eight stolen bases and a .352 on-base 
percentage; his 1,460 strikeouts were then the fifth highest total in major 
league history. Jim Sundberg surpassed his Senators/Rangers franchise totals 
for career games, at bats and doubles in 1982 and 1983; Toby Harrah broke 
his marks for runs and hits in 1985 and 1986; and Juan González broke his 
records for home runs, RBI, total bases, and slugging average in 1997 and 
1998. Following his retirement as a player, Howard coached for the Milwaukee 
Brewers 1977–80 before being named manager of the 1981 San Diego Padres. 
The team finished in last place in both halves of that strike-marred season, 
and Howard was let go. Catching on as a coach with the Mets in 1982, he 
took over as manager for the last 116 games in 1983 after George Bamberger 
resigned, but again finished in last place. In all, he posted a 93–133 
career managerial record. Howard also coached again for the Brewers (1985–86), 
Mets (1994–96), Seattle Mariners (1987–88), Yankees (1989, 1991–93), and 
Tampa Bay Devil Rays (1998–99). Since 2000 he has worked for the Yankees 
as a player development instructor. Back in 1972 Howard had thought that 
before much time had passed, another President would deliver the opening-day 
pitch in the capital. On April 14, 2005, baseball returned to Washington. 
Reflecting on its '71 departure he remarked, "I thought that within five 
years it would be back. Well, 34 years later, here we are." During pregame 
ceremonies before the Washington Nationals–Arizona Diamondbacks game at 
RFK Stadium which featured players from both former Senators clubs, Howard 
walked out to left field and was greeted by a raucous ovation. At age 68, 
he joked, "I know I'm going to left field – if I can make it that far without 
having a coronary! I used to be able to sprint out there but I don't even 
know if I'll be able to jog. I told (former Senator Ed) Brinkman, 'For 
crissakes, call 911 if I have a blowout in left field.'" He now helps raise
