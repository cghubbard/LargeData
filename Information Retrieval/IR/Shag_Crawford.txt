Henry Charles "Shag" Crawford (August 30, 1916 – July 11, 2007)[1][2] was 
an American professional umpire in Major League Baseball who worked in 
the National League from 1956 to 1975.[3] During his twenty seasons in 
the National League, Crawford worked more than 3,100 games and as a home 
plate umpire was notable for getting in a low crouch and resting his hands 
on the back of the catcher in front of him.[4] Crawford wore number 2 after 
the National League adopted numbers for its umpires, which was then transferred 
to his son Jerry Crawford, who wore it from 1976 until his 2010 retirement. 
Crawford was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Growing up, he played 
baseball and football and was involved in boxing, and later played in the 
minor leagues as a catcher in the Philadelphia Phillies' system.[4] Crawford 
married Vivian Gallagher on November 2, 1940, and they had three sons and 
a daughter, residing in Havertown, Pennsylvania.[5] He served in the United 
States Navy during World War II, and was on the destroyer USS Walke (DD-723) 
when its bridge was struck by a Japanese kamikaze on January 6, 1945 during 
the invasion of Luzon, in which commanding officer George Fleming Davis 
suffered fatal injuries and was awarded the Medal of Honor. Crawford became 
a minor league umpire in 1950, working for two months in the Canadian–American 
League before moving to the Eastern League from 1951 to 1953 and the American 
Association in from 1954 to 1955; his contract was purchased by the National 
League in November 1955.[6] Crawford was the third base umpire for Sandy 
Koufax's third no-hitter on June 4, 1964. He was the home plate umpire 
when one of the most violent brawls in baseball history occurred during 
a game between the Los Angeles Dodgers and the San Francisco Giants at 
Candlestick Park on August 22, 1965.[7][8] The incident occurred between 
Giants pitcher Juan Marichal and Dodgers catcher John Roseboro in the aftermath 
of the Watts riots near Roseboro's Los Angeles home and while the Dominican 
Civil War raged in Marichal's home country so emotions were raw.[9] The 
Dodgers' Maury Wills led off the game with a bunt single off Giants pitcher 
Marichal and eventually scored a run.[10] Marichal, a fierce competitor, 
viewed the bunt as a cheap way to get on base and took umbrage with Wills.[8][9] 
When Wills came up to bat in the second inning, Marichal threw a pitch 
directly at Wills sending him sprawling to the ground.[8] Willie Mays then 
led off the bottom of the second inning for the Giants and Dodgers' pitcher 
Sandy Koufax threw a pitch over Mays' head as a token form of retaliation.[8][9] 
In the top of the third inning with two outs, Marichal threw a fastball 
that came close to hitting Ron Fairly, prompting him to dive to the ground.[9] 
Marichal's act angered the Dodgers sitting in the dugout and, Crawford 
then warned both teams that any further retaliations would not be tolerated.[9] 
When Marichal came to bat in the third inning, he was expecting Koufax 
to take further retaliation against him but instead, he was startled when 
Roseboro's return throw to Koufax after the second pitch either brushed 
his ear or came close enough for him to feel the breeze off the ball.[11] 
When Marichal confronted Roseboro about the closeness of his throw, Roseboro 
came out of his crouch with his fists clenched.[11] Marichal stated afterwards 
that he thought Roseboro was about to attack him and raised his bat, striking 
Roseboro at least twice over the head with his bat, opening a two-inch 
gash that sent blood flowing down the catcher's face that required 14 stitches.[11] 
Koufax raced in from the mound to attempt separate them and was joined 
by the umpires, players and coaches from both teams.[11] Crawford attempted 
to step between the two players in an effort to defuse the situation.[9] 
When Marichal stumbled, Crawford saw his opportunity and wrapped both of 
his arms around Marichal and the two men fell to the ground.[9] A 14-minute 
brawl ensued on the field before Koufax, Giants captain Willie Mays and 
other peacemakers restored order.[8] Crawford ejected Marichal from the 
game and afterwards, National League president Warren Giles suspended him 
for eight games (two starts), fined him a then-NL record US$1,750[7][12] 
(equivalent to $13,163 in 2015),[13] and also forbade him from traveling 
to Dodger Stadium for the final, crucial two-game series of the season.[11] 
Roseboro filed a $110,000 damage suit against Marichal one week after the 
incident but, eventually settled out of court for $7,500.[11] During Crawford's 
career, he officiated three World Series (1961, 1963, 1969), ejecting Baltimore 
manager Earl Weaver in Game 4 of the 1969 Series for arguing balls and 
strikes, the first managerial ejection in World Series competition since 
1935, two National League Championship Series (1971, 1974), and All-Star 
Games in 1959 (first game), 1961 (first game) and 1968; he worked behind 
the plate for the 1968 All-Star Game.[1] Crawford was relieved of his duties 
in 1975 for refusing to work the World Series that year, due to a rotational 
system implemented for selection of World Series umpires, over the traditional 
assignment by merit.[14] Two of Crawford's sons, Jerry Crawford and Joey 
Crawford, also became sports officials. Jerry was a National League umpire 
from 1976 until 2010, and Joey was a National Basketball Association referee 
from 1977 to 2016. Shag Crawford worked the first game at Philadelphia's 
Veterans Stadium in 1971 and stood with Jerry at home plate when the lineup 
cards were presented before the final game at the ballpark in 2003.[3]
