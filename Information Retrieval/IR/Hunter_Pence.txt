Hunter Andrew Pence (born April 13, 1983)[1][2] is a Major League Baseball 
right fielder for the San Francisco Giants. He previously played for the 
Houston Astros and Philadelphia Phillies. Pence stands 6 feet 4 inches 
(193 cm) tall and weighs 235 pounds (107 kg). He bats and throws right-handed. 
He was a member of the 2012 World Series and 2014 World Series championship 
teams with the San Francisco Giants. Pence attended Arlington High School 
in Arlington, Texas.[1] After playing outfield his first three years,[1] 
he moved to shortstop his senior year.[1] He attended Texarkana College 
for a year and was a designated hitter on the baseball team.[1] He transferred 
to the University of Texas at Arlington (UTA) where he returned to the 
outfield.[1] He hit .347 as a sophomore in 2003 and was named a first-team 
all-conference outfielder. Despite missing 15 of UTA's 30 Southland Conference 
games the following year due to an injury at mid-season—he was still named 
the 2004 Southland Conference player of the year, leading the league with 
a .395 batting average.[1] Pence still holds the conference record for 
doubles in a single series, with 5.[3] Pence was drafted by the Milwaukee 
Brewers in the 40th round of the 2002 Major League Baseball Draft, but 
did not sign. In the 2004 Major League Baseball Draft he was drafted in 
the second round (64th pick overall) by the Houston Astros out of the University 
of Texas at Arlington. He played the 2004 season with the single A Tri-City 
ValleyCats in Troy, New York. During that year, Pence, along with current 
major leaguers Ben Zobrist and Drew Sutton helped lead the 'Cats to a 50 
win season in the New York–Penn League, the second-most in ValleyCats history. 
That year, the 'Cats defeated the Brooklyn Cyclones in the first round, 
but lost to the Mahoning Valley Scrappers in the league championship.[citation

hit 28 home runs, with 95 RBIs. He had 17 stolen bases, while being caught 
stealing only 4 times.[4] In 2006, he was one of three outfielders named 
to the Baseball America Minor League All-Star Team.[5] Pence began the 
2007 season as the AAA Round Rock Express' center fielder,[6] though he 
made a serious run to make the big league club out of spring training.[citation 
needed] Pence made his major league debut as the Houston Astros center 
fielder on April 28, 2007, versus the Milwaukee Brewers[7] and got his 
first major league hit and scored his first run. Pence's first home run 
in the majors was a grand slam, against the St. Louis Cardinals on May 
5. Pence hit a dramatic walk-off home run against José Mesa of the Philadelphia 
Phillies in the bottom of the 13th inning at Minute Maid Park on July 3 
in a 5–4 win. It was Mesa's only pitch of the game.[8] Pence was named 
National League co-Player of the Week for May 14–20, after recording a 
1.091 slugging percentage and .625 on-base percentage with 2 home runs 
and 5 RBIs.[9] On July 23, general manager Tim Purpura announced that Pence 
would be out with a small chipped bone fracture in his right wrist. On 
August 21, Pence was activated from the disabled list. At that point, despite 
having missed a month he was 4th among NL rookies in at bats.[citation

in batting average (.322), on-base percentage (.360), slugging percentage 
(.539), and OPS (.899).[citation needed] Pence was a unanimous selection 
to the 2007 Topps Major League Rookie All-Star Team. The selection was 
the result of the 49th annual Topps balloting of Major League managers.[10] 
Pence (15 points) came in third, and lost out to Braun (128 points) in 
the vote for the 2007 NL Sporting News Rookie of the Year Award by 488 
major league players and 30 managers.[11][12] He also lost out to Braun 
in the competition for the 2007 Baseball America Rookie of the Year Award,[13] 
in the vote for the 2007 Players Choice NL Most Outstanding Rookie by their 
fellow major league players,[14] and in the Baseball Prospectus 2007 Internet 
Baseball NL Rookie of the Year Award, with 16 first place votes, versus 
666 for Braun.[15] After Michael Bourn was traded from the Philadelphia 
Phillies to the Astros before the 2008 season, Pence moved to right field 
while Bourn took over in center. In his sophomore season, Pence set new 
personal single-season records in home runs (25), runs batted in (83), 
doubles (25), hits (160), and at bats (595). However, his batting average 
dipped to .269, his on-base percentage fell to .318, and his slugging percentage 
also fell to .466. Pence led the league in outfield assists with 16, committed 
1 error, and had a fielding percentage of .997. In his third season (2009), 
Pence was named an All-Star for the first time.[16] In his fourth season 
(2010), Pence batted .282 with 25 home runs, drove in 91 RBIS and played 
156 games. For the week of August 30–September 5, 2010, Pence was named 
National League Player of the Week for the second time in his career after 
batting .500 (11-for-22) and slugging .909 with two home runs.[17] Pence 
was named a 2011 All-Star as a reserve, the second time he made the All-Star 
team. He was brought into the middle of the game, threw out José Bautista 
from the outfield, and scored the National League's 5th run of the game. 
At the All-Star break, Pence was batting .321 with 10 home runs and 59 
RBIs.[18] On July 29, 2011, the Houston Astros traded Pence to the Philadelphia 
Phillies for four minor-league players: first baseman Jonathan Singleton, 
right-handers Jarred Cosart and Josh Zeid, and a player to be named later, 
determined to be outfielder Domingo Santana.[19][20] On August 4, Pence 
hit his first home run as a Phillie, against Madison Bumgarner.[21] Pence 
finished fourth in the NL in batting average (.314; behind Jose Reyes, 
Ryan Braun, and Matt Kemp) and eighth in RBI, with 97.[22] Pence made the 
playoffs for the first time in his career; however, the Phillies lost the 
2011 National League Division Series to the eventual World Series-champion 
St. Louis Cardinals in 5 games. On July 31, 2012, the Phillies sent Pence 
in a deadline deal to the San Francisco Giants. In return, the Phillies 
received Nate Schierholtz, Tommy Joseph, and Seth Rosin.[23] On August 
12, Pence hit his first home run as a Giant off Rockies' relief pitcher 
Rafael Betancourt.[24] On August 21, despite Pence no longer being on the 
team, the Phillies went ahead with a previously-planned Hunter Pence bobblehead 
promotion.[25] Before Game 3 of the 2012 NLDS, with the Giants down 2–0 
and facing elimination against the Cincinnati Reds, Pence gave his teammates 
a passionate pregame speech in the dugout shortly before the first pitch.[26] 
The Giants ended up beating the Reds in 3 straight games to advance to 
the NLCS. His inspirational speeches have been credited by his teammates 
as helping them rally together during the Giants' postseason and to eventually 
win the 2012 World Series.[27][28] His speeches have also become the source 
of good-natured ribbing between Giants teammates.[29] On July 13, 2013, 
Pence had a five-RBI game in a 9–0 Giants win over the San Diego Padres 
at Petco Park. With two outs in the bottom of the 8th inning, Pence robbed 
Jedd Gyorko of a hit by making a diving catch to preserve Tim Lincecum's 
no-hitter.[30] On August 27, 2013, Hunter Pence hit what at the time was 
the longest home run of the season to date. The ball hit a wall above the 
left field bleacher seats at Coors Field. According to ESPN Tracking, the 
ball traveled an estimated 476 feet.[31] Pence was named NL Player of the 
Month for September, hitting .293 with a .393 on-base percentage and 11 
home runs and 32 RBIs.[32] On September 10, Pence hit his 20th home run 
in the 1st inning and became the 7th San Francisco Giants player to hit 
20 home runs and steal 20 bases in the same season and the first since 
Barry Bonds in 1998. (Bobby Bonds, Willie Mays, Jeffrey Leonard, Orlando 
Cepeda and Glenallen Hill are the others.)[33] On September 14, Pence lifted 
his first career Giants grand slam over the center-field wall at Dodgers 
Stadium in Los Angeles off of Los Angeles Dodgers relief pitcher Stephen 
Fife and drove in a career-high 7 RBIs, helping propel the Giants to a 
historic 19–3 rout of their longtime rival the Dodgers. With the help of 
Brandon Belt's first career five-hit game, they scored the most runs in 
the history of Dodger Stadium.[34] On September 16, Pence was named National 
League Player of the Week for the third time in his career, after hitting 
.448 with 6 home runs and 19 RBI.[35] On September 27, Pence won the Willie 
Mac Award.[36] The next day, Pence agreed to a 5-year, $90 million contract 
extension with the Giants through the 2018 season.[37] Pence started all 
162 games during the 2013 season, becoming the first Giants player to do 
so since Alvin Dark in 1954, when the season was 154 games long.[32] On 
July 6, Pence was elected to his third All-Star Game.[38] On the second-to-last 
game of the season, Pence was held out of the starting lineup, ending his 
streak of consecutive starts at 331. Pence pinch-hit in the seventh inning 
to continue his games-played streak.[39] On October 7, in Game 4 of the 
2014 NLDS against the favored Washington Nationals, Pence made a leaping 
catch against the right field wall in the 6th inning to deny Jayson Werth 
an extra-base hit. This dramatic play held the Giants' 2–1 lead, helping 
the Giants to secure an eventual 3–2 victory.[40] In Game 4 of the 2014 
World Series, Pence went 3–5 with a double, scored two runs, had three 
RBIs including one by beating out a double play in the first leading to 
a run, scored on a fly caught by Jarrod Dyson in shallow center field, 
and made a nice sliding catch of a bloop hit by Lorenzo Cain in the ninth.[41] 
His performance helped lead the Giants to their 3rd World Series title 
in 5 years, as San Francisco went on to beat the Royals 3–2 in Game 7. 
Pence finished the series batting .444 with 5 RBIs and 7 runs scored. He 
had 12 hits in the series and, along with teammate Brandon Belt, had at 
least one hit in every game of the 7 game series.[42] Pence's performance 
drew some media comparisons to Barry Bonds, in terms of unusual statistical 
production.[43] On March 5, 2015, Pence suffered a fractured left forearm 
after being hit by a pitch during a spring training game against the Chicago 
Cubs.[44] He started the regular season on the disabled list, ending his 
league-leading iron man streak of consecutive games played at 383.[45] 
Pence started a rehab assignment with the Triple-A Sacramento River Cats 
on May 8 and was activated from the disabled list on May 16.[46][47] Pence 
batted .282 with two home runs and 13 RBIs in 18 games before returning 
to the disabled list on June 11 with left wrist tendinitis.[48] Pence was 
re-activated on July 7 and drove in two runs and started a double play 
after making a diving catch in a 3–0 victory over the New York Mets.[49] 
On July 10, Pence hit an opposite-field grand slam off former teammate 
Cole Hamels, part of a 15–2 rout of the Philadelphia Phillies.[50] Pence 
returned to the disabled list on August 20 with a left oblique strain and 
missed the rest of the season.[51] Pence was named National League Player 
of the Week for the fourth time in his career after batting .421 (8-for-19) 
with 2 home runs and 10 RBIs during April 25–May 1, 2016.[52] On May 14, 
Pence hit his 200th career home run in a game against the Arizona Diamondbacks.[53] 
On June 1, Pence suffered a torn hamstring tendon while running to first 
base and was expected to miss at least eight weeks.[54] Opposing fans hold 
whimsical signs making reference to Pence. Apparently, this trend started 
in 2014 with a photo his girlfriend posted of Pence in a NY diner holding 
a sign "These pretzels are making me thirsty."[55] Pence was in NY because 
the Giants had a series against the New York Mets. During that series, 
Mets fans held up signs saying things such as "Hunter Pence Puts Ketchup 
on His Hot Dog" and "Hunter Pence Eats Pizza With a Fork" (two typically 
NYC taboos).[55] Since then, the "Hunter Pence Sign" phenomenon has taken 
off. Kansas City Royals fans held up signs saying "Hunter Pence Picks the 
Hamburger in the Hot Dog Race" (one of Pence's favorites), "Hunter Pence 
Thinks Kansas City's in Kansas" and "Hunter Pence wears socks with sandals.[55]" 
Other signs have included "Hunter Pence Likes Godfather 3," "Hunter Pence 
can't parallel park," "Hunter Pence brings 13 items to the express lane," 
"Hunter Pence hates bacon," "Hunter Pence lives in a van down by the river," 
and "Hunter Pence still has a Blockbuster card.[56]" During the 2013 season, 
Pence kept to a strict Paleolithic diet. There have been conflicting reports 
since about his retention of this diet.[57][58] Also in 2013 he was diagnosed 
with Scheuermann's disease, a spinal disorder that usually develops in 
adolescence. It was not discovered in Pence until his physical before signing 
a five-year $90 million contract with the San Francisco Giants in September.[59] 
On December 3, 2015, Pence announced his engagement to Alexis Cozombolidis, 
to whom he proposed at Walt Disney World.[60] Pence appeared as himself 
in an episode of the television sitcom Fuller House in 2016.[61] Pence 
is the San Francisco host for Big League Impact, an eight-city fantasy 
football network created and led by longtime St. Louis Cardinals pitcher 
Adam Wainwright. In 2015, the organization raised more than $1 million
