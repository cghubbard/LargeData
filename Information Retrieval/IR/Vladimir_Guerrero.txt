Vladimir Alvino Guerrero (born February 9, 1975) is a Dominican former 
professional baseball player who spent 16 seasons in Major League Baseball 
(MLB) as a right fielder and designated hitter. He played for the Montreal 
Expos from (1996–2003), the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim from (2004–2009), 
the Texas Rangers in (2010), and Baltimore Orioles in (2011). In 2004, 
he was voted the American League (AL) Most Valuable Player (MVP). He helped 
lead the Angels to five AL West championships (2004, 2005, 2007, 2008, 
2009), and was voted as one of the most feared hitters in baseball in a 
2008 poll of all 30 major league managers.[1] A nine-time All Star, he 
was widely recognized as one of the best all-around players in the game 
because of his impressive offensive production, regularly hitting for power 
and average, and, prior to injuries that robbed him of range, stellar defense, 
and a strong throwing arm. He was also regarded as the game's premier "bad 
ball hitter", for his ability to consistently hit balls thrown well outside 
of his strike zone, a skill made evident on August 14, 2009, when Guerrero 
hit a pitch which bounced in front of home plate.[2] On September 26, 2011, 
Guerrero became the all-time MLB leader in hits among players from the 
Dominican Republic, surpassing Julio Franco. He was later surpassed by 
Adrián Beltré in 2014. Through 2011, he was the leader among active major 
league outfielders in errors, with 125, and was second in assists, with 
126.[3][4] His older brother, Wilton Guerrero, also played in Major League 
Baseball, and the two were teammates for several seasons on the Montreal 
Expos.[5] One of nine children, Guerrero is the younger brother of ex-major 
leaguer Wilton Guerrero, who also played with the Montreal Expos. He is 
also the cousin of minor leaguer Cristian Guerrero, and the uncle of Arizona 
Diamondbacks farmhand Gabby Guerrero.[6] His son, Vladimir Guerrero, Jr., 
was born in Montreal, Canada in 1999[7] during the elder Guerrero's time 
with the Expos,[8] and is also a baseball prospect.[9] On July 2, 2015, 
he was signed by the Toronto Blue Jays.[8] As of 2012, Guerrero had a total 
of eight children with five different women.[10] His 6-foot-3-inch (1.91 m) 
frame, strong arm, and unusual ability to hit balls out of the strike zone 
drew attention at a Dodgers training camp. After injuring his hamstring 
running out a double, he allegedly hit a home run in his next at bat to 
avoid having to run the bases. Due to his leg condition, Guerrero only 
received a 30-day contract. But he grew frustrated with the structure of 
the Dodgers camp, and left. In March 1993, Guerrero signed with the Montreal 
Expos. During the process he lied about his age, claiming to be born February 
9, 1976. It was not until March 2009 that he revealed to Major League Baseball 
that he was born February 9, 1975.[11] In 1994, Guerrero hit .314 in 37 
games with the Expos' Rookie League team. The next year he hit .333 with 
the Albany Polecats. In 1996, while advancing from Single-A to Double-A, 
Guerrero batted .360 with 24 home runs and 96 RBI.[12] His September callup 
was unproductive, although he hit his first major league home run. Guerrero 
was signed by the Montreal Expos as an amateur free agent on March 1, 1993 
and eventually made his major league debut on September 19, 1996. He was 
1 for 5 in his debut, with his first hit a single to center field off of 
Steve Avery of the Atlanta Braves in the top of the 4th.[13] He hit his 
first career home run off of the Braves closer Mark Wohlers on September 
21, 1996.[14] He was criticized during his first season in 1997 (he had 
played 9 games in 1996) for being too aggressive at the plate. Nonetheless, 
he put up solid numbers for a rookie, batting .302 with 11 HRs and 40 RBI 
in just 325 at-bats. Guerrero led all major league outfielders in errors 
in 1997 (12; tied), 1998 (17), 1999 (19), 2000 (10; tied), and 2001 (12; 
tied). He also led all NL outfielders in errors in 2002 (10), and led all 
AL outfielders in 2006 (11), and 2007 (9).[15] Scorn for Guerrero's free-swinging 
ways changed into admiration in 1998. While he continued to swing at pitches 
that were clearly balls, he also continued to hit them with authority. 
In one instance, Guerrero got a base hit off a pitch that bounced before 
arriving at home plate. Guerrero's superior hand-eye coordination and prodigious 
strength allowed him to be unusually aggressive at the plate, but still 
put up high batting averages year after year. Despite his freeswinging 
style, Guerrero never struck out 100 times in any season. Guerrero batted 
.324 with 38 HRs and 109 RBI in 1998. Before the end of the 1998 season, 
Guerrero agreed to a $28 million deal.[16] Guerrero represented the Expos 
at the 1999 All-Star Game. During the 1999 season, Guerrero maintained 
a 31-game hitting streak‚ the longest in the majors in 12 years.[17] He 
finished 1999 with 131 RBI, and in 2000, he hit 44 home runs; both figures 
are career highs. He posted similar or slightly improved numbers through 
the 2002 season. He also developed a running game, stealing 37 bases in 
2001. In 2002, he stole a career-high 40 bases, and fell one home run short 
of becoming the fourth member of the "40-40 Club." However, he hit 30+ 
home runs and stole 30+ bases in both 2001 and 2002 (see 30–30 club). Guerrero's 
2003 season was shortened due to a back injury. In 394 at-bats, he hit 
.330 with 25 HRs and 79 RBIs. Because of the injury, some in the media 
thought signing him would be a risk. While he was playing injured, though, 
he still managed to hit for the cycle on September 14, 2003. Throughout 
his career, he set single season Expos records in Batting average, Slugging, 
OPS, Home runs, RBI, TB, Hits, XBH, TOB, IBB, as well as several other 
records. He is the all time Expos career leader in Batting Average (.323), 
Home Runs (234), Slugging (.588) and OPS (.978).[18] He won the Montreal 
Expos Player of the Year award in 1998, 1999, 2000 and 2002. Guerrero was 
a free agent for the first time after the 2003 season, and he signed a 
five-year, $70 million deal with the Anaheim Angels after being courted 
by several teams. The owner of the Angels, Arte Moreno, was the first Hispanic 
controlling owner of a Major League ballclub, and Guerrero cited Moreno's 
heritage as a motivating factor for choosing the Angels over other teams.[19] 
During his first season with Angels, Guerrero led his club, and in some 
cases the American League (AL), in several offensive categories, including 
124 runs (set new club record and led the AL), 13 outfield assists (Tied 
for 1st in AL), 366 total bases (tied club record and led AL), and a season 
ending batting average of .337 (3rd in AL). He was the second player in 
club history with .300/30/100 numbers. Among AL leaders, he finished in 
the top 10 of 20 major offensive categories, which led to Guerrero being 
voted the Gene Autry Trophy (Team MVP) by his teammates. Making his fifth 
MLB All-Star game appearance in July, he led AL outfielders with 3,024,870 
votes and was the first Angel outfielder to be a starter since Reggie Jackson 
in 1984. Guerrero continued his offensive dominance in September, earning 
American League Player of the Month after batting .371 with 24 runs scored, 
six doubles, a triple, 10 home runs and 23 RBI. Guerrero was clutch down 
the stretch. Over the final seven games of the season, his 10 runs, six 
home runs and 11 RBI helped the Angels overcome a 3-game deficit, which 
ultimately led to an American League West Division Crown. Down the stretch 
of the 2004 MLB season, Guerrero was impressive. Mike Scioscia, the Angels 
manager, said that Guerrero "really carried us on his back" in the last 
month of the season, as the Angels overtook first place from the faltering 
Oakland Athletics who finished the season one game behind in the standings. 
Guerrero leading the Angels to their first Western Division title since 
1986 (The Angels won the 2002 World Series as the American League Wild 
Card). These late-season heroics led to Guerrero being chosen as the second 
Angel to win the AL MVP in franchise history. He finished with 354 points, 
100 more than second-place finisher Gary Sheffield. In the opening best-of-5 
round of the playoffs, the Angels were swept by the Boston Red Sox, and 
Guerrero had an odd batting line: just a .167 average, but six RBIs in 
three games. He would also have a grand slam in game 3. The Angels won 
the Western Division again in 2005, with Guerrero batting .317 with 32 
home runs and 108 RBIs in 520 at bats. Late in the season, Guerrero became 
the 12th player to hit his 300th home run before the age of 30 (along with 
Hank Aaron, Jimmie Foxx, Mickey Mantle, Eddie Mathews, Harmon Killebrew, 
Mel Ott, Frank Robinson, Alex Rodriguez, Ken Griffey, Jr., Juan González, 
and Andruw Jones, who achieved the mark about the same time as Guerrero). 
Guerrero had an up-and-down 2005 postseason, batting .389 in ALDS victory 
over the New York Yankees, but just .050 in the ALCS against the eventual 
world champion Chicago White Sox. He fared better in a national TV ad for 
Pepsi with the Yankees' third baseman Alex Rodriguez; the two engaged in 
a personal home run competition that ended up with the moon being broken. 
Guerrero also appeared at Game Four of the 2005 World Series, where he 
was introduced as a member of Major League Baseball's Latino Legends Team. 
Guerrero recorded his 1000th career RBI on July 15, 2006 at home against 
the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. Making his 8th Major League Baseball All-Star 
game appearance, Guerrero subsequently won his first career Home Run Derby 
in the 2007 season, highlighted by a 503-foot (153 m) home run. He is the 
third Angel to win the Derby (after Wally Joyner in 1986, and Garret Anderson 
in 2003). Guerrero was chosen for the All-Star Game in each of his first 
four seasons with the Angels (2004–2007). Guerrero's stellar fielding talent 
dwindled in the later 2000s due to age and injuries, prompting the long-time 
outfielder to be reassigned as a designated hitter at the start of the 
2009 season.[20] In 2009, Guerrero was named # 37 on the Sporting News' 
list of the 50 greatest current players in baseball. A panel of 100 baseball 
people, many of them members of the Baseball Hall of Fame and winners of 
major baseball awards, was polled to arrive at the list.[21] On August 
10, Guerrero hit his 400th career home run off Tampa Bay Rays pitcher Russ 
Springer.[22] On August 26, he recorded his 1,000th career hit as an Angel, 
a single off Detroit Tigers pitcher Edwin Jackson. This hit made Guerrero 
only the fourth player (Frank Robinson, Dave Winfield, Fred McGriff) to 
record 1,000 hits as a National League player and as an American league 
player.[citation needed] On October 11, 2009, Guerrero hit a two-run RBI 
single to score Bobby Abreu and Chone Figgins off Jonathan Papelbon in 
the ninth-inning. The single gave the Angels a 7–6 lead and eventually 
the win to finally advance to the ALCS and beat the Boston Red Sox for 
the first time ever in postseason history. It was called "the biggest hit 
in Vlad's career." 2009 was the first time that Guerrero had a batting 
average below .300 (.295), an OPS below .800 (.794), or a doubles total 
less than 20 (16). He set 15 team records – 10 career, 5 single season 
– during his tenure with the Angels. On January 11, 2010, Guerrero signed 
a one-year, $5.5 million deal with incentives and a 2011 option with the 
Texas Rangers. He broke up a no-hitter by Shaun Marcum in the seventh inning 
of the Opening Day game against the Toronto Blue Jays on April 5, 2010.[23] 
On May 6, 2010 Guerrero hit two home runs versus the Kansas City Royals 
to secure a 13–12 win. On May 13, 2010 Guerrero's walk off line drive to 
left field won the final game of a three-game series against the Oakland 
Athletics in the bottom of the twelfth. On May 25, 2010 he hit two more 
home runs to secure another win over the Kansas City Royals. On June 30, 
2010, against his former team, the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, Guerrero 
hit two home runs and went 4-for-4 with 5 RBIs. Guerrero wound up appearing 
in 152 games with a batting average of .300 hitting 29 home runs and 115 
RBIs earning him a Silver Slugger Award in the regular season for a Texas 
Rangers club that wound up winning its division and ultimately, the first 
pennant in Rangers' history. He also earned his ninth invitation to the 
All-Star Game.[24] On October 22, 2010, Guerrero drove in 3 runs during 
game 6 of the American League Championship Series against the New York 
Yankees, capturing the first American League pennant for the Texas Rangers.[25] 
The Rangers would go on to lose the World Series to the San Francisco Giants 
in five games. On November 3 the Rangers declined to pick up Guerrero's 
2011 option making him a free agent. Guerrero signed a one-year, US $8 
million contract with the Baltimore Orioles on February 18, 2011.[26] He 
became the all-time MLB hits leader among Dominican-born players when he 
singled off Josh Beckett in the sixth inning of a 6–3 victory over the 
Boston Red Sox at Camden Yards on September 26, 2011.[27] In 2011, Guerrero 
hit .290, his lowest since his rookie year with the Montreal Expos in 1996. 
He also had 13 home runs and 63 RBIs on a struggling Orioles team. Though 
it seemed like an unproductive year for him, Guerrero still hit in the 
top 20 and had 163 base hits. Guerrero remained unsigned by any team going 
into the 2012 Major League Baseball season, leading to much speculation 
about his potential retirement, though Guerrero insisted that he would 
not retire.[28] On May 10, 2012, Guerrero signed a minor league contract 
with the Toronto Blue Jays.[29] During his first game for the Class-A Dunedin 
Blue Jays on Sunday May 27, 2012, Guerrero hit a home run.[30] Guerrero 
played in 4 games for Dunedin, with 9 hits in 20 at bats, including 4 home 
runs and was then promoted to the Triple-A Las Vegas 51s. With the 51s 
he played in 8 games, with 10 hits in 33 at-bats (.303 avg). He asked for, 
and was granted, his release on June 12, 2012.[31] On November 4, 2012 
Guerrero made his debut in the Liga de Béisbol Profesional de la República 
Dominicana with Tigres del Licey.[32] He only played eight games with Tigres 
logging a batting average of .188 without a home run. On November 20, 2012 
Guerrero quit the team after he was informed by team management that he 
would only be used as a pinch hitter.[33] On April 4, 2013, Guerrero signed 
with the Long Island Ducks of the Atlantic League.[34] He informed the 
team that he had family issues to attend to and wouldn't be joining them 
to start the season. He never did arrive. On March 31, 2014, Guerrero signed 
a one-day contract with the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim and officially 
retired.[35] Guerrero batted without wearing batting gloves, a custom rarely 
seen in modern baseball. In an interview with Yahoo! Sports, he attributed 
this to helping his grandfather pull cows home barehanded as a young boy 
in the Dominican Republic.[36] To improve his grip on the bat, he coats 
his helmet with pine tar and simply rubs his helmet before going into the 
on-deck circle. As the season progresses, his batting helmet becomes covered 
in the substance.[37][38] Guerrero batted over .300 from 1997 to 2008. 
He has driven in over 100 runs in every season but 2003 and 2008. Along 
with his 2004 MVP season, he has finished 6th (2000), 4th (2002), 3rd (2005), 
9th (2006), and 3rd (2007) in MVP voting.[24] In 2008, Guerrero swung at 
a higher percentage of pitches outside the strike zone, 45.5%, than any 
other hitter in major league baseball up to that time. [39] He had a 44-game 
hitting streak exclusively against the Texas Rangers from 2004 to 2006, 
the longest such player-vs.-team streak in MLB history since 1969.[17] 
The streak occurred over his first 44 appearances against the Rangers. 
The streak finally came to an end in August 2006 in a game in which Guerrero 
was intentionally walked three times, walked four times overall, and finished 
0-for-1. Guerrero has decimated Ranger pitching over his career, putting 
up a career batting line of .395/.461/.661 with 25 HR, 34 Doubles and 70 
RBI in 108 games.[40] During the 2009 post-season, Cal Ripken Jr. commented 
during a TBS post-game report that Guerrero was "the best bad-ball hitter 
he's ever seen." On one occasion in a game against the Baltimore Orioles, 
Guerrero hit a pitch that bounced in the dirt before home plate. Even more 
unusual, his bat struck the ground as well before hitting the ball.[2] 
Guerrero was named to the Dominican Republic's roster for the 2006 World 
Baseball Classic, although he eventually withdrew due to the death of three 
cousins in a car accident immediately before the tournament.[41] He has 
provided several job opportunities in his hometown in the Dominican Republic 
through his business ventures: a concrete-block factory, a propane distribution 
company, a supermarket, a livestock and vegetable farm, and a women's clothing
