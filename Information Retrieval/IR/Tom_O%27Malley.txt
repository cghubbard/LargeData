As player As coach Thomas Patrick O'Malley (born December 25, 1960 in Orange, 
New Jersey) is a former Major League baseball player born in Orange, New 
Jersey, and raised in Montoursville, Pennsylvania in the United States. 
He played for the San Francisco Giants, Chicago White Sox, Baltimore Orioles, 
Texas Rangers, Montreal Expos, and New York Mets. He also spent six highly 
successful seasons in the Japanese Central League with the Hanshin Tigers 
and Yakult Swallows. He also worked as a manager for the Newark Bears in 
the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball after retiring. O'Malley was 
drafted by the San Francisco Giants in 1979, and made his major league 
debut with the Giants in 1982. He played in 135 major league games in 1983, 
but split time with the majors and minors afterwards, spending nine years 
playing for six different teams. He was signed by the Hanshin Tigers in 
1991, and immediately became the regular third baseman for the team. He 
won the Central League golden glove award in 1992, and led the league in 
on-base-percentage from 1992 to 1995, averaging 20 HRs and a batting average 
over .300 each season. He introduced Jim Paciorek to the Tigers in 1992, 
and managed to put the struggling Tigers in second place that year. O'Malley 
won the batting title in 1993, but left the Tigers in 1994 after having 
issues with manager Katsuhiro Nakamura. He was quickly picked up by the 
Yakult Swallows in 1995, and played his best season that year, hitting 
31 home runs with 87 RBIs and a .307 batting average. The Swallows won 
the Japan Series that year, and O'Malley was awarded both the season MVP 
award, and the Japan Series MVP award. He hit .300 for the sixth season 
in a row in 1996, (a record among non-Japanese players in the Japanese 
professional leagues) but split with the Swallows over contract obligations. 
He returned to the major leagues to spend spring training with the Texas 
Rangers, but retired after he was cut from the team. He managed the Newark 
Bears from 1998 to 2001 after retiring. He returned to Japan during the 
Hanshin Tigers 2002 spring training camp, and served as a batting coach 
throughout the season. He was also a mentor for non-Japanese players, including 
George Arias, Jeff Williams, Trey Moore, and Jerrod Riggan, who contributed 
to the Tigers' championship in 2003. O'Malley resigned from his coaching 
job after Senichi Hoshino resigned from his managerial position. He scouted 
players in the major and minor leagues for the Hanshin Tigers until 2009, 
and traveled to Japan during spring training to offer advice to non-Japanese 
players. He has appeared in various television commercials in the local 
Kansai region (Hanshin Electric Railway Co., Ltd.), and posters featuring
