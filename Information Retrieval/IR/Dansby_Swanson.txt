James Dansby Swanson (born February 11, 1994) is an American professional 
baseball shortstop for the Atlanta Braves of Major League Baseball (MLB). 
Swanson attended Vanderbilt University and played college baseball for 
the Vanderbilt Commodores. The Arizona Diamondbacks selected him first 
overall in the 2015 Major League Baseball draft, and traded him to the 
Braves during the 2015–16 offseason. He was born on February 11, 1994 in 
Kennesaw, Georgia, to parents Cooter and Nancy (née Dansby) Swanson.[1] 
Swanson grew up in Marietta with two older siblings, sister Lindsey and 
brother Chase.[2] Both his father and brother played college baseball, 
while his mother played collegiate basketball and tennis. Swanson's sister 
was a softball player.[3] Dansby attended Marietta High School, where he 
played basketball and baseball.[4] As a child, Swanson's favorite teams 
were the Atlanta Braves and Atlanta Hawks.[5][6] He was drafted by the 
Colorado Rockies in the 38th round of the 2012 Major League Baseball Draft, 
but did not sign and attended Vanderbilt University.[7] As a freshman, 
he played in only 11 games due to a broken bone in his foot and a torn 
labrum in his non throwing shoulder.[8] As a sophomore in 2014, he was 
named an All-Southeastern Conference.[9] After the Commodores beat the 
Virginia Cavaliers in the 2014 College World Series, he was named the College 
World Series Most Outstanding Player.[10][11] He was a finalist for the 
2015 Golden Spikes Award, presented annually to the nation's top college 
player.[12] The Arizona Diamondbacks selected Swanson with the first overall 
selection of the 2015 Major League Baseball Draft.[13] Swanson signed with 
the Diamondbacks, receiving a $6.5 million signing bonus.[14][15] While 
batting in a simulated game against Yoan López in July 2015, Swanson was 
hit in the face with a pitch.[16] The injury delayed his professional debut, 
which took place on August 12, 2015, with the Hillsboro Hops of the Class 
A-Short Season Northwest League.[17] Swanson played in 22 games in his 
first professional season and finished with a .289 batting average, one 
home run, fourteen walks, and eleven RBIs.[18][19] On December 9, 2015, 
the Diamondbacks traded Swanson, Ender Inciarte, and Aaron Blair to the 
Atlanta Braves for Shelby Miller and Gabe Speier.[20] The Braves invited 
Swanson to spring training,[21] and he was sent to the Carolina Mudcats 
of the Class A-Advanced Carolina League at the end of spring training.[22] 
Swanson was promoted to the Mississippi Braves of the Class AA Southern 
League on April 30, 2016, after hitting .333/.441/.526 in 21 appearances 
at Carolina.[23] On June 28, he was named to appear in the All-Star Futures 
Game, soon after having played the Southern League All-Star Game.[24][25] 
On August 16, the Braves announced that Swanson would be promoted to the 
major leagues the next day.[26][27] On August 17, he went 2-4 in his MLB 
debut, including his first career hit off of Minnesota Twins pitcher Kyle 
Gibson.[28] Swanson hit an inside-the-park home run on September 6, his 
team's first such home run since 2001.[29] With the hit, Swanson followed 
Paul Runge as the second Brave to make an inside-the-park home run his
