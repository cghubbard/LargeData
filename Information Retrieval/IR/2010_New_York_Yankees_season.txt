The 2010 New York Yankees season was the 110th season for the New York 
Yankees franchise (counting its two years as the Baltimore Orioles; then 
moving to Manhattan as the Highlanders.) The Yankees were attempting to 
defend its status as American League and World Series champions, but lost 
in the ALCS to the Texas Rangers. The Yankees opened and closed the regular 
season against the Boston Red Sox at Fenway Park.[1][2] This marked the 
first time since 1950 this happened.[3] The Yankees and the Los Angeles 
Dodgers renewed their rivalry as the Bronx Bombers traveled west to face 
former Yankee icons Joe Torre and Don Mattingly, both of them current and 
future Dodgers managers. The Yankees' regular season record for 2010 was 
95 wins, 67 losses, 2nd place in the AL East behind Tampa and good for 
the AL Wild Card.[4] Infielders Coaches With the series win in Oakland 
clinched, the club matched the 1926 Yankees' all-time franchise record 
by winning each of the first five series of the season. Only one other 
club in team history started with as many as four series wins in a row, 
the 1922 Yankees. Both of those teams made it to the World Series, although 
they lost. During this time, the Yankees tied an April record of 12 straight 
error-less games, from April 7 to 22. On April 22 against the Oakland Athletics 
the Yankees turned a triple play for the first time since June 3, 1968. 
On May 8, Mark Teixeira hit 3 home runs against the Red Sox, becoming only 
the second Yankee player in history since Lou Gehrig to accomplish the 
feat.[17] On June 11, Andy Pettitte won his 200th game as a Yankee, becoming 
the third player to achieve the feat. The other two players are Yankee 
pitching legends Red Ruffing (231) and Whitey Ford (236). During the last 
2 games against the Astros, Jorge Posada hit grand slams in back-to-back 
games becoming the third Yankee player to do so. The other two players 
are Baseball Hall of Fame members and Yankee legends Babe Ruth and Bill 
Dickey.[18] Brett Gardner became the first player in MLB history to hit 
a grand slam and an inside-the-park home run during back-to-back games 
on July 3–4. The Yankees suffered three great losses during the month of 
July, two of which happened during the All-Star weekend. First, on July 
11, longtime Yankee Stadium public address announcer Bob Sheppard died 
at age 99. Then just two days later on July 13, longtime owner George Steinbrenner 
died at age 80.[19] Steinbrenner was the longest tenured owner in Yankees 
history and among active ownership. On July 21, former Yankee manager and 
executive Ralph Houk died. On July 18, the Yankees were 58-33, their best 
91-game record since the 1998 season, when they were 68-23, en route to 
a then American League record 114 wins, and a World Series victory over 
the Padres in 4 games. Against the Royals on July 22, Derek Jeter hit only 
the second inside-the-park home run of his career, in a 10–4 Yankee win 
– his first came in his rookie year. The next day, Jorge Posada drove in 
his 1,000th career RBI against the Royals, becoming only the 12th Yankee 
to join the 1,000 RBI club and became one of three Yankees catchers to 
reach that mark, along with Yogi Berra (1,430) and Bill Dickey (1,209). 
Posada also became just the 5th catcher in MLB history with 1,000 RBI, 
350 doubles and 250 home runs. The other four are Carlton Fisk, Iván Rodríguez, 
Johnny Bench and Gary Carter.[20] On July 25, Robinson Canó recorded his 
1,000th career hit, becoming the third-quickest homegrown Yankees player 
– behind Derek Jeter and Don Mattingly – to reach that plateau.[21] On 
August 4, Alex Rodriguez hit his 600th career home run against the Toronto 
Blue Jays, becoming the youngest player in history to do so.[22] On August 
8, Derek Jeter passed Babe Ruth on the all-time hits list when he knocked 
in a second-inning single collecting his 2,874th hit. He is the first Yankee 
to hold the Major League lead in hits among active players since Johnny 
Mize in 1952, according to the Elias Sports Bureau.[23] During the same 
game against the Red Sox, Alex Rodriguez recorded his 300th career stolen 
base, making Rodriguez the 10th player in baseball history with at least 
1,500 runs scored, 2,500 hits, 200 home runs and 300 stolen bases. Rodriguez 
joined a select group in that category -- Jeter, Damon, Bonds, Biggio, 
Alomar, Rickey Henderson, Molitor, Joe Morgan and Mays—but only A-Rod, 
Mays and Bonds have hit as many as 600 homers to go along with the 300 
steals. Against the Kansas City Royals on August 14, Rodriguez hit 3 home 
runs in a game for the 4th time in his career.[24] On August 22, Sabathia 
recorded his 16th consecutive start of at least six innings allowing three 
earned runs or less, breaking a tie with Ron Guidry (from his Cy Young 
Award winning 1978 season for the longest streak in franchise history).[25] 
On September 18, CC Sabathia notched his 20th win for the first time in 
his career.[26] He also became the first pitcher in 2010 to reach 20 wins. 
On September 24, A-Rod notched career home runs #609 and #610, putting 
him in sole possession of 6th place on the all-time home run list. The 
blasts put him one home run ahead of MLB great Sammy Sosa. Also on this 
date, Mark Teixeira and A-Rod, who have been teammates for 3 years (2003 
with Rangers, and 2009-10 with Yankees), hit two home runs in a game each 
for the first time. On September 28, the Yankees clinched a playoff berth 
for the 15th time in the last 16 seasons. However, they lost the division 
crown to the Tampa Bay Rays on the last day of the season after an 8-4 
loss to the Red Sox, thus they were the Wild Card. Losing 17 of their last 
26 games, the Yankees failed to clinch the AL East after holding the lead 
on Labor Day for the first time since 1944. The Yankees faced the Twins 
in the ALDS, and swept them in 3 games. This was the fourth time both teams 
have met in the postseason, with the Yankees winning all four matchups: 
a 3-1 Yankees win in 2003, a 3-1 Yankees win in 2004, and a Yankees sweep 
in 2009. However, this was the first time the Twins held home-field advantage, 
as the Yankees qualified for the Wild Card, while the Twins won the American 
League Central. 8:30 p.m. (EDT) at Target Field in Minneapolis, Minnesota
