Wallace Wade Moon,[1] known as Wally Moon, (born April 3, 1930, in Bay, 
Craighead County, Arkansas) is a former Major League Baseball outfielder. 
Moon played his 12-year career in the major leagues for the St. Louis Cardinals 
(1954–58) and Los Angeles Dodgers (1959–65). He batted left-handed and 
threw right-handed. Moon was the 1954 National League Rookie of the Year. 
He was an All-Star for two seasons and a Gold Glove winner one season. 
Moon batted .295 or more for seven seasons. He led the National League 
in triples in 1959 and in fielding percentage as left fielder in 1960 and 
1961. Moon was a 3-time World Series champion with the Los Angeles Dodgers 
in 1959, 1963, and 1965. Moon was named after Wallace Wade, a former college 
football coach at the University of Alabama and Duke University. From a 
family of educators, he earned a master's degree in administrative education 
from Texas A&M University in College Station while he was still in the 
minor leagues.[1] He coached from 1953 to 1954 at Lake City, also in Craighead 
County, Arkansas. In the spring of 1954, the Cardinals told Moon to report 
to their minor league spring training camp. He ignored the order and reported 
instead to St. Petersburg with the Cardinals. He said that he would make 
the team or quit baseball. They let him stay, and by the end of the spring 
training he replaced Enos Slaughter in the outfield. To make room for him 
on the roster, St. Louis sent Slaughter to the New York Yankees. Moon made 
his major league debut on April 13, 1954. In his first at-bat, despite 
chants of "We want Slaughter", he belted a home run against the Chicago 
Cubs; in the same game Tom Alston became the first African American to 
play for the Cardinals. Moon finished his rookie season with a .304 batting 
average, 12 home runs, 76 runs batted in, and career-high numbers in runs 
(106), hits (193), doubles (29), and stolen bases (18) in 151 games. He 
earned both the MLB Rookie of the Year and The Sporting News Rookie of 
the Year honors. Almost a unanimous vote, Moon won easily over Ernie Banks, 
Gene Conley and Hank Aaron.[1] A fine left fielder with a good arm, Moon 
also played right field and center as well as first base. He hit a career-high 
24 homers in 1957, and made the All-Star team in 1957 and 1959 (two games 
were played). Twice in his career, Moon compiled double figures in doubles, 
triples, home runs and stolen bases: 22, 11, 16, 12 in 1956, and 26, 11, 
19, 15 in 1959, his first year with the Dodgers. After the 1958 season, 
the Cardinals traded Moon to the Dodgers for outfielder Gino Cimoli. Both 
players were coming off years when they batted below .250; the Cardinals 
also sent pitcher Phil Paine, who never played for the Dodgers. Moon was 
initially concerned about batting in the converted Los Angeles Memorial 
Coliseum because right field was 440 feet away, making it difficult for 
a left-handed batter. However, the left field seats were only 251 feet 
away, protected by a 42-foot high screen. After consulting with friend 
and mentor Stan Musial, Moon adjusted his batting stance to emphasize hitting 
to left. The results were very successful.[1] In his first season with 
the Dodgers, the team won the World Championship. Moon provided support 
in the lineup for Duke Snider, Gil Hodges and Don Demeter. He gained quick 
public acclaim in 1959 for the "Moon shots" that he hit over the high left 
field screen.[1][2] Moon hit a home run in the sixth and final game of 
that World Series, which the Dodgers won over the Chicago White Sox. He 
also caught Luis Aparicio's fly ball for the final out of the Series. Moon 
was a Gold Glove Award winner for left field in 1960, and had another good 
season in 1961, batting .328 with 17 home runs and 88 runs batted in. A 
career .289 hitter, Moon hit 142 home runs with 661 runs batted in during 
1457 games, with a .371 on-base percentage and a .445 slugging average 
for a combined .816 on-base plus slugging percentage. He also scored the 
last run ever in the Coliseum.[1] In 1969, Moon was a batting coach for 
the San Diego Padres, joining manager Preston Gómez and pitching coach 
and former teammate Roger Craig. Moon went on to become athletic director 
and baseball coach at John Brown University, and a coach and minor league 
manager and owner of the San Antonio Dodgers for four years beginning in 
the late 1970s. Moon moved to Bryan, Texas, where he has lived for over 
25 years. He retired in 1998. He is married to Bettye and has five children 
and seven grandchildren.[1] Moon is featured on many websites featuring 
baseball cards, as he sported a prominent unibrow. The January 27, 1960 
episode ("The Larry Hanify Story") of the popular TV western Wagon Train 
featured Moon in a brief role.[3][4] The end credits included: "And Introducing 
Wally Moon as Sheriff Bender." There was no baseball tie-in with his character, 
but the sheriff was hit by a bullet during a shoot-out with Tommy Sands' 
bad guy. A rerun of the program aired on the Encore Westerns Channel, May
