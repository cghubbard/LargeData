The Arizona League is a minor league baseball league that operates in and 
around Phoenix, Arizona. It is a rookie-level league run by Major League 
Baseball since 1989. Along with the Gulf Coast League, it forms the lowest 
rung of the minor-league system. Games are not marketed to the general 
public, and no admission is charged for spectators. Games are played at 
the spring training complexes of the teams' parent organizations from mid-June 
until the end of August. Every Cactus League team fields an Arizona League 
team with the exception of the Colorado Rockies.[1] Night games are commonly 
played in the spring training stadium, though games may be played at the 
team's practice fields. The regular season is 56 games, with a 35-player 
roster limit. Players must not have more than three years of previous minor 
league experience to be eligible to play.[2] Teams primarily consist of 
players from the Dominican Republic and recently drafted high school and 
college players, and are owned by their parent clubs. Most of the players 
have just been selected in that year's entry draft, two to three weeks 
before the league begins its season. The league is also where major league 
players often go for their first rehab assignments. No official attendance 
records are kept as there is no paid admittance fee, and no concessions 
are sold. Few spectators show up, and games are typically played in temperatures 
above 100 °F. For 2016, the six teams who won their division for the first 
and second half of the season qualify for the playoffs. If a team wins 
the first and second half, the next best team in that division by overall 
record qualifies for the playoffs. The top two teams by overall record 
receive a bye to the semifinals. All playoff games are single elimination, 
with the exception of a best-of-3 final.[3] Bob Richmond is the league
