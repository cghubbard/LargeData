The 1968 Minnesota Twins season was a season in American baseball. The 
team finished 79–83, seventh in the American League. Leadoff batter César 
Tovar sparked the offense, finishing second in the AL with 167 hits and 
third with 89 runs. Tony Oliva was third in the AL with a .289 batting 
average. Harmon Killebrew had 17 HR and 40 RBI at the All-Star break, but 
was injured in the game and missed the second half of the season. It took 
until their eighth season for the Twins to get no-hit and then it happened 
profoundly, as their first opposing no-hitter was the perfect game thrown 
by Oakland's Jim "Catfish" Hunter on May 8 in Oakland. Hunter struck out 
eleven, and drove in three of his team's four runs. A first for the Twins: 
on July 11, Rick Renick played his first-ever major league game, as shortstop. 
In his first big-league at bat, he homered. The run came off Detroit Tigers 
pitcher Mickey Lolich. Renick is the first Twins player to accomplish the 
feat, but will be joined in history by Dave McKay (1975), Gary Gaetti (1981) 
and Andre David (1984). They'll all be joined by Eddie Rosario in 2015, 
who hits a homer not only in his first at bat, but on the first major-league 
pitch thrown to him. Three Twins made the All-Star Game: first baseman 
Harmon Killebrew, second baseman Rod Carew, and outfielder Tony Oliva. 
On September 22, utility player César Tovar played all nine positions, 
an inning each, against the Oakland Athletics. Duplicating the feat that 
Bert Campaneris had performed three years prior, Tovar topped Campy by 
starting as pitcher and allowing no hits or runs, for a 0.00 earned run 
average. In the inning, the first man to face Tovar was Campaneris, who 
fouled out. Tovar then struck out slugger Reggie Jackson.[2] Four Twins 
won 10 or more games: Dean Chance (16–16), Jim Kaat (14–12) Jim Merritt 
(12–16), Dave Boswell (10–13). Pitcher Jim Kaat won his seventh Gold Glove. 
Al Worthington led the American League with 18 saves. 1,143,257 fans attended 
Twins games, the fourth highest total in the American League. [1] [2] [3]
