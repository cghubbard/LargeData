John Karl Wetteland (born August 21, 1966) is a retired American Major 
League Baseball pitcher who specialized as a closer. During a 12-year career 
(from 1989â€“2000), he pitched for four different teams: the Los Angeles 
Dodgers, Montreal Expos, New York Yankees, and Texas Rangers. With the 
Yankees, he won the 1996 World Series over the Atlanta Braves and was named 
the World Series MVP. Wetteland was signed by the Dodgers as their second 
choice in the June 1985 amateur draft (Secondary Phase). He was later claimed 
by the Detroit Tigers in December 1989 as a Rule 5 draft pick, but was 
soon returned to the Dodgers. While playing in the Pacific Coast League, 
he garnered notice by earning 20 saves in 20 chances. He made his major 
league debut on May 31, 1989. After struggling with his first five starts 
in 1990, Wetteland asked to be switched to the bullpen, and became a full-time 
closer in 1992. After the 1991 season, Wetteland was traded twice; first 
to the Cincinnati Reds for Eric Davis, and then to the Expos for Dave Martinez. 
On April 5, 1995 he was traded to the Yankees for Fernando Seguignol. During 
the 1996 season, he led the American League in saves, totaling 43, and 
appeared in the All-Star Game. During the 1996 World Series, Wetteland 
had 4 saves and the Yankees won the World Series against the Atlanta Braves 
in 6 games. Wetteland was given the World Series MVP Award that year, recording 
the maximum four saves possible during the Series, tying the record for 
the most saves in a single postseason series (Dennis Eckersley first did 
it in the 1988 ALCS; since then, Greg Holland matched it in the 2014 ALCS), 
and setting a record for saves in the full postseason, with 7 (since then, 
Robb Nen, Troy Percival, Brad Lidge, Koji Uehara, and Holland, share this 
record). He was awarded with the 1996 Rolaids Relief Man Award. The most 
famous of the four World Series saves was in Game 5, as a result of ex-Reds 
teammate Paul O'Neill robbing Luis Polonia of a potential extra-base hit 
to right-center field. That save, and batterymate Jim Leyritz's three-run 
game-winning home run in Game 4, both in the final two games in Atlanta 
Fulton County Stadium, are the two most remembered moments of that World 
Series. The Yankees allowed Wetteland to leave as a free agent due to the 
emergence of Mariano Rivera. He joined the Texas Rangers on December 16, 
1996, signing a 4-year contract worth $23 million. Before the 1999 season, 
Wetteland underwent elbow surgery. The surgery robbed him of some of his 
fastball speed, forcing him to expand his repertoire to include a slider, 
curveball, and change-up. Wetteland was again named to the All-Star team 
for the 1999 season, where he pitched a scoreless 9th inning, and became 
the first Rangers pitcher to earn an All-Star save. His 43 saves that year 
set a new Rangers record. His final game was on September 20, 2000, and 
he retired at age 33 after his Rangers contract expired during the 2000 
offseason. Wetteland was awarded the Rolaids Reliever of the Decade after 
earning the most saves of any pitcher during the 1990s. He is also the 
Rangers all-time saves leader. His final win/loss percentage was .516, 
with 48 wins and 45 losses. In 2005, Wetteland was inducted into the Texas 
Rangers Hall of Fame. On January 27, 2006, Wetteland was hired as the bullpen 
coach of the Washington Nationals. However, on June 15, 2006, Wetteland 
was relieved of his duties by manager Frank Robinson, and offered another 
position within the organization. On December 3, 2008, Wetteland was announced 
as the bullpen coach for the Seattle Mariners.[1] He served in this position 
until after the end of the 2010 season, when new manager Eric Wedge replaced 
him with Triple-A Tacoma Rainiers pitching coach Jaime Navarro. Wetteland 
and his ex-wife Michele met while he was playing for the Double-A San Antonio 
Missions. Michele left John in 2014. Their divorce by state decree was 
final in 2015. They have four children. On May 18, 2007, Wetteland, a self 
proclaimed born-again Christian, was introduced as an assistant baseball 
coach and Bible teacher at Liberty Christian School in Argyle, Texas. On 
November 12, 2009, Wetteland was hospitalized for what was originally reported 
to be a "mental issue."[2] In a subsequent statement upon Wetteland's release 
the same night, the Seattle Mariners indicated that the cause of the hospitalization 
was "because of an extremely high heart rate" linked to high blood pressure.[3]
