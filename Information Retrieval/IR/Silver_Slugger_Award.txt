The Silver Slugger Award is awarded annually to the best offensive player 
at each position in both the American League and the National League, as 
determined by the coaches and managers of Major League Baseball (MLB). 
These voters consider several offensive categories in selecting the winners, 
including batting average, slugging percentage, and on-base percentage, 
in addition to "coaches' and managers' general impressions of a player's 
overall offensive value".[1] Managers and coaches are not permitted to 
vote for players on their own team.[1] The Silver Slugger was first awarded 
in 1980 and is given by Hillerich & Bradsby, the manufacturer of Louisville 
Slugger bats.[2] The award is a bat-shaped trophy, 3 feet (91 cm) tall, 
engraved with the names of each of the winners from the league[1] and plated 
with sterling silver.[3] The prize is presented to outfielders irrespective 
of their specific position.[4][5] This means that it is possible for three 
left fielders, or any other combination of outfielders, to win the award 
in the same year, rather than one left fielder, one center fielder, and 
one right fielder. In addition, only National League pitchers receive a 
Silver Slugger Award;[5] lineups in the American League usually include 
a designated hitter in place of the pitcher in the batting order,[6] so 
the designated hitter receives the award instead.[4] Embattled home run 
record-holder Barry Bonds[7] won twelve Silver Slugger Awards in his career 
as an outfielder, the most of any player.[5][8] He also won the award in 
five consecutive seasons twice in his career: from 1990 to 1994, and again 
from 2000 to 2004. Retired catcher Mike Piazza and former New York Yankees 
third baseman Alex Rodriguez are tied for second, with ten wins each.[4][5] 
Rodriguez' awards are split between two positions; he won seven Silver 
Sluggers as a shortstop for the Seattle Mariners and Texas Rangers, and 
three with the Yankees as a third baseman.[9] Wade Boggs leads third basemen 
with eight Silver Slugger Awards;[4][10] Barry Larkin leads shortstops 
with nine.[5][11] Other leaders include Ryne Sandberg (seven wins as a 
second baseman)[5][12] and Mike Hampton (five wins as a pitcher).[5][13] 
Todd Helton[5][14] and Albert Pujols[5][15] are tied for the most wins 
among first baseman with four, although Pujols has won two awards at other 
positions. David Ortiz has won seven awards at designated hitter position,
