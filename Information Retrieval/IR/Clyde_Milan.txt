As player As manager Jesse Clyde Milan (March 25, 1887 – March 3, 1953) 
was an American baseball player who spent his entire career as an outfielder 
with the Washington Senators (1907–1922). He was not a powerful batter,

"Deerfoot" for his speed. He set a modern-rules record for stolen bases 
in a season with 88 in 1912, a mark surpassed three years later by Ty Cobb. 
Milan was mostly a center fielder. He was born in Linden, Tennessee and 
died 22 days before his 66th birthday, in Orlando, Florida. During spring 
training as a coach, he collapsed from the heat and suffered a fatal heart

batted in over 1982 games. He accumulated 495 stolen bases (tied for 37th

and spent seventeen seasons (1928–29 and 1938 until his death) as a coach 
with Washington. His brother, Horace Milan, was briefly his teammate with
