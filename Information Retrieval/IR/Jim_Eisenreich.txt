James Michael Eisenreich (/ˈaɪzᵻnraɪk/; born April 18, 1959) is an American 
former Major League Baseball player with a 15-year career from 1982–1984 
and 1987–1998. He played for the Minnesota Twins and Kansas City Royals 
of the American League, and the Philadelphia Phillies, Florida Marlins 
and Los Angeles Dodgers of the National League. He played first base, outfield 
and designated hitter. In 1993, his first year with the Phillies, Eisenreich 
put together one of his best years, batting .318 and helping the Phillies 
to win the National League pennant. As the Phillies began their slide the 
next season, Eisenreich was one of the team's few bright spots, batting 
.361 for the last place Phillies in 1996. After signing with the Florida 
Marlins prior to the 1997 season, Eisenreich played a pivotal role in the 
1997 World Series helping the Marlins reach a championship in their 5th 
year. Eisenreich was the runner on 2nd base when Edgar Renter hit his walkoff 
single in the bottom of the 11th inning of Game 7.[1] Eisenreich was part 
of a "blockbuster" baseball trade[2] on May 14, 1998. He was traded from 
the Florida Marlins, with Bobby Bonilla, Gary Sheffield, Charles Johnson, 
and Manuel Barrios, to the Los Angeles Dodgers for Todd Zeile and Mike 
Piazza. Eisenreich was noted in Los Angeles for his longtime success against 
Dodger pitching staffs, despite those staffs being among the best. His 
.405 batting average and .620 slugging percentage greatly exceed his other 
career numbers and rank among the most successful of any one player against 
any team.[3] Eisenreich has Tourette syndrome (TS),[4] which caused him 
to go on to the voluntary retirement list between 1984 and 1987 while undergoing 
treatment. Eisenreich was replaced on the Twins roster by Kirby Puckett. 
In 1990, he was the first recipient of the Tony Conigliaro Award, which 
is given annually to a Major League Baseball player who has overcome a 
significant obstacle in life.[5] He also is an inductee of the Baseball 
Reliquary Shrine of the Eternals.[6] Eisenreich resides in the Kansas City 
area and runs the Jim Eisenreich Foundation for Children with Tourette's 
Syndrome whose goal is to help children with TS to achieve personal success.[4]
