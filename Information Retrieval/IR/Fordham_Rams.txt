The Fordham University varsity sports teams are known as the Fordham Rams. 
Their colors are maroon and white. The Fordham Rams are members of NCAA 
Division I and compete in the Atlantic 10 Conference for all sports except 
football.[3] In football, the Rams play in the Patriot League of NCAA Division 
1 Football Championship Subdivision.[4] The University also supports a 
number of club sports, and a significant intramural sports program. The 
University's athletic booster clubs include the Sixth Man Club for basketball 
and the Afterguard for sailing. Fordham University sports, though not part 
of the Ivy League, has nevertheless been credited with inspiring the term 
by comparison. The first usage of "Ivy" in reference to a group of colleges 
is from sportswriter Stanley Woodward (1895–1965). In an article that appeared 
in the New York Tribune on October 14, 1933, Woodward, referencing football, 
wrote William Morris writes that Stanley Woodward actually took the term 
from fellow New York Tribune sportswriter Caswell Adams.[6] Morris writes 
that during the 1930s, the Fordham University football team was running 
roughshod over all its opponents. One day in the sports room at the Tribune, 
the merits of Fordham's football team was being compared to Princeton and 
Columbia. Adams remarked disparagingly of the latter two, saying they were 
"only Ivy League." Woodward, the sports editor of the Tribune, picked up 
the term and printed it the next day. A member of the Atlantic 10 Conference, 
Fordham University sponsors varsity teams in eleven men's and ten women's 
NCAA sanctioned sports:[7] Men's Intercollegiate Sports Women's Intercollegiate 
Sports Founded in the late 1850s, the Fordham Rose Hill Baseball Club of 
St. John's College (the precursor to Fordham University, and of no connection 
at all to St. John's University) played against St. Francis Xavier College 
in the first ever nine-man-team college baseball game on November 3, 1859. 
Fordham is the all time NCAA leader in wins. There have been 56 major leaguers 
who have played for Fordham, including All-Star pitcher Pete Harnisch and 
Baseball Hall of Famer Frankie Frisch. Frisch, a star athlete in four different 
sports at Fordham, was known as the "Fordham Flash".[8] Steve Bellán, first 
Latin American to play Major League Baseball, started his career as a player 
at St. John's College.[9] The team plays home games at Houlihan Park at 
Jack Coffey Field. Jack Coffey Field, a multisport facility, is named after 
Jack Coffey, former athletic director and baseball coach at the University. 
He amassed 817 wins as a baseball coach. Coffey is the only player to play 
with both Ty Cobb and Babe Ruth in the same season (1918 Detroit Tigers 
and Boston Red Sox). The baseball portion of the field was renamed "Houlihan 
Park" after renovations completed in 2005. Fordham basketball teams (men 
and women) have been members of the MAAC (1981–82 through 1989–90), Patriot 
League (1990–91 through 1994–95), and the Atlantic 10 Conference (1995–96 
through present). Fordham began competing in men's basketball in 1902. 
They played their first game in Rose Hill Gymnasium on January 16, 1925 
(defeating Boston College, 46–16). On February 28, 1940, Fordham hosted 
the University of Pittsburgh at Madison Square Garden in the first ever 
televised basketball game. Pitt won, 57–37. The game was televised by NBC. 
Fordham University enjoyed its best season in 1970–1971, when the squad 
went 26–3 under coach Digger Phelps and was ranked number nine in the nation 
in the AP poll. The Fordham men have won three Patriot League regular season 
conference titles (1991, 1992, 1994) and two Patriot League Tournament 
Championships (1991 and 1992).[10] Fordham has participated in four NCAA 
Tournaments (1953, 1954, 1971, 1992), and sixteen NITs (1943, 1958, 1959, 
1963, 1965, 1968, 1969, 1972, 1981, 1982, 1983, 1984, 1985, 1988, 1990, 
1991).[11][12] Though Fordham won the 1991 Patriot League Tournament, the 
NCAA did not grant the Patriot League an automatic bid to the NCAA Tournament 
that year. Instead, Fordham played in one of three "play-in games", but 
lost, and was not considered to have reached the NCAA Tournament. In the 
2009–10 season, Fordham went 0–16 in the A-10 conference season (2–26 overall), 
becoming the first team to go winless in an A-10 conference season since 
St. Bonaventure in 1992–93.[13] That winless streak, which started during 
the 2008–09 season, ended on the 2010–11 season's final game, snapping 
the streak at 41.[14] Through the end of the 2010–11 season, the program's 
cumulative record is 1444 wins and 1237 losses (.539 win percentage). Women's 
basketball at Fordham began as a club team in 1963–64. They became an NCAA 
competitive team in 1970–71. The Rams won the Patriot League Championship 
in 1992 and 1994. They played in the 1994 NCAA Tournament and the 2013 
WNIT.[citation needed] Tackle Ed Franco was a consensus All-American. So 
was center Alex Wojciechowicz who later became an All-Pro with Detroit 
and Philadelphia. Guard Vince Lombardi later became one of the greatest 
of pro coaches. In 1937, the team went undefeated and was ranked number 
three nationally. So popular was Fordham, that the Cleveland NFL franchise 
formed in the 1930s took its nickname from the Rams of the Bronx.[15] The 
Cleveland Rams later moved to Los Angeles and then to St. Louis, Missouri, 
before returning to Los Angeles in 2016, and are now known as the Los Angeles 
Rams. On September 30, 1939, Fordham participated in the world's first 
televised American football game. In front of the sport's first live TV 
audience, the Rams defeated Waynesburg College 34–7. The following week 
they lost the second ever televised game to the University of Alabama, 
7–6.[16] It was not for another month that a professional NFL game was 
televised. Fordham has dropped their football program on several different 
occasions. Fordham first dropped football between 1894–95, and then again 
between 1910–11, 1919, and 1943-45.[17] On December 15, 1954, Fordham scratched 
its football program for the fifth time, for various reasons, mainly financial. 
A club football team was established in 1964 (on shaky authority) and football 
was re-established as a varsity sport in 1970, but in Division III. Fordham 
joined what is now the NCAA Division I Football Championship Subdivision 
in 1989. With 722 all-time wins at the close of the 2005 season, Fordham's 
football program ranks 15th among Division I programs on the all-time NCAA 
wins list, and fifth among programs currently playing in the NCAA Football 
Championship Subdivision, trailing only Yale University, the University 
of Pennsylvania, Harvard University, and Princeton University (putting 
the Rams in first among non-Ivy League schools in the FCS standings). Fordham 
was invited to play in the 1942 Rose Bowl, but declined the invitation 
because it had previously accepted a berth in the 1942 Sugar Bowl. The 
Rams, who defeated the University of Missouri by a 2–0 score, were the 
1942 Sugar Bowl champions. The Rams also played in the 1941 Cotton Bowl 
Classic but lost 13–12 to Texas A&M. At least one source lists Fordham 
as the 1929 National Football Champions.[18] Since 2002, Fordham has played 
Columbia University for The Liberty Cup. The trophy was dedicated after 
the attacks of Sep 11, 2001 forced the postponement of the first annual 
meeting between New York City's two Division I football programs. In 2009 
the university announced that it will be offering scholarships for football 
for the first time since 1954. This makes the Rams ineligible to compete 
for the Patriot League championship, but simultaneously allows them to 
schedule games with Football Bowl Subdivision teams such as the Army Black 
Knights and the Navy Midshipmen (which are members of the Patriot League 
outside football), both immediately scheduled. In addition, the Rams are 
still eligible for an at-large bid for the Championship Subdivision play-offs.[19] 
In 2013, the Rams had a record year in going 12-2 with wins over FBS Temple 
and ranked Villanova and Lehigh teams and went to the Second Round of the 
FCS Playoffs. The Fordham softball program has been the most successful 
recent program for the Rams, winning five of the past six Atlantic 10 championships 
(2011, 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016) and earning an NCAA championship berths 
in six of the past seven years (2010, 2011, 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016). 
Fordham's Women's Swimming and Diving team was the first women's team to 
win an A10 championship. The men's swimming and diving team has also been 
successful in recent years. Johnny Gibson, a 1928 graduate of Fordham, 
broke the 440 yd (400 m) Hurdles World Record while at the school and made 
the 1928 Olympic team in the same event. Gibson is known as a great contributor 
to the world of track and field as a founding member of the New Jersey 
Track and Field Officials Association and head coach of men's track and 
field at Seton Hall University from 1945 to 1972. Sam Perry set the World 
Record for the 60-yard dash indoors at the Milrose Games in 1965.[22] Tom 
Courtney won Olympic Gold in the 800 m run at the 1956 Games. While at 
Fordham Courtney had anchored the 2 Mile Relay that broke the world record 
in 1954. Fordham track has had a resurgence in the past two decades with 
an All-Americans and numerous conference champions. Barry Cantrell earned 
all-American honors in the high jump in 1998. There have been several Atlantic 
10 Conference champions including the jumping events, hammer throw. and 
the intermediate hurdles.[23] In 2008, the men's Track and Field team won 
the Outdoor Metropolitan Championship. The title was the first ever Metropolitan 
Athletic Conference team title captured by the Rams in the school's history.[24] 
In the 2009 Outdoor Season the Rams defended their title, while the Women's 
squad captured second in the team scoring. Fordham's Men's Water Polo team 
is an NCAA Division 1 program. They compete in the Collegiate Water Polo 
Association (CWPA) against Brown University, Connecticut College, Harvard 
University, Iona, MIT, Queens College, St. Francis College. In 2010 and 
2009 they placed third and fifth in the CWPA Eastern Division championship. 
Their coach, Bill Harris, was awarded the CWPA Coach of the Year in 2009. 
Fordham University alumnus Chris Judge (class of 1980) was inducted into 
the CWPA Hall of Fame in 2010.[25] Men's crew has been a club sport at 
Fordham since 1915, when John Mulcahy (an alumnus and Olympic Gold medalist 
in the sport) helped found it there. Fordham Crew has since been quite 
successful, winning several national championships. The team is a member 
of the Dad Vail affiliation, making the Dad Vail Regatta the focus of its 
spring racing season. Exceptional crews have competed at the Intercollegiate 
Rowing Association (IRA) National Championships, Henley Royal Regatta, 
and the San Diego Crew Classic. The team is divided into novice and varsity 
squads. Fordham Athletics also sponsors a women's varsity team. Fordham 
Crew trains on the Harlem River. For many years the university maintained 
the last remaining boathouse on "sculler's row" off the river in Manhattan, 
along Sherman Creek, until it was destroyed by suspected arson in 1978.[26] 
It has yet to be replaced. Currently, the club shares space at the Peter 
Jay Sharp Boathouse near Sherman Creek, the first community boathouse built 
in Manhattan in over 100 years.[27] Since 1989, Fordham has medaled every 
year at the Dad Vail and other major collegiate regattas. During that period 
the team has had 9 undefeated seasons and 13 national championships: eight 
at the Dad Vail, three at the Eastern College Athletic Conference National 
Invitational Collegiate Regatta, one at the Division-I National Championships, 
and one at the IRA Championship. Fordham was the 2007 Dad Vail Champions 
in Men's Varsity Lightweight 4+ and the 2008 Dad Vail Champions in Men's 
Varsity Lightweight 8+. The university supports hockey as a club sport.[28] 
The team was created in the 1967–68 season playing and winning one game 
versus cross-town rival Manhattan College. The "Maroon Six" as they were 
known then, began playing a full slate of games during the 1970–71 season. 
The team joined the Metropolitan Intercollegiate Hockey League, in the 
fall of 1970 and began playing such teams as Columbia, Fairfield and St. 
Johns. Since then the team has held the longest tenure in its current league 
the Metropolitan Collegiate Hockey Conference (MCHC) after the MIHL changed 
its name during the 1974–75 season. In February 2014, the Rams captured 
their third league championship with a 5-4 win over Suffolk Community College. 
Prior championships were in 2006 and 2011. The 2013-14 team finished the 
year with an overall record of 20-5-2-1, the third time in team history 
the squad has won 20 games. They also finished in first place for the third 
time in the last five years, have had 11 consecutive winning seasons (the 
longest in team history), and have qualified for the post season play every 
year for the last 14 seasons. The team also is a member of the American 
Collegiate Hockey Association (ACHA) which ranks club teams on a national 
basis. Founded in 1970, the lacrosse program has grown tremendously. After 
years as the top independent lacrosse team in the New York metropolitan 
area, the team has been accepted to be a member of the National College 
Lacrosse League. The Rams currently compete in the New York Metro Division. 
The University supports men's rugby as a club sport. The Fordham University 
Rugby Football Club plays in the Metropolitan New York Rugby Union. Additionally, 
they are a member of USA Rugby, and field within it Division I 'A' and 
'B' side rugby squads. The Rose Hill Campus is host every spring to the 
"Irish-Italian" men's rugby game, a staple of Fordham's Spring Weekend 
festival. The men's team won the Metropolitan New York Rugby Union (METNY) 
D-1 conference championship in 2003, 2004 and 2009 and made it to the first 
round of the national tournament in 2004, and also made an appearance in 
the second round of the national tournament in the fall of 2009. In the 
spring of 2009 Fordham Rugby were crowned champions of the annual Cherry 
Blossoms Tournament held in Washington DC.[29] The women's team is a three-time 
champion of the Big Apple Classic, which is hosted on Randalls Island, 
New York. They were also east coast champions in the spring of 2005. Fordham 
is a regular member of the Middle Atlantic Intercollegiate Sailing Association 
(MAISA), one of seven regional conferences of the Intercollegiate Sailing 
Association of North America (ICSA), the governing body of US Sailing. 
With 50 schools and a geographical territory extending from Canada to Virginia, 
MAISA is one of the most competitive conferences in the country. The ICSA 
has 230 members, of which 194 are club teams. During the 2013-2014 College 
Sailing season, Fordham was ranked 12th nationally. They were highest ranked 
club sailing team. For the first time, both the Co-ed and Women's teams 
qualified for College Nationals in the spring of 2014. Among club teams, 
the Rams were ranked as high as 3rd nationally and finished the year ranked 
5th in the country.[30] Fordham’s homeport is Morris Yacht & Beach Club, 
overlooking Long Island Sound and Eastchester Bay on City Island, a few
