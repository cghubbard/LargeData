John T. Shelby (born February 23, 1958 in Lexington, Kentucky) is a former 
center fielder in Major League Baseball who played from 1981 to 1991. His 
nickname was "T-Bone" for his slight frame. He currently is a coach in 
the Colorado Rockies minor league system. John Shelby is a 1976 graduate 
of Henry Clay High School in Lexington, KY, where he played baseball (shortstop) 
and basketball and was an all-area performer. After high school he played 
one year of baseball at Columbia State Community College in Tennessee. 
Over his 11-year career he played with three different teams: the Baltimore 
Orioles (1981–1987), Los Angeles Dodgers (1987–1990) and Detroit Tigers 
(1990–1991). Shelby was a member of two World Series-winning teams, the 
1983 Orioles and the 1988 Dodgers. When he was traded to the Dodgers during 
the 1987 season, the team was so desperate for a center fielder that he 
was rushed into uniform and into his first game. There was not even time 
to put his name on the back of his uniform. He played the entire game as 
the only member of the Dodgers without his name stitched on his uniform. 
During Game Four of the 1988 National League Championship Series, he drew 
a crucial walk off Dwight Gooden in the top of the ninth inning, allowing 
Mike Scioscia to come up and hit a game-tying home run, paving the way 
for the game-winning home run by Kirk Gibson in the top of the twelfth 
inning. On June 3, 1989 he batted 0 for 10 in a 22 inning game vs. the 
Houston Astros. He is currently the hitting coach for the Albuquerque Isotopes, 
the AAA affiliate of the Colorado Rockies.[1] In addition to managing several 
minor league teams, he has also served as a coach for the Dodgers, Pittsburgh 
Pirates, Baltimore Orioles, and Milwaukee Brewers. His oldest son, John 
Shelby III, is currently in playing in Minor League Baseball for the Gateway 
Grizzlies of the Frontier League. His second oldest son, Jeremy Shelby, 
played one season in the Baltimore Orioles' farm system. His fourth oldest 
son, JaVon Shelby, played for the University of Kentucky Wildcats baseball 
team and was drafted by the Oakland Athletics in 2016 amateur draft.[2] 
His nephew, Josh Harrison, is currently playing for the Pittsburgh Pirates.
