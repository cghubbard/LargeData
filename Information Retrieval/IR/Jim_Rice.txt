James Edward Rice (born March 8, 1953), nicknamed "Jim Ed", is a former 
Major League Baseball left fielder and designated hitter who played his 
entire 16-year baseball career for the Boston Red Sox. Rice was an eight-time 
American League (AL) All-Star and was named the AL's Most Valuable Player 
in 1978 after becoming the first major league player in 19 years to hit 
for 400 total bases. He went on to become the ninth player to lead the 
major leagues in total bases in consecutive seasons. He joined Ty Cobb 
as one of two players to lead the AL in total bases three years in a row. 
He batted .300 seven times, collected 100 runs batted in (RBI) eight times 
and 200 hits four times, and had eleven seasons with 20 home runs. He also 
led the league in home runs three times, RBIs and slugging percentage twice 
each. In the late 1970s he was part of one of the sport's great outfields 
along with Fred Lynn and Dwight Evans (who was his teammate for his entire 
career); Rice continued the tradition of his predecessors Ted Williams 
and Carl Yastrzemski as a power-hitting left fielder who played his entire 
career for the Red Sox. He ended his career with a .502 slugging percentage, 
and then ranked tenth in AL history with 382 home runs; his career marks 
in homers, hits (2,452), RBI (1,451) and total bases (4,129) remain Red 
Sox records for a right-handed hitter, with Evans eventually surpassing 
his Boston records for career runs scored, at bats and extra base hits 
by a right-handed hitter. When Rice retired, his 1,503 career games in 
left field ranked seventh in AL history. Rice was inducted into the Baseball 
Hall of Fame on July 26, 2009, as the 103rd member voted in by the BBWAA. 
Rice's three-run home run was the key blow in helping the Pawtucket Red 
Sox (International League) defeat the Tulsa Oilers (American Association) 
in a 5–2 win in the 1973 Junior World Series. After he was AAA's International 
League Rookie of the Year, Most Valuable Player and Triple Crown winner 
in 1974, he and fellow rookie teammate Fred Lynn were brought up to the 
Red Sox at the same time, and were known as the "Gold Dust Twins".[1][2][3] 
He was promoted in the Red Sox organization to be a full-time player in 
1975, and finished in second place for the American League's Rookie of 
the Year honors, and third in the Most Valuable Player voting, after he 
finished the season with 174 base hits, 102 runs batted in, a .309 batting 
average and 22 home runs; Lynn won both awards. The Red Sox won the AL's 
East Division, but Rice did not play in either the League Championship 
Series or World Series because of a wrist injury sustained during the last 
week of the regular season when he was hit by a pitch. A disappointed Rice 
appeared during the postseason player introductions, in uniform and without 
the cast on his wrist,[citation needed] which he had removed the night 
before, informing the team that he was fit to play.[citation needed] Red 
Sox management, however, persuaded him that healing would be in the best 
future interest of both Rice and the team. The Red Sox went on to lose 
the World Series, 4 games to 3, to the Cincinnati Reds of the National 
League (NL). In 1978, Rice won the Most Valuable Player award in a campaign 
where he hit .315 (third in the league) and led the league in home runs 
(46), RBI (139), hits (213), triples (15), total bases (406, a Red Sox 
record) and slugging percentage (.600). He is one of only two AL players 
ever to lead his league in both triples and home runs in the same season, 
and he remains the only player ever to lead the major leagues in triples, 
home runs and RBIs in the same season. His 406 total bases that year were 
the most in the AL since Joe DiMaggio had 418 in 1937, and it made Rice 
the first major leaguer with 400 or more total bases since Hank Aaron's 
400 in 1959. This feat wasn't repeated again until 1997, when Larry Walker 
had 409 in the NL. No AL player has done it since Rice in 1978, and his 
total remains the third highest by an AL right-handed hitter, behind DiMaggio 
and Jimmie Foxx (438 in 1932). In 1986, Rice had 200 hits, batted .324, 
and had 110 RBIs. The Red Sox made it to the World Series for the second 
time during his career. This time, Rice played in all 14 postseason games, 
where he collected 14 hits, including two home runs. He also scored 14 
runs and drove in six. The 14 runs Rice scored is the fifth most recorded 
by an individual during a single year's postseason play. The Red Sox went 
on to lose the World Series to the New York Mets, 4 games to 3, the fourth 
consecutive Series appearance by Boston which they lost in seven games. 
Rice led the AL in home runs three times (1977, 1978, 1983), in RBI twice 
(1978, 1983), in slugging percentage twice (1977, 1978), and in total bases 
four times (1977-1979, 1983). He also picked up Silver Slugger Awards in 
1983 and 1984 (the award was created in 1980). Rice hit at least 39 home 
runs in a season four times, had eight 100-RBI seasons and four seasons 
with 200+ hits, and batted over .300 seven times. He finished his 16-year 
career with a .298 batting average, 382 home runs, 1,451 RBIs, 1,249 runs 
scored, 2,452 hits, and 4,129 total bases. He was an American League All-Star 
eight times (1977–1980, 1983–1986). In addition to winning the American 
League MVP award in 1978, he finished in the top five in MVP voting five 
other times (1975, 1977, 1979, 1983, 1986). Rice is the only player in 
major league history to record over 200 hits while hitting 39 or more HRs 
for three consecutive years. He is tied for the AL record of leading the 
league in total bases for three straight seasons, and was one of three 
AL players to have three straight seasons of hitting at least 39 home runs 
while batting .315 or higher. From 1975 to 1986, Rice led the AL in total 
games played, at bats, runs scored, hits, homers, RBIs, slugging percentage, 
total bases, extra base hits, go-ahead RBIs, multi-hit games, and outfield 
assists.[4] Among all major league players during that time, Rice was the 
leader in five of these categories (Mike Schmidt is next, having led in 
four). In 1984 he set a major league single-season record by hitting into 
36 double plays. His 315 career times grounding into a double play ranked 
third in major league history behind Hank Aaron and Carl Yastrzemski when 
he retired; he broke Brooks Robinson's AL record for a right-handed hitter 
(297) in 1988, and Cal Ripken, Jr. eventually surpassed his mark in 1999. 
Rice led the league in this category in four consecutive seasons (1982–1985), 
matching Hall of Famer Ernie Lombardi for the major league record. The 
on-base prowess of Rice's teammates placed him in a double play situation 
over 2,000 times during his career, almost once for every game he played. 
Rice posted a batting average of .310 and slugging percentage of .515 in 
those situations, better than his overall career marks in those categories. 
Rice could hit for both power and average, and currently only twelve other 
retired players rank ahead of him in both career home runs and batting 
average: Hank Aaron, Jimmie Foxx, Lou Gehrig, Willie Mays, Stan Musial, 
Mel Ott, Babe Ruth, Ted Williams, Chipper Jones, Vladimir Guerrero, Mike 
Piazza, and Larry Walker. In 1981, Lawrence Ritter and Donald Honig included 
him in their book The 100 Greatest Baseball Players of All Time. Rice was 
an accomplished left fielder, finishing his career with a fielding percentage 
of .980 and had 137 outfield assists (comparable to Ted Williams' figures 
of .974 and 140). Although never possessing great speed, he had a strong 
throwing arm and was able to master the various caroms that balls took 
from the Green Monster (in left field) in Fenway Park. His 21 assists in 
1983 remains the most by a Red Sox outfielder since 1944, when Bob Johnson 
had 23. Aside from playing 1543 games as an outfielder during his career, 
Rice also appeared as a designated hitter in 530 games. Rice's number 14 
was retired by the Red Sox in a pre-game ceremony on July 28, 2009. Rice 
was associated with a variety of charitable organizations during his career, 
primarily on behalf of children, some of which have carried on into his 
retirement. He was named an honorary chairman of The Jimmy Fund, the fundraising 
arm of the Dana–Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, in 1979,[5] and in 1992 
was awarded that organization's "Jimmy Award", which honors individuals 
who have demonstrated their dedication to cancer research.[6] Rice is also 
active in his support of the Neurofibromatosis Foundation of New England.[7] 
Rice's involvement with Major League Baseball's RBI program (Reviving Baseball 
in Inner Cities) resulted in the naming of a new youth baseball facility 
in Roxbury, Massachusetts in his honor in 1999.[8] A youth recreation center 
in Rice's hometown of Anderson, South Carolina is also named in his honor. 
Rice's most notable humanitarian accomplishment occurred during a nationally 
televised game on August 7, 1982, when he rushed into the stands to help 
a young boy who had been struck in the head by a line drive off the bat 
of Dave Stapleton. As other players and spectators watched, Rice left the 
dugout and entered the stands to help 4-year old Jonathan Keane, who was 
bleeding heavily. Rice carried the boy onto the field, through the Red 
Sox dugout and into the clubhouse, where the young boy could be treated 
by the team's medical staff.[9] In 1990, Rice agreed to play with the St. 
Petersburg Pelicans of the short-lived Senior Professional Baseball Association.[10] 
Afterwards, Rice has served as a roving batting coach (1992–1994) and hitting 
instructor (1995–2000), and remains an instructional batting coach (2001–present) 
with the Red Sox organization. While the Red Sox hitting coach, the team 
led the league in hitting in 1997 and players won two batting titles. Rice 
was the hitting coach for the American League in the 1997 and 1999 Major 
League Baseball All-Star Games, both under the same manager, the New York 
Yankees' Joe Torre. Since 2003, he's also been employed as a commentator 
for the New England Sports Network (NESN), where he contributes to the 
Red Sox pre-game and post-game shows. He had a cameo appearance in the 
NESN movie Wait Till This Year[11] and in the film Fever Pitch.[12] The 
former slugger has been known to pass his wisdom on to the current Sox 
players and stars from time to time. Rice was elected to the Boston Red 
Sox Hall of Fame when it first opened in 1995, and he is the 40th member 
of Ted Williams' Museum and Hitters Hall of Fame, having been inducted 
along with Paul Molitor, Dave Winfield and Robin Yount in 2001.[13] On 
November 29, 2008, the Boston chapter of the Baseball Writers' Association 
of America (BBWAA) announced that Rice would be the recipient of the Emil 
Fuchs Award for long and meritorious service to baseball.[14] During his 
Hall of Fame acceptance speech Rice revealed that he is a devoted fan of 
The Young and the Restless, noting that he was watching the show when he 
was informed of his acceptance.[15] While Rice was generally regarded as 
one of the better hitters of his era based upon the statistics traditionally 
used by the BBWAA to evaluate players' Hall of Fame qualifications, he 
was not elected until his 15th and final year of eligibility, netting 76.4% 
of the votes, in 2009. Over the years he was on the BBWAA ballot, he received 
3,974 total votes, the most ever collected by any player that was voted 
on for baseball's highest honor. In 2006[16] and 2007,[17] he received 
over 63% of votes cast. Rice just missed being elected in 2008 when the 
count found him on 72.2% of the ballots, only 2.8% short of the required 
75%. Rice became the third enshrinee to get into the shrine on his last 
chance on the ballot, and the first since Ralph Kiner (1975). Rice's delay 
in being elected to the Hall of Fame stemmed in part from more current 
statistical analysis of player performance. This analysis suggested that 
Rice's HOF credentials might have been more questionable than they were 
considered during his career.[18] The delay may also have been related 
to his often difficult relationship with the media during his playing career, 
many of whom are still voting members of the BBWAA, and his career fading 
relatively early – he last played in the major leagues at the age of 36.[19] 
Some writers, such as the Boston Herald's Sean McAdam, said that Rice's 
chances improved[20] with the exposure of the "Steroids Era" in baseball. 
In the same article, McAdam expanded this subject by adding: "In an era 
when power numbers are properly viewed with a healthy dose of suspicion, 
Rice's production over the course of his 16 years gains additional stature." 
As such, he has received increasingly more votes each year since the 2003 
ballot, improving his vote totals by 133 votes over the last five years 
on the ballot.[21] However, from several sabermetric standpoints (not including 
Black Ink, Gray Ink or HOF Monitor) it can be argued that Rice falls short 
of his peers in the Hall of Fame.[22] Nevertheless, several commentators 
have noted that the continued criticism of Rice's statistics not meeting 
sabermetric standards is unfair given that several other Hall of Fame players, 
notably Andre Dawson and Tony Pérez, fare even worse against such standards. 
During the 2007 season, the Pawtucket Red Sox started a campaign to get 
Rice inducted which included having fans sign "the World's Largest Jim 
Rice Jersey." Although other players have compiled career statistics more 
similar to Rice's, most notably 1999 Hall inductee Orlando Cepeda, perhaps 
the most similar player to Rice was 1968 inductee Joe Medwick. Both were 
power-hitting left fielders who batted right-handed and played their home 
games in stadiums which favored hitters, and both had a period of a few 
years in which they enjoyed a remarkable burst of offense, each winning 
an MVP award at age 25 – Rice after collecting 400 total bases, and Medwick 
after becoming the last NL player to win the Triple Crown. Both retired 
at age 36 due to the cumulative effect of various minor injuries. Their 
career totals in games, at bats, runs, hits, RBI, steals, on-base percentage, 
slugging percentage, extra base hits and total bases are all fairly similar, 
with notable differences only in batting average and home runs; Medwick's 
higher average (.324 to .298) can be partially attributed to the higher 
emphasis on batting average in the 1930s, while Rice's advantage in home 
runs (382 to 205) is largely the result of a dramatic increase in homers 
over the 40 years between their careers (Rice ranked 10th in AL history 
upon his retirement, while Medwick ranked 11th in NL history upon his). 
Medwick was elected to the Hall in his final season of eligibility in 1968,
