As player As manager Frederick Charles Hutchinson (August 12, 1919 – November 
12, 1964) was an American professional baseball player, a major league 
pitcher for the Detroit Tigers and the manager for three major league teams.[1][2][3] 
Born and raised in Seattle, Washington, Hutchinson was stricken with fatal 
lung cancer at the height of his managerial career as leader of the pennant-contending 
Cincinnati Reds. He was commemorated one year after his death when his 
surgeon brother, Dr. William Hutchinson (1909–1997), created the Fred Hutchinson 
Cancer Research Center in Seattle, as a division of the Pacific Northwest 
Research Foundation. The "Fred Hutch", which became independent in 1975, 
is now one of the best-known facilities of its kind in the world. Born 
in Seattle, Hutchinson was the youngest son of Dr. Joseph Lambert Hutchinson 
(1872–1951)[4] and Nona Burke Hutchinson (1879–1962). Both were born in 
Wisconsin and they relocated to Seattle in 1907. A graduate of the medical 
school at Marquette University in Milwaukee,[4] he was a general practitioner 
in the Rainier Beach area in the southeast part of Seattle.[5][6][7] The 
oldest of the four Hutchinson children was daughter Mary Joy (Crosetto) 
(1904–1989).[4][8] Sons Bill and John were older than Fred by ten and seven 
years,[9] respectively, and both played baseball at Franklin High School 
and at the University of Washington in Seattle under head coach Tubby Graves. 
Bill captained the 1931 Huskies team which won the Pacific Coast Conference 
title and John (1912–1991) later played in the St. Louis Browns organization.[5][7] 
The older brothers mentored young Fred in the game and fostered a competitive 
spirit; they even taught him to hit left-handed to reach first base quicker.[5][7] 
A catcher until he was 15, Hutchinson starred as a right-handed pitcher, 
catcher, first baseman, outfielder, and left-handed hitter at Franklin. 
He led the Quakers to four city championships and played American Legion 
ball in the summer.[5][7] Hutchinson, known throughout baseball as Hutch, 
played semi-pro ball in 1937 in Yakima, attended UW briefly,[10] then entered 
the organized baseball ranks in 1938 with the unaffiliated Seattle Rainiers 
of the AA Pacific Coast League. He caused an immediate sensation at age 
19, winning a league-best 25 games and that season's minor league player 
of the year award as bestowed by The Sporting News.[3] Several teams were 
interested in him, including the Pittsburgh Pirates.[11][12] After his 
contract was purchased by the Detroit Tigers of the American League for 
players and cash,[12][13] Hutchinson struggled in his early major league 
career with a 6–13 record and an earned-run average of 5.43 during the 
1939–1941 seasons. His ineffectiveness caused his return to the minor leagues 
in each season. In 1941, at Buffalo of the AA International League, he 
enjoyed another stellar campaign, leading the league in victories (26) 
and innings pitched (284). A successful Major League career seemed to await 
Hutchinson, then 22, when the U.S. entered World War II. He saw active 
duty in the U.S. Navy, rose to the rank of lieutenant commander, and lost 
four full seasons (1942–1945) to military service. In 1946, Hutchinson 
– approaching 27 – returned to baseball with a vengeance, winning a place 
in the defending World Series champion Tigers' starting rotation and beginning 
a string of six straight campaigns of ten or more wins, including seasons 
of 18 (1947) and 17 victories (1950). He was selected to the 1951 American 
League All-Star team, and pitched three innings in an 8–3 loss at the Tigers' 
home park, Briggs Stadium.[14] In eleven major league seasons, Hutchinson 
compiled a 95–71 (.572) career record and a 3.73 earned run average, all 
with Detroit – a stellar mark considering his early-career mishaps. Appearing 
in 242 games, 169 as a starting pitcher, and 1,464 innings pitched, he 
allowed 1,487 hits and 388 bases on balls. He amassed 591 strikeouts, 81 
complete games, and 13 shutouts, along with seven saves. He led the American 
League in WHIP in 1949, a season in which Hutchinson's 2.96 ERA was fourth 
in the league. The 6 ft 2 in (1.88 m), 190 lb (86 kg) Hutchinson was known 
as a ferocious competitor. "His displays of temper became legendary in 
the American League", wrote Sports Illustrated in 1957. "'I always know 
how Hutch did when we follow Detroit into a town,' cracked Yankee catcher 
Yogi Berra. 'If we got stools in the dressing room, I know he won. If we 
got kindling, he lost.'"[15] He also was one of the best-hitting pitchers 
of his time; a left-handed batter, he frequently pinch-hit and batted over 
.300 four times during his major league career. His career batting average 
was .263, with 171 hits, four home runs and 83 runs batted in — excellent 
totals for a pitcher. On a dubious note, he is also recalled as the pitcher 
who gave up the longest homer in Ted Williams' career, a 502-foot (153 m) 
blast on June 9, 1946, that broke the straw hat of a startled fan sitting 
in Fenway Park's right-center-field bleachers. The seat where the home 
run landed has been painted red since to mark the long ball.[16] Hutchinson 
led the AL in home runs allowed with 32 during the 1948 season. A slow 
decline in Hutchinson's pitching career coincided with an alarming drop 
in the fortunes of his usually contending Tigers. On July 5, 1952, with 
Detroit in the surprising position of last place in the eight-team American 
League, the club fired manager Red Rolfe and handed the job to Hutchinson, 
still an active player and five weeks shy of his 33rd birthday. Hutchinson 
was chosen based on his leadership skills; he had been the AL's Player 
Representative since 1947. Hutchinson managed the Tigers for the next 2½ 
years, serving into 1953 as a playing manager. He guided them from their 
eighth-place finish in 1952 to sixth and fifth place during the next two 
seasons. His reign included the 1953 debut of future hall of fame outfielder 
Al Kaline. However, Detroit's ownership and front office were in flux; 
at the end of 1954, Hutchinson asked for a two-year contract, through 1956, 
and was only offered a single season deal.[15][17] He left the Tigers, 
ending a 16-year association with the team. Out of the majors for the first 
time since 1941, Hutchinson went home to Seattle and the Rainiers of the 
PCL, becoming their manager in 1955. Even though the club did not enjoy 
a major league affiliation, Hutchinson led Seattle to a 95–77 record and 
a first-place finish. His success led to his second major league managerial 
job when he replaced Harry Walker as skipper of the St. Louis Cardinals 
shortly after the 1955 season.[18] The Cardinals, one of baseball's storied 
franchises, had fallen into the second division. With general manager "Frantic" 
Frank Lane constantly revamping the roster through trades and Hutchinson's 
steady hand at the helm, the Cardinals improved by eight games in 1956, 
and catapulted to second place in the National League in 1957, behind only 
the eventual world champion Milwaukee Braves.[19] Hutchinson won The Sporting 
News Manager of the Year Award, and his popularity in the Mound City resulted 
in a new nickname, "The Big Bear", bestowed by Cardinal broadcaster Joe 
Garagiola. Hutchinson's typical unsmiling expression also led Garagiola 
to joke that Hutchinson was "a happy guy inside, only his face didn't show 
it."[20] He was given a raise in his one-year contract for the next season,[19] 
however, Lane's departure from the front office and the Cardinals' disappointing 
season resulted in Hutchinson's dismissal;[21] it came on September 17, 
with the team six games below .500 and in fifth place.[22] Once again, 
Hutchinson returned to Seattle as manager of the Rainiers. The 1959 team 
did not have the on-field success of 1955's edition but the Rainiers were 
by then the top farm club of the Cincinnati Reds, who had stumbled badly 
in the National League standings coming out of the gate. On July 9, 1959, 
with the Reds ten games under .500 at the All-Star break, Hutchinson was 
called to Cincinnati to take over the club, replacing Mayo Smith.[23] Under 
Hutchinson, Cincinnati went 39–35 and improved two notches in the standings, 
but the following season saw the Reds struggle again to a 67–87 record 
and sixth-place finish. Like Detroit and St. Louis before, the Reds also 
were in front office turmoil, as the general manager who originally hired 
Hutchinson, Gabe Paul, departed for the expansion Houston Colt .45s and 
was replaced by Bill DeWitt. The sudden death of longtime owner Powel Crosley 
less than three weeks before the start of the 1961 regular season meant 
the team would soon be sold. As a result, 1961 was a crucial season for 
Hutchinson. The Reds were projected as a second division team, lagging 
well behind the defending world champion Pittsburgh Pirates, the 1959 champion 
Los Angeles Dodgers, and strong San Francisco Giants, St. Louis Cardinals, 
and Milwaukee Braves outfits. But the Reds stunned the league, led by NL 
MVP Frank Robinson. They were buoyed by three other factors: the maturation 
of young players such as outfielder Vada Pinson and pitchers Jim O'Toole, 
Ken Hunt and Jim Maloney; the acquisition of key contributors such as pitcher 
Joey Jay (who became a 20-game winner) and third baseman Gene Freese; and 
surprise slugging and clutch hitting performances by first baseman Gordy 
Coleman, Jerry Lynch (one of the greatest pinchhitters in baseball history), 
and veteran Wally Post. The Reds surged into contention with a nine-game 
winning streak in May, and took first place for good August 16 when they 
swept the Dodgers in a doubleheader in Los Angeles. The season was marked 
by numerous dramatic late-inning comeback victories, overcoming large margins, 
sometimes in a single inning. The Reds seemed never to be out of any game, 
until the last out. The 1961 Reds won 93 games and their first NL pennant 
since 1940. It was Hutchinson's second trip to the World Series; ironically, 
he was a Detroit pitcher in 1940 when his Tigers lost the Fall Classic 
to Cincinnati in seven games. However, the 1961 Reds drew one of the best 
teams of its era as its World Series foe: the New York Yankees of Roger 
Maris, Mickey Mantle, Whitey Ford, et al., who had won 109 games. The Reds 
could muster only one victory, in Game 2, with utility infielder Elio Chacón 
racing home on a passed ball with the go-ahead run, barely before the crunching 
body tag of Elston Howard. Cincinnati lost the 1961 Series in five games. 
Winning the 1961 pennant secured Hutchinson's place in Cincinnati. In 1962, 
his Reds won 98 games but finished third, 3½ games behind the Giants. While 
the team fell to fifth in 1963, with an 86–76 mark, it continued to blend 
in young talent, such as young shortstop Leo Cárdenas and freshman second 
baseman Pete Rose, who was named the National League's Rookie of the Year. 
In July, Hutchinson was given a contract extension through the 1965 season,[24] 
and with a solid corps of veterans and a strong farm system, the Reds were 
considered a contending club in 1964, provided that its pitching staff 
made a comeback.[25] At his Florida home on Anna Maria Island, Hutchinson 
found a lump on his neck in late December 1963 and a medical examination 
in Seattle revealed malignant tumors in his lungs, chest, and neck.[26] 
Given the cancer treatments available at the time, the prognosis was grim. 
According to his brother, Hutchinson was a chain smoker, up to four packs 
of cigarettes a day.[9][27] The Reds made their manager's illness public 
on January 3, 1964,[28] and after radiation treatment in early February, 
still felt relatively well in March during spring training.[29][30] As 
The Sporting News noted, the team played the 1964 season with the terrible 
knowledge that Hutchinson "probably was at death's door." His health failing,[31] 
Hutchinson nevertheless managed the Reds through July 27, when he was hospitalized. 
He returned to the dugout August 4,[32] but could only endure nine more 
days before he turned the team over to his first-base coach, Dick Sisler, 
one day after Hutch's 45th birthday.[33] The birthday was celebrated at 
Crosley Field on August 12,[34][35] then he was re-hospitalized two days 
later for two weeks.[36][37] With their manager now critically ill, the 
inspired Reds caught fire and won 29 out of their last 47 games as the 
first-place Philadelphia Phillies collapsed, but the team finished in a 
tie with the Phillies for second, one game behind the Cardinals, who went 
on to win that year's World Series. Hutchinson formally resigned as manager 
on October 19,[38] and died three weeks later at Manatee Memorial Hospital 
in Bradenton, Florida.[1][2][3] He was buried next to his parents in the 
family plot at Mount Olivet Cemetery near Seattle in Renton, overlooking 
Lake Washington.[39] SPORT magazine posthumously named him "Man of the 
Year" for 1964 in tribute to his courage in battling his final illness 
and the Reds permanently retired his uniform number (1). The Hutch Award 
is given annually by Major League Baseball in his memory as well.[40] Hutchinson 
was inducted into the Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame in 1965. His career 
record as a major league manager, in all or parts of 12 seasons, was 830–827 
(.501) with nine tie games. He was remembered for his winning baseball 
teams, as the man who launched Cincinnati into an historic winning era 
(which ended years after his death with the "Big Red Machine" in the 1970s). 
He is described favorably by pitcher/author Jim Brosnan in his two season 
memoirs, The Long Season (an account of Brosnan's 1959 campaign) and Pennant 
Race (about 1961). Brosnan describes the team's wariness of the manager's 
hot temper and its respect for his competitive nature and leadership skills, 
and notes Hutchinson's sense of humor as well. Wrote Brosnan in 1959: "Most 
ballplayers respect Hutch. In fact, many of them admire him, which is even 
better than liking him. He seems to have a tremendous inner power that 
a player can sense. When Hutch gets a grip on things it doesn't seem probable 
that he's going to lose it. He seldom blows his top at a player, seldom 
panics in a game, usually lets the players work out of their own troubles 
if possible."[41] Said future hall of famer Stan Musial in 1957: "If I 
ever hear a player say he can't play for Hutch, then I'll know he can't 
play for anybody."[15] In honor of his achievements with Buffalo, Hutchinson 
became a charter member of the Buffalo Baseball Hall of Fame in 1985.[42] 
On December 24, 1999, the Seattle Post-Intelligencer named Hutchinson Seattle's 
Athlete of the 20th Century.[27] Meanwhile, the Fred Hutchinson Cancer 
Research Center continues to make news as a cancer treatment hub — in medical 
and baseball circles. When Boston Red Sox rookie left-handed pitcher Jon 
Lester, a Washington native, was diagnosed with anaplastic large cell lymphoma 
during the 2006 season, he chose to undergo chemotherapy at the Seattle 
facility. Coming full circle, on November 11, 2008, Lester — a 16-game 
winner and postseason pitching star — was chosen as the winner of the 2008 
Hutch Award.[43] All of the end plates of the rows of seats at Seattle's
