Darryl Eugene Strawberry, Sr. (born March 12, 1962) is an American former 
Major League Baseball right fielder and an ordained Christian minister 
and author.[1] Strawberry is well known for his career in baseball and 
his controversial personal life. Throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, 
Strawberry was one of the most feared sluggers in the game, known for his 
prodigious home runs and his intimidating presence in the batter's box 
with his 6-foot-6 frame and his long, looping swing that elicited comparisons 
to Ted Williams.[2][3] During his 17-year career, he helped lead the New 
York Mets to a World Series championship in 1986 and the New York Yankees 
to three World Series championships in 1996, 1998 and 1999. He was also 
suspended three times by Major League Baseball for substance abuse, leading 
to many narratives about his massive potential going unfulfilled.[4] A 
popular player during his career, Strawberry was voted to the All-Star 
Game eight straight times from 1984–1991.[5] Strawberry was formerly an 
analyst for SportsNet New York.[6] His memoir, Straw: Finding My Way, was 
written in collaboration with author John Strausbaugh, was published on 
April 28, 2009 by Ecco Press, an imprint of HarperCollins publishers.[7] 
Strawberry was born to Henry and Ruby Strawberry in Los Angeles. He played 
high school baseball for the Crenshaw High School Cougars along with Chris 
Brown. Strawberry was drafted first overall in the 1980 Major League Baseball 
draft by the New York Mets.[8] Darryl's older brother Michael Strawberry 
was also selected in that draft, going to the Dodgers in the 31st round. 
Employing a distinctive batting stance with a high leg kick, Strawberry 
rose through the Mets system and reached the major league level in 1983, 
posting 26 home runs, 7 triples, and 74 runs batted in, while hitting for 
a .257 average.[8] He was named the National League's Rookie of The Year.[8][9] 
In 1984, he made it to the All-Star game for the first of eight consecutive 
appearances (the first five as a starter) and once again hit 26 home runs, 
this time driving in 97.[8] Strawberry's Mets from 1984–1990 formed one 
of the premier teams in the National League, finishing either first or 
second in the division every year. But as good as the Mets were on the 
field, they constantly feuded off the field. Despite this, Strawberry remained 
an iconic figure in not only New York City, but across America. He was 
loathed by opposing fans, but beloved by New Yorkers and young fans across 
the country. During the period from 1983 to 1990, Strawberry was very popular, 
with his image used on action figures (Kenner's Starting Lineup), posters 
and banners. He was also known for his disruptive behavior. He got into 
a physical altercation on team picture day with team captain Keith Hernandez[10] 
and in the midst of a war of words with infielder Wally Backman, threatened 
to "bust that little redneck in the face".[11] He often overslept and was 
late for, or missed, team workouts.[11] He publicly complained about Manager 
Davey Johnson after he was removed from the game in a double switch during 
the 9th inning of Game 6 of the 1986 World Series, which the Mets would 
go on to win.[11] During the regular season in 1986, Strawberry hit 27 
homers and had 93 RBIs.[8] In 1987, Strawberry hit 39 home runs and stole 
36 bases, joining the exclusive 30–30 club[12] at the time becoming one 
of only 10 players in baseball history to accomplish the feat. In addition 
to that, he hit 32 doubles and drove in 104 runs. Despite this, the 1987 
team missed the playoffs. In 1988, Strawberry once again hit 39 home runs 
to lead the National League. He also drove in 101 runs and led the league 
in slugging percentage at .545 and OPS at .911.[8] He finished a very close 
second in MVP voting to the Dodgers' Kirk Gibson. Strawberry led the Mets 
to the playoffs, losing to the Dodgers in seven games in the National League 
championship series.[8] In 1989, Strawberry's offensive numbers declined: 
He had 29 home runs and 77 runs batted, but only had a .225 average.[8] 
Nevertheless, the Mets came in a close second place to the Chicago Cubs 
in the National League East. In 1990, Strawberry rebounded by hitting 37 
home runs, while driving in 108 runs and batting for a .277 average.[8] 
His Mets, however, came once again in a close second place in the NL's 
east, losing to the Pittsburgh Pirates by three games. Strawberry himself 
finished third in MVP voting that season. Strawberry signed as a free agent 
with the Los Angeles Dodgers on November 8, 1990,[8] inking a lucrative 
five-year $22.25 million contract. In California, he was named Big Brother 
of The Year for 1991. After hitting 28 home runs and bringing in 99 runs 
batted in a successful first year for the Dodgers, injuries and personal 
problems kept him sidelined for much of the next two seasons, hitting five 
home runs in each season. By the end of the 1991 season, he had 280 lifetime 
homers at the age of only 29, drawing comparisons to home run king Hank 
Aaron.[13] Strawberry's numbers tailed off considerably after 1991; over 
the next two years he only played in 75 games. In 1994, he was released 
in May by the Dodgers and signed with the San Francisco Giants, where he 
saw limited playing time as he tried to make a comeback, hitting only four 
home runs and driving in 17 runs that year.[8] After a suspension from 
the league at the beginning of 1995 due to his involvement with cocaine,[14] 
Strawberry signed with the New York Yankees for the stretch run. The next 
year, Darryl signed with the Saint Paul Saints of the Northern League on 
May 3, 1996 in an attempt to rehabilitate. On June 2, the Saints faced 
the Duluth–Superior Dukes at Wade Stadium, where Strawberry hit his first 
home run for the Saints, at a distance of 522' off of pitcher Pat Ahearne.[15] 
Soon thereafter, he found himself back with the Yankees who signed him 
on July 4, 1996. With the Yankees, he showed flashes of his former brilliance, 
belting 11 home runs in a part-time role and helping his team win the World 
Series in 1996 alongside former Mets teammates Dwight Gooden and David 
Cone. His second career three-homer game came against the Chicago White 
Sox on August 6 of that season.[16] He had a big series against the Baltimore 
Orioles in the 1996 ALCS as he blasted three home runs with five RBIs and 
a .417 average in four games.[8] In 1997, he did not have any home runs, 
with his playing time limited by injuries. He played in just 11 games that 
year, collecting just two runs batted in.[8] But in 1998, he had 24 home 
runs, once again helping the Yankees win the World Series and playing 100 
games for the first time since 1991. This was also the year he was diagnosed 
with colon cancer.[17] In 1999, he made a comeback from his cancer treatment, 
but saw limited playing time, hitting 3 home runs. He did however hit a 
crucial 3-run home run against the Texas Rangers in the 1999 American League 
Division Series helping the Yankees advance to the ALCS.[8] Strawberry 
was the starting right fielder five straight times and appeared at nine 
All-Star games. Strawberry batted .333 with two stolen bases and two runs 
in 12 career All-Star at-bats. Interestingly, he had two three-home run 
games in his career, both of which came against Chicago teams and were 
almost 11 years to the day between each other. The first came against the 
Cubs on August 5, 1985, and the second was on August 6, 1996, against the 
White Sox. Strawberry is one of only five Major League Baseball players 
to hit two pinch-hit grand slams in the same season. The others are Davey 
Johnson of the Philadelphia Phillies, Mike Ivie of the San Francisco Giants, 
Ben Broussard of the Cleveland Indians, and Brooks Conrad of the Atlanta 
Braves.[18] Strawberry is one of only three players in MLB history to have 
played for the Mets, Yankees, Dodgers and Giants. The others are Ricky 
Ledée and José Vizcaíno. Strawberry attended the Mets' 1986 World Champion 
team reunion on August 19, 2006, where he and the rest of the team received 
a standing ovation from fans at Shea Stadium in an on-field ceremony.[19] 
Strawberry worked as an instructor for the New York Mets in 2005 and 2008, 
and was inducted to the Mets Hall of Fame in 2010. Strawberry has made 
regular appearances at the New York Yankees' Old Timer's Day, most recently 
in 2012.[20] Strawberry threw out the ceremonial first pitch at Shea Stadium 
before Game 1 of the National League Championship Series between the Mets 
and the St. Louis Cardinals on Oct 12, 2006. He was given a rousing ovation 
by the Shea Stadium crowd. He served as an anchor on the Mets pre- and 
post- game shows on SNY in 2007 and 2008, eventually settling into a part-time 
analysis role for the 2009 season. Strawberry opened his own restaurant, 
Strawberry's Sports Grill, in Douglaston, Queens in August 2010.[21] The 
restaurant closed in October 2012.[22] He is an evangelical born-again 
Christian and has appeared on The Trinity Broadcasting Network. In 1999, 
he and Tiny Lister appeared on evangelist Benny Hinn's T.V. program giving 
their testimonies. Strawberry has also appeared on The 700 Club to talk 
about his life and his newfound faith in Jesus.[23] Darryl frequently donates 
to charity and is a headliner of the BGC Charity Day event at BGC Partners, 
where he brokered over 5MM GD4.5 roll.[24] In October 2005, his wife Charisse 
filed for divorce.[25] He now resides in St. Charles County, Missouri with 
his third wife Tracy whom he met in a drug recovery convention. The couple 
were married in October 2006 and have since founded "The Darryl Strawberry 
Foundation", an organization dedicated to children with autism. Strawberry's 
son, Darryl "D.J." Strawberry, Jr., born in 1985, was a star shooting guard 
with the Maryland Terrapins men's basketball team and was drafted by the 
Phoenix Suns in the 2007 NBA Draft. On December 19, 1995, Strawberry was 
charged in California with failing to make child support payments. When 
he missed a June 5, 1996, deadline to pay the child support, a Los Angeles 
judge set a trial date of July 17, at which time Strawberry agreed to use 
his signing bonus to pay the debt.[26] On October 1, 1998, Strawberry was 
diagnosed with colon cancer. Two days later, he had surgery to remove a 
tumor and 24 inches of his colon. On October 14, doctors announced that 
cancer had been detected in a lymph node so he would also have to undergo 
chemotherapy.[27] On April 3, 1999, Strawberry was arrested in Tampa, Florida 
for soliciting sex from a policewoman posing as a prostitute and for having 
a small amount of cocaine. On April 24, he was suspended for 140 days by 
Major League Baseball for the incident. On May 29, he pleaded no contest 
to the charges and was sentenced to 21 months probation and community service.[28] 
On July 28, 2000, a C.T. scan suggested that Strawberry's cancer had spread 
to his lymph nodes. The next month, he had surgery to remove a tumor and 
a kidney on August 7.[29] On September 11, 2000, in Tampa, Strawberry tried 
to drive to see his probation officer after taking painkillers. While driving, 
he blacked out, rear-ended another car, and then tried to drive away. An 
off-duty police officer witnessed the episode and arrested him at gunpoint. 
The next day, Strawberry admitted to the charges and his probation was 
changed to two years of house arrest. On November 21, he was sentenced 
to a year of probation and community service.[30] On October 25, 2000, 
Strawberry left a Tampa drug treatment center to use drugs with a female 
friend violating his house arrest and parole. On November 9, he was sentenced 
to 40 days in jail with credit for time served.[31] On November 3, 2000, 
Strawberry told a judge in Tampa that he had lost his will to live and 
had stopped chemotherapy. On November 30, he was released from jail and 
sent back to rehab.[32] On April 2, 2001, Strawberry was arrested for again 
disappearing from his house arrest drug treatment center in Tampa. On May 
1, he was sentenced to more time at a drug treatment center.[33] On March 
12, 2002, Strawberry was back in jail for violating several non-drug rules 
at the drug treatment center where he was on probation in Ocala, Florida. 
On April 29, he was ordered to serve the 22-month suspended prison sentence 
from 1999.[34] On April 8, 2003, he was released from prison after 11 months.[35] 
In September 2005, Strawberry was charged with filing a false police report 
after he claimed his SUV was stolen. He admitted that he had lied on the 
report but was not arrested because it was a misdemeanor.[36] Strawberry 
appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated seven times: five times by 
himself, once with Don Mattingly, and once with Dwight Gooden. In 2004, 
the Rebecca Gilman play The Sweetest Swing in Baseball premiered at the 
Royal Court Theatre in London. The lead character ‒ Dana, as portrayed 
by Gillian Anderson ‒ adopts the personality and speech of Darryl Strawberry 
in an attempt to pass herself off as schizophrenic. The title is a reference 
to Strawberry's playing skills. Strawberry appeared, as himself, in The 
Simpsons episode "Homer at the Bat". He was a featured pro on the second 
season of the physical reality game show Pros vs. Joes. He currently does 
occasional commentary for baseball on SportsNet New York.[citation needed] 
In 2010, Strawberry appeared on NBC's The Apprentice with Sharon Osbourne, 
Cyndi Lauper, Bret Michaels, and others. At the end of the third episode, 
Strawberry was fired when he suggested he was the weakest contestant. Donald 
Trump insisted he wanted to go home because he was tired and homesick. 
After Strawberry made a successful return in the season finale to assist 
Bret Michaels, Trump made a donation of $25,000 to The Darryl Strawberry 
Foundation. Strawberry placed 12th. On February 8, 2011, Strawberry appeared 
along with Clara Hughes and Stephane Richer on a Canadian documentary by
