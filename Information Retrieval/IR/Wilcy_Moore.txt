William Wilcy "Cy" Moore (May 20, 1897 – March 29, 1963) was a professional 
baseball right-handed pitcher over parts of six seasons (1927–1933) with 
the New York Yankees and Boston Red Sox. He led the American League in 
ERA as a rookie in 1927 while playing for New York. Moore was a member 
of the 1927 New York Yankees, frequently referred to as Major League Baseball's 
greatest team of all time. He made his MLB debut on April 14 of that season 
and proceeded to win 19 games, with Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig among his 
teammates. Moore was the winning pitcher in Game 4 of the 1927 World Series, 
pitching all nine innings for the champion Yankees against the Pittsburgh 
Pirates. New York won the game in the bottom of the ninth inning on a wild 
pitch. He also won the fourth and final game of the 1932 World Series, 
in which the Yankees defeated the Chicago Cubs. Primarily a relief pitcher, 
Moore was a member of the Yankee staff during the 1928 World Series as 
well, but was not needed as the team's starting pitchers threw four consecutive 
complete games. He was traded away on Nov. 21, 1929 by the Yankees, who 
reacquired him on Aug. 1, 1932. For his career, he compiled a 51–44 record, 
with a 3.70 ERA and 204 strikeouts. In his two World Series, he went 2–0 
in three appearances with a 0.56 ERA. While being scouted in 1926, Moore 
claimed he was 27, but records have proven that his actual age was then 
29. He was born in Bonita, Texas and later died in Hollis, Oklahoma at
