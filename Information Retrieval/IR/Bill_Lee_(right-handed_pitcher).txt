William Crutcher "Big Bill" Lee (October 21, 1909 – June 15, 1977) was 
a Major League Baseball pitcher. He played professionally for the Chicago 
Cubs, Philadelphia Phillies, and Boston Braves during the 1930s and 1940s. 
Lee was born in Plaquemine, Louisiana and played college baseball for Louisiana 
State University.[1] He was originally a top prospect in the St. Louis 
Cardinals organization. In August 1933, Cardinals general manager Branch 
Rickey called his counterpart with the Cubs, William Veeck, Sr. and offered 
him two pitchers—Lee and Clarence Heise. According to Bill Veeck, one of 
Rickey's favorite tricks was to offer another team two players and trust 
that the other team would take the wrong one. In the case of Lee and Heise, 
Rickey knew that all but one Cubs pitcher was right-handed, and expected 
the Cubs to take Heise, a left-hander. However, on the advice of chief 
scout Jack Doyle, the Cubs took Lee. As it turned out, Heise would make 
only one relief appearance in 1934, and was never heard from again. It 
was one of the few times where Rickey, who was legendary for fleecing National 
League teams, ended up getting fleeced himself.[2] Lee spent 10 full seasons 
with the Cubs, as well as a pair of cameo appearances in 1947. He made 
his major league debut on April 29, 1934 with the Cubs. He saved Game 5 
of the 1935 World Series at Wrigley Field, with his team on the verge of 
elimination, and his best year was in 1938 when he helped lead the Cubs 
to another World Series with a record of 22–9 and 2.66 ERA.[3] He was on 
the National League All-Star Team twice when he played for the Cubs.[4] 
Lee played for the Phillies from 1943–1945 and for the Braves from 1945–1946. 
Lee developed eye problems which made it difficult for him to see the catcher's 
signs. Eyeglasses helped little, and he retired in 1947 while playing for 
the Cubs. His career marks were 169 wins, 157 losses and a 3.54 ERA.[5] 
His 139 wins with the Cubs are still the ninth-most in franchise history.[6][7] 
After retiring, Lee returned to Plaquemine, Louisiana and had eye surgery 
for his detached retinas. He eventually went blind.[8] Lee died on June 
15, 1977, and is interred in Saint John Cemetery in Plaquemine.[9] Lee
