John Rikard Dempsey (born September 13, 1949) is an American former professional 
baseball player.[1] He played for 24 seasons as a catcher in Major League 
Baseball from 1969 to 1992, most notably for the Baltimore Orioles.[1] 
Dempsey was known for being one of the best defensive catchers of his era.[2] 
Dempsey was selected by the Minnesota Twins in the 15th round of the 1967 
Major League Baseball draft out of Crespi Carmelite High School.[3] After 
two seasons in the minor leagues, he made his major league debut late in 
the 1969 season for the division winning Twins managed by Billy Martin, 
however he didn't qualify for the post-season roster.[1] Dempsey spent 
a few more seasons shuttling between the Twins and their minor league teams, 
before being traded to the New York Yankees for Danny Walton on October 
31, 1972.[4] During his tenure with the Yankees, he served as a reserve 
catcher to Thurman Munson, and received tutoring from Yankees coach and 
former catching standout, Jim Hegan.[2] After three and a half seasons 
with the Yankees, he was traded to the Baltimore Orioles in June 1976, 
where manager Earl Weaver made him the Orioles' starting catcher. For the 
next ten and a half seasons, Dempsey would remain as the Orioles' starting 
catcher.[5] He became known for his exceptional ability to handle pitching 
staffs, his strong throwing arm, and for his agility behind home plate.[2] 
In 1979, the Orioles defeated the California Angels in the 1979 American 
League Championship Series to reach the World Series.[6] In the 1979 World 
Series, the Orioles won three of the first four games against the Pittsburgh 
Pirates and seemed to be on the verge of winning the championship, when 
the Pirates, led by Willie Stargell, rebounded to win the final three games.[7] 
It was one of Dempsey's greatest disappointments of his playing career.[8] 
The highlight of his career came in 1983, when the Orioles won the American 
League Eastern Division pennant, then defeated the Chicago White Sox in 
the 1983 American League Championship Series, before winning the 1983 World 
Series against the Philadelphia Phillies.[9][10] Dempsey posted a .385 
batting average along with a .923 slugging percentage in the five-game 
series, and won the World Series Most Valuable Player Award, one of six 
catchers to have won the award.[5][11][12][13] In 1987, Dempsey became 
a free agent and signed a contract to play for the Cleveland Indians.[14] 
After only one season with the Indians, he became a free agent once again 
and signed with the Los Angeles Dodgers, where he would be a member of 
another World Series-winning team in 1988, this time as a back up catcher 
to Mike Scioscia.[1] While playing for the Dodgers in 1990, he became involved 
in a brawl with Phillies' center fielder Lenny Dykstra, who took exception 
to Dempsey's fraternization with the home plate umpire.[15] After three 
seasons with the Dodgers, he played one season with the Milwaukee Brewers, 
before returning to the Baltimore Orioles for his final season in 1992.[14] 
His sense of humor during his playing career was renowned, and he was famous 
for his "rain delay theatre" performances, in which he emerged from the 
dugout in stockinged feet onto the tarpaulin covering the infield during 
a rain delay and pantomimed hitting an inside-the-park home run, climaxed 
by his sliding into home plate on his belly on the wet tarp, all to the 
raucous delight of the soggy fans.[5] He sometimes did this while wearing 
a pair of underpants over his uniform, making fun of teammate Jim Palmer's 
famous advertisements for Jockey brand briefs. In a 24-year career, Dempsey 
played in 1,765 games, accumulating 1,093 hits in 4,692 at bats for a .233 
career batting average along with 96 home runs and 471 runs batted in.[1] 
He ended his career with a .988 fielding percentage.[1] Dempsey led American 
League catchers twice in fielding percentage, twice in baserunners caught 
stealing and once in assists.[1] He played more games as a catcher than 
any other player in Orioles history (1230).[16] During his career, Dempsey 
caught ten different twenty game winning pitchers.[5] He was a durable 
player, only going on the disabled list twice in his career.[17] While 
he was a light-hitting player, Dempsey's lengthy major league career was 
due in part to his excellent defensive skills.[2] He usually did not make 
a large contribution offensively; he holds the major league record for 
the most seasons with enough plate appearances to qualify for the batting 
title with less than 50 runs or RBI, with 22.[citation needed] During his 
season with the Brewers, Dempsey made two relief pitching appearances, 
giving three hits and one run in two innings pitched.[18] Dempsey also 
won a Little League World Series in 1963 with the team from Canoga Park-Woodland 
Hills, California.[17] He is the uncle of former major league catcher Gregg 
Zaun.[1] Dempsey is one of only 29 players to play in four different calendar 
decades.[citation needed] After his playing career ended, Dempsey became 
a minor league manager in the Los Angeles Dodgers organisation, winning 
the 1994 Pacific Coast League championship with the Triple-A Albuquerque 
Dukes.[19] He then joined the New York Mets organisation, managing the 
Norfolk Tides in 1997 and 1998. Dempsey also served as first base coach 
for the Orioles for several seasons, first as a third base coach in the 
2005 season after bench coach Sam Perlozzo was promoted to interim manager. 
He assumed the bullpen coach position in the 2006 season, replacing Elrod 
Hendricks who the team intended to reassign to another position in the 
organization before his death. Later in 2006, he became the first base 
coach again when the team reassigned Dave Cash. Dempsey has been a candidate 
for managerial openings with the Orioles in the past, as recently as 2003 
when the Orioles interviewed him for the spot that eventually went to Lee 
Mazzilli. He was mentioned again as a possible candidate for the Baltimore 
manager's job in 2010, after the firing of Dave Trembley. Dempsey also 
served as an Oriole color commentator in 2000 and began another stint in 
2007, as the studio analyst for O's Xtra on MASN, the cable channel that 
carries Orioles games. In addition, he serves as a game analyst for occasional 
games on MASN. In 1985, Dick Enberg was in Toronto for Games 1 and 7 of 
the 1985 ALCS on NBC. Enberg hosted the pregame show alongside Dempsey 
(who was still active with Baltimore at the time). In 1995, Dempsey worked 
as a field reporter for ABC's coverage of the All-Star Game from Texas.
