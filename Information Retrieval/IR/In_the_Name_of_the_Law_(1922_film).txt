In the Name of the Law is a 1922 American silent film featuring Pittsburgh 
Pirates retired Hall of Famer Honus Wagner as a hero in an early action 
plot. During the climax of the film retired baseball player, and current 
(for the film) Pittsburgh Police Superintendent throws baseballs off the 
144 foot high roof of the ten story Pittsburgh City Hall with only the 
film's hero Wagner to catch them and save a vulnerable public. The film 
relies heavily on Wagner catching baseballs in almost every possible way. 
The plot of the film involves the children of police officer Patrick O'Hara 
(Ralph Lewis) who manage to get involved in thefts, murders, and bank robberies. 
Although they are innocent, it takes time (and several catches by Wagner)
