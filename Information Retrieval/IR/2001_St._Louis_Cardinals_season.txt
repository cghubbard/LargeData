The St. Louis Cardinals 2001 season was the team's 120th season in St. 
Louis, Missouri and the 110th season in the National League. The Cardinals 
went 93-69 during the season and finished tied for first in the National 
League Central division with the Houston Astros. Both the Cardinals and 
Astros finished five games ahead of the third-place Chicago Cubs. The Astros 
were declared the NL Central champion in the playoffs due to a better head-to-head 
record, and the Cardinals were seeded as the wild-card.[1] In the playoffs 
the Cardinals lost to the eventual World Champion Arizona Diamondbacks 
3 games to 2 in the NLDS. Third baseman/Outfielder Albert Pujols won the 
Rookie of the Year Award this year, batting .329, with 37 home runs and 
130 RBIs. Second baseman Fernando Vi√±a and outfielder Jim Edmonds won Gold 
Gloves in 2001. Albert Pujols made his major league debut on April 2 against 
the Colorado Rockies.[5] He appeared in three at-bats and collected one 
hit.[6] On September 3, Bud Smith became the ninth Cardinal and eighteenth 
rookie to hurl a no-hitter. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11]
