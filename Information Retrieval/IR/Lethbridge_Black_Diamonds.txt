The Lethbridge Black Diamonds were a minor league baseball team located 
in Lethbridge, Alberta, Canada.[2] The team was previously known as the 
Lethbridge Mounties from 1992–1995[3] before becoming the Lethbridge Black 
Diamonds from 1996–1998. They were one of the first two farm clubs of the 
Arizona Diamondbacks. Only 16 months after Arizona was granted a major 
league baseball franchise, the first farm club — the Lethbridge Black Diamonds 
— took the field.[4] The team started playing two years before their parent 
club even played a game.[5] The team played their first game in June 1996, 
whereas the Arizona Diamondbacks started playing in April 1998.[4] The 
team played in the Pioneer League,[6] which is a rookie league, with a 
shortented season, in Minor League Baseball.[7] Their home stadium was 
Henderson Stadium.[2] In 1999, the team was moved and became the Missoula 
Osprey.[8] Within their first year, in 1996, the Lethbridge Black Diamonds 
had the best record going 50-22 before falling in the opening round of 
the playoffs.[5] With manager Chris Speier, they led the league in defence/pitching, 
with 339 runs allowed which was 102 less than the number two place,[9] 
and in offense, with 637 runs, which was 94 more than the next team in 
the league.[5] The team drew in 49,124 fans that year. There were many 
All-Star players on the team the first year. The second season manager 
Tommy Jones[10] led the team to a 39-33 record, which tied them for third 
in the league with the Idaho Falls Braves,[11] but the Black Diamonds fell 
within the first round of the playoffs. During 1997, no player on the team 
made the All-Star team or lead the Pioneer League in any key stat.[5] The 
last season the Black Diamonds were in Lethbridge they went 43-32 with 
manage Joe Almaraz. The team defeated Great Falls Dodgers 2 games to 1,
