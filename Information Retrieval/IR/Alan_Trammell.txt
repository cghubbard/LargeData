As player As manager Alan Stuart Trammell (born February 21, 1958) is an 
American former professional baseball shortstop, manager and coach. His 
entire 19-year playing career was with the Detroit Tigers. He currently 
serves as a special assistant to the General Manager of the Detroit Tigers. 
Trammell, nicknamed "Tram", played his entire career with the Tigers, highlighted 
by a World Series championship in 1984 over his hometown San Diego Padres 
and an American League East division championship in 1987. Although his 
arm was not overpowering, he had a quick release and made accurate throws, 
ultimately winning four Gold Glove awards. Trammell's defense perfectly 
complemented his double-play partner, Lou Whitaker. The two formed the 
longest continuous double-play combination in major league history, playing 
19 seasons together. At the plate, Trammell was one of the best-hitting 
shortstops of his era and won three Silver Slugger awards. Trammell later 
served as Detroit's manager from 2003 through 2005. He also served as the 
interim manager for the Arizona Diamondbacks during the final three games 
of the 2014 season. While playing for the Tigers' farm team in Montgomery 
of the Southern League, Trammell played his first game with teammate Lou 
Whitaker before the two infielders were promoted, making their major league 
debut at Fenway Park together, during the second game of a double-header 
on September 9, 1977, the first of nineteen seasons together. Trammell 
batted .300 in 1980 as he made the All-Star team for the first time. In 
1983 he batted .319 with 14 home runs, 66 runs batted in and 30 stolen 
bases.[1] He won the MLB Comeback Player of the Year Award in the American 
League. Trammell and Whitaker also made a cameo appearance on the television 
show Magnum, P.I. starring Tom Selleck during the 1983 season.[2][3] Selleck's 
character, Thomas Magnum (as well as Selleck himself), was a Tigers fan.[4] 
Trammell, along with his Tiger teammates, enjoyed a championship-winning 
season in 1984, when they started the season 35–5 and won the World Series.[5] 
Despite a season-long battle with tendinitis in his shoulder which caused 
him to miss 23 regular season games, he finished fifth in the AL batting 
race with .314 and ranked eighth in on-base percentage. In the 1984 American 
League Championship Series against the Kansas City Royals, Trammell hit 
.364 with one home run and three RBI. Finally, in the World Series, he 
was 9-for-20 against the San Diego Padres, including a pair of two-run 
home runs that accounted for all of the Tigers' runs in a Game 4 victory. 
Detroit won the series 4–1 and Trammell was named World Series MVP.[6][7] 
In 1985, after two consecutive years of batting not lower than .314, Trammell 
was hampered by injuries and posted only a .258 batting average. He underwent 
postseason surgery on his left knee and right shoulder. The following season, 
playing without any injuries, Trammell became only the second player in 
Detroit history to hit 20 home runs and steal 20 bases (Kirk Gibson was 
the other and Curtis Granderson has since joined the club). Trammell also 
set a career-high with 75 RBI. In 1987, asked by manager Sparky Anderson 
to bat cleanup, Trammell responded with the best season of his career, 
hitting a career-high 28 home runs. In addition, Trammell appeared amongst 
the league leaders in most AL offensive categories: third in batting average 
(.343), tenth in RBI (105), third in hits (205), tied for fifth in runs 
(109), fourth in total bases (329), fifth in on-base percentage (.402), 
eighth in slugging average (.551), sixth in on-base plus slugging (.953), 
fifth in OPS+ (155), and tied for fifth in game-winning RBI (16). In September, 
he batted .416 with six homers and 17 RBI and put together an 18-game hitting 
streak in which he hit .457, helping his team to win the AL East division 
by two games on the last day of the season. He became the first Tiger to 
collect 200 hits and 100 RBI in the same season since Al Kaline did it 
in 1955. Despite his efforts, Trammell finished second to Toronto's George 
Bell in the MVP voting (332–311).[8] After the season finale, Whitaker 
gave him second base, with the inscription: To Alan Trammell, 1987 AL MVP. 
From, Lou Whitaker.[citation needed] In the following years, Trammell suffered 
a long string of injuries that reduced his production. In 1991, knee and 
ankle injuries limited Trammell to 101 games. During the following season, 
he played in 29 games before breaking his right ankle and missing the remainder 
of the 1992 season. In his final five seasons, Trammell averaged 76 games 
played after averaging 140 games played the first thirteen seasons of his 
career. From 1993 to 1996, Trammell saw less time at shortstop in favor 
of Travis Fryman and eventually Chris Gomez and Andújar Cedeño.[9] He instead 
saw playing time at multiple defensive positions, including shortstop, 
third base, second base, left field, center field, and designated hitter.[10] 
Trammell retired following the 1996 season. In his twenty-year career, 
Trammell batted over .300 seven times and ending with a career average 
of .285 and 185 home runs with 1,003 RBI, 1,231 runs, 2,365 hits, 412 doubles, 
55 triples, and 236 stolen bases in 2,293 games. After his retirement, 
Trammell coached for Detroit (1999, hitting coach), the San Diego Padres 
(2000–2002, first base coach), and managed the Tigers (2003–2005).[11] 
He served as the bench coach for the Arizona Diamondbacks under former 
teammate Kirk Gibson[12] until returning to the Tigers in late 2014 as 
a special assistant to the general manager. In 2001, Trammell was rated 
as the ninth best shortstop of all time in "The New Bill James Historical 
Baseball Abstract", rating him higher than fourteen Hall of Fame shortstops. 
Furthermore, in recent years, Trammell's candidacy for the Hall of Fame 
has picked up increasing support from the sabermetric community. However, 
Trammell has not been enshrined into the Baseball Hall of Fame as of 2014. 
In his first twelve years of eligibility, he has received the following 
percentage of votes: 15.7% (2002), 14.1% (2003), 13.8% (2004), 16.9% (2005), 
17.7% (2006), 13.4% (2007), 18.2% (2008), 17.4% (2009), 22.4% (2010), 24.3% 
(2011), 36.8% (2012), 33.6% (2013), and 20.8% (2014).[1] His boost in recent 
years is likely due to voters being more receptive to advanced metrics, 
such as WAR (Wins above replacement).[13] Trammell was on his 15th and 
final Baseball Writers' Association of America ballot in 2016, failing 
to earn enough for induction. Trammell was one of the last candidates to 
be allowed on the ballot for fifteen years after the BBWAA reduced eligibility 
to ten years, and can now be considered for the Veterans Committee Expansion 
starting from 2017. In 1998, Trammell was elected into the National Polish-American 
Sports Hall of Fame.[14] Alan Trammell was named the manager of a struggling 
Tigers team on October 9, 2002.[15] The team lost 119 games in his first 
season in 2003, an American League record, before posting a 72–90 record 
in 2004. In the 2005 season, however, the team's record regressed slightly, 
finishing 71–91. During Trammell's three years as manager, the Tigers compiled 
a record of 186–300.[11][16] During the 2003 season, Detroit nearly matched 
the modern MLB record of 120 losses, set by the expansion New York Mets 
(40–120) in 1962. The Tigers won five of their last six games to avoid 
the distinction. On October 3, 2005, the Tigers released Trammell after 
three seasons in which the organization failed to post a winning record.[11] 
Trammell was replaced by Jim Leyland on October 4, 2005. Leyland led Detroit 
to a 24-game improvement in the regular season, an AL pennant and a World 
Series appearance in 2006. While there was some media criticism regarding 
Trammell's managerial strategies and "nice" demeanor,[17] others contend 
that he was a rookie manager put in charge of a team that was severely 
lacking in talent, and believe his managerial stint played an integral 
role in re-instilling professionalism and pride throughout the Detroit 
organization. Leyland himself attributed a degree of the success that the 
Tigers saw in the 2006 postseason to Trammell's efforts in the three years 
prior.[18] In October 2006, Trammell returned to Comerica Park for the 
first time since his firing to participate, along with Sparky Anderson, 
in pregame festivities prior to Game 2 of the World Series.[19] Trammell 
was showered with a lengthy standing ovation from Detroit baseball fans 
upon taking the field. After being replaced by Leyland, Trammell turned 
down an offer to stay with the Tigers as a special assistant, instead opting 
to sit out 2006. In October 2006, he agreed to join the Chicago Cubs as 
a bench coach for the 2007 season,[19] a possible precursor to an eventual 
return to managing a major league club. During the four-game suspension 
of Lou Piniella in 2007, Trammell was acting manager of the Chicago Cubs. 
Trammell was passed over for the Cubs' managerial position when Lou Piniella 
retired midway through the 2010 season.[20] Trammell was named bench coach 
of the Arizona Diamondbacks in October 2010 joining his former teammate 
Kirk Gibson who had earlier been named manager. Gibson had previously been 
Trammell's bench and hitting coach with the Tigers.[12] He and Gibson were 
fired on September 26, 2014, though Trammell stayed on for the final three 
games of the season to serve as the interim manager.[21] He had a record 
of one win and three losses in those three games.[16] On November 3, 2014, 
it was announced that Trammell would return to Detroit as a special assistant
