Bradenton /ˈbreɪdəntən/ BRAY-den-ton is a city in Manatee County, Florida, 
United States. The U.S. Census Bureau estimated the city's 2016 population 
to be 54,437.[4] Bradenton is a principal city of the Bradenton-Sarasota-Venice, 
Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area, which had a 2007 estimated population 
of 682,833.[7] It is the county seat.[8] The area that would become Bradenton 
(originally spelled "Bradentown") was explored in 1539 by the Spanish during 
the famous expedition led by Hernando De Soto. Bradenton was established 
in 1842.[2] The original town of Bradentown was incorporated in 1903.[9] 
The city took the name of Dr. Joseph Braden, whose nearby fort-like house 
was a refuge for early settlers during Seminole Indian attacks. The current 
city of Bradenton was formed in 1943, when the Florida legislature merged 
the cities of Manatee (incorporated in 1888) and Bradentown.[2][10] Historic 
properties in Bradenton include: According to the United States Census 
Bureau, Bradenton has a total area of 14.44 square miles (37.4 km2), of 
which 12.11 square miles (31.4 km2) is land and 2.33 square miles (6.0 km2) 
(16.14%) is water. Bradenton is located on US 41 between Tampa and Sarasota. 
The area is surrounded by waterways, both fresh and saltwater. Along the 
Gulf of Mexico and into Tampa Bay are over 20 miles (32 km) of Florida 
beaches, many of which are shaded by Australian pines. Bordered on the 
north by the Manatee River, Bradenton is located on the mainland and is 
separated from the outer barrier islands of Anna Maria Island and Longboat 
Key by the Intracoastal Waterway. Downtown Bradenton is located in the 
northwest area of the city. Home to many of Bradenton's offices and government 
buildings, the tallest is the Bradenton Financial Center, 12 stories high, 
with its blue-green windows. The next tallest is the brand new Manatee 
County Judicial Center with nine floors, located next to the historic courthouse. 
Other major downtown buildings include the Manatee County Government building 
and the headquarters of the School Board of Manatee County. The eastern 
side of Bradenton is growing at a rapid rate. Starting as the popular subdivision 
Lakewood Ranch, it is now becoming a heavily populated part of town. Most 
of the communities are newer than in West Bradenton. However the majority 
of foreclosures in Manatee County have taken place in that area due to 
the fact that a much higher loss in value happened compared to the areas 
of West Bradenton which is located nearer to the beaches. As of the census[5] 
of 2000, there were 49,504 people, 21,379 households, and 12,720 families

Bradenton has been considerably hard hit by the United States housing market 
correction, as reported by CNN, projecting a 24.8% loss in median home 
values by the third quarter of 2008.[14] Real estate has shown a recovery 
in 2012, as home prices stabilize and inventory subsides. Continued growth 
is expected for 2013 in commercial and residential sectors as a fast paced 
winter travel season shows a new boom in construction starts and short 
time on market for homes. Bradenton is served by Sarasota-Bradenton International 
Airport in nearby Sarasota, Florida and is connected to St. Petersburg,

highest point. Remnants of the old Skyway bridge have been converted into 
a fishing pier extending into Tampa Bay from both sides of the bay. Manatee
