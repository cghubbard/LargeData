The Philadelphia Keystones (also known as the Keystone Club of Philadelphia) 
were a professional baseball franchise. In 1884, they were a member of 
the short-lived Union Association. The team was owned by former player 
Tom Pratt.[1] The Keystones were managed by catcher Fergy Malone and finished 
in eighth place in the 12 team league with a 21-46 record. Their top-hitting 
regular was left fielder/infielder Buster Hoover, who batted .364 with 
a slugging percentage of .495, and their best pitcher was Jersey Bakely, 
who was 14-25 with an ERA of 4.47. Their home games were played at Keystone 
Park. Jack Clements, who played for 17 seasons and was the last (and virtually 
the only) left-handed catcher in major-league history, made his big-league 
debut with the Keystones. Like several other teams in the Union Association, 
the Keystones did not make it through the entire season, folding after 
the game of August 7. The entire league ceased operations after 1884, its 
first and only season. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12]
