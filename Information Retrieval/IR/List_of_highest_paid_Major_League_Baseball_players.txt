The highest paid player in Major League Baseball (MLB) from the 2013 season 
is New York Yankees' third baseman Alex Rodriguez with an annual salary 
of $29,000,000, $4 million higher than the second-highest paid player, 
Cliff Lee. MLB does not have a hard salary cap, instead employing a luxury 
tax which applies to teams whose total payroll exceeds certain set thresholds 
for a given season.[1][2] Free agency did not exist in MLB prior to the 
end of the reserve clause in the 1970s, allowing owners before that time 
to wholly dictate the terms of player negotiations and resulting in significantly 
lower salaries. Babe Ruth, widely regarded as one of the greatest baseball 
players ever, earned an estimated $910,696 ($14,194,502 inflation-adjusted 
from 1931 dollars) over his entire playing career.[3] When asked whether 
he thought he deserved to earn $80,000 a year ($1,135,139 inflation-adjusted), 
while the president, Herbert Hoover, had a $75,000 salary, Ruth famously 
remarked, "What the hell has Hoover got to do with it? Besides, I had a 
better year than he did."[4][5] Rodriguez has signed two record-breaking 
contracts over the course of his career. First, he signed a $252 million, 
10-year contract with the Texas Rangers in December 2000 ($346,859,130 
inflation-adjusted from 2000 dollars).[6] Sandy Alderson called the deal 
"stupefying", while Sports Illustrated noted that Rodriguez's early salaries 
under the contract ($21 million) would be greater than the annual payroll 
of the entire Minnesota Twins team that year ($15.8 million).[6] The deal 
was the largest sports contract in history, doubling the total value of 
Kevin Garnett's $126 million National Basketball Association contract (the 
previous record holder) and more than doubling Mike Hampton's $121 million 
contract, the previous MLB record which had been signed just days before.[6] 
The Rangers later traded Rodriguez to the Yankees in exchange for Alfonso 
Soriano before the 2004 season, though they agreed to pay $67 million of 
the $179 million outstanding on the contract.[7] Despite this, he opted 
out of the remainder of his deal after the 2007 season and renegotiated 
a new $275 million, 10-year agreement with the Yankees, breaking his own 
record for the largest sports contract.[8] Under this deal, Rodriguez also 
receives $6 million each if and when he ties the career home run totals 
of Willie Mays (660), Babe Ruth (714), Hank Aaron (755), and Barry Bonds 
(762), along with another $6 million for breaking Bonds' mark.[8] First 
base was the highest paid position in 2010; regular starters at that position 
earned an average salary of $9,504,165 in compared to an overall average 
of $3,014,572.[9] Pitcher Nolan Ryan was the first player to earn an annual 
salary above $1 million, signing a $4.5 million, 4-year contract with the 
Houston Astros in 1979.[10] Kirby Puckett and Rickey Henderson signed the 
first contracts which paid an average of $3 million a year in November 
1989, while 2010 was the first season where the MLB average salary rose 
above that same mark.[9][11] Five of the twenty highest paid players in 
2013 were members of the Yankees. Their team payroll for 2013 was $228,835,490, 
roughly $12 million above the second-largest Los Angeles Dodgers.[12] The 
Yankees have drawn criticism for their payroll, with some claiming it undermines 
the parity of MLB.[13][14] This table refers to the salary for 2015 alone,
