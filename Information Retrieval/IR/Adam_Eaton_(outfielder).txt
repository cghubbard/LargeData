Adam Cory Eaton (born December 6, 1988) is an American professional baseball 
outfielder for the Chicago White Sox of Major League Baseball (MLB). He 
made his MLB debut in 2012 with the Arizona Diamondbacks, and played with 
them through the 2013 season. Prior to playing professionally, he played 
college baseball for Miami University. Eaton graduated from Kenton Ridge 
High School in Springfield, Ohio. He is the fourth player to reach the 
major leagues from Kenton Ridge preceded by Dave Burba, Rick White and 
Dustin Hermanson. A pitcher and outfielder in high school, Eaton's fastball 
could reach as high as 92 mph, while he batted .482 in his junior season 
in 2006.[1] He helped lead his team to the regional finals in 2004 and 
2005.[2] Eaton earned All-Ohio honorable mention honors that year,[3] as 
well as being named to the All-Miami Valley first team and the Springfield 
News-Sun's All-Area first team as a sophomore and junior.[1][4] However, 
a bulging disc suffered while playing basketball limited Eaton in his senior 
season in 2007.[2][3] Eaton committed to attend Miami University on a college 
baseball scholarship. Miami recruited Eaton as a two-way player.[1] He 
played for the Miami RedHawks baseball team in the Mid-American Conference 
(MAC) in NCAA Division I.[1] In 2009, he was named a MAC All-Star outfielder. 
The Diamondbacks drafted Eaton in the 19th round of the 2010 Major League 
Baseball draft, with the 571st overall selection.[5] In 2010 and 2011, 
Eaton had a .340 batting average with the Diamondbacks' minor league affiliates.[6] 
Eaton was named a Pioneer League All-Star outfielder in 2010,[7] and a 
California League All-Star in 2011.[8] In 2011, he batted .318 with 145 
hits and 72 walks, good for a .434 on-base percentage (OBP), which was 
the fourth best OBP in minor league baseball.[9] Eaton also stole 34 bases.[9] 
He was invited to spring training in 2012, where he impressed Diamondbacks' 
manager Kirk Gibson,[10] and received as many at bats as Diamondbacks regulars.[9] 
Eaton played for the Reno Aces of the Class AAA Pacific Coast League (PCL) 
in 2012. He was named the PCL Rookie of the Year[11] and Most Valuable 
Player.[12] The Diamondbacks called Eaton up to the major leagues on September 
4.[13] Eaton was expected to play for the Diamondbacks for the 2013 season, 
but suffered an injury to his right elbow during spring training. He returned 
to the Diamondbacks in July,[14] and played in 66 games. On December 10, 
2013, the Diamondbacks traded Eaton to the Chicago White Sox in a three-team 
deal, involving the Diamondbacks, the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, and 
the White Sox. The Diamondbacks received Mark Trumbo from the Angels and 
two players to be named later (Brandon Jacobs and A. J. Schugel) and the 
Angels received Tyler Skaggs from the Diamondbacks and Hector Santiago 
from the White Sox.[15][16] Eaton batted .300 with 15 stolen bases during 
the 2014 season. During spring training in 2015, Eaton and the White Sox 
agreed to a five-year contract extension worth $23.5 million, with options 
for two additional years.[17] During a game against the Kansas City Royals 
on April 22, 2015, Eaton grounded out to Yordano Ventura, who shouted profanity 
at Eaton, which ignited a bench-clearing brawl. Eaton was unaffected while 
five players, including Ventura were ejected.[18] Eaton has been confused 
with former Major League Baseball (MLB) pitcher Adam Eaton. On one instance, 
he received six licensing checks from MLB worth $20,000 each, and has received 
fan mail meant for the other MLB veteran.[6][19] Eaton is married to former 
Miami (Ohio) softball player Katie Osburn Eaton. The two of them had a 
baby boy named Brayden Eaton. Adam's brother, Zach Eaton, is an acquisitions
