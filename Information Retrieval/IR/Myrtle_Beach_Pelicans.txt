Pelicans blue, sun gold, midnight blue, white The Myrtle Beach Pelicans 
are a Minor League Baseball team in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, and the 
Class A-Advanced affiliate of the Chicago Cubs.[1] The Pelicans are members 
of the Carolina League and most recently won the league's championship 
in 2016.[2] Home games are played at TicketReturn.com Field, which opened 
in 1999 and seats up to 6,599 fans.[3] From their inaugural season through 
2010, the Pelicans were affiliated with the Atlanta Braves, before spending 
four seasons as a Texas Rangers affiliate from 2011 to 2014. The team's 
affiliation with the Chicago Cubs began in 2015 and is currently in place 
through 2020.[4] Previously, this frachise was known as the Durham Bulls, 
but relocated following the 1997 season as a result of the expansion of 
the Triple-A International League into Durham, North Carolina, where the 
new franchise assumed the "Bulls" name. It spent the 1998 season in Danville, 
Virginia, as the Danville 97s, awaiting a move to Myrtle Beach while their 
new stadium, Coastal Federal Field, was under construction. When then their 
home ballpark opened its gates on April 12, 1999, for the franchise's first 
game, 5,521 fans came to see the Pelicans play the Potomac Cannons.[3] 
In the first at bat, Pelicans pitcher Luis Rivera struck out Cannons hitter 
Esix Snead looking.[3] The first two hits at the stadium were home runs 
for each team, first by Potomac's Andy Bevins, and later that same game 
by Myrtle Beach's Ryan Lehr.[3] Their ballpark has since been renamed TicketReturn.com 
Field at Pelicans Ballpark, which is a family-friendly stadium with a speed 
pitch, obstacle course, and moon bounce on the concourse. In 2004, Baseball 
America rated it the second-best Class-A level ballpark in the United States, 
and the best in the Carolina League in 2009.[3] For four consecutive seasons 
(2011 to 2014), Stadium Journey ranked the Pelicans as the top stadium 
experience in the Carolina League,[5] and one of the publication's "Top 
50 Stadium Experiences" in all of sports,[3] while TripAdvisor named the 
team the third-best attraction in Myrtle Beach. In their first season, 
the Pelicans advanced to the 1999 Carolina League Mills Cup Championship 
series. The best-of-five series against the Wilmington Blue Rocks was tied 
2–2, with the deciding Game 5 set to be played in Myrtle Beach, when the 
series was cancelled because of Hurricane Floyd. The two teams were named 
co-champions for that season. Myrtle Beach won both the first and second-half 
Southern Division titles in 2008 under Rocket Wheeler, who was named Carolina 
League Manager of the Year. The following season, Jason Heyward played 
over half the year in Myrtle Beach en route to being named Baseball America's 
2009 Minor League Player of the Year. On July 3, 2014, the Pelicans home 
game with the Winston-Salem Dash was broadcast on the CBS Sports Network, 
the first time the Pelicans were on live national television.[6][7] In 
early 2006, Capitol Broadcasting Company announced plans to sell the Pelicans. 
The current owner is Myrtle Beach Pelicans LP, a group led by lawyer Chuck 
Greenberg.[8] On November 20, 2012, General Manager Scott Brown left to 
join the Triple-A Charlotte Knights of the International League.[9] A month 
later, on December 21, 2012, the Pelicans hired Andy Milovich to become 
the club's Vice President and General Manager.[10] By January 14, 2015, 
Milovich was promoted to President and General Manager.[11] On September 
16, 2014, the Myrtle Beach Pelicans reached an agreement on a player development 
contract with the Chicago Cubs, beginning with the 2015 season. The agreement 
made the Pelicans the Advanced Class-A affiliate of the Cubs through 2016.[1] 
On August 29, 2016, the Pelicans and Cubs extended their Player Development 
Contract through 2020.[4] [citation needed] Pitchers Catchers Infielders
