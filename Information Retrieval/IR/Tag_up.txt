In baseball, to tag up is for a baserunner to retouch or remain on their 
starting base (the time-of-pitch base) until (after) the ball either lands 
in fair territory or is first touched by a fielder. By rule, baserunners 
must tag up when a fly ball is caught in flight by a fielder. After a legal 
tag up, runners are free to attempt to advance, even if the ball was caught 
in foul territory.[1] On long fly ball outs, runners can often gain a base; 
when a runner scores by these means, this is called a sacrifice fly.[2] 
On short fly balls, runners seldom attempt to advance after tagging up, 
due to the high risk of being thrown out. When a baserunner fails to tag 
up on a caught fly ball (for instance, if they started running too early, 
thinking the ball wouldn't be caught), they may be "doubled off", which 
results in them being called out. To double a runner off, a fielder must 
touch the runner's starting base while in possession of the ball, before 
the runner returns to the base. If the baserunner appeared to tag up, but 
a fielder suspects the baserunner may have left the base too early (thus 
failing to legally tag up), the fielder may attempt to double the runner 
off by touching the runner's starting base while controlling the ball, 
before the next pitch is thrown. This is considered a type of appeal play.[3] 
If the umpire agrees that the runner did not retouch after the ball was 
touched by a fielder, the umpire will call the runner out, and anything 
else the runner did during the play (such as score a run) is negated. Doubling 
a runner off is considered a "time play" (as opposed to a force play), 
which means that even if the doubling-off is the third out of an inning, 
any runs which score before the double-off will count (unless the run was 
scored by the same runner that was doubled off, in which case the run will
