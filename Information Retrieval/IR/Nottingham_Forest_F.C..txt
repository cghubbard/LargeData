Nottingham Forest Football Club is a professional association football 
club based in Nottinghamshire, England. The team play in the Championship, 
the second tier of English football. The club, often referred to as Forest, 
have played home matches at the City Ground since 1898. Founded in 1865, 
Forest were founder members of the Football Alliance in 1889 and joined 
the Football League in 1892. Since then they mostly competed in the top 
two League tiers, excepting five seasons in the third tier. Forest won 
the FA Cup in 1898 and 1959. Their most successful period was under the 
management of Brian Clough between 1975 and 1993, winning the League in 
1978, back to back European Cups in the two years thereafter, four League 
Cups and two Full Members Cups. Forest have yo-yoed between the second 
and third tiers since relegation from the Premier League in 1999. Forest 
were founded in 1865 as Nottingham Forest Football and Bandy Club[2] by 
a group of shinty[3] players (bandy is similar to shinty, but is played 
on ice) shortly after their neighbours Notts County, (the world's oldest 
surviving professional football club), in 1862. They joined the Football 
Alliance in 1889, and won the competition in 1892, before entering the 
Football League. In their early years Forest were a multi-sports club; 
as well as their roots in bandy and shinty, the baseball club Forest deployed 
were British champions in 1899.[4] Forest's charitable approach to the 
sport helped teams like Liverpool, Arsenal and Brighton & Hove Albion to 
come into existence. In 1886, Forest donated a set of football kits to 
help Arsenal establish themselves - the North London team still wear red. 
Forest also donated shirts to Liverpool and helped secure a site to play 
on for Brighton. Forest claimed their first major honour when they won 
the 1898 FA Cup, beating Derby County 3-1 at Crystal Palace. However, for 
much of the first half of the 20th century the club spent life in the Second 
Division and had to seek re-election in 1914 after finishing bottom. In 
1919, the Football League First Division was to be expanded from twenty 
clubs to twenty-two in time for the 1919–20 Football League: Forest were 
one of eight clubs to campaign for entry and received three votes; Arsenal 
and Chelsea gained the additional slots.[5] In 1949 the club were relegated 
to the Third Division, but were quickly promoted back two years later as 
champions having scored a record 110 goals in the 1950-51 season. A brief 
period of glory followed at the end of the 1950s, as they regained First 
Division status in 1957 and won the FA Cup for a second time in 1959, despite 
losing Roy Dwight (the cousin of pop icon Elton John whose real name is 
Reg Dwight) because of a broken leg. They therefore became the first team 
to defeat the Wembley 'hoodoo', (where one team was hampered by losing 
a player through injury).[6] By this time Forest had replaced Notts County 
as the biggest club in Nottingham and went on to become runners-up in the 
First Division and FA Cup semi-finalists in 1967. However, after a highly 
successful period for the club, Forest were relegated from the First Division 
in 1972. Despite their two FA Cup wins and a runners-up finish in the top 
flight as recently as 1967, Forest were generally considered an underachieving 
club by English league standards until the mid-1970s, when Brian Clough 
and his assistant Peter Taylor took the helm at the club, shortly after 
Clough's highly colourful, very controversial and ultimately disastrous 
44-day tenure as manager of Leeds United. Clough became the most successful 
manager in the history of Nottingham Forest, taking them to unprecedented 
heights. He had won the league title with Forest's neighbours Derby County 
in 1972, and came to Nottingham Forest on 6 January 1975, after a 0–2 home 
defeat by Notts County, on Boxing Day, prompted the committee (Forest had 
no board of directors then) to sack the previous manager Allan Brown. Clough's 
first game in charge was the third round FA Cup replay against Tottenham 
Hotspur, a 1–0 victory thanks to a goal by Scottish centre-forward Neil 
Martin. Nottingham Forest won promotion to the top division at the end 
of the 1976–77 season after finishing third in the Second Division, but 
no-one could have predicted how successful Clough's team would be over 
the next three seasons. Nottingham Forest became one of the few teams (and 
the most recent team to date) to win the English First Division Championship 
a year after winning promotion from the English Second Division (1977–78 
season).[nb 1] In 1978–79, Forest went on to win the European Cup by beating 
Malmö 1–0 in Munich's Olympiastadion and retained the trophy in 1979–80, 
beating Hamburg 1–0 in Madrid, at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium, thanks 
to an outstanding performance by goalkeeper Peter Shilton, signed from 
Stoke City early in the 1977–78 season. They also won the European Super 
Cup and two League Cups. Beside Shilton, key players of that era included 
right-back Viv Anderson (the first black player to play for the England 
national team), midfielder Martin O'Neill; striker Trevor Francis (English 
football's first million-pound player on his arrival at Forest in February 
1979) and a trio of Scottish internationals: winger John Robertson, midfielder 
Archie Gemmill and defender Kenny Burns. The club reached the semi-finals 
of the UEFA Cup in 1983–84 but were knocked out by Anderlecht in controversial 
but uncertain circumstances. More than a decade later, it emerged that 
in the second leg, the Belgian club had allegedly bribed the referee but 
the referee in question had since died in a car accident and was hence 
not able to be held to account. The case was therefore dismissed and Anderlecht 
was acquitted from all charges [7] Nottingham Forest's next major trophies 
came in 1989 when they won the Football League Cup and the Full Members 
Cup. For most of the season they had been competing for all three English 
cup competitions available at the time, but their hopes of a unique cup 
treble ended when they lost to Liverpool in the replay of the FA Cup semi-final, 
originally held at Hillsborough, where 96 Liverpool fans were crushed to 
death on terracing, the match was abandoned after six minutes. They also 
finished third in the league in 1989, and had occupied the same final position 
a year later, although they had never looked like serious title contenders 
in either campaign; Liverpool had been runaway leaders for most of the 
1987–88 season, and Forest had been ? in the table at Christmas the following 
campaign before climbing into the division's upper reaches with their strong 
post-Christmas form. By the end of the 1980s, Forest's European Cup winning 
stars were all long gone, and their new stars included high-scoring midfielder 
Neil Webb (sold to Manchester United for a million-plus fee in July 1989), 
left-back Stuart Pearce, central defender Des Walker and striker Nigel 
Clough (son of Brian Clough). Clough's side retained the League Cup in 
1990 when they beat Oldham Athletic 1–0; the winning goal scored by Nigel 
Jemson. There was chance for more success in 1991 when Forest reached their 
only FA Cup final under Brian Clough and went ahead after scoring an early 
goal against Tottenham Hotspur at Wembley, but ended up losing 2–1 in extra 
time after an own goal by Des Walker. In Forest's team that day was young 
Irish midfielder Roy Keane, who had joined the club the previous summer. 
In the summer of 1991, Brian Clough broke Forest's transfer record fee 
by signing the league's top scorer, Millwall striker Teddy Sheringham, 
for £2.1million. Forest beat Southampton 3–2 in the Full Members Cup final 
in 1992, but then lost to Manchester United in the League Cup in the same 
season, both finals being played by a Forest team much weakened by injuries. 
This meant that Forest had played in six cup finals in four seasons, winning 
four of them. Forest finished eighth in the league that season to take 
a place in the new FA Premier League, but their prospects of succeeding 
in the new league were hit by the pre-season loss of players like Des Walker 
and Darren Wassall, and the sale of Teddy Sheringham a few games into the 
new season. Brian Clough's 18-year reign as manager ended in May 1993 after 
Forest were relegated from the inaugural Premier League after 16 illustrious 
years of top-flight football which had seen a league title, two European 
Cups and four League Cups. Relegation from the Premier League was also 
followed by the departure of midfielder Roy Keane to Manchester United 
for a British record fee of £3.75million. Frank Clark, who had been a left-back 
in Nottingham Forest's 1979 European Cup winning team, returned to the 
club in May 1993 to succeed Brian Clough as manager. His management career 
had previously seen promotion from the Fourth Division with Leyton Orient 
in 1989 as his greatest distinction. Making key signings including Stan 
Collymore, Colin Cooper, Lars Bohinen, and convincing Stuart Pearce to 
remain at the club, Clark was able to achieve a return to the Premier League 
when the club finished Division One runners-up at the end of the 1993–94 
season.[8] Forest finished third in 1994–95[9] and qualified for the UEFA 
Cup – their first entry to European competition in the post-Heysel era. 
Despite the pre-season loss of striker Stan Collymore to Liverpool for 
a national record fee of £8.5million, Forest did reach the quarter-finals, 
the furthest an English team reached in UEFA competitions that season, 
although they slipped to ninth position in the league. The 1996–97 season 
quickly became a relegation battle and Clark left the club in December.[10] 
34-year-old captain Stuart Pearce was installed as player-manager on a 
temporary basis just before Christmas in 1996 and he inspired a brief upturn 
in the club's fortunes. However, in March 1997 he was replaced on a permanent 
basis by Dave Bassett and left the club that summer after 12 years.[11] 
Forest were unable to avoid relegation and finished the season in bottom 
place.[12] They won promotion back to the Premier League at the first attempt, 
being crowned Division One champions in 1997–98.[13] Bassett was sacked 
in January 1999, with Ron Atkinson replacing him.[14] Ron Atkinson was 
unable to prevent Forest from once again slipping back into Division One, 
and announced his retirement from football management when Forest's relegation 
was confirmed on 24 April 1999, with three weeks of the Premier League 
seasons still to play. Former England captain David Platt succeeded Atkinson 
and spent approximately £12 million on players in the space of two seasons, 
including the Italian veterans Moreno Mannini, Salvatore Matrecano and 
Gianluca Petrachi.[15] However, Forest could only finish 14th in Platt's 
first season and 10th in his second. He departed in July 2001 to manage 
the England U-21 side and was succeeded by youth team manager Paul Hart. 
[16] Now faced with huge debts, which reduced Forest's ability to sign 
new players, they finished 16th in Hart's first season in charge.[17] By 
December 2001, Forest were reported as losing over £100,000 every week,[18] 
and their financial outlook was worsened by the collapse of ITV Digital, 
which left Forest and many other Football League clubs in severe financial 
difficulties.[19] Despite the off-field difficulties, Forest finished 2002–03 
in sixth place[20] and qualified for the play-offs, where they lost to 
Sheffield United in the semi-finals. A poor league run the following season, 
following the loss of several key players, led to the sacking of Hart in 
February 2004 with Forest in danger of relegation.[21] The decision was 
unpopular with certain quarters of the fanbase and Hart was described as 
a 'scapegoat'.[22] Joe Kinnear was subsequently appointed and led the club 
to a secure 14th place in the final league table.[23] The 2004–05 season 
saw Forest drop into the relegation zone once more, leading to Kinnear's 
resignation in December 2004.[24]Mick Harford took temporary charge of 
Forest over Christmas, before Gary Megson was appointed in the new year. 
Megson had already won two promotions to the Premier League with his previous 
club West Bromwich Albion, having arrived at the club when they were in 
danger of going down to Division Two, but failed to stave off relegation 
as the club ended the season second from bottom in 23rd place,[25] becoming 
the first European Cup-winners ever to fall into their domestic third division.[26] 
In Forest's first season in the English third tier in 54 years, a 3–0 defeat 
at Oldham Athletic[27] in February 2006 led to the departure of Megson 
by "mutual consent" leaving the club mid-table only four points above the 
relegation zone.[28] Frank Barlow and Ian McParland took temporary charge 
for the remainder of the 2005–06 season, engineering a six-match winning 
run and remaining unbeaten in ten games, the most notable result a 7–1 
win over Swindon Town.[29] Forest took 28 points from a possible 39 under 
the two, narrowly missing out on a play-off place, as they finished in 
7th place.[30] Colin Calderwood, previously of Northampton Town, was appointed 
as Forest's new manager in May 2006. He was their 12th new manager to be 
appointed since the retirement of Brian Clough 13 years earlier, and went 
on to become Forest's longest-serving manager since Frank Clark. The Calderwood 
era was ultimately one of rebuilding, and included the club's first promotion 
in a decade. In his first season he led the club to the play-offs, having 
squandered a 7-point lead at the top of League One which had been amassed 
by November 2006. Forest eventually succumbed to a shock 5–4 aggregate 
defeat in the semi-finals against Yeovil Town; they had taken a 2–0 lead 
in the first leg at Huish Park, but were then beaten 5–2 on their own soil 
by the Somerset club.[31] Calderwood achieved automatic promotion in his 
second year at the club, following an impressive run which saw Forest win 
six out of their last seven games of the season, culminating in a dramatic 
final 3–2 win against Yeovil at the City Ground. Forest kept a league record 
of 24 clean sheets out of 46 games, proving to be the foundation for their 
return to the second tier of English football and leaving them just one 
more promotion away from a return to the Premier League. However, Calderwood's 
side struggled to adapt to life in the Championship in the 2008–09 campaign 
and having been unable to steer Forest out of the relegation zone, Calderwood 
was sacked following a Boxing Day 4–2 defeat to the Championship's bottom 
club Doncaster Rovers.[32] Under the temporary stewardship of John Pemberton, 
Forest finally climbed out of the relegation zone, having beaten Norwich 
City 3–2.[33] Billy Davies, who had taken Forest's local rivals Derby County 
into the Premier League two seasons earlier, was confirmed as the new manager 
on 1 January 2009[34] and watched Pemberton's side beat Manchester City 
3–0 away in the FA Cup,[35] prior to taking official charge. Under Davies, 
Forest stretched their unbeaten record in all competitions following Calderwood's 
sacking to six matches, including five wins. He also helped them avoid 
relegation as they finished 19th in the Championship,[36] securing survival 
with one game to go. Forest spent most of the 2009–10 campaign in a top-three 
position, putting together an unbeaten run of 20 league games, winning 
12 home league games in a row (a club record for successive home wins in 
a single season), going unbeaten away from home from the beginning of the 
season until 30 January 2010 (a run spanning 13 games) whilst also claiming 
memorable home victories over local rivals Derby County and Leicester City. 
The club finished third, missing out on automatic promotion, and in the 
two-legged play-off semi-final were beaten by Blackpool, 2–1 away and 4–3 
in the home leg, the club's first defeat at home since losing to the same 
opposition in September 2009. The 2010–11 season saw Forest finish in sixth 
place in the Championship table with 75 points,[37] putting them into a 
play-off campaign for the fourth time in the space of eight years. Promotion 
was yet again to elude Forest, as they were beaten over two legs by eventual 
play off final winners Swansea City. Having drawn the first leg 0–0 at 
the City Ground,[38] they were eventually beaten 3–1 in the second leg.[39] 
In June 2011 Billy Davies's contract was terminated,[40][41] and he was 
replaced as manager by Steve McClaren, who signed a three-year contract.[42][43] 
Forest started the 2011–12 season with several poor results and after a 
5–1 defeat away to Burnley, David Pleat and Bill Beswick left the club's 
coaching setup.[44] Less than a week later, following a home defeat to 
Birmingham City McClaren resigned, and chairman Nigel Doughty announced 
that he intended to resign at the end of the season.[44] In October 2011, 
Nottingham Forest underwent several changes. These changes included the 
appointment of Frank Clark as new chairman of the club and also that of 
Steve Cotterill, replacing the recently departed Steve McClaren.[45] Nigel 
Doughty, owner and previous chairman of the club, died on 4 February 2012, 
having been involved with the club since the late 1990s, with many estimating 
his total contribution as being in the region of £100million.[46] The Al-Hasawi 
family, from Kuwait, purchased the club and became the new owners of Nottingham 
Forest in July 2012. The Al-Hasawi family told press that they had a long-term 
vision for the club based around a 3–5-year plan, and after interviewing 
several potential new managers, appointed Sean O'Driscoll, formerly manager 
at Doncaster Rovers and Crawley Town, as the manager on 19 July 2012 after 
a second round of talks with the then Crawley man. He was known for playing 
an attractive brand of passing football (which had taken Doncaster Rovers 
into the league's second tier for the first time since the 1950s) and what 
football fans would consider the Forest way.[47] O'Driscoll had spent 5 
months at the City Ground as Coach under Steve Cotterill in the 2011–12 
season before taking over at Crawley. After taking over at Crawley, O'Driscoll 
never took charge of a single competitive game. By 15 December 2012, after 
the team's 0–0 draw away at Brighton, Forest sat in 9th position with 33 
points, just 3 points off the play-off positions. The Al-Hasawi's 3–5-year 
plan had turned into a push for the play-offs in their first season as 
the Nottingham Forest owners. On the same weekend, the club announced that 
Omar Al-Hasawi had stepped down due to personal reasons and Fawaz Al-Hasawi, 
the majority shareholder with 75% stepped into the position,[48] with his 
brother Abdulaziz Al-Hasawi holding a 20% share and his cousin Omar Al-Hasawi 
holding a 5% share. On Boxing Day 2012 manager Sean O'Driscoll was sacked 
following a 4–2 victory over Leeds United with the club stating their intentions 
of a change ahead of the January transfer window and hopes of appointing 
a manager with Premiership experience.[49] The man to replace O'Driscoll 
was Alex McLeish.[50] The move was criticised by some members of the Forest 
fan base.[51] Chief executive Mark Arthur as well as scout Keith Burt and 
club ambassador Frank Clark were dismissed in January 2013.[52] On 5 February 
2013 Nottingham Forest and Alex McLeish had parted company by mutual agreement, 
just 40 days after McLeish took charge of Forest.[53] Forest supporters 
and pundits alike registered their concern for the state of the club,[47] 
with journalist Pat Murphy describing the situation as a "shambles".[54] 
Two days after McLeish's departure, the club re-appointed Billy Davies 
as manager, having been sacked as the team's manager twenty months previously.[55] 
His first match in charge was a draw,[56] followed by a run of 10 undefeated 
games. In March 2014 the club terminated Davies' employment, following 
a 5–0 defeat by Derby County.[57] Neil Warnock turned down the job as Forest 
manager on the day Davies was sacked. After initially rejecting the job 
in March 2014,[58] fans favourite Stuart Pearce was named the man to replace 
Billy Davies, taking over from caretaker manager Gary Brazil. He signed 
a two-year contract commencing on 1 July 2014. Pearce led Forest to an 
unbeaten start to the season but failed to keep up the form. He was sacked 
in February 2015 and replaced by another former Forest player, Dougie Freedman. 
Another mid table finish means that Forest will begin the 2015–16 season 
still in the Championship and now in their 17th season away from the Premier 
League. On 13 March 2016 Freedman was sacked, following a 3–0 defeat at 
home to Sheffield Wednesday.[59] Paul Williams was then appointed as temporary 
manager as Nottingham Forest searched for their new manager. Finally, following 
months of speculation and frustration the former US Boulogne, Valenciennes 
FC, Real Sociedad, and Stade Rennais head coach Philippe Montanier was 
appointed on a two-year contract on June 27, 2016. Nottingham Forest have 
worn red since the club’s foundation in 1865. At the meeting in the Clinton 
Arms which established Nottingham Forest as a football club, the committee 
also passed a resolution that the team colours should be ‘Garibaldi red’.[60] 
This decision was made in honour of Giuseppe Garibaldi, the Italian patriot 
who was the leader of the redshirts party. At this time, clubs identified 
themselves more by their headgear than their shirts and a dozen red caps 
with tassels were duly purchased, making Forest the first club to ‘officially’ 
wear red, a colour that has since been adopted by a significant number 
of others. Forest is the reason behind Arsenal's choice of red, having 
donated a full set of red kits following Arsenal's foundation in 1886. 
Forest's tour of South America in 1905 inspired Independiente to adopt 
red as their club colour, after the Argentine club's President Arístides 
Langone described the tourists as looking like diablos rojos ("red devils"), 
which would become Independiente's nickname.[61] The first club crest used 
by Forest was the city arms of Nottingham, which was first used on kits 
in 1947.[62] The current club badge was introduced in 1974.[62] The logo 
has been reported as being the brainchild of manager Brian Clough.[63] 
However, he did not arrive at the club until the year after. Forest have 
two stars above the club badge to commemorate the European Cup victories 
in 1979 and 1980.[64] Air Conditioning Company The club has garnered many 
nicknames over time. Historically, the nickname of "Foresters" was used,[66] 
as was "Garibaldis".[67] "The Forest"[68] or the simpler "Forest" – as 
used on the club crest – is commonly used, as is "the Reds". Another, lesser-used, 
nickname referring to the club is the "Tricky Trees".[69][70] Nottingham 
Forest is sometimes referred to as Notts Forest, which is not correct, 
as the club name refers The Nottingham Foresters Army regiment, not Nottinghamshire.[58][68][71][72][73] 
Since 1898 Nottingham Forest have played their home games at the City Ground 
in West Bridgford, on the banks of the River Trent. Since 1994 the stadium 
has been all-seater, a preparation that was made in time for the ground 
to be a venue for Euro 96, and currently has a capacity of 30,445. The 
City Ground is 300 yards away from Notts County's Meadow Lane stadium, 
on the other side of the Trent. The two grounds are the closest professional 
football stadia in England and the second closest in the United Kingdom 
after the grounds of Dundee and Dundee United. When built, the ground was 
within the boundaries of Nottingham, which had been made a city the previous 
year and gave rise to the name of the stadium. A boundary change in the 
1950s meant that the City Ground is now no longer within the city of Nottingham 
whilst Notts County's ground is. Prior to moving into the City Ground, 
Forest played their home games at Forest Recreation Ground, then Trent 
Bridge, and finally the purpose-built Town Ground. Whilst Notts County 
is the closest professional football club geographically, Forest have remained 
at least one division higher since the 1994–95 season and the club's fiercest 
rivalry is with Derby County, located 14 miles away.[74] The two clubs 
contest the East Midlands derby, a fixture which has taken on even greater 
significance since the inception of the Brian Clough Trophy in 2007. Leicester 
City are Forest's other East Midlands rival due to the close proximity 
of the two cities. Forest's other regional rival is Sheffield United, based 
in the neighbouring county of South Yorkshire, a rivalry which has roots 
in the UK miners' strike 1984-85 when the miners of South Yorkshire walked 
out on long strikes but some Nottinghamshire miners, who insisted on holding 
a ballot, continued to work. The exciting 2003 Football League Championship 
Play-off semi final between the two clubs, in which Sheffield United finished 
as 5–4 aggregate winners, also fuelled the rivalry. Forest's fanbase includes 
a host of celebrity supporters, including fashion designer Paul Smith,[75] 
England international cricketers Stuart Broad[76] and Samit Patel,[77] 
boxer Carl Froch,[78][79] golfers Lee Westwood[80] and Oliver Wilson,[81] 
footballers Alex Baptiste[82] Tom Cairney,[82] Shaun Barker[83] and Patrick 
Bamford,[84] ice hockey player Miika Wiikman,[85] Doctor Who actor Matt

game was a replay as the original match three weeks previous was abandoned 
at half time, due to the collapse of Leicester player Clive Clarke, with 
Forest leading 1–0.[109] Where a player has not declared an international 
allegiance, nation is determined by place of birth. Squad correct as of

allegiance, nation is determined by place of birth. In 1997 and 1998, as 
part of the release of the book The Official History of Nottingham Forest, 
a vote was carried out to decide on the club's official All Time XI.[131]
