The San Francisco Giants are a Major League Baseball team that plays in 
the National League Western Division. Since their inception as the New 
York Gothams in 1883, the Giants have employed 36 managers.[1] The duties 
of the team manager include team strategy and leadership on and off the 
field.[2][3] The franchise's first manager was John Clapp, who managed 
the team for one year before being replaced in 1884 by Jim Price.[1] The 
Giants won two World Series championships during the 19th century, in 1888 
and 1889, with Jim Mutrie as their manager both years.[a][1][4][5] John 
McGraw became the Giants' manager during the 1902 season, beginning a streak 
of 54 consecutive years in which the Giants were managed by a Baseball 
Hall of Famer. McGraw himself managed for more than 30 years, until the 
middle of the 1932 season, the longest managerial tenure in Giants history. 
McGraw won 2,583 games as the Giants manager, the most in Giants history. 
While managing the Giants, the team won the National League championship 
10 timesâ€”in 1904, 1905, 1911, 1912, 1913, 1917, 1921, 1922, 1923 and 1924. 
They played in the World Series nine times (no World Series was played 
in 1904)[6] and won three, in 1905, 1921 and 1922.[1][7] McGraw's successor 
was Hall of Famer Bill Terry, who managed the team from the middle of the 
1932 season until 1941. He won 823 games as the Giants' manager, third 
most in Giants history, and won three National League championships, in 
1933, 1936 and 1937, winning the World Series in 1933.[8] Hall of Famers 
Mel Ott and Leo Durocher managed the team from 1942 through 1955. Durocher 
was the manager for the Giants' World Series championship in 1954.[9] The 
Giants moved from New York to San Francisco in 1958, with Bill Rigney as 
their manager.[10][11] They won their first National League championship 
in San Francisco under Alvin Dark in 1962 but lost the World Series that 
year.[12] In their first 28 years in San Francisco, they had 14 managers 
(including two terms by Rigney).[1] Since 1985, the Giants' managerial 
situation has been more stable. Roger Craig managed the team for more than 
seven seasons, from the middle of the 1985 season until 1992, including 
a National League championship in 1989. His successor, Dusty Baker, managed 
the team for ten years from 1993 through 2002, winning the National League 
championship in 2002. Baker has the second highest win total of any Giants 
manager with 840.[1] Felipe Alou replaced Baker in 2003 and managed the 
team until 2006. The current Giants manager, Bruce Bochy, has managed the 
team since 2006, winning World Series' championships in 2010, 2012, and 
2014.[1][13] Mutrie has the highest winning percentage of any Giants manager, 
with .605. Heinie Smith has the lowest, with .156, although he managed 
just 32 games. The lowest winning percentage of any Giants manager who 
managed at least 100 games is .389, by Jim Davenport in 1985.[1] Statistics
