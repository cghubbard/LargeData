New Jersey is a state in the northeastern and mid-Atlantic regions of the 
United States. It is bordered on the north and east by New York, on the 
southeast and south by the Atlantic Ocean, on the west by Pennsylvania, 
and on the southwest by Delaware. New Jersey is the fourth-smallest state 
but the 11th-most populous and the most densely populated of the 50 United 
States. New Jersey lies entirely within the combined statistical areas 
of New York City and Philadelphia and is the third-wealthiest U.S. state 
by per capita income as of 2014.[19] New Jersey was inhabited by Native 
Americans for more than 2,800 years, with historical tribes such as the 
Lenape along the coast. In the early 17th century, the Dutch and the Swedes 
made the first European settlements.[20] The English later seized control 
of the region,[21] naming it the Province of New Jersey after the largest 
of the Channel Islands, Jersey,[22] and granting it as a colony to Sir 
George Carteret and John Berkeley, 1st Baron Berkeley of Stratton. New 
Jersey was the site of several decisive battles during the American Revolutionary 
War in the 18th century. In the 19th century, factories in cities such 
as Camden, Paterson, Newark, Trenton, and Elizabeth helped to drive the 
Industrial Revolution. New Jersey's geographic location at the center of 
the Northeast megalopolis, between Boston and New York City to the northeast, 
and Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Washington, D.C., to the southwest, fueled 
its rapid growth through the process of suburbanization in the second half 
of the 20th century. In the first decades of the 21st century, this suburbanization 
began reverting to consolidation of New Jersey's culturally diverse populace 
toward more urban settings within the state,[23][24] with towns home to 
commuter rail stations outpacing the population growth of more automobile-oriented 
suburbs since 2008.[25] Around 180 million years ago, during the Jurassic 
Period, New Jersey bordered North Africa. The pressure of the collision 
between North America and Africa gave rise to the Appalachian Mountains. 
Around 18,000 years ago, the Ice Age resulted in glaciers that reached 
New Jersey. As the glaciers retreated, they left behind Lake Passaic, as 
well as many rivers, swamps, and gorges.[26] New Jersey was originally 
settled by Native Americans, with the Lenni-Lenape being dominant at the 
time of contact. Scheyichbi is the Lenape name for the land that is now 
New Jersey.[27] The Lenape were several autonomous groups that practiced 
maize agriculture in order to supplement their hunting and gathering in 
the region surrounding the Delaware River, the lower Hudson River, and 
western Long Island Sound. The Lenape society was divided into matrilinear 
clans that were based upon common female ancestors. These clans were organized 
into three distinct phratries identified by their animal sign: Turtle, 
Turkey, and Wolf. They first encountered the Dutch in the early 17th century, 
and their primary relationship with the Europeans was through fur trade. 
The Dutch became the first Europeans to lay claim to lands in New Jersey. 
The Dutch colony of New Netherland consisted of parts of modern Middle 
Atlantic states. Although the European principle of land ownership was 
not recognized by the Lenape, Dutch West India Company policy required 
its colonists to purchase the land that they settled. The first to do so 
was Michiel Pauw who established a patronship called Pavonia in 1630 along 
the North River which eventually became the Bergen. Peter Minuit's purchase 
of lands along the Delaware River established the colony of New Sweden. 
The entire region became a territory of England on June 24, 1664, after 
an English fleet under the command of Colonel Richard Nicolls sailed into 
what is today New York Harbor and took control of Fort Amsterdam, annexing 
the entire province. During the English Civil War, the Channel Island of 
Jersey remained loyal to the British Crown and gave sanctuary to the King. 
It was from the Royal Square in St. Helier that Charles II of England was 
proclaimed King in 1649, following the execution of his father, Charles 
I. The North American lands were divided by Charles II, who gave his brother, 
the Duke of York (later King James II), the region between New England 
and Maryland as a proprietary colony (as opposed to a royal colony). James 
then granted the land between the Hudson River and the Delaware River (the 
land that would become New Jersey) to two friends who had remained loyal 
through the English Civil War: Sir George Carteret and Lord Berkeley of 
Stratton.[28] The area was named the Province of New Jersey. Since the 
state's inception, New Jersey has been characterized by ethnic and religious 
diversity. New England Congregationalists settled alongside Scots Presbyterians 
and Dutch Reformed migrants. While the majority of residents lived in towns 
with individual landholdings of 100 acres (40 ha), a few rich proprietors 
owned vast estates. English Quakers and Anglicans owned large landholdings. 
Unlike Plymouth Colony, Jamestown and other colonies, New Jersey was populated 
by a secondary wave of immigrants who came from other colonies instead 
of those who migrated directly from Europe. New Jersey remained agrarian 
and rural throughout the colonial era, and commercial farming developed 
sporadically. Some townships, such as Burlington on the Delaware River 
and Perth Amboy, emerged as important ports for shipping to New York City 
and Philadelphia. The colony's fertile lands and tolerant religious policy 
drew more settlers, and New Jersey's population had increased to 120,000 
by 1775. Settlement for the first 10 years of English rule took place along 
Hackensack River and Arthur Kill – settlers came primarily from New York 
and New England. On March 18, 1673, Berkeley sold his half of the colony 
to Quakers in England, who settled the Delaware Valley region as a Quaker 
colony. (William Penn acted as trustee for the lands for a time.) New Jersey 
was governed very briefly as two distinct provinces, East and West Jersey, 
for 28 years between 1674 and 1702, at times part of the Province of New 
York or Dominion of New England. In 1702, the two provinces were reunited 
under a royal governor, rather than a proprietary one. Edward Hyde, Lord 
Cornbury, became the first governor of the colony as a royal colony. Britain 
believed that he was an ineffective and corrupt ruler, taking bribes and 
speculating on land. In 1708 he was recalled to England. New Jersey was 
then ruled by the governors of New York, but this infuriated the settlers 
of New Jersey, who accused those governors of favoritism to New York. Judge 
Lewis Morris led the case for a separate governor, and was appointed governor 
by King George II in 1738.[29] New Jersey was one of the Thirteen Colonies 
that revolted against British rule in the American Revolution. The New 
Jersey Constitution of 1776 was passed July 2, 1776, just two days before 
the Second Continental Congress declared American Independence from Great 
Britain. It was an act of the Provincial Congress, which made itself into 
the state Legislature. To reassure neutrals, it provided that it would 
become void if New Jersey reached reconciliation with Great Britain. New 
Jersey representatives Richard Stockton, John Witherspoon, Francis Hopkinson, 
John Hart, and Abraham Clark were among those who signed the United States 
Declaration of Independence. During the American Revolutionary War, British 
and American armies crossed New Jersey numerous times, and several pivotal 
battles took place in the state. Because of this, New Jersey today is often 
referred to as "The Crossroads of the American Revolution."[30] The winter 
quarters of the Continental Army were established there twice by General 
George Washington in Morristown, which has been called "The Military Capital 
of the American Revolution".[31] On the night of December 25–26, 1776, 
the Continental Army under George Washington crossed the Delaware River. 
After the crossing, he surprised and defeated the Hessian troops in the 
Battle of Trenton. Slightly more than a week after victory at Trenton, 
American forces gained an important victory by stopping General Cornwallis's 
charges at the Second Battle of Trenton. By evading Cornwallis's army, 
Washington made a surprise attack on Princeton and successfully defeated 
the British forces there on January 3, 1777. Emanuel Leutze's painting 
of Washington Crossing the Delaware became an icon of the Revolution. American 
forces under Washington met the forces under General Henry Clinton at the 
Battle of Monmouth in an indecisive engagement in June 1778. Washington 
attempted to take the British column by surprise; when the British army 
attempted to flank the Americans, the Americans retreated in disorder. 
The ranks were later reorganized and withstood the British charges. In 
the summer of 1783, the Continental Congress met in Nassau Hall at Princeton 
University, making Princeton the nation's capital for four months. It was 
there that the Continental Congress learned of the signing of the Treaty 
of Paris (1783), which ended the war. On December 18, 1787, New Jersey 
became the third state to ratify the United States Constitution, which 
was overwhelmingly popular in New Jersey, as it prevented New York and 
Pennsylvania from charging tariffs on goods imported from Europe. On November 
20, 1789, the state became the first in the newly formed Union to ratify 
the Bill of Rights. The 1776 New Jersey State Constitution gave the vote 
to "all inhabitants" who had a certain level of wealth. This included women 
and blacks, but not married women, because they could not own property 
separately from their husbands. Both sides, in several elections, claimed 
that the other side had had unqualified women vote and mocked them for 
use of "petticoat electors", whether entitled to vote or not; on the other 
hand, both parties passed Voting Rights Acts. In 1807, the legislature 
passed a bill interpreting the constitution to mean universal white male 
suffrage, excluding paupers; the constitution was itself an act of the 
legislature and not enshrined as the modern constitution.[32] On February 
15, 1804, New Jersey became the last northern state to abolish new slavery 
and enacted legislation that slowly phased out existing slavery. This led 
to a gradual decrease of the slave population. By the close of the Civil 
War, about a dozen African Americans in New Jersey were still held in bondage.[33] 
New Jersey voters initially refused to ratify the constitutional amendments 
banning slavery and granting rights to the United States' black population. 
Industrialization accelerated in the northern part of the state following 
completion of the Morris Canal in 1831. The canal allowed for coal to be 
brought from eastern Pennsylvania's Lehigh Valley to northern New Jersey's 
growing industries in Paterson, Newark, and Jersey City. In 1844, the second 
state constitution was ratified and brought into effect. Counties thereby 
became districts for the State Senate, and some realignment of boundaries 
(including the creation of Mercer County) immediately followed. This provision 
was retained in the 1947 Constitution, but was overturned by the Supreme 
Court of the United States in 1962 by the decision Baker v. Carr. While 
the Governorship was stronger than under the 1776 constitution, the constitution 
of 1844 created many offices that were not responsible to him, or to the 
people, and it gave him a three-year term, but he could not succeed himself. 
New Jersey was one of the few Union states (the others being Delaware and 
Kentucky) to select a candidate other than Abraham Lincoln twice in national 
elections, and sided with Stephen Douglas (1860) and George B. McClellan 
(1864) during their campaigns. McClellan, a native Philadelphian, had New 
Jersey ties and formally resided in New Jersey at the time; he later became 
Governor of New Jersey (1878–81). (In New Jersey, the factions of the Democratic 
party managed an effective coalition in 1860.) During the American Civil 
War, the state was led first by Republican Governor Charles Smith Olden, 
then by Democrat Joel Parker. During the course of the war, over 80,000 
from the state enlisted in the Northern army; unlike many states, including 
some Northern ones, no battle was fought there.[citation needed] In the 
Industrial Revolution, cities like Paterson grew and prospered. Previously, 
the economy had been largely agrarian, which was problematically subject 
to crop failures and poor soil. This caused a shift to a more industrialized 
economy, one based on manufactured commodities such as textiles and silk. 
Inventor Thomas Edison also became an important figure of the Industrial 
Revolution, having been granted 1,093 patents, many of which for inventions 
he developed while working in New Jersey. Edison's facilities, first at 
Menlo Park and then in West Orange, are considered perhaps the first research 
centers in the U.S. Christie Street in Menlo Park was the first thoroughfare 
in the world to have electric lighting. Transportation was greatly improved 
as locomotion and steamboats were introduced to New Jersey. Iron mining 
was also a leading industry during the middle to late 19th century. Bog 
iron pits in the southern New Jersey Pinelands were among the first sources 
of iron for the new nation.[34] Mines such as Mt. Hope, Mine Hill and the 
Rockaway Valley Mines created a thriving industry. Mining generated the 
impetus for new towns and was one of the driving forces behind the need 
for the Morris Canal. Zinc mines were also a major industry, especially 
the Sterling Hill Mine. Through both World Wars, New Jersey was a center 
for war production, especially in naval construction. Battleships, cruisers, 
and destroyers were made in this state. New Jersey manufactured 6.8 percent 
of total United States military armaments produced during World War II, 
ranking fifth among the 48 states.[35] In addition, Fort Dix (1917) (originally 
called "Camp Dix"),[36] Camp Merritt (1917)[37] and Camp Kilmer (1941)[38] 
were all constructed to house and train American soldiers through both 
World Wars. New Jersey also became a principal location for defense in 
the Cold War. Fourteen Nike Missile stations were constructed, especially 
for the defense of New York City and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. PT-109, 
a motor torpedo boat commanded by Lt. (j.g.) John F. Kennedy in World War 
II, was built at the Elco Boatworks in Bayonne. The aircraft carrier USS 
Enterprise (CV-6) was briefly docked at the Military Ocean Terminal in 
Bayonne in the 1950s before she was sent to Kearney to be scrapped.[39] 
In 1962, the world's first nuclear-powered cargo ship, the NS Savannah, 
was launched at Camden. New Jersey prospered through the Roaring Twenties. 
The first Miss America Pageant was held in 1921 in Atlantic City, the Holland 
Tunnel connecting Jersey City to Manhattan opened in 1927, and the first 
drive-in movie was shown in 1933 in Camden. During the Great Depression 
of the 1930s, the state offered begging licenses to unemployed residents,[40] 
the zeppelin airship Hindenburg crashed in flames over Lakehurst, and the 
SS Morro Castle beached itself near Asbury Park after going up in flames 
while at sea. In 1951, the New Jersey Turnpike opened, permitting fast 
travel by car and truck between North Jersey (and metropolitan New York) 
and South Jersey (and metropolitan Philadelphia). In the 1960s, race riots 
erupted in many of the industrial cities of North Jersey. The first race 
riots in New Jersey occurred in Jersey City on August 2, 1964. Several 
others ensued in 1967, in Newark and Plainfield. Other riots followed the 
assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in April 1968, just as in 
the rest of the country. A riot occurred in Camden in 1971. As a result 
of an order from the New Jersey Supreme Court to fund schools equitably, 
the New Jersey legislature passed an income tax bill in 1976. Prior to 
this bill, the state had no income tax.[41] In the early part of the 2000s, 
two light rail systems were opened: the Hudson–Bergen Light Rail in Hudson 
County and the River Line between Camden and Trenton. The intent of these 
projects were to encourage transit-oriented development in North Jersey 
and South Jersey, respectively. The HBLR in particular was credited with 
a revitalization of Hudson County and Jersey City in particular.[42][43][44][45] 
Urban revitalization has continued in North Jersey in the 21st century. 
As of 2014, Jersey City's Census-estimated population was 262,146,[46] 
with the largest population increase of any municipality in New Jersey 
since 2010,[47] representing an increase of 5.9% from the 2010 United States 
Census, when the city's population was enumerated at 247,597.[48][49] In 
2010, Newark experienced its first population increase since the 1950s. 
New Jersey is bordered on the north and northeast by New York (parts of 
which are across the Hudson River, Upper New York Bay, the Kill Van Kull, 
Newark Bay, and the Arthur Kill); on the east by the Atlantic Ocean; on 
the southwest by Delaware across Delaware Bay; and on the west by Pennsylvania 
across the Delaware River. New Jersey can be thought of as five regions, 
based on natural geography and population. Northeastern New Jersey, the 
Gateway Region, lies closest to Manhattan in New York City, and up to a 
million residents commute daily into the city to work via automobile or 
mass transit.[52] Northwestern New Jersey, or the "Skylands", is, compared 
to the northeast, more wooded, rural, and mountainous. The "Shore", along 
the Atlantic Coast in the central-east and southeast, has its own natural, 
residential, and lifestyle characteristics owing to its location by the 
ocean. The Delaware Valley includes the southwestern counties of the state, 
which reside within the Philadelphia Metropolitan Area. The fifth region 
is the Pine Barrens in the interior of the southern part. Covered rather 
extensively by mixed pine and oak forest, it has a much lower population 
density than much of the rest of the state. New Jersey also can be broadly 
divided into three geographic regions: North Jersey, Central Jersey, and 
South Jersey. Some New Jersey residents do not consider Central Jersey 
a region in its own right, but others believe it is a separate geographic 
and cultural area from the North and South. The federal Office of Management 
and Budget divides New Jersey's counties into seven Metropolitan Statistical 
Areas, including sixteen counties in the New York City or Philadelphia 
metro areas. Four counties have independent metro areas, and Warren County 
is part of the Pennsylvania-based Lehigh Valley metro area. (See Metropolitan 
Statistical Areas of New Jersey for details.) It is also at the center 
of the Northeast megalopolis. Additionally, the New Jersey Commerce, Economic 
Growth, & Tourism Commission divides the state into six distinct regions 
to facilitate the state's tourism industry. The regions are: High Point, 
in Montague Township, Sussex County, is the highest elevation, at 1,803 
feet (550 m). The Palisades are a line of steep cliffs on the lower west 
side of the Hudson River, in Bergen County and Hudson County. Major rivers 
include the Hudson, Delaware, Raritan, Passaic, Hackensack, Rahway, Musconetcong, 
Mullica, Rancocas, Manasquan, Maurice, and Toms rivers. Sandy Hook, along 
the eastern coast, is a popular recreational beach. It is a barrier spit 
and an extension of the Barnegat Peninsula along the state's Atlantic Ocean 
coast. Long Beach Island ("LBI"), a barrier island along the eastern coast, 
has popular recreational beaches. The primary access point to the island 
is by a single bridge connection to the mainland. Barnegat Lighthouse is 
on the northern tip. Areas managed by the National Park Service include: 
Prominent geographic features include: There are two climatic conditions 
in the state. The south, central, and northeast parts of the state have 
a humid subtropical climate, while the northwest has a humid continental 
climate (microthermal), with much cooler temperatures due to higher elevation. 
New Jersey receives between 2,400 and 2,800 hours of sunshine annually.[53] 
Summers are typically hot and humid, with statewide average high temperatures 
of 82–87 °F (28–31 °C) and lows of 60–69 °F (16–21 °C); however, temperatures 
exceed 90 °F (32 °C) on average 25 days each summer, exceeding 100 °F (38 °C) 
in some years. Winters are usually cold, with average high temperatures 
of 34–43 °F (1–6 °C) and lows of 16 to 28 °F (−9 to −2 °C) for most of 
the state, but temperatures could, for brief periods, fall below 10 °F 
(−12 °C) and occasionally rise above 50 °F (10 °C). Northwestern parts 
of the state have significantly colder winters with sub-0 °F (−18 °C) being 
an almost annual occurrence. Spring and autumn may feature wide temperature 
variations, with lower humidity than summer. The USDA Plant Hardiness Zone 
classification ranges from 6 in the northwest of the state, to between 
7B and 8A near Cape May.[54] All-time temperature extremes recorded in 
New Jersey include 110 °F (43 °C) on July 10, 1936 in Runyon, Middlesex 
County and −34 °F (−37 °C) on January 5, 1904 in River Vale, Bergen County.[55] 
Average annual precipitation ranges from 43 to 51 inches (1,100 to 1,300 mm), 
uniformly spread through the year. Average snowfall per winter season ranges 
from 10–15 inches (25–38 cm) in the south and near the seacoast, 15–30 
inches (38–76 cm) in the northeast and central part of the state, to about 
40–50 inches (1.0–1.3 m) in the northwestern highlands, but this often 
varies considerably from year to year. Precipitation falls on an average 
of 120 days a year, with 25 to 30 thunderstorms, most of which occur during 
the summer. During winter and early spring, New Jersey can experience "nor'easters", 
which are capable of causing blizzards or flooding throughout the northeastern 
United States. Hurricanes and tropical storms (such as Tropical Storm Floyd 
in 1999[56]), tornadoes, and earthquakes are rare, although New Jersey 
was severely impacted by Hurricane Sandy on October 29, 2012 with the storm 
making landfall in the state at 90 mph. The United States Census Bureau 
estimates that the population of New Jersey was 8,958,013 on July 1, 2015, 
a 1.89% increase since the 2010 United States Census.[6] Residents of New 
Jersey are most commonly referred to as "New Jerseyans" or, less commonly, 
as "New Jerseyites". As of the 2010 census, there were 8,791,894 people 
residing in the state. The racial makeup of the state was: 17.7% of the 
population were Hispanic or Latino (of any race). Non-Hispanic Whites were 
58.9% of the population in 2011,[7] down from 85% in 1970.[64] As of 2011, 
56.4% of New Jersey's population younger than age 1 were minorities (meaning 
that they had at least one parent who was not non-Hispanic white).[65] 
In 2010, undocumented immigrants constituted an estimated 6.4% of the population. 
This was the fourth highest percentage of any state in the country.[66] 
There were an estimated 550,000 illegal immigrants in the state in 2010.[67] 
The United States Census Bureau, as of July 1, 2015[update], estimated 
New Jersey's population at 8,958,013,[6] which represents an increase of 
166,119, or 1.89%, since the last census in 2010. This includes a natural 
increase since the last census of 343,965 people (that is, 933,185 births 
minus 589,220 deaths) and a decrease due to net migration of 53,930 people 
out of the state.[68] Immigration from outside the United States resulted 
in a net increase of 384,687 people, and migration within the country produced 
a net loss of 438,617 people.[68] As of 2005[update], there were 1.6 million 
foreign-born living in the state (accounting for 19.2% of the population).[69] 
As of 2010, New Jersey is the eleventh-most populous state in the United 
States, and the most densely populated, at 1,185 residents per square mile 
(458 per km2), with most of the population residing in the counties surrounding 
New York City, Philadelphia, and along the eastern Jersey Shore, while 
the extreme southern and northwestern counties are relatively less dense 
overall. It is also the second wealthiest state according to the U.S. Census 
Bureau.[19] The center of population for New Jersey is located in Middlesex 
County, in the town of Milltown, just east of the New Jersey Turnpike.[70] 
New Jersey is home to more scientists and engineers per square mile than 
anywhere else in the world.[71][72][73] On October 21, 2013, same-sex marriages 
commenced in New Jersey.[74] New Jersey is one of the most ethnically and 
religiously diverse states in the country. As of 2011, 56.4% of New Jersey's 
children under the age of one belonged to racial or ethnic minority groups, 
meaning that they had at least one parent who was not non-Hispanic white.[75] 
It has the second largest Jewish population by percentage (after New York);[76] 
the second largest Muslim population by percentage (after Michigan); the 
largest population of Peruvian Americans in the United States; the largest 
population of Cubans outside of Florida; the third highest Asian population 
by percentage; and the third highest Italian population by percentage, 
according to the 2000 Census. African Americans, Hispanics (Puerto Ricans 
and Dominicans), West Indians, Arabs, and Brazilian and Portuguese Americans 
are also high in number. New Jersey has the third highest Asian Indian 
population of any state by absolute numbers and the highest by percentage,[77][78][79][80] 
with Bergen County home to America's largest Malayali community.[81] Overall, 
New Jersey has the third largest Korean population, with Bergen County 
home to the highest Korean concentration per capita of any U.S. county[82] 
(6.9% in 2011). New Jersey also has the fourth largest Filipino population, 
and fourth largest Chinese population, per the 2010 U.S. Census. The five 
largest ethnic groups in 2000 were: Italian (17.9%), Irish (15.9%), African 
(13.6%), German (12.6%), Polish (6.9%). Newark was the fourth poorest of 
U.S. cities with over 250,000 residents in 2008,[83] but New Jersey as 
a whole had the second-highest median household income as of 2014.[19] 
This is largely because so much of New Jersey consists of suburbs, most 
of them affluent, of New York City and Philadelphia. New Jersey is also 
the most densely populated state, and the only state that has had every 
one of its counties deemed "urban" as defined by the Census Bureau's Combined 
Statistical Area.[84] In 2010, 6.2% of its population was reported as under 
age 5, 23.5% under 18, and 13.5% were 65 or older; and females made up 
approximately 51.3% of the population.[90] A study by the Pew Research 
Center found that in 2013, New Jersey was the only U.S. state in which 
immigrants born in India constituted the largest foreign-born nationality, 
representing roughly 10% of all foreign-born residents in the state.[89] 
For further information on various ethnic groups and neighborhoods prominently 
featured within New Jersey, see the following articles: As of 2010, 71.31% 
(5,830,812) of New Jersey residents age 5 and older spoke English at home 
as a primary language, while 14.59% (1,193,261) spoke Spanish, 1.23% (100,217) 
Chinese (which includes Cantonese and Mandarin), 1.06% (86,849) Italian, 
1.06% (86,486) Portuguese, 0.96% (78,627) Tagalog, and Korean was spoken 
as a main language by 0.89% (73,057) of the population over the age of 
five. In total, 28.69% (2,345,644) of New Jersey's population age 5 and 
older spoke a mother language other than English.[91] A diverse collection 
of languages has since evolved amongst the state's population, given that 
New Jersey has become cosmopolitan and is home to ethnic enclaves of non-English-speaking 
communities:[92][93][94][95] By number of adherents, the largest denominations 
in New Jersey, according to the Association of Religion Data Archives in 
2010, were the Roman Catholic Church with 3,235,290; Islam with 160,666; 
and the United Methodist Church with 138,052.[102] The world's largest 
Hindu temple was inaugurated in Robbinsville, Mercer County, in central 
New Jersey during 2014, a BAPS temple.[103] For its overall population 
and nation-leading population density, New Jersey has a relative paucity 
of classic large cities. This paradox is most pronounced in Bergen County, 
New Jersey's most populous county, whose more than 930,000 residents in 
2014 inhabited 70 municipalities, the most populous being Hackensack, with 
44,519 residents estimated in 2014. Many urban areas extend far beyond 
the limits of a single large city, as New Jersey cities (and indeed municipalities 
in general) tend to be geographically small; three of the four largest 
cities in New Jersey by population have under 20 square miles of land area, 
and eight of the top ten, including all of the top five have land area 
under 30 square miles. As of the United States 2010 Census[update], only 
four municipalities had populations in excess of 100,000, although Edison 
and Woodbridge came very close. These are the five cities and towns gaining 
the highest total numbers of residents between 2010 and 2014:[104] The 
U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis estimates that New Jersey's gross state 
product in 2010 was $487 billion.[105][106] New Jersey's estimated taxpayer 
burden in 2015 was $59,400 per taxpayer.[107] New Jersey's per capita gross 
state product in 2008 was $54,699, second in the U.S. and above the national 
per capita gross domestic product of $46,588.[108] Its per capita income 
was the third highest in the nation with $51,358.[108] In 2013, the state 
had the second-largest number of millionaires per capita in the United 
States (ratio of 7.49%), according to a study by Phoenix Marketing International.[109] 
It is ranked 2nd in the nation by the number of places with per capita 
incomes above national average with 76.4%. Nine of New Jersey's counties 
are in the wealthiest 100 of the country. New Jersey has seven tax brackets 
that determine state income tax rates, which range from 1.4% to 8.97%. 
The standard sales tax rate is 7%, applicable to all retail sales unless 
specifically exempt by law. Tax exemptions include most food items for 
at-home preparation, medications, most clothing, footwear, and disposable 
paper products for use in the home. Approximately 30 New Jersey municipalities 
are designated as Urban Enterprise Zones, in which shoppers are charged 
a 3½% sales tax rate, half of the rate charged outside the UEZs. Sections 
of Paterson, Elizabeth, and Jersey City are examples of communities that 
are subject to the lower sales tax rate. New Jersey has the highest cumulative 
tax rate of all 50 states with residents paying a total of $68 billion 
in state and local taxes annually with a per capita burden of $7,816 at 
a rate of 12.9% of income.[110] All real property located in the state 
is subject to property tax unless specifically exempted by statute. New 
Jersey does not assess an intangible personal property tax, but it does 
impose an inheritance tax. New Jersey consistently ranks as having one 
of the highest proportional levels of disparity of any state in the United 
States based upon what it receives from the federal government relative 
to what it gives. In 2015, WalletHub ranked New Jersey the state least 
dependent upon federal government aid overall and having the fourth lowest 
return on taxpayer investment from the federal government, at 48 cents 
per dollar.[111] New Jersey has one of the highest tax burdens in the nation.[112] 
Factors for this include the large federal tax liability which is not adjusted 
for New Jersey's higher cost of living and Medicaid funding formulas. As 
shown by the study, incomes tend to be higher in New Jersey, which puts 
those in higher tax brackets especially vulnerable to the alternative minimum 
tax. New Jersey's economy is multifaceted but is nevertheless centered 
upon the pharmaceutical industry, the financial industry, chemical development, 
telecommunications, food processing, electric equipment, printing, publishing, 
and tourism. New Jersey's agricultural outputs are nursery stock, horses, 
vegetables, fruits and nuts, seafood, and dairy products. New Jersey ranks 
second among states in blueberry production, third in cranberries and spinach, 
and fourth in bell peppers, peaches, and head lettuce.[113] New Jersey 
harvests the fourth-largest number of acres planted with asparagus.[114] 
Although New Jersey is home to many energy-intensive industries, its energy 
consumption is only 2.7% of the U.S. total, and its carbon dioxide emissions 
are 0.8% of the U.S. total. Its comparatively low greenhouse gas emissions 
can be attributed to nuclear power. According to the Energy Information 
Administration, nuclear power dominates New Jersey's electricity market, 
typically supplying more than one-half of State generation. New Jersey 
has three nuclear power plants, including the Oyster Creek Nuclear Generating 
Station, which came online in 1969 and is the oldest operating nuclear 
plant in the country.[115] New Jersey has a strong scientific economy and 
is home to major pharmaceutical and telecommunications firms. There is 
also a strong service economy in New Jersey serving residents who work 
in New York City or Philadelphia in retail sales, education, and real estate. 
Furthermore, New Jersey draws upon its large and well-educated labor pool, 
which also supports the myriad of industries that exists today. Shipping 
is a strong industry in New Jersey because of the state's strategic location, 
the Port of New York and New Jersey the busiest on the East Coast. The 
Port Newark-Elizabeth Marine Terminal was the world's first container port 
and is one of the world's largest container ports. New Jersey also has 
a strong presence in chemical development, refining, and food processing 
operations. New Jersey hosts several business headquarters, including twenty-four 
Fortune 500 companies.[116] Paramus in Bergen County has become the top 
retail zip code in the United States, with the municipality generating 
over $5 billion in annual retail sales.[117][118] Several New Jersey counties 
such as Somerset (7), Morris (10), Hunterdon (13), Bergen (21), Monmouth 
(42) counties are ranked among the highest-income counties in the United 
States. Four others are also in the top 100. New Jersey's location as a 
crossroads of commerce and its extensive transportation system have put 
over one third of all United States residents and many Canadian residents 
within overnight distance by land. This accessibility to consumer revenue 
has enabled seaside resorts such as Atlantic City and the remainder of 
the Jersey Shore, as well as the state's other natural and cultural attractions, 
to contribute significantly to New Jersey's record tourism revenue of $40.3 
billion and 87.2 million tourist visitations in 2013.[119] In 1976, a referendum 
of New Jersey voters approved casino gambling in Atlantic City, where the 
first legalized casino opened in 1978.[120] At that time, Las Vegas was 
the only mega-casino resort.[121] Several casinos lie along the Atlantic 
City Boardwalk,[122] the first and longest boardwalk in the world.[123] 
On February 26, 2013, Governor Chris Christie signed online gambling into 
law.[124] Atlantic City experienced a dramatic contraction in its stature 
as a gambling destination after 2010, including the closure of multiple 
casinos in 2014, spurred by competition from the advent of legalized gambling 
in other northeastern U.S. states.[125] Forests cover 45%, or approximately 
2.1 million acres, of New Jersey's land area.[126] The chief tree of the 
northern forests is the oak. The Pine Barrens, consisting of pine forests, 
is in the southern part of the state. Some mining activity of zinc, iron, 
and manganese still takes place in the area in and around the Franklin 
Furnace. New Jersey is second in the nation in solar power installations,[127] 
enabled by one of the country's most favorable net metering policies, and 
the renewable energy certificates program. The state has more than 10,000 
solar installations.[128] In 2010, there were 605 school districts in the 
state.[130] Secretary of Education Rick Rosenberg, appointed by Governor 
Jon Corzine, created the Education Advancement Initiative (EAI) to increase 
college admission rates by 10% for New Jersey's high school students, decrease 
dropout rates by 15%, and increase the amount of money devoted to schools 
by 10%. Rosenberg retracted this plan when criticized for taking the money 
out of healthcare to fund this initiative. In 2010 the state government 
paid all of the teachers' premiums for health insurance,[130] but currently 
all NJ public teachers pay a portion of their own health insurance premiums. 
Census data reveal that New Jersey spent more per each public school student 
than any other state except New York in 2009, amounting to $16,271 spent 
per pupil, with 41% of the revenue derived from state sources.[131] According 
to 2011 Newsweek statistics, students of High Technology High School in 
Lincroft, Monmouth County and Bergen County Academies in Hackensack, Bergen 
County registered average SAT scores of 2145 and 2100, respectively,[132] 
representing the second- and third-highest scores, respectively, of all 
listed U.S. high schools.[132] Princeton University in Princeton, Mercer 
County, was ranked the top U.S. national university per the 2017 list of 
U.S. News & World Report.[133] In 2013, Rutgers University gained medical 
and dental schools intended to augment its profile as a national research 
university.[129] In 2014, New Jersey's school systems were ranked at the 
top of all fifty U.S. states by financial website Wallethub.com.[134] Nine 
New Jersey high schools were ranked among the top 25 in the U.S. on the 
Newsweek "America's Top High Schools 2016" list, more than from any other 
state.[135] Major New Jersey newspapers including the following: Since 
2006 there have been a growing number of hyperlocal news sites.[139][140] 
These sites provide relevant news for their respective communities.[141] 
Motion picture technology was developed by Thomas Edison, with much of 
his early work done at his West Orange laboratory. Edison's Black Maria 
was the first motion picture studio. America's first motion picture industry 
started in 1907 in Fort Lee and the first studio was constructed there 
in 1909.[142] DuMont Laboratories in Passaic, developed early sets and 
made the first broadcast to the private home. A number of television shows 
and films have been filmed in New Jersey. Since 1978, the state has maintained 
a Motion Picture and Television Commission to encourage filming in-state.[143] 
New Jersey has long offered tax credits to television producers. Governor 
Chris Christie suspended the credits in 2010, but the New Jersey State 
Legislature in 2011 approved the restoration and expansion of the tax credit 
program. Under bills passed by both the state Senate and Assembly, the 
program offers 20 percent tax credits (22% in urban enterprise zones) to 
television and film productions that shoot in the state and meet set standards 
for hiring and local spending.[144] The New Jersey Turnpike is one of the 
most prominent and heavily traveled roadways in the United States. This 
toll road carries interstate traffic between Delaware and New York, and 
the East Coast in general. Commonly referred to as simply "the Turnpike," 
it is known for its numerous rest areas named after prominent New Jerseyans 
as diverse as inventor Thomas Edison; United States Secretary of the Treasury 
Alexander Hamilton; United States Presidents Grover Cleveland and Woodrow 
Wilson; writers James Fenimore Cooper, Joyce Kilmer, and Walt Whitman; 
patriot Molly Pitcher; Red Cross founder Clara Barton; and football coach 
Vince Lombardi. The Garden State Parkway, or simply "the Parkway," carries 
relatively more in-state traffic than interstate traffic and runs from 
the town of Montvale along New Jersey's northern border to its southernmost 
tip at Cape May for 172.4 miles (277.5 km). It is the trunk that connects 
the New York metropolitan area to Atlantic City and is consistently one 
of the safest roads in the nation. With a total of 15 travel and 6 shoulder 
lanes, the Driscoll Bridge on the Parkway, spanning the Raritan River in 
Middlesex County, is the widest motor vehicle bridge in the world by number 
of lanes[147] as well as one of the busiest. New Jersey is connected to 
New York City via various bridges and tunnels. The double-decked George 
Washington Bridge carries the heaviest load of motor vehicle traffic of 
any bridge in the world,[145][146] at 102 million vehicles per year, over 
fourteen lanes, from Fort Lee, New Jersey in Bergen County across the Hudson 
River to the Trans-Manhattan Expressway in the Washington Heights neighborhood 
of Upper Manhattan in New York City; Interstate 95 and U.S. Route 1/9 cross 
the Hudson River via the "GWB", while U.S. Route 46, which lies entirely 
within New Jersey, ends halfway across the bridge at the state border with 
New York. The Lincoln Tunnel connects to Midtown Manhattan carrying New 
Jersey State Route 495 and the Holland Tunnel connects to Lower Manhattan 
carrying I-78. These are the three major Hudson River crossings that see 
heavy vehicular traffic. New Jersey is also connected to Staten Island 
by three bridges — from south to north: the Outerbridge Crossing, Goethals 
Bridge, and Bayonne Bridge. Other expressways in New Jersey include the 
Atlantic City Expressway, the Palisades Interstate Parkway, Interstate 
76, Interstate 78, Interstate 80, Interstate 95, Interstate 195, Interstate 
278, Interstate 280, Interstate 287, Interstate 295, and Interstate 676. 
Other major roadways include U.S. 1, New Jersey Route 4, U.S. 9, New Jersey 
Route 10, and New Jersey Route 17. New Jersey has interstate compacts with 
all three of its neighboring states. The Port Authority of New York and 
New Jersey, the Delaware River Port Authority (with Pennsylvania), and 
the Delaware River and Bay Authority (with Delaware) operate most of the 
major transportation routes into and out of New Jersey. Bridge tolls are 
collected in one direction only – it is free to cross into New Jersey, 
but motorists must pay when exiting the state. Exceptions to this are the 
Dingman's Ferry Bridge and the Delaware River – Turnpike Toll Bridge where 
tolls are charged both ways. The Washington Crossing and Scudders Falls 
(on I-95) bridges near Trenton, as well as Trenton's Calhoun Street and 
Bridge Street ("Trenton Makes") bridges, are toll-free. In addition, * 
Riverton-Belvidere Bridge, Northampton Street Bridge, Riegelsville Bridge, 
and Upper Black Eddy-Milford Bridge are free Delaware River bridges into 
and out of NJ. New Jersey became the only U.S. state where all fuel dispensing 
stations are required to sell full-service gasoline to customers at all 
times, after Oregon's introduction of restricted self-service gasoline 
availability took effect in 2016.[148] It is unlawful for a customer to 
serve oneself gasoline in New Jersey. Newark Liberty International Airport 
is one of the busiest airports in the United States. Operated by the Port 
Authority of New York and New Jersey, which runs the other two major airports 
in the New York metropolitan area (John F. Kennedy International Airport 
and LaGuardia Airport), it is one of the main airports serving the New 
York City area. United Airlines is the facility's largest tenant, operating 
an entire terminal at Newark, which it uses as one of its primary hubs. 
FedEx Express operates a large cargo hub. The adjacent Newark Airport railroad 
station provides access to the trains of Amtrak and NJ Transit along the 
Northeast Corridor Line. Two smaller commercial airports, Atlantic City 
International Airport and Trenton-Mercer Airport, also operate in other 
parts of New Jersey. Teterboro Airport, in Bergen County, is a general 
aviation airport popular with private and corporate aircraft, due to its 
proximity to New York City. Millville Municipal Airport, in Cumberland 
County, is a general aviation airport popular with private and corporate 
aircraft, due to its proximity to the shore. The NJ Transit Corporation 
(NJ Transit) operates extensive rail and bus service throughout the state. 
NJ Transit is a state-run corporation that began with the consolidation 
of several private bus companies in North Jersey. In the early 1980s, it 
acquired the commuter train operations of Conrail that connect towns in 
northern and central New Jersey to New York City. NJ Transit has eleven 
lines that run throughout different parts of the state. Most of the trains 
start at various points in the state and most end at either Pennsylvania 
Station, in New York City, or Hoboken Terminal in Hoboken. NJ Transit began 
service between Atlantic City and Lindenwold in 1989 and extended it to 
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in the 1990s. NJ Transit also operates three 
light rail systems in the state. The Hudson-Bergen Light Rail connects 
Bayonne to North Bergen, with planned expansion into Bergen County communities. 
The Newark Light Rail is partially underground, and connects downtown Newark 
with other parts of the city. The River Line connects Trenton and Camden. 
The PATH is a subway and above-ground railway which links Hoboken, Jersey 
City, Harrison and Newark with New York City. The PATH operates four lines 
that connect various points in North Jersey and New York. The lines all 
terminate in Hudson County, Essex County or Manhattan in New York City. 
The PATCO High Speedline links Camden County and Philadelphia. PATCO operates 
a single elevated and subway line that runs from Lindenwold to Center City 
Philadelphia. PATCO operates stations in Lindenwold, Voorhees, Cherry Hill, 
Haddonfield, Haddon Township, Collingswood, and Camden, along with four 
stations in Philadelphia. Amtrak also operates numerous long-distance passenger 
trains in New Jersey to and from neighboring states and around the country. 
In addition to the Newark Airport connection, other major Amtrak railway 
stations include Trenton Rail Station, Metropark, and the grand historic 
Newark Penn Station. SEPTA also has two lines that operate into New Jersey. 
The Trenton Line terminates at the Trenton Transit Center, and the West 
Trenton Line terminates at the West Trenton Rail Station in Ewing. AirTrain 
Newark is a monorail connecting the Amtrak/NJ Transit station on the Northeast 
Corridor to the airport's terminals and parking lots. Some private bus 
carriers still remain in New Jersey. Most of these carriers operate with 
state funding to offset losses and state owned buses are provided to these 
carriers of which Coach USA companies make up the bulk. Other carriers 
include private charter and tour bus operators that take gamblers from 
other parts of New Jersey, New York City, Philadelphia, and Delaware to 
the casino resorts of Atlantic City. In the Port of New York and New Jersey, 
New York Waterway has ferry terminals at Belford Harbor, Jersey City, Hoboken, 
Weehawken, and Edgewater Landing. There are slips at Port Liberte, Liberty 
Harbor, Exchange Place in Jersey City, Port Imperial and Lincoln Harbor 
in Weehawken, Hoboken Terminal and 14th Street in Hoboken. Manhattan terminals 
are located at Wall Street/Pier 11, Battery Park City (BPC) or West Midtown 
Ferry Terminal. Liberty Water Taxi in Jersey City has ferries from Paulus 
Hook and Liberty State Park to (BPC). Statue Cruises has service from Liberty 
State Park and Statue of Liberty National Monument, including Ellis Island. 
(Although there is a bridge from Ellis Island to the park built for renovations 
on the island it is not open for public use.) SeaStreak offers services 
from the Raritan Bayshore to Manhattan and during the Met's season to Shea 
Stadium. The ferries on leave from Atlantic Highlands and two terminals 
in Highlands. Ferry service from Keyport and Perth Amboy have been also 
been proposed. Service from Elizabeth at Newark Bay is proposed in conjunction 
with re-development plans on the shore near Jersey Gardens.[149] On the 
Delaware Bay, the Delaware River and Bay Authority operates the Cape May-Lewes 
Ferry. The agency also operates the Forts Ferry Crossing for passengers 
across the Delaware River. The Delaware River Port Authority operates the 
RiverLink Ferry between the Camden waterfront and Penn's Landing in Philadelphia, 
Pennsylvania. Several private bus lines provide transportation service 
in the state of New Jersey. Below is a list of major carriers and their 
areas of operation: The position of Governor of New Jersey has been considered 
one of the most powerful in the nation. Until 2010, the governor was the 
only statewide elected executive official in the state and appointed numerous 
government officials. Formerly, an Acting Governor was even more powerful 
as he simultaneously served as President of the New Jersey State Senate, 
thus directing half of the legislative and all of the executive process. 
In 2002 and 2007, President of the State Senate Richard Codey held the 
position of Acting Governor for a short time, and from 2004 to 2006 Codey 
became a long-term Acting Governor due to Jim McGreevey's resignation. 
A 2005 amendment to the state Constitution prevents the Senate President 
from becoming Acting Governor in the event of a permanent gubernatorial 
vacancy without giving up her or his seat in the state Senate. Chris Christie 
(Republican) is the Governor. The governor's mansion is Drumthwacket, located 
in Princeton. Before 2010, New Jersey was one of the few states without 
a lieutenant governor. Republican Kim Guadagno was elected the first Lieutenant 
Governor of New Jersey and took office on January 19, 2010. She was elected 
on the Republican ticket with Governor-Elect Chris Christie in the November 
2009 NJ gubernatorial election. The position was created as the result 
of a Constitutional amendment to the New Jersey State Constitution passed 
by the voters on November 8, 2005 and effective as of January 17, 2006. 
The current version of the New Jersey State Constitution was adopted in 
1947. It provides for a bicameral New Jersey Legislature, consisting of 
an upper house Senate of 40 members and a lower house General Assembly 
of 80 members. Each of the 40 legislative districts elects one State Senator 
and two Assembly members. Assembly members are elected for a two-year term 
in all odd-numbered years; State Senators are elected in the years ending 
in 1, 3, and 7 and thus serve either four- or two-year terms. New Jersey 
is one of only five states that elects its state officials in odd-numbered 
years. (The others are Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Virginia.) 
New Jersey holds elections for these offices every four years, in the year 
following each federal Presidential election year. Thus, the last year 
when New Jersey elected a Governor was 2013; the next gubernatorial election 
will occur in 2017, with future gubernatorial elections to take place in 
2021, 2025, 2029, etc. The New Jersey Supreme Court[150] consists of a 
Chief Justice and six Associate Justices. All are appointed by the Governor 
with the advice and consent of a majority of the membership of the State 
Senate. Justices serve an initial seven-year term, after which they can 
be reappointed to serve until age 70. Most of the day-to-day work in the 
New Jersey courts is carried out in the Municipal Courts, where simple 
traffic tickets, minor criminal offenses, and small civil matters are heard. 
More serious criminal and civil cases are handled by the Superior Court 
for each county. All Superior Court judges are appointed by the Governor 
with the advice and consent of a majority of the membership of the State 
Senate. Each judge serves an initial seven-year term, after which he or 
she can be reappointed to serve until age 70. New Jersey's judiciary is 
unusual in that it still has separate courts of law and equity, like its 
neighbor Delaware but unlike most other U.S. states. The New Jersey Superior 
Court is divided into Law and Chancery Divisions at the trial level; the 
Law Division hears both criminal cases and civil lawsuits where the plaintiff's 
primary remedy is damages, while the Chancery Division hears family cases, 
civil suits where the plaintiff's primary remedy is equitable relief, and 
probate trials. The Superior Court also has an Appellate Division, which 
functions as the state's intermediate appellate court. Superior Court judges 
are assigned to the Appellate Division by the Chief Justice. There is also 
a Tax Court, which is a court of limited jurisdiction. Tax Court judges 
hear appeals of tax decisions made by County Boards of Taxation. They also 
hear appeals on decisions made by the Director of the Division of Taxation 
on such matters as state income, sales and business taxes, and homestead 
rebates. Appeals from Tax Court decisions are heard in the Appellate Division 
of Superior Court. Tax Court judges are appointed by the Governor for initial 
terms of seven years, and upon reappointment are granted tenure until they 
reach the mandatory retirement age of 70. There are 12 Tax Court judgeships. 
New Jersey is divided into 21 counties; 13 date from the colonial era. 
New Jersey was completely divided into counties by 1692; the present counties 
were created by dividing the existing ones; most recently Union County 
in 1857. New Jersey is the only state in the nation where elected county 
officials are called "Freeholders," governing each county as part of its 
own Board of Chosen Freeholders. The number of freeholders in each county 
is determined by referendum, and must consist of three, five, seven or 
nine members. Depending on the county, the executive and legislative functions 
may be performed by the Board of Chosen Freeholders or split into separate 
branches of government. In 16 counties, members of the Board of Chosen 
Freeholders perform both legislative and executive functions on a commission 
basis, with each Freeholder assigned responsibility for a department or 
group of departments. In the other 5 counties (Atlantic, Bergen, Essex, 
Hudson and Mercer), there is a directly elected County Executive who performs 
the executive functions while the Board of Chosen Freeholders retains a 
legislative and oversight role. In counties without an Executive, a County 
Administrator (or County Manager) may be hired to perform day-to-day administration 
of county functions. New Jersey currently has 565 municipalities; the number 
was 566 before Princeton Township and Princeton Borough merged to form 
the municipality of Princeton on January 1, 2013. Unlike other states, 
all New Jersey land is part of a municipality. In 2008, Governor Jon Corzine 
proposed cutting state aid to all towns under 10,000 people, to encourage 
mergers to reduce administrative costs.[151] In May 2009, the Local Unit 
Alignment Reorganization and Consolidation Commission began a study of 
about 40 small communities in South Jersey to decide which ones might be 
good candidates for consolidation.[152] Starting in the 20th century, largely 
driven by reform-minded goals, a series of six modern forms of government 
was implemented. This began with the Walsh Act, enacted in 1911 by the 
New Jersey Legislature, which provided for a three- or five-member commission 
elected on a non-partisan basis. This was followed by the 1923 Municipal 
Manager Law, which offered a non-partisan council, provided for a weak 
mayor elected by and from the members of the council, and introduced a 
Council-manager government structure with an appointed manager responsible 
for day-to-day administration of municipal affairs. The Faulkner Act, originally 
enacted in 1950 and substantially amended in 1981, offers four basic plans: 
Mayor-Council, Council-Manager, Small Municipality, and Mayor-Council-Administrator. 
The act provides many choices for communities with a preference for a strong 
executive and professional management of municipal affairs and offers great 
flexibility in allowing municipalities to select the characteristics of 
its government: the number of seats on the Council; seats selected at-large, 
by wards, or through a combination of both; staggered or concurrent terms 
of office; and a mayor chosen by the Council or elected directly by voters. 
Most large municipalities and a majority of New Jersey's residents are 
governed by municipalities with Faulkner Act charters. Municipalities can 
also formulate their own unique form of government and operate under a 
Special Charter with the approval of the New Jersey Legislature.[citation 
needed] While municipalities retain their names derived from types of government, 
they may have changed to one of the modern forms of government, or further 
in the past to one of the other traditional forms, leading to municipalities 
with formal names quite baffling to the general public. For example, though 
there are four municipalities that are officially of the village type, 
Loch Arbour is the only one remaining with the village form of government. 
The other three villages – Ridgefield Park (now with a Walsh Act form), 
Ridgewood (now with a Faulkner Act Council-Manager charter) and South Orange 
(now operates under a Special Charter) – have all migrated to other non-village 
forms.[citation needed] Socially, New Jersey is considered one of the more 
liberal states in the nation. Polls indicate that 60% of the population 
are self-described as pro-choice, although a majority are opposed to late 
trimester and intact dilation and extraction and public funding of abortion.[153][154] 
In a 2009 Quinnipiac University Polling Institute poll, a plurality supported 
same-sex marriage 49% to 43% opposed,[155] while the proportion supporting 
gay marriage continued to increase thereafter. On October 18, 2013, the 
New Jersey Supreme Court rendered a provisional, unanimous (7-0 vote) order 
authorizing same-sex marriage in the state, pending a legal appeal by Governor 
Chris Christie,[156] who then withdrew this appeal hours after the inaugural 
same-sex marriages took place on October 21, 2013.[74] New Jersey also 
has some of the most stringent gun control laws in the U.S. These include 
bans on assault firearms, hollow-nose bullets and even slingshots. No gun 
offense in New Jersey is graded less than a felony. BB guns and black-powder 
guns are all treated as modern firearms. New Jersey does not recognize 
out-of-state gun licenses and aggressively enforces its own gun laws.[157] 
In past elections, New Jersey was a Republican bastion, but recently has 
become a Democratic stronghold. Currently, New Jersey Democrats have majority 
control of both houses of the New Jersey Legislature (Senate, 24–16, and 
Assembly, 47–33), a 6-6 split of the state's twelve seats in the U.S. House 
of Representatives, and both U.S. Senate seats. Although the Democratic 
Party is very successful statewide, the state had a Republican governor 
from 1994 to 2002, as Christie Todd Whitman won twice with 47% and 49% 
of the votes, and in the 2009 gubernatorial election, Republican Chris 
Christie defeated incumbent Democrat Jon Corzine with 48%. In the 2013 
gubernatorial election, Christie won reelection with over 60% of the votes. 
Because each candidate for lieutenant governor runs on the same ticket 
as the party's candidate for governor, the current Governor and Lieutenant 
Governor are members of the Republican Party. The governor's appointments 
to cabinet and non-cabinet positions may be from either party; for instance, 
the Attorney General is a Democrat. In federal elections, the state leans 
heavily towards the Democratic Party. For many years in the past, however, 
it was a Republican stronghold, having given comfortable margins of victory 
to the Republican candidate in the close elections of 1948, 1968, and 1976. 
New Jersey was a crucial swing state in the elections of 1960, 1968, and 
1992. The last elected Republican to hold a Senate seat from New Jersey 
was Clifford P. Case in 1979. Newark Mayor Cory Booker was elected in October 
2013 to join Robert Menendez to make New Jersey the first state with concurrent 
serving black and Latino U.S. senators.[159] The state's Democratic strongholds 
include Camden County, Essex County (including Newark, the state's largest 
city), Hudson County (including Jersey City, the state's second-largest 
city); Mercer County (especially around Trenton and Princeton), Middlesex 
County, and Union County (including Elizabeth, the state's fourth-largest 
city). The suburban northwestern and southeastern counties of the state 
are reliably Republican: Republicans have support along the coast in Ocean 
County and in the mountainous northwestern part of the state, especially 
Morris County, Sussex County, and Warren County. Other suburban counties, 
especially Bergen County and Burlington County had the majority of votes 
go to the Democratic Party. In the 2008 election, President Barack Obama 
won New Jersey with approximately fifty-seven percent of the vote, compared 
to McCain's forty-one percent. Independent candidate Ralph Nader garnered 
less than one percent of the vote. About one-third of the state's counties 
are considered "swing" counties, but some go more one way than others. 
For example, Salem County, the same is true with Passaic County, with a 
highly populated Hispanic Democratic south (including Paterson, the state's 
third-largest city) and a rural, Republican north. Other "swing" counties 
like Monmouth County, Somerset County, and Cape May County tend to go Republican, 
as they also have population in conservative areas. To be eligible to vote 
in a U.S. election, all New Jerseyans are required to start their residency 
in the state 30 days prior to an election and register 29 days prior. On 
December 17, 2007, Governor Jon Corzine signed into law a bill that would 
eliminate the death penalty in New Jersey. New Jersey is the first state 
to pass such legislation since Iowa and West Virginia eliminated executions 
in 1965.[160] Corzine also signed a bill that would downgrade the Death 
Row prisoners' sentences from "Death" to "Life in Prison with No Parole."[161] 
New Jersey has many museums of all kinds. A few major museums in the state 
are listed. Visitors and residents take advantage of and contribute to 
performances at the numerous music, theater, and dance companies and venues 
located throughout the state, including: New Jersey currently has four 
teams from major professional sports leagues playing in the state, although 
the Major League Soccer team and two National Football League teams identify 
themselves as being from New York. The National Hockey League's New Jersey 
Devils, based in Newark at the Prudential Center, is the only major league 
franchise to bear the state's name. The Metropolitan Area's two National 
Football League teams, the New York Giants and the New York Jets, both 
play in East Rutherford, Bergen County, at MetLife Stadium.[165] Completed 
at a cost of approximately $1.6 billion[166] it is the most expensive stadium 
ever built.[164] On February 2, 2014, MetLife Stadium hosted Super Bowl 
XLVIII, the first Super Bowl played outdoors in a cold-weather city. The 
New York Red Bulls of Major League Soccer play in Red Bull Arena, a soccer-specific 
stadium located in Harrison outside of downtown Newark. The sports complex 
is also home to the Meadowlands Racetrack, one of three major harness racing 
tracks in the state. The Meadowlands Racetrack along with Freehold Raceway 
in Freehold are two of the major harness racing tracks in North America. 
Monmouth Park Racetrack in Oceanport is also a popular spot for thoroughbred 
racing in New Jersey and the northeast. It hosted the Breeders' Cup in 
2007, and its turf course was renovated in preparation. Additionally, New 
Jersey is home to two MLB affiliated Minor League Baseball teams: the Trenton 
Thunder (New York Yankees affiliate) and the Lakewood BlueClaws (Philadelphia 
Phillies affiliate). The following table shows the major league sports 
teams in the state: New Jerseyans' collegiate allegiances are predominantly 
split among the four major NCAA Division I programs in the state – the 
Rutgers University Scarlet Knights, the NJIT Highlanders, the Seton Hall 
University Pirates, and the Princeton University Tigers. Rutgers joined 
the Big Ten Conference in 2014. Rutgers and Princeton have an intense rivalry – 
stemming from the first intercollegiate football game in 1869 – though 
the two schools have not met on the football field since 1980. They continue 
to play each other annually in other sports. Rutgers, which fields 24 teams 
in various sports, is nationally known for its excellent football and women's 
basketball programs.[citation needed] The university is planning an expansion 
to Rutgers Stadium, and the teams play in Piscataway, which is adjacent 
to the New Brunswick campus. The university also fields rising basketball 
and baseball programs.[citation needed] Rutgers' fan base is mostly derived 
from the western parts of the state and Middlesex County,[citation needed] 
and its alumni base is the largest in the state. Seton Hall's basketball 
team has been one of the most storied programs in the Big East,[citation 
needed] and it plays its home games at the Prudential Center in Newark. 
The Pirates have support in the predominantly Roman Catholic areas of the 
northern part of the state and the Jersey Shore.[citation needed] New Jersey 
high schools are divided into divisions under the New Jersey State Interscholastic 
Athletic Association.(NJSIAA) [167]'[168] Founded in 1918, the NJSIAA currently 
represents 22,000 schools, 330,000 coaches, and almost 4.5 million athletes. 
Sports are divided between 3 seasons (fall, winter, and spring). Like every 
state, New Jersey has its own cuisine, religious communities, museums, 
and halls of fame. New Jersey is the birthplace of modern inventions such 
as: FM radio, the motion picture camera, the lithium battery, the light 
bulb, transistors, and the electric train. Other New Jersey creations include: 
the drive-in movie, the cultivated blueberry, cranberry sauce, the postcard, 
the boardwalk, the zipper, the phonograph, saltwater taffy, the dirigible, 
the seedless watermelon,[169] the first use of a submarine in warfare, 
and the ice cream cone.[170] There are mineral museums in Franklin and 
Ogdensburg. Diners are common in New Jersey. The state is home to many 
diner manufacturers and has more diners than any other state: over 600. 
There are more diners in the state of New Jersey than any other place in 
the world.[171] New Jersey is the only state without a state song. I'm 
From New Jersey is incorrectly listed on many websites as being the New 
Jersey state song, but it was not even a contender when in 1996 the New 
Jersey Arts Council submitted their suggestions to the New Jersey Legislature.[172] 
New Jersey is frequently the target of jokes in American culture,[173] 
especially from New York City-based television shows, such as Saturday 
Night Live. Academic Michael Aaron Rockland attributes this to New Yorkers' 
view that New Jersey is the beginning of Middle America. The New Jersey 
Turnpike, which runs between two major East Coast cities, New York City 
and Philadelphia, is also cited as a reason, as people who traverse through 
the state may only see its industrial zones.[174] Reality television shows 
like Jersey Shore and The Real Housewives of New Jersey have reinforced 
stereotypical views of New Jersey culture,[175] but Rockland cited The 
Sopranos and the music of Bruce Springsteen as exporting a more positive 
image.[174] New Jersey is known for several foods developed within the 
region, including pork roll (or Taylor ham), cheesesteaks, and scrapple. 
Credit for the development of submarine sandwiches is claimed by several 
states with substantial Italian American populations, including New Jersey.[176] 
New Jersey has long been an important area for both rock and rap music.
