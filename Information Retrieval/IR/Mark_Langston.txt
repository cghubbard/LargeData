Mark Edward Langston (born August 20, 1960) is an American former Major 
League Baseball left-handed pitcher. He pitched for the Seattle Mariners 
(1984–1989), Montreal Expos (1989), California and Anaheim Angels (1990–1997), 
San Diego Padres (1998), and Cleveland Indians (1999). During a 16-year 
baseball career, Langston compiled 179 wins, 2,464 strikeouts, and a 3.97 
earned run average. Langston pitched collegiately at San Jose State and 
was drafted by Seattle Mariners in the second round. Langston began his 
career with the Seattle Mariners, debuting in 1984 with fellow rookie Alvin 
Davis. Davis' performance won him the American League Rookie of the Year 
award, but Langston's performance was voted worthy of the Rookie Pitcher 
of the Year award, as he finished the year with a league leading 204 strikeouts. 
In 1989, Langston was involved in the trade which sent him to Montreal 
and Randy Johnson to the Mariners. In 1990, he pitched the first seven 
innings for a 2–0 combined no-hitter with Mike Witt. Witt, who had pitched 
a perfect game back in 1984, tossed the final two frames. This combined 
no-hitter remained the last one in Angels history until Ervin Santana pitched 
a no-hitter on July 27, 2011.[1] In the 1998 World Series, Langston's 2–2 
pitch to Tino Martinez appeared to be over the plate, but was called ball 
3;[2] Langston's next pitch was hit for a grand slam in the seventh inning 
of Game 1 to give the New York Yankees a 9–5 lead. The Yankees went on 
to sweep the San Diego Padres in four games. Noted for his pickoff move 
to first base, his 91 career pickoffs were, at the time of his retirement, 
the most in baseball history. Today, he has the fourth-most pickoffs in 
baseball history, behind only Kenny Rogers, Terry Mulholland and Andy Pettitte, 
all of them also left-handed pitchers. Langston serves as a radio color 
commentator for the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim during all games and 
is also a co-host of the Angels post-game call-in show Angel Talk on radio 
station KLAA.[3] Right after retirement Langston was the head coach for 
Lutheran High School of Orange County for 2 years. He lives in the Los 
Angeles area. Langston appeared as himself in an episode of Sabrina, The 
Teenage Witch, entitled "To Tell a Mortal", where he plays catch with Harvey.[4]
