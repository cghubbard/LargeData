Oddibe McDowell (born August 25, 1962) is a former center fielder in Major 
League Baseball who played from 1985 to 1994 for the Texas Rangers, Cleveland 
Indians and Atlanta Braves. McDowell was the first player to hit for the 
cycle for the Rangers, doing so on July 23, 1985 in a Rangers' 8-4 victory 
over the Indians at Arlington Stadium. Mark Teixeira, Gary Matthews, Jr., 
Ian Kinsler, Bengie Molina, Adrián Beltré, Alex Ríos, and Shin-Soo Choo 
are the other Rangers players to hit for the cycle. His first name is pronounced 
"owed a bee" or "oh-ta-bee." Because it also sounds vaguely like a slurred 
rendition of "oh to be", ESPN personality and announcer Chris Berman dubbed 
him Oddibe "Young Again" McDowell.[1] He won the prestigious Golden Spikes 
Award, which is given annually to the best amateur baseball player, in 
1984 while playing at Arizona State University. He wore uniform number 
0 at ASU, and ASU has retired his number. McDowell also finished 4th in 
the American League Rookie of the Year voting for 1985. He was a member 
of the 1984 United States Olympic Team. McDowell stood out during his first 
stint with the Texas Rangers by wearing the very unusual uniform number 
0. He wore the number 20 with the Indians, the number 1 with the Braves, 
and during his second time with the Rangers, he wore number 8.[2] Through 
June 16, 2009, McDowell was tied for second of all Rangers players ever 
in career leadoff home runs, one behind the 9 by Ian Kinsler.[3] Today, 
Oddibe is the Head Coach for the McArthur High School Varsity Baseball
