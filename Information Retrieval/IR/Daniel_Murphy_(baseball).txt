Daniel Thomas Murphy (born April 1, 1985)[1] is an American professional 
baseball second baseman for the Washington Nationals of Major League Baseball 
(MLB). He has previously played for the New York Mets. While primarily 
a second baseman, he has also played first base, third base, and left field. 
Murphy was an MLB All-Star in 2014 and 2016. En route to leading the New 
York Mets to their fifth World Series appearance in franchise history, 
he won the 2015 NLCS MVP award and set a record for consecutive postseason 
games with a home run with six. Daniel Murphy was born in Jacksonville, 
Florida, to Tom and Sharon Murphy. Murphy has a younger brother, Jonathan, 
and a sister, Tricia.[2] Murphy began playing baseball at the age of five 
years and played his high school ball at Englewood High School in Jacksonville. 
Jacksonville University was the only four-year school to offer Murphy a 
scholarship.[3] Murphy attended Jacksonville University, where he played 
college baseball for the Dolphins under head coach Terry Alexander. In 
college, he was regarded as a strong hitter but below average fielder – 
as a freshman, when asked to introduce himself and name what position he 
played (implying his defensive position), Murphy instead gave his preferred 
position in the batting order: "I’m Daniel Murphy from Jacksonville and 
I hit third."[4] He mostly played third base but was also slotted into 
right field to minimize the defensive liability. As a junior in 2006, Murphy 
posted a .398 batting average en route to being named the A-Sun Baseball 
Player of the Year.[3] The Mets selected Murphy out of Jacksonville in 
the 13th round (394th overall) of the 2006 Major League Baseball draft.[1] 
The first two months of Murphy's professional career were spent rehabilitating 
a knee injury he suffered late in his college career.[3] He spent the entire 
2007 season with the High-A St. Lucie Mets of the Florida State League.[5] 
During home games, Murphy's walk up music included "I'm Shipping Up to 
Boston" by Dropkick Murphys, "What I've Done" by Linkin Park, and "The 
Drop (Intro)" by Lecrae. Murphy is known as being a hard worker, as Mets 
manager Terry Collins has noted on many occasions.[6] Murphy began the 
season with the Double-A Binghamton Mets.[5] On August 2, a day after being 
promoted to the Triple-A New Orleans Zephyrs, the Mets left-handed reserve 
outfielder Marlon Anderson was placed on the disabled list, so Murphy was 
called up to the majors.[7] In his first major league at bat, against three-time 
All-Star Roy Oswalt, Murphy hit a single. Later in the same game, he made 
a difficult catch against the left field wall, throwing out Hunter Pence 
at second base for a double play to end the inning.[8] As of August 9, 
2008, Murphy was only the fifth Mets rookie to record 10 hits in his first 
20 at bats. Murphy hit his first home run in the bottom of the sixth inning 
against the Florida Marlins at Shea Stadium on August 9. He finished the 
season batting .313, with two home runs and 17 RBI. Although he is a natural 
third baseman, Murphy began to play left field in 2008, and continued in 
2009, due to the presence of David Wright on the Mets.[7] Murphy had a 
hard time transitioning to left field. In May, Carlos Delgado underwent 
hip surgery and Murphy moved to first base.[9] Murphy led the Mets in home 
runs, with 12. This tied 1977 as the season with the fewest home runs to 
lead a Mets team in franchise history.[10] On March 30, 2010, Murphy hurt 
his knee in a spring training game against the St. Louis Cardinals in a 
rundown between third base and home plate.[11] On June 2, while playing 
second base for the Buffalo Bisons, the Mets' Triple-A affiliate, he suffered 
a "high-grade" MCL tear while trying to turn a double play. Although surgery 
was not needed, he was expected to miss 4–6 months.[12] Murphy suffered 
a season-ending injury to his MCL on August 7, 2011 after a collision with 
the Atlanta Braves' José Constanza.[13] At the time of his season ending 
injury, Murphy had the 3rd highest batting average in the National League. 
However, Murphy did not have enough at bats to qualify as a league leader 
at the end of the 2011 season. Murphy started off the 2012 season as the 
Mets' starting second baseman after recovering from his MCL injury from 
2011. On April 9, he hit a walk-off single against the Nationals to give 
the Mets a 4–3 victory and their first 4–0 start since 2007. After going 
352 at bats since his last home run on July 16, 2011, Murphy hit two against 
the Cubs on June 27.[14] Murphy was named as the Mets nominee for the 2012 
MLBPAA Heart & Hustle Award which was ultimately won by Mike Trout of the 
Angels.[15] Murphy had a strained muscle on his right side during spring 
training. He returned to training on February 20, said he didn’t have a 
timetable for his return to regular workouts.[16] For the period ending 
September 1, Murphy was named the National League Player of the Week after 
accumulating five doubles, seven runs and thirteen hits.[17] Murphy had 
a strong 2013, establishing himself as one of the best offensive 2nd basemen 
in the league. Murphy played in 161 games and batted .286. Murphy finished 
2nd in the National League with 188 hits. Murphy also contributed 13 home 
runs and 78 RBIs. Murphy led the National League in stolen base success 
rate, swiping 23/26 bases, an 88.4 percent success rate. Following the 
season, he was again nominated for the MLBPAA Heart & Hustle Award, this 
time losing out to Boston Red Sox second baseman Dustin Pedroia.[15] Murphy 
was named to his first Major League Baseball All-Star Game in 2014 as the 
backup to starter Chase Utley.[18] His roster position was announced on 
July 6, at which time he had 105 hits (second in the National League) and 
a .295 batting average. In 2015, after an injury to David Wright, Murphy 
was moved to third base on June 4.[19] He spent the regular season splitting 
his time between first base, second base and third base. Murphy hit the 
225th and 226th doubles of his career in a game against the Atlanta Braves 
on September 22, giving him the second most doubles in Mets franchise history, 
ahead of Ed Kranepool and behind David Wright.[20] In the deciding fifth 
game of the 2015 National League Division Series (NLDS) against the Los 
Angeles Dodgers, Murphy had three hits, including the game-winning home 
run in the sixth inning, to lead the Mets to a 3-2 win.[21] For the entire 
NLDS, Murphy had five RBI and seven hits in 21 at bats, three of them being 
home runs and one of them being a double, giving him a 1.143 OPS.[22] Over 
the course of the NLDS and 2015 National League Championship Series (NLCS), 
Murphy became the first person in major league history to hit a home run 
in six consecutive postseason games, beating a record set by Carlos Beltrán, 
and became the second person, after Lou Gehrig, to have a hit, a run and 
an RBI in seven consecutive postseason games. He also broke a Mets franchise 
record for most home runs in the postseason, previously held by Mike Piazza.[23] 
He hit .529 with four home runs, a double and six RBI and was named the 
2015 NLCS MVP.[24] During the eighth inning of game 4 of the 2015 World 
Series against the Kansas City Royals, Murphy made a key fielding error 
which increased Kansas City's chances of winning the game by 32%. The Royals 
went on to win 5-3.[25] Murphy tallied two errors and only three hits in 
his 20 at bats as the Mets lost the five-game series.[26] During the offseason, 
the Mets offered Murphy a one-year, $15.8 million qualifying offer. On 
November 13, 2015, Murphy rejected the offer, thus becoming a free agent. 
This ensured the Mets a compensational draft pick if he signed with another 
team.[27] On December 24, 2015, Murphy agreed to a three-year, $37.5 million 
contract with the Washington Nationals.[28] The New York Mets gained a 
draft pick from the Nationals, since Murphy turned down New York's one-year, 
$15.8 million qualifying offer. The Mets will get a compensation pick between 
the first and second rounds.[29] On May 2, 2016, Murphy recorded his 1,000th 
career hit in a game against the Kansas City Royals.[30] On June 5, 2016, 
Murphy was selected to his second all star game. He was nearly voted a 
starter by fans, losing to the Cubs' Ben Zobrist by just 88 votes. In 142 
games, Murphy finished the year with a .347 batting average, 25 home runs, 
and 104 RBI. He also led the NL in doubles (47), slugging percentage (.595), 
and OPS (.985). Daniel's younger brother, Jonathan, also played college 
baseball at Jacksonville University as an outfielder and was selected in 
the 19th round (580th overall) of the 2012 Major League Baseball draft 
by the Minnesota Twins.[31] In August 2014, the Twins organization released 
Jonathan from the Cedar Rapids Kernels.[32] In 2011, Murphy appeared with 
fellow Major Leaguers Shane Victorino and Clay Buchholz on a special Veterans 
Day episode of the ABC series Extreme Makeover: Home Edition.[33] Murphy 
wed his longtime girlfriend, Victoria "Tori" Ahern, on December 1, 2012 
in Florida.[34] Murphy's wife Victoria gave birth to a son, Noah, on March 
31, 2014.[35] On December 4, 2015, Victoria gave birth to their second 
child, a daughter, Quinn.[36] When Daniel Murphy took a three-day leave 
of absence from the team to attend the birth of his child, something guaranteed 
by the MLB collective bargaining agreement, he received heavy criticism 
from New York City radio commentators Boomer Esiason and Craig Carton on 
their show for doing so. While they were roundly criticized themselves 
for their comments—including a statement by Mets manager Terry Collins 
where he told them to "look in the mirror"—Murphy himself only said he 
was aware of the comments.[37][38] On June 9, 2014, Murphy was invited 
to speak at the Working Families Summit at the White House.[18][39] In 
March 2015, Major League Ambassador for Inclusion Billy Bean visited the 
Mets spring training clubhouse. Murphy made controversial comments,[40][41] 
when he remarked on Bean, who is gay, "I do disagree with the fact that 
Billy is a homosexual. That doesn’t mean I can’t still invest in him and 
get to know him" and "you can still accept them but I do disagree with 
the lifestyle, 100%."[42] The next day Bean responded in an article on 
MLB.com, "I appreciate that Daniel spoke his truth. I really do. I was 
visiting his team, and a reporter asked his opinion about me. He was brave 
to share his feelings, and it made me want to work harder and be a better 
example that someday might allow him to view things from my perspective, 
if only for just a moment."[43] Murphy announced the same day he would 
no longer talk to the media about his religious beliefs, and said he would
