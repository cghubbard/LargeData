Hensley Filemon Acasio "Bam Bam" Meulens (Papiamento pronunciation: [ˈhɛnsli 
ˈmʏiləns]; born June 23, 1967) is a retired Dutch professional baseball 
player and current hitting coach for the San Francisco Giants. A native 
of Curaçao, he played from 1989 to 2000 in Major League Baseball, Nippon 
Professional Baseball, and the Korea Baseball Organization. He was the 
first Curaçaoan to play in both Major League Baseball and the Dominican 
Professional Baseball League[1] He speaks five languages: English, Spanish, 
Dutch, Papiamento and Japanese.[2] Hitting home runs left-handed while 
playing softball as a teenager earned Meulens the nickname "Bam Bam" when 
his friends compared his power to the Flintstones cartoon character.[3] 
Over the course of his career, Meulens would become the first to play for 
all four of the major Caribbean winter leagues.[4] Hensley Meulens was 
signed by the Yankees as an undrafted free agent in 1985. After struggling 
in his first professional season in 1986 with the Gulf Coast Yankees, Meulens 
made a splash in 1987 with Single-A Prince William, hitting .300 with 28 
HR and 103 RBI, also being named to the Carolina League All-Star team. 
His hitting cooled somewhat in 1988 & 1989 as he split time between the 
Double-A Albany-Colonie Yankees of the Eastern League and the Triple-A 
Columbus Clippers of the International League. His bat rebounded in 1990 
for Columbus as he helped lead the team to the 1990 International League 
championships (where they ultimately lost to Rochester), hitting .285 with 
26 HR and 96 RBI, and was named the 1990 International League MVP. Meulens' 
impressive 1990 season earned him a spot on the Yankees roster in 1991,[5] 
but he was back in Columbus in 1992 to help lead the Clippers to the Governors' 
Cup Championship. 1993 was a frustrating year for Meulens, at the end of 
which the Yankees sold his contract to the Chiba Lotte Marines of Nippon 
Professional Baseball. He made his Major League debut with the New York 
Yankees August 23, 1989. While having great success hitting minor league 
pitching, Meulens never attained a permanent spot on the New York lineup, 
despite spending the entire 1991 season on the Yankees roster. Averaging 
a strike-out every three at bats, Meulens platooned in left field with 
the more consistent hitting Mel Hall. He saw limited action with the Yankees 
in late-season call-ups in 1992 and 1993. In November 1993, the Yankees 
sold Meulens' contract to the Chiba Lotte Marines of Nippon Professional 
Baseball,[6] where he spent the 1994 season, hitting 23 home runs and driving 
in 69 runs while accumulating 135 strikeouts. The following season, Meulens 
signed with the Yakult Swallows, helping lead the Swallows to the 1995 
Japan Series Championship. He returned to North America in 1997, and after 
an unsuccessful tryout with the Atlanta Braves,[7][8] he reached the Majors 
again briefly playing with the Montreal Expos (while having a good season 
for the Expos' AAA affiliate Ottawa Lynx) and Arizona Diamondbacks. Unable 
to secure a contract with a major league team in 1999, Meulens signed with 
the Newark Bears of the independent Atlantic League.[9] He made one last 
stop in Asia, playing 14 games with the SK Wyverns of the Korea Baseball 
Organization and batting only .196, before heading his professional playing 
career to the Mexican League with the Saraperos de Saltillo in 2001 and 
finally retiring, in 2002, after a mid-season injury while playing with 
the Pericos de Puebla. Meulens represented the Netherlands at the 2000 
Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia. His 4th-inning double gave the Cuban 
team their first Olympic loss in 21 games.[10] Ultimately, the Netherlands 
took fifth place in the final standings. He returned to the team as a coach 
for the 2004 Summer Olympics and the 2009 World Baseball Classic. Meulens 
was named to serve as manager for the team during the 2013 World Baseball 
Classic.[11] Meulens also played for the Dutch team in the 2001 Baseball 
World Cup in Taichung, Taiwan and 2002 Intercontinental Cup in Havana, 
Cuba. Meulens began his coaching career with the Bluefield Orioles for 
the 2003 and 2004 seasons. From 2005-2008, he was the hitting coach of 
the Indianapolis Indians, the Triple-A affiliate of the Pittsburgh Pirates,[12][13] 
also coaching in the Arizona Fall League for the Peoria Saguaros in 2005 
and the Hawaii Winter Baseball league for the Honolulu Sharks in the 2006 
off-season. In 2009, Meulens served as hitting coach for the Fresno Grizzlies, 
the AAA affiliate of the San Francisco Giants of the Pacific Coast League.[14] 
Meulens reached the Major League ranks as batting coach in 2010, serving 
as hitting coach for the San Francisco Giants following the firing of previous 
hitting coach Carney Lansford.[15] He helped the Giants win a World Series 
in three of his first five years. Hensley Meulens also runs the Dutch Antilles 
Baseball Academy in Curaçao.[16] He is reportedly interested in starting 
a baseball league in Curaçao in association with Major League Baseball's 
RBI Program. Meulens is married to Gyselle Meulens Petronia and has four 
daughters, 2 from a previous marriage—Michelle MarIise Aimee Meulens-Ebecilio 
(1989), Danielle Marie Antonia Meulens-Ebecilio (1992), Mia Valentina Turya 
(Feb. 29, 2012) and Evangelina Cristina Vuri (Jan. 14, 2014). In addition 
to the two daughters he has with his wife, Gyselle, he also has a son, 
Elijah Gabriel Ludwig (April 14, 2010). On April 27, 2012, Meulens was 
awarded with the Order of Orange-Nassau by Queen Beatrix, which is a chivalry 
order of the Netherlands that is the equivalent of knighthood. He is one 
of four baseball players awarded the title, along with Calvin Maduro, Eugene 
Kingsale, and Sidney Ponson. Brandon Belt, one of the players that Meulens 
coaches on the Giants, says he prefers to call the newly knighted coach
