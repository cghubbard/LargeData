Michael Seth Maness (/ˈmeɪnɛs/ MAY-ness;[1] born October 14, 1988) is an 
American professional baseball pitcher for the St. Louis Cardinals of Major 
League Baseball. Maness was born in Pinehurst, North Carolina. The son 
of Michael Maness and Jan Andrews Benton, he has two siblings—Bailey and 
Tanner.[2] He attended Pinecrest High School in Southern Pines, North Carolina, 
where he played for the school's baseball team.[3] As a sophomore he earned 
first team All-State and conference Player of the Year honors.[2] His father 
served as one of his coaches.[4] Following high school, Maness enrolled 
at East Carolina University, majoring in accounting.[2] He played college 
baseball for the East Carolina Pirates. Initially a middle infielder, Maness 
was converted to a pitcher when one of the team's starting pitchers went 
down with an injury.[4] Before the 2009 season, Maness was named a preseason 
All-American.[5] On May 3, 2010, he was named Conference USA's pitcher 
of the week,[6][7] and after the season, he was named the conference's 
pitcher of the year.[8] The Florida Marlins drafted Maness in the 41st 
round of the 2010 MLB draft, but he did not sign. The St. Louis Cardinals 
selected Maness in the 11th round of the 2011 MLB draft, and Maness signed 
with the Cardinals.[9] Maness started his professional career with the 
Batavia Muckdogs of the Class A-Short Season New York–Penn League. After 
appearing in the All-Star Game, the Cardinals promoted him to the Palm 
Beach Cardinals of the Class A-Advanced Florida State League. He finished 
the season with the Quad Cities River Bandits of the Class A Midwest League.[9] 
Maness is noted for his control: in 169 2/3 innings pitched in 2012, he 
allowed only ten walks.[10] Maness was named to the Texas League postseason 
All-Star team in 2012.[11] On November 30, 2012 Maness was named the Cardinals' 
Minor League Pitcher of the Year. His efforts on the mound helped Double 
A Springfield as they were named Minor League Team of the Year by Baseball 
America.[12] On April 29, 2013, Maness was called up to the major leagues 
due to the Cardinals' struggling bullpen.[13] Maness made his MLB debut 
on May 3. He pitched one inning in his debut, against the Milwaukee Brewers 
at Miller Park in the eighth inning, giving up no hits, and getting three 
consecutive groundouts (the third out hit to him) for his debut, following 
the seventh inning debut of Carlos Martinez who was brought up earlier 
that day.[14] On May 15, 2013 he became the first Cardinal rookie pitcher 
since 1900 with three relief wins in his first five major league appearances.[15] 
In 66 games with St. Louis, Maness went 5–2 with 15 holds, 1 save and a 
2.32 ERA, striking out 35 in 62 innings. He led the team in ERA. Maness 
pitched five effective innings in the Cardinals postseason run, posting 
an earned run average of 1.80. The one earned run he surrendered was a 
three-run home run to Jonny Gomes in Game 4 of the 2013 World Series.[16][17] 
The Cardinals would not lead in a World Series game after this home run, 
falling in six games. An arbitration-eligible player prior to the 2016 
season, Maness and the Cardinals agreed to a one-year, $1.4 million contract 
on January 15, 2016.[18] After yielding a 6.39 ERA for the season, and 
his velocity on all four pitches down 2-3 mph, he landed on the DL for 
the first time in his career on May 14, after an exam revealed an inflammation 
on his right (pitching) elbow. He was having pitching difficulties, getting 
hit hard in his previous 1⁄3 inning work against the Anaheim Angels on 
May 12. For the season, he has a 6.39 ERA and 1.97 WHIP in 12 2⁄3 innings. 
He will eventually be able to join a Minor League affiliate on a rehab 
assignment, instead of as a member of that club's roster. That rehab assignment 
can last up to 30 days.[19] On August 16th, Maness was placed on the disabled 
list with an elbow strain. It was later revealed that Maness would need 
to undergo Tommy John surgery, effectively ending his 2016 season and likely 
for most of the 2017 season.[20] After a medical review of his injury, 
Maness had surgery on August 18, to fix his Ulnar collateral ligament of 
elbow joint instead of Tommy John surgery ligament replacement, drastically 
reducing his recovery time from 12-15 months to 6-8 months, which would
