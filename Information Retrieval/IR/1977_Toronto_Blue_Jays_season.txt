The 1977 Toronto Blue Jays season was the first year of Major League Baseball 
played by the Toronto-based expansion franchise. The Blue Jays finished 
seventh in the American League East with a record of 54 wins and 107 losses, 
45½ games behind the World Champion New York Yankees. The Blue Jays spring 
training was held in Dunedin, Florida. In their first pre-season game on 
March 11, the Jays beat the New York Mets by a score of 3–1. The first 
two times that they played the Montreal Expos, the Jays were triumphant 
as well. Perhaps the highlight of spring training was a match against the 
Cincinnati Reds. The Blue Jays defeated the defending World Series champions 
as the Reds were missing only one regular starter from their lineup.[10] 
After spring training, the Blue Jays 25-man roster was set. Ron Fairly, 
who had previously played for the Montreal Expos, was one of the most recognizable 
players on the nascent team. The only marquee name was Bill Singer. Pat 
Gillick had a deal with the New York Yankees to trade Singer for a promising, 
young left-hander named Ron Guidry.[10] Blue Jays president Peter Bavasi 
vetoed the deal as Singer was part of his plan to market and promote the 
team.[10] On April 7, 1977, 44,649 fans were in attendance to watch the 
first game in Toronto Blue Jays franchise history as the squad played the 
Chicago White Sox.[11] Notables in attendance that day included Paul Godfrey, 
Toronto mayor David Crombie, legendary broadcaster Foster Hewitt, and country 
singer Anne Murray.[12] Besides the snow that adorned the field, there 
were hundreds of fans who missed the first pitch due to many traffic jams 
that day. The umpires for the game included crew chief Nestor Chylak, Joe 
Brinkman, Rich Garcia, and 27-year-old Steve Palermo, who was making his 
major league debut.[13] The game was broadcast on the CBC with Tom McKee 
(host), Don Chevrier (play by play) and New York Yankee legend Whitey Ford 
providing the commentary. McKee was the first ever face, and voice, to 
appear on the inaugural Blue Jays telecast. The Blue Jays would only appear 
on the CBC sixteen times that first season.[12] As the snow was squeegeed 
off the field (via Zamboni loaned to them by the Toronto Maple Leafs), 
the 48th Highlanders marched onto the field to perform the Star Spangled 
Banner. Canadian country music star Murray arrived to sing O Canada while 
wearing a red parka.[13] The fans chanted "We want beer", because Toronto's 
Exhibition Stadium was the only stadium in the major leagues to not serve 
beer.[14] Bill Singer took to the mound and threw the first pitch in Toronto 
Blue Jays history against Ralph Garr of the White Sox. The pitch was a 
high fastball called for a strike.[14] From an 0–2 count, Garr battled 
back to get the count to 3–2, then drew a walk. Afterwards, Garr stole 
second base, and advanced to third base when Blue Jays catcher Rick Cerone's 
throw went into center field.[14] The next batter was shortstop Alan Bannister 
who hit a fly ball for the first out of the game. Jorge Orta batted third 
and he hit a sacrifice fly which scored Garr, the first run at Exhibition 
Stadium.[14] Richie Zisk followed and hit the first home run in the history 
of the stadium. The score was now 2–0 in favour of the White Sox. Blue 
Jays manager Roy Hartsfield went to the mound to talk to Singer. As Hartsfield 
went to the mound, reliever Jerry Johnson started warming up in the bullpen. 
Singer was able to compose himself and he got Eric Soderholm to hit into 
a fielder's choice to end the inning.[14] John Scott was the first Blue 
Jay to take an at bat for the team. He faced White Sox pitcher Ken Brett, 
taking a strike on the first pitch thrown to him.[12] He struck out, as 
did the next Jays batter, Héctor Torres. The third Blue Jays batter into 
the game was Doug Ault, a 27 year old career minor leaguer with only nine 
games experience in the major leagues who had been the Blue Jays' sixteenth 
pick in the expansion draft.[12] On a 1–1 pitch, Ault hit the first home 
run in Blue Jays history. The score was now 2–1 in favour of Chicago. After 
the second inning it was 4–1 for Chicago.[12] In the bottom of the second, 
Gary Woods bunted for a single, stole second, scoring on a hit by Pedro 
García. In the third inning, Torres had a single and Ault was back at the 
plate. With the count 1–1, Ault hit his second home run down the right 
field line, and the game was tied at 4 runs apiece.[12] Heading into the 
fourth inning, Toronto got the lead as Dave McKay singled in García from 
second base.[15] Singer was still in the game in the top of the fifth inning, 
striking out Chet Lemon, but Brian Downing and Ralph Garr singled off him.[15] 
Hartsfield came out to the mound and pulled Singer out of the game. Singer 
left to a standing ovation as Jerry Johnson entered the game.[15] Johnson 
got the final two outs of the fifth inning. Al Woods came up to pinch hit 
for Steve Bowling in the bottom of the fifth inning.[15] With Otto Vélez 
on the basepads, Woods homered to right field.[15] The score was now 7–4 
in favour of Toronto, with the team having scored in every inning of the 
game to that point. The Sox scored a run in the sixth inning and it was 
7–5. Pete Vuckovich started the eighth inning. He struck out two batters, 
gave up a walk and a single, but got a ground ball to end the inning.[16] 
In the bottom of the inning, Ault returned to the plate and singled in 
another run to make the score 8–5. Another run was scored on a double play 
to make the score 9–5 in favour of the Blue Jays. In the top of the ninth 
inning, Vuckovich retired Jorge Orta on a ground ball. Vuckovich then struck 
out Richie Zisk. For the day, Zisk had four hits in five at bats.[16] With 
one out to go for the win, Jim Spencer hit a line drive to left field but 
Scott dropped the ball for a two-base error. Oscar Gamble was up at the 
plate and he grounded out to the shortstop.[16] The Jays won their first 
game in franchise history with Jerry Johnson picking up the win while Vuckovich 
got the first save.[16] The heroes of opening day would not have a future 
with the Jays. Jerry Johnson would end up in Hollywood working as a stuntman. 
At the 1977 Winter Meetings, Toronto traded Vuckovich to the St. Louis 
Cardinals in exchange for Tom Underwood.[16] Doug Ault was back in the 
minors in 1979.[17] April 7, Exhibition Stadium, Toronto, Ontario The Blue 
Jays would finish off their first ever homestand with a 5-2 record, sitting 
in first place in the American League East by 0.5 games, as the team took 
two of three against the Chicago White Sox and three of four from the Detroit 
Tigers. Pitcher Jerry Garvin picked up two of Toronto's five wins. The 
Blue Jays struggled on their first ever road trip, as they were swept in 
a three-game series against the Chicago White Sox, followed by a split 
in a four-game series against the New York Yankees to return home with 
a 7-7 record. On April 27, the Blue Jays were involved in their first ever 
extra innings game, as the team defeated the Cleveland Indians 6-5 in 12 
innings. The Jays would finish the month in fifth place with a 10-11 record, 
three games out of first place. Pitcher Jerry Garvin had an impressive 
4-0 record with a 2.14 ERA. Outfielder Otto Vélez hit .442 with five home 
runs and 18 RBI and was named American League Player of the Month. On May 
4, the Blue Jays scored 10 runs in a game for the first time in team history, 
as they defeated the Milwaukee Brewers 10-3 at Exhibition Stadium. The 
team would get 10 runs again five nights later on May 9 in a 10-4 win in 
their first ever game against their expansion cousins, the Seattle Mariners. 
On May 14, the Jays allowed double digits in runs for the first time in 
a 13-3 loss against the Minnesota Twins. Toronto struggled during the month 
of May, as the team would post a record of 8-17. Following a 6-5 loss to 
the Oakland Athletics on May 25, the Blue Jays fell into last place in 
the American League East for the first time. After losing their first two 
games in the month of June, the Blue Jays would win five of their next 
six games, as their only loss in that span was a 2-1 decision in 13 innings 
against the California Angels. Following that, Toronto would win only two 
of their next 14 games. On June 27, Ron Guidry of the New York Yankees 
was carrying a no-hitter into the fifth inning when he walked the bases 
loaded, then gave up a grand slam to light hitting Hector Torres, which 
saw his Blue Jays win the game 7-6. During the month, Toronto had a 10-17 
record, bringing their overall record to 28-45, seventh place in the American 
League East. The Blue Jays played their first ever Canada Day game on July 
1, as Toronto lost to the Texas Rangers 11-8 at Exhibition Stadium. The 
Blue Jays would go into the All-Star break with a 34-58 record, 19 games 
out of first place. At the 1977 Major League Baseball All-Star Game held 
at Yankee Stadium in New York City on July 19, first baseman Ron Fairly 
was the only Blue Jays representative. He struck out in his only at-bat 
against Tom Seaver. After the All-Star break, the Blue Jays would continue 
to struggle, losing eight games in a row, before ending the month with 
a win over the Milwaukee Brewers. Toronto would have a record of 7-21 in 
July to bring their overall record to 35-66, and 24 games out of first 
place. On August 9, the Blue Jays defeated the Minnesota Twins 6-2 in front 
of 23,450 fans at Exhibition Stadium, as the franchise broke the Major 
League record for attendance by an expansion team in a season. It was another 
tough month for the ballclub, as Toronto went 10-18 during August, and 
a record of 45-84 during the season, 32.5 games out of first place. The 
Blue Jays lost their last five games in August. Toronto began September 
with six losses in a row, bringing their overall losing streak to 11 games, 
before defeating the Boston Red Sox 3-2 on September 7. On September 10, 
Roy Howell drove in a club record nine runs in a 19-3 win over the New 
York Yankees at Yankee Stadium. It also marked the Yankees worst lose at 
home in over 50 years. On September 15, the Blue Jays earned a 9-0 forfeit 
victory over the Baltimore Orioles when Orioles manager Earl Weaver removed 
his club from the field in the fifth inning.[18] The Blue Jays inaugural 
season came to a close on October 2, as they split a double header against 
the Cleveland Indians in front of 27,789 fans at Exhibition Stadium, bringing 
the Blue Jays total attendance to 1,701,052, an MLB record for an expansion 
team. Toronto finished the year in last place in the American League East 
with a 54-107 record, 45.5 games behind the first place New York Yankees. 
Toronto also finished 9.5 games worse than their expansion cousins, the 
Seattle Mariners, who had a 64-98 record. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8]
