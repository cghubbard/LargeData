One of the top black baseball teams of the 1890s, the Page Fence Giants 
were based in Adrian, Michigan and named after the Page Woven Wire Fence 
Company. The team was sponsored by the company's founder, J. Wallace Page. 
Formed in 1894, the team played its first game on April 9, 1895. Bud Fowler 
and Home Run Johnson organized the team, which was managed by Gus Parsons. 
Fowler chose players who did not drink and aimed for a group with high 
moral character. Five of the twelve players were college graduates. Fowler 
played second base while Johnson manned shortstop. The team played in 112 
towns that year against all levels of competition, going 118-36-2. They 
were 8-7 against clubs from the white Michigan State League. They lost 
games by scores of 11-7 and 16-2 against the Cincinnati Reds. The club 
lost Fowler and pitcher George Wilson to the white Adrian-based team in 
the MSL during the season. In 1896, Charlie Grant replaced Fowler at second. 
The Page Fence Giants beat the Cuban X-Giants in a 15-game series, 10 games 
to 5, to claim they were the top team in black baseball. Overall they went 
80-19 through August 1. In 1897, they went 125-12 with 82 consecutive wins. 
The 1898 tour was the club's last, and the next year many of the players 
went to the new Columbia Giants.[1] Sources: Riley 294, 330, 387, 432, 
434, 609, 836, 872. Fowler and Wilson left the team before the end of its 
first, 1895 season to play in the primarily white Michigan State League.(Riley
