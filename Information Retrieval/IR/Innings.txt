An Innings is one of the divisions of a cricket match during which one 
team takes its turn to bat. The word is of uncertain origin and the same 
word applies to both the singular and plural forms, so a cricketer might 
refer to "an innings" and "both innings". This contrasts with baseball 
and softball in which the singular is "inning". In use since time immemorial, 
the earliest known record of the term concerns a match on Wednesday, 5 
August 1730 at Blackheath, Kent between Kent and London. The London-based 
newspaper St. James Evening Post reported on Saturday, 8 August: "'Twas 
thought that the Kentish champions would have lost their honours by being 
beat at one innings if time had permitted". This is the first time that 
the word "innings" is found in contemporary records. Incidentally, it is 
also the first time that the word "champions" is found in a team sense, 
which is significant because it confirms that the idea of a champion county 
was already well established among cricket's followers. Furthermore, the 
match was apparently drawn and is the earliest known instance of this result.[1][2][3] 
An innings is one of the divisions of a match during which one team takes 
its turn to bat. Innings is the subject of Law 12 in the Laws of cricket.[4] 
In a first-class match, there are up to four innings with each team due 
to bat twice (in practice, this is not always the case). In a limited overs 
match, there are only two innings with each team batting once. The term 
is also used with the meaning of "score" for both the team and each individual 
batsman. For example, it may be said that "he played an innings of 101", 
meaning that the player scored 101 in his innings. Similarly, it may be 
said that the team had a first innings (score) of 501.[4] The term can 
generally be taken as a reference to the time during which someone possesses 
something and, colloquially, the phrase "a good innings" means a long life.[5][6]
