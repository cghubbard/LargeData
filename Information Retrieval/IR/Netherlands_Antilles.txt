The Netherlands Antilles (Dutch: Nederlandse Antillen [ˈneːdərˌlɑntsə ɑnˈtɪlə(n)] ( 
listen); Papiamentu: Antia Hulandes)[2] was a constituent country of the 
Kingdom of the Netherlands. The country consisted of several island territories 
located in the Caribbean Sea. The islands were also informally known as 
the Dutch Antilles.[3] The country came into being in 1954 as the autonomous 
successor of the Dutch colony of Curaçao and Dependencies, and was dissolved 
in 2010. The former Dutch colony of Surinam, although it was relatively 
close by on the continent of South America, did not become part of Netherlands 
Antilles but became a separate autonomous country at the same time. All 
the island territories that belonged to the Netherlands Antilles remain 
part of the kingdom today, although the legal status of each differs. As 
a group they are still commonly called the Dutch Caribbean, regardless 
of their legal status.[4] The islands of the Netherlands Antilles are all 
part of the Lesser Antilles island chain. Within this group, the country 
was spread over two smaller island groups: a northern group (part of the 
Leeward Islands) and a western group (part of Leeward Antilles). No part 
of the country was in the southern Windward Islands. This island sub-group 
was located in the eastern Caribbean Sea, to the east of Puerto Rico. There 
were three islands, collectively known as the "SSS islands": They lie approximately 
800–900 kilometers (500–560 miles) north-east of the ABC Islands. This 
island sub-group was located in the southern Caribbean Sea off the north 
coast of Venezuela. There were three islands collectively known as the 
"ABC Islands": The Netherlands Antilles had an equatorial climate, with 
hot weather all year round. The Leeward islands are subject to hurricanes 
in the summer months, while those islands located in the Leeward Antilles 
are warmer and drier. Spanish-sponsored explorers discovered both the leeward 
(Alonso de Ojeda, 1499) and windward (Christopher Columbus, 1493) island 
groups. However, the Spanish Crown only founded settlements in the leeward 
islands. In the 17th century the islands were conquered by the Dutch West 
India Company and colonised by Dutch settlers. From the last quarter of 
the 17th century, the group consisted of six undisputedly Dutch islands: 
Curaçao (settled in 1634), Aruba (settled in 1636), Bonaire (settled in 
1636), Sint Eustatius (settled in 1636), Saba (settled in 1640) and Sint 
Maarten (settled in 1648). In the past, Anguilla (1631–1650), the present-day 
British Virgin Islands (1612–1672), St. Croix and Tobago had also been 
Dutch. The various islands were united as a single country — the Netherlands 
Antilles — in 1954. The country was dissolved on 10 October 2010.[3] Curaçao 
and Sint Maarten became distinct constituent countries alongside Aruba 
which had become a distinct constituent country in 1986; whereas Bonaire, 
Sint Eustatius, and Saba (the "BES Islands") became special municipalities 
within the Netherlands proper.[5] In the second half of the 18th century 
Sint Eustatius became the commercial hub of the north-eastern Caribbean, 
earning the nickname "the Golden Rock". This aroused the envy of the French 
and English, who from 1795 made sure the island lost that position by occupying 
the island and ruining it — the French through their taxes and the English 
by closing the island off and diverting all trade to their own islands.[citation

Kingdom of the Netherlands. Slavery was abolished in 1863, and in 1865 
a government regulation for Curaçao was enacted that allowed for some very 
limited autonomy for the colony. Although this regulation was replaced 
by a constitution (Dutch: Staatsregeling) in 1936, the changes to the government 
structure remained superficial and Curaçao continued to be ruled as a colony.[6] 
The island of Curaçao was hit hard by the abolition of slavery in 1863. 
Its prosperity (and that of neighboring Aruba) was restored in the early 
20th century with the construction of oil refineries to service the newly 
discovered Venezuelan oil fields. Colonial rule ended after the conclusion 
of the Second World War. Queen Wilhelmina had promised in a 1942 speech 
to offer autonomy to the overseas territories of the Netherlands, and British 
and American occupation—with the consent of the Dutch government—of the 
islands during the war led to increasing demands for autonomy within the 
population as well.[7] In May 1948 a new constitution for the territory 
entered into force, allowing the largest amount of autonomy possible under 
the Dutch constitution of 1922. Among other things, universal suffrage 
was introduced. The territory was also renamed "Netherlands Antilles". 
After the Dutch constitution was revised in 1948, a new interim Constitution 
of the Netherlands Antilles was enacted in February 1951. Shortly afterwards, 
on 3 March 1951, the Island Regulation of the Netherlands Antilles (Dutch: 
Eilandenregeling Nederlandse Antillen or ERNA) was issued by royal decree, 
giving fairly wide autonomy to the various island territories in the Netherlands 
Antilles. A consolidated version of this regulation remained in force until 
the dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles in 2010.[8][9] The new constitution 
was only deemed an interim arrangement, as negotiations for a Charter for 
the Kingdom were already under way. On 15 December 1954 the Netherlands 
Antilles, Suriname and the Netherlands acceded as equal partners to an 
overarching Kingdom of the Netherlands, established by the Charter for 
the Kingdom of the Netherlands. With this move, the United Nations deemed 
decolonization of the territory complete and removed the Netherlands Antilles 
from the United Nations list of Non-Self-Governing Territories.[10] Aruba 
seceded from the Netherlands Antilles on 1 January 1986, paving the way 
for a series of referendums among the remaining islands on the future of 
the Netherlands Antilles. Whereas the ruling parties campaigned for the 
dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles, the people voted for a restructuring 
of the Netherlands Antilles. The coalition campaigning for this option 
became the Party for the Restructured Antilles, which ruled the Netherlands 
Antilles for much of the time until its dissolution on 10 October 2010. 
Even though the referendums held in the early 1990s resulted in a vote 
in favour of retaining the Netherlands Antilles, the arrangement continued 
to be an unhappy one. Between June 2000 and April 2005, each island of 
the Netherlands Antilles had a new referendum on its future status. The 
four options that could be voted on were the following: Of the five islands, 
Sint Maarten and Curaçao voted for status aparte, Saba and Bonaire voted 
for closer ties with the Netherlands, and Sint Eustatius voted to stay 
within the Netherlands Antilles. On 26 November 2005, a Round Table Conference 
(RTC) was held between the governments of the Netherlands, Aruba, the Netherlands 
Antilles, and each island in the Netherlands Antilles. The final statement 
to emerge from the RTC stated that autonomy for Curaçao and Sint Maarten, 
plus a new status for Bonaire, Sint Eustatius, and Saba (BES) would come 
into effect by 1 July 2007.[11] On 12 October 2006, the Netherlands reached 
an agreement with Bonaire, Sint Eustatius, and Saba: this agreement would 
make these islands special municipalities.[12] On 3 November 2006, Curaçao 
and Sint Maarten were granted autonomy in an agreement,[13] but this agreement 
was rejected by the then island council of Curaçao on 28 November.[14] 
The Curaçao government was not sufficiently convinced that the agreement 
would provide enough autonomy for Curaçao.[15] On 9 July 2007 the new island 
council of Curaçao approved the agreement previously rejected in November 
2006.[16] A subsequent referendum approved the agreement as well. The acts 
of parliament integrating the "BES" islands (Bonaire, Sint Eustatius and 
Saba) into the Netherlands were given royal assent on 17 May 2010. After 
ratification by the Netherlands (6 July), the Netherlands Antilles (20 
August), and Aruba (4 September), the Kingdom act amending the Charter 
for the Kingdom of the Netherlands with regard to the dissolution of the 
Netherlands Antilles was signed by the three countries in the closing Round 
Table Conference on 9 September 2010 in The Hague. The Island Regulation 
had divided the Netherlands Antilles into four island territories: Aruba, 
Bonaire, Curaçao (ABC), and the islands in the Leeward Islands. In 1983, 
the island territory of the Leeward was split up to form the new island 
territories of Sint Maarten, Saba, and Sint Eustatius (SSS). In 1986, Aruba 
seceded from the Netherlands Antilles, reducing the number of island territories 
to five. After the dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles in 2010, Curaçao 
and Sint Maarten became autonomous countries within the Kingdom and Bonaire, 
Sint Eustatius and Saba (BES) became special municipalities of the Netherlands. 
The islands of the former country of the Netherlands Antilles are currently 
divided are two main groups for political and constitutional purposes: 
There are three Caribbean islands that are countries (Dutch: landen) within 
the Kingdom of the Netherlands: Aruba, Curaçao, and Sint Maarten. (The 
Netherlands is the fourth constituent country in the Kingdom of the Netherlands.) 
Sint Maarten is approximately one half of the island of Saint Martin; the 
remaining northern half of the island — the Collectivity of Saint-Martin 
— is an overseas territory of France. There are three Caribbean islands 
that are special municipalities of the Netherlands alone: Bonaire, Sint 
Eustatius, and Saba. Collectively, these special municipalities of the 
Netherlands are also known as the BES islands. There are also several smaller 
islands, like Klein Curaçao and Klein Bonaire, that belong to one of the 
island countries or special municipalities. The Constitution of the Netherlands 
Antilles was proclaimed on 29 March 1955 by Order-in-Council for the Kingdom. 
Together with the Island Regulation of the Netherlands Antilles it formed 
the constitutional basis for the Netherlands Antilles. Because the Constitution 
depended on the Island Regulation, which gave fairly large autonomy to 
the different island territories, and the Island Regulation was older than 
the Constitution, many scholars describe the Netherlands Antilles as a 
federal arrangement.[18] The head of state was the monarch of the Kingdom 
of the Netherlands, who was represented in the Netherlands Antilles by 
a governor. The governor and the council of ministers, chaired by a prime 
minister, formed the government. The Netherlands Antilles had a unicameral 
legislature called the Estates of the Netherlands Antilles. Its 22 members 
were fixed in number for the islands making up the Netherlands Antilles: 
fourteen for Curaçao, three each for Sint Maarten and Bonaire, and one 
each for Saba and Sint Eustatius. The Netherlands Antilles were not part 
of the European Union, but instead listed as overseas countries and territories 
(OCTs). This status was kept for all the islands after dissolution, and 
will be kept until at least 2015. Tourism, petroleum transshipment and 
oil refinement (on Curaçao), as well as offshore finance were the mainstays 
of this small economy, which was closely tied to the outside world. The 
islands enjoyed a high per capita income and a well-developed infrastructure 
as compared with other countries in the region.[19] Almost all consumer 
and capital goods were imported, with Venezuela, the United States, and 
Mexico being the major suppliers, as well as the Dutch government which 
supports the islands with substantial development aid. Poor soils and inadequate 
water supplies hampered the development of agriculture. The Antillean guilder 
had a fixed exchange rate with the United States dollar of 1.79:1. A large 
percentage of the Netherlands Antilleans descended from European colonists 
and African slaves who were brought and traded here from the 17th to 19th 
centuries. The rest of the population originated from other Caribbean islands 
as well as Latin America, East Asia and elsewhere in the world. In Curaçao 
there was a strong Jewish element going back to the 17th century. The language 
Papiamentu was predominant on Curaçao and Bonaire (as well as the neighboring 
island of Aruba). This creole descended from Portuguese and West African 
languages with a strong admixture of Dutch, plus subsequent lexical contributions 
from Spanish and English. An English-based creole dialect, formally known 
as Netherlands Antilles Creole, was the native dialect of the inhabitants 
of Sint Eustatius, Saba and Sint Maarten. After a decades-long debate, 
English and Papiamentu were made official languages alongside Dutch in 
early March 2007.[20] Legislation was produced in Dutch, but parliamentary 
debate was in Papiamentu or English, depending on the island. Due to a 
massive influx of immigrants from Spanish-speaking territories such as 
the Dominican Republic in the Windward Islands, and increased tourism from 
Venezuela in the Leeward Islands, Spanish had also become increasingly 
used. The majority of the population were followers of the Christian faith, 
with a Protestant majority in Sint Eustatius and Sint Maarten, and a Roman 
Catholic majority in Bonaire, Curaçao and Saba. Curaçao also hosted a sizeable 
group of followers of the Jewish religion, descendants of a Portuguese 
group of Sephardic Jews that arrived from Amsterdam and Brazil from 1654. 
In 1982, there was a population of about 2,000 Muslims, with an Islamic 
association and a mosque in the capital.[21] Most Netherlands Antilleans 
were Dutch citizens and this status permitted and encouraged the young 
and university-educated to emigrate to the Netherlands. This exodus was 
considered to be to the islands' detriment, as it created a brain drain. 
On the other hand, immigrants from the Dominican Republic, Haiti, the Anglophone 
Caribbean and Colombia had increased their presence on these islands in 
later years. The origins of the population and location of the islands 
gave the Netherlands Antilles a mixed culture. Tourism and overwhelming 
media presence from the United States increased the regional United States 
influence. On all the islands, the holiday of Carnival had become an important 
event after its importation from other Caribbean and Latin American countries 
in the 1960s. Festivities included "jump-up" parades with beautifully colored 
costumes, floats, and live bands as well as beauty contests and other competitions. 
Carnival on the islands also included a middle-of-the-night j'ouvert (juvé) 
parade that ended at sunrise with the burning of a straw King Momo, cleansing 
the island of sins and bad luck. Netherlands Lesser Antilles competed in 
the Winter Olympics of 1988, notably finishing 29th in the bobsled, ahead 
of Jamaica who famously competed but finished 30th. Baseball is by far 
the most popular sport. Several players have made it to the Major Leagues, 
such as Xander Bogaerts, Andrelton Simmons, Hensley Meulens, Randall Simon, 
Andruw Jones, Kenley Jansen, Jair Jurrjens, Roger Bernadina, Sidney Ponson, 
Didi Gregorius, Shairon Martis, Wladimir Balentien, and Yurendell DeCaster. 
Xander Bogaerts competed in the 2013 World Series for the Boston Red Sox 
against the St. Louis Cardinals. Andruw Jones played for the Atlanta Braves 
in the 1996 World Series hitting two home runs in the first game against 
the New York Yankees. Three athletes from the former Netherlands Antilles 
competed in the 2012 Summer Olympics. They, alongside one athlete from 
South Sudan, competed under the banner of Independent Olympic Athletes. 
Unlike the metropolitan Netherlands, same-sex marriages were not performed 
in the Netherlands Antilles, but those performed in other jurisdictions 
were recognised. The main prison of the Netherlands Antilles was Koraal 
Specht, later known as Bon Futuro. It was known for ill treatment of prisoners 
and bad conditions throughout the years.[22] The late Venezuelan President 
Hugo Chávez claimed that the Netherlands was helping the United States 
to invade Venezuela due to military games in 2006.[23] Curaçao is under 
consideration as a Cooperative Security Location, not a full Main Operating 
Base. Click on a coloured area to see an article about English in that
