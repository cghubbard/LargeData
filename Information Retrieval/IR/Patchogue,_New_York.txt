Patchogue /ˈpætʃɒɡ/ is a village on the south shore of Long Island in Suffolk 
County, New York, United States. The population was 11,798 at the time 
of the 2010 census.[1] Patchogue is part of the town of Brookhaven, on 
the South Shore of Long Island, adjoining Great South Bay. It is officially 
known as the Incorporated Village of Patchogue. Patchogue, which is approximately 
60 miles (100 km) east of Manhattan, became incorporated in 1893. A natural 
riverfront and harbor are resources that the village has utilized for the 
past 100 years, to become a modern and largely self-contained community. 
The current mayor of Patchogue, Paul Pontieri, was a vice-principal of 
the neighboring South Country School District's Bellport High School for 
many years. He has also served as a vice-principal at Ward Melville High 
School, in Three Village School District. He was elected in March, 2004 
to a four-year term, then re-elected in 2008. Patchogue is the mailing 
address for residents of the village, as well as residents of the adjoining 
hamlets of North Patchogue, Canaan Lake and some areas on Fire Island. 
Patchogue and the adjacent hamlet of Medford share a school district and 
library. There are Primary, Middle and High Schools, plus continuing education 
programs for adults. The School District, library, St. Joseph's and the 
Briarcliffe Colleges provide a variety of educational opportunities. In 
2010, the Patchogue-Medford Library was awarded the 2010 National Medal 
for Museum and Library Science for the library's work in bilingual programming.[2] 
The Patchogue Theater for the Performing Arts opened in 1923. It was later 
renovated into a triplex, after which it was converted to a single movie 
theater. It closed in the late 1980s. In the mid-1990s the Village acquired 
the theater, and completely refurbished the building; it now seats 1,166 
people. Patchogue has places of worship of various Christian denominations. 
Three churches in Patchogue are listed on the National Register of Historic 
Places. The Congregational Church on East Main Street, United Methodist 
Church on South Ocean Avenue between Church Street and Terry Street, and 
the St. Paul's Episcopal Church on Rider Avenue across from Terry Street. 
St. Francis de Sales is the Roman Catholic parish which was formed in the 
1880s. It was formed and flourished despite the protests of the nativist 
movement (the Know Nothings). Patchogue also has two synagogues, Young 
Israel of Patchogue and Temple Beth-El. Volunteer organisations include 
The Patchogue Chamber of Commerce, Knights of Columbus Council 725, Kiwanis, 
Rotarians and Lions. The Patchogue Ambulance Company is an all-volunteer 
service. In 1996, the Village acquired the old Ward & Glynne theatre located 
in the heart of the Village. It had opened in 1923 as a Vaudeville and 
live theatre. It stayed open through the 1940s when it was converted into 
a movie house. Around the late 1980s, the theatre closed its doors. In 
1996, the Village acquired it, and it reopened in 1999. Done by an army 
of volunteers, the theatre was restored as close to its original beauty 
as possible. In 2006 over 100,000 people visited the theatre, which accommodates 
all types of live theatre. From Broadway shows, to Irish Tenors, to local 
bands, the theatre continues to draw an audience from all over the island 
and New York. The Blue Point Brewing Company opened in Patchogue in 1998, 
and is the only commercial brewery on Long Island (not counting the Brooklyn 
Brewery in Brooklyn, which is in the City of New York and contracts most 
of its product from Matt Brewing Company in upstate Utica, or the various 
brewpubs that brew mostly for consumption on the premises). Patchogue is
