United States. The population was 40,318 at the 2010 census. Fitchburg 
is home to Fitchburg State University as well as 17 public and private 
elementary and high schools. Fitchburg was first settled in 1730 as part 
of Lunenburg, and was officially set apart from that township and incorporated 
in 1764. It is named for John Fitch, one of the committee that procured 
the act of incorporation.[1] In July 1748 Fitch and his family, living 
in this isolated spot, were abducted to Canada by Native Americans, but 
returned the next year.[2] Fitchburg is situated on both the Nashua River 
and a railroad line. The original Fitchburg Railroad ran through the Hoosac 
Tunnel, linking Boston and Albany, New York. The tunnel was built using 
the Burleigh Rock Drill, designed and built in Fitchburg. Fitchburg was 
a 19th-century industrial center. Originally operated by water power, large 
mills produced machines, tools, clothing, paper, and firearms. The city 
is noted for its architecture, particularly in the Victorian style, built 
at the height of its mill town prosperity. A few examples of these 19th 
century buildings are the Fay Club, the old North Worcester County Courthouse 
and the Bullock house. As the city is one of two shire towns, the Northern 
Worcester County Registry of Deeds, established in 1903, and the county 
jail on Water Street were two county facilities located in Fitchburg. The 
1961 film Return to Peyton Place was filmed in Fitchburg.[3] Fitchburg

collection spanning 5,000 years. The museum was founded in 1925 through 
the bequest of artist, collector and Fitchburg native Eleanor Norcross 
(1854–1923). Her extraordinary talents and educational vision highlights 
her as an important pioneer in American social history. The museum's four 
building complex features over 20,000 square feet of gallery and educational 
workshop space and includes the historic "Cross Barn" built in 1883, and 
the impressive Simond's building completed in 1989. Visitors can experience 
masterpieces in 12 beautifully designed galleries that feature American,

Fitchburg is noted for the "Rollstone Boulder", a 110-ton specimen of porphyritic 
granite, which is in a small triangular park adjacent to the city green. 
The boulder was a feature of the summit of Rollstone Hill; it was exploded 
and reassembled on the green in 1929 and 1930. A plaque attached to the 
boulder today reads, in part: This boulder, carried by the last glacier 
from Mt. Monadnock, New Hampshire to the summit of the hill whose name 
commemorates it, was for centuries a land mark to Indian and Settler. Threatened 
with destruction by quarrying operations, it was saved by popular subscription... 
Listed on the National Register of Historic Places, this athletic facility 
was a gift of Alva Crocker, in 1918, to the City Of Fitchburg’s school 
children. Alvah Crocker hired the famous Olmsted Brothers Landscaping and 
Design Firm of Brookline, MA to design his “field of dreams.” Babe Ruth 
once visited Crocker field and asked Clarence Amiott, then the Fitchburg 
High School Athletic Director, “What professional team plays here?” to 
which Mr. Amiott answered “The Fitchburg High School teams.” Crocker Field

devoted to aviation-related toys. Included in the museum’s collection of 
over 2000 toys are tin toys from Japan, Hungary, Germany, and the United 
States. Top Fun Aviation Museum. The Society houses more than 200,000 items 
related to the history of Fitchburg. Included in the archives are original

story of Fitchburg—early iron hearth cooking tools, the first printing 
press of the Fitchburg Sentinel, machines illustrating the strong industrial 
heritage of the City, a stellar collection of early paintings, and clothing 
representing many decades in Fitchburg. A comprehensive strategic plan 
completed in 2001 pointed out a need to find a building better suited our 
needs in order to continue collecting and preserving the history of Fitchburg 
and conducting programs for students and the general public. The Historical 
Society is now in the final stages of renovation and upgrading our building 
located at 781 Main Street. As a result of the renovations to the H. M. 
Francis Phoenix Building the Society has moved to its new location of 781 
Main Street, Fitchburg, MA. Coggshall Park is a Victorian park with miles 
of wooded trails branching out from around Mirror Lake, which is encircled 
by a walking path. Stone steps built into a hillside face a gazebo on the 
water, making this a popular spot for weddings and photos. A classic stone 
house on the property overlooks Mirror Lake. The tables and benches scattered 
around the park draw picnickers as well as those simply seeking a place 
to relax. For the children there's a playground that sits adjacent from 
the pond and a frisbee golf course. Coggshall Park was a gift to the City 
from Mr. Henry Coggshall, an executive of The Fitchburg Gas Company, and 
his wife in 1894. The initial donation included 86 acres (35 ha), but the 
couple subsequently purchased and donated additional parcels to create 
the 212-acre park that exists today. Coggshall Park also abuts a large 
parcel of conservation land and a bird sanctuary, providing a total of 
approximately 300 acres (120 ha) for visitors to enjoy. The Friends of 
Coggshall Park was founded in 1992 when approximately $1 million in state 
and federal funds were used to renovate the park. Since the group's founding, 
the Friends have contributed significantly to the upkeep and beautification 
of Coggshall Park. Annual spring clean-up projects, to which the Friends 
contribute both volunteer labor and supplies (including more than 60 yards 
of mulch each year), ensure the park's landscaping remains well-kept. Other 
investments made by the Friends have been even more significant, such as 
the purchase of a new fountain for Mirror Lake and a specialized off-road 
firefighting vehicle for use in Coggshall or elsewhere around the city 
as needed.Friends of Coggshall Park As of the census[23] of 2010, there

of public library services and was not certified by the Massachusetts Board 
of Library Commissioners for FY2009.[40][41] It returned to certification 
in FY2012.[41] Furthermore, on going support comes from the Friends of

twentieth century, Fitchburg was known for its paper industry, which occupied 
the banks of the Nashua River and employed a large segment of the European 
immigrant population. It has been noted by many residents in Fitchburg 
that the Nashua River would be dyed the color the paper mills had been 
coloring the paper that day.[citation needed] The Fitchburg Central Steam 
Plant (locally known by its nickname: the PLT) was built in 1928 to provide 
steam and electricity to the many local paper mills. As the paper mills 
were abandoned or improved the Central Steam Plant fell into disuse and 
was abandoned. In 2008, the EPA designated the Central Steam Plant a brownfield 
site due to contamination of the site soil and groundwater with metals 
and inorganic contaminants. The EPA provided the City of Fitchburg $50,500 
in grant money[45] to help clean up hazardous substances on the site. Cleanup[46] 
of the Central Steam Plant started in 2010 and is ongoing as of July 2011. 
Unfortunately as of December 2015 the Fitchburg Central Steam Plant has 
been razed. The last structure to fall being the massive smokestack. The 
Fitchburg Parks and Recreation Department maintains parks in Fitchburg,

that is part a network of Mass Aududon land, with 6 miles of trails. It 
is located within minutes from downtown Fitchburg, the hustling sounds 
of the city fade into a chorus of songbirds, rustling leaves, and zipping 
dragonflies. This wooded area provides habitat for species needing relatively 
large territories such as fisher, coyote, and red fox. Bobcat and black 
bear occasionally travel through these woods over rocky ledges and through 
hemlock groves. The West Fitchburg Steam Line Trail[47] is a bike and walking 
path located in Fitchburg on Route 2A. It is 0.6 miles long and runs along 
the Nashua River and Flag Brook in the Waites Corner neighborhood. The 
path is gravel and is relatively easy terrain. The trail is the first contracted 
part of a planned project to build a mixed use bike and walking trail through 
Fitchburg. This trail will eventually connect with trails in the neighboring 
towns of Leominster and Westminster. Additional parts of the proposed trail 
are in the Riverfront and Gateway Parks.[48] The Fitchburg Steam Line Trail 
is located near the junction of Route 31 (Princeton Rd) and Route 2A (Westminster 
St) at 465 Westminster Street. The trail parking lot is marked with signs, 
and is on the south side of 2A approximately ¼ mile East of Route 31. The
