Larry Edward Jaster (born January 13, 1944) is a former left-handed pitcher 
in Major League Baseball who played for the St. Louis Cardinals, Montreal 
Expos and Atlanta Braves between 1965 and 1972 with the exception of 1971. 
Before Jaster was signed as an undrafted free agent by the St. Louis Cardinals 
on January 1, 1962, he attended Northwood University. Jaster made his major 
league debut on September 17, 1965 versus the Los Angeles Dodgers at the 
age of 21. He finished the year with a record of 3–0 and an ERA of 1.61. 
All three of Jaster's starts were complete game victories. Jaster spent 
most of 1966 in the big leagues where he finished with a record of 11–5 
with an ERA of 3.26 which earned him a tie for 4th in the Rookie of the 
Year balloting for that season. The main highlight of Jaster's 1966 season, 
were his league leading five shutouts, all of which were against the NL 
pennant winning Los Angeles Dodgers.[1] Because of his success against 
Los Angeles, some people nicknamed Jaster 'The Dodger Killer'. Others gave 
him the nickname, 'The Creeper'.[2] Over Jaster's seven-year MLB playing 
career, he batted .170. Of his twenty-nine career hits, only three were 
for extra bases, two of which were home runs. Jaster pitched two more years 
for St. Louis but never won more than nine games in a season. On May 31, 
1968, Jaster pitched no-hit baseball for 7.2 innings against the New York 
Mets. After retiring the first twenty-three batters he faced, Jaster gave 
up a single to Greg Goossen.[3] Larry Jaster made appearances in both the 
1967 and 1968 World Series. It was during Game 6 of the 1968 series that 
he surrendered a grand slam to Jim Northrup.[4] Detroit went on to win 
the game 13–1, and the series four games to three after being down three 
games to one. After the World Series, Jaster was drafted 47th overall by 
the Montreal Expos in the 1968 MLB expansion draft. He made history on 
April 14, 1969 by throwing the first pitch in a Major League regular season 
game in Canada. The Expos defeated Jaster's former team, the Cardinals, 
8–7 at Jarry Park that day.[5] Jaster, who gave up seven runs (only two 
of which were earned) in 3.2 innings of pitching, did not get the decision. 
Jaster made six of his eight career errors while playing for Montreal. 
He finished the 1969 season with a .684 fielding percentage. After the 
1969 season was over, Jaster was sent to the Atlanta Braves in exchange 
for pitcher Jim Britton and minor league catcher Don Johnson. Jaster was 
only twenty-eight years old when he played his last MLB game on October 
4, 1972. After that he played two more years of professional baseball with 
the Richmond Braves. After his playing days were over, Jaster has worked 
as a minor league pitching coach or pitching coordinator in the Atlanta 
Braves[6] and Baltimore Orioles organizations.[7] At present he lives in
