Timothy Manus Cooney (born December 19, 1990) is an American professional 
baseball pitcher for the St. Louis Cardinals of Major League Baseball (MLB). 
The Cardinals selected him in the third round of the 2012 amateur draft 
after attending Wake Forest University and playing college baseball for 
the Demon Deacons. He made his major league debut on April 30, 2015. Cooney 
attended Malvern Preparatory School in Malvern, Pennsylvania. Pitching 
for Malvern's baseball team, Cooney won the Pennsylvania state championship 
in 2009.[1] Though Cooney received scholarship offers from Ivy League universities, 
he chose to enroll at Wake Forest University to play college baseball for 
the Demon Deacons in the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC).[2] As a sophomore, 
Cooney was named to the All-ACC second team.[3] The Cardinals chose Cooney 
in the third round, with the 117th overall selection, of the 2012 MLB Draft.[3] 
He made his professional debut that year with the Batavia Muckdogs of the 
Class A-Short Season New York–Penn League.[4] In 2013, Cooney began the 
season with the Palm Beach Cardinals of the Class A-Advanced Florida State 
League, and was promoted to the Springfield Cardinals of the Class AA Texas 
League.[5] The Cardinals invited Cooney to spring training in 2014.[6] 
With Springfield, he was a mid-season All-Star for the Texas League.[7] 
Next, Cooney pitched for the Memphis Redbirds of the Class AAA Pacific 
Coast League (PCL) in 2014,[8] and opened the season with Memphis in 2015.[9] 
Entering the 2015 season, Baseball America rated Cooney as having the best 
control in the Cardinals organization.[7] Cooney made his major league 
debut on April 30, 2015, replacing the injured Adam Wainwright in the Cardinals' 
starting rotation.[10] Cooney struggled in his debut, and was optioned 
back to Memphis the next day.[11] On May 17, he was named the PCL Pitcher 
of the Week after allowing a 0.66 ERA in 13 1⁄3 IP against the New Orleans 
Zephyrs and Omaha Storm Chasers. He also held batters to a .143 batting 
average against (7-for-49).[12] In his first 14 starts of the season with 
Memphis, Cooney completed 88 2⁄3 IP, allowing 27 ER for a 2.74 ERA. He 
also struck out 63 batters and was 6–4 in won–loss decisions. He was named 
to the 2015 PCL All-Star squad on July 1.[7] The Cardinals recalled him 
the next day when they placed outfielder Jon Jay on the disabled list.[13] 
On July 24 against the Atlanta Braves, Cooney earned his first major league 
victory by pitching a career-high seven innings in a 4−2 outcome. He had 
previously received no-decisions in each of his first five major league 
starts. Further, he had a 12-inning scoreless streak that ended in the 
sixth inning.[14] The Cardinals withheld Cooney from play for the remainder 
of the season starting on September 1 due to appendicitis. His major league 
totals for the season included a 1–0 record, 3.16 ERA, 28 hits, 10 walks 
allowed and 29 strikeouts in 31 1⁄3 innings.[15] Prior to the 2016 season, 
Baseball America rated Cooney as the second-best prospect in the Cardinals 
organization.[16] However, Cooney missed the whole 2016 season due to a
