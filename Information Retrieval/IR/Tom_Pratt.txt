Thomas Jefferson Pratt (January 26, 1844 – September 28, 1908) was a professional 
baseball player who played for the Philadelphia Athletics. He played in 
one game for the Athletics on October 18, 1871, getting two hits in six 
at-bats. Pratt, along with Elvio Jiménez and Clarence Dow, are the only
