The Pawtucket Red Sox and the Rochester Red Wings, two teams from the Triple-A 
International League, played the longest game in professional baseball 
history. It lasted for 33 innings, with 8 hours and 25 minutes of playing 
time. 32 innings were played April 18/19, 1981, at McCoy Stadium in Pawtucket, 
Rhode Island and the final 33rd inning was played June 23, 1981. Pawtucket 
won the game, 3–2. The game began on Saturday, April 18, 1981 at 8:25 p.m.,[1] 
after a delay of about 30 minutes due to problems with stadium lights, 
with 1,740 in attendance. It continued through the night and into Easter 
morning. Although most leagues have a curfew rule that would have suspended 
the game—the International League's activates at 12:50 a.m.[2]—the rule 
book that the home plate umpire Dennis Cregg[1] had did not contain one.[3] 
After Pawtucket's Russ Laribee's sacrifice fly drove in Chico Walker in 
the bottom of the ninth inning and tied the game at one run each,[4] the 
teams continued playing.[3] Several times, one side neared victory before 
circumstances changed. When Wade Boggs drove in the tying run in the bottom 
of the 21st inning after a Rochester run, even the Pawtucket players groaned.[3] 
He recalled that, "I didn't know if the guys on the team wanted to hug 
me or slug me."[5] The weather was so cold that players burned broken bats 
and the stadium's wooden benches to warm themselves, and the clubhouses 
ran out of food. The wind blew into the infield, making hits difficult;[3][4] 
Pawtucket's Dave Koza later claimed that otherwise his team would have 
won in nine innings, with "four or five shots that would have been out 
of the park".[6] For example, Sam Bowen hit a fly ball to center that reportedly 
left the field before the wind blew it back to Rochester outfielder Dallas 
Williams. Williams went 0–for–13 in 15 plate appearances, one of many records 
achieved during the game.[3] After Pawtucket's Luis Aponte pitched the 
seventh to tenth innings in relief, manager Joe Morgan—who himself would 
be ejected in the 22nd inning by Cregg[2]—let him leave before the game 
ended. Aponte's wife did not believe his explanation for coming home at 
3 a.m. Sunday.[6] He promised that the Sunday newspaper would prove his 
story, but since the game's postponement occurred too late to appear in 
it, Aponte had to wait until the Monday edition.[3] Cregg had brought his 
nephew David to the game; David's father became concerned for his family 
and called the police, who told him that the game had not ended.[1] By 
4 a.m. the players were "delirious" from exhaustion; Rochester's Dave Huppert 
had caught the first 31 innings before being replaced, and Jim Umbarger 
pitched 10 scoreless innings from the 23rd inning, striking out nine and 
giving up four hits. The president of the league, Harold Cooper, was finally 
reached on the phone by Pawtucket public relations manager Mike Tamburro 
sometime after 3:00 a.m.; the horrified Cooper ordered that play stop at 
the end of the current inning. Finally at 4:07 a.m., at the end of the 
32nd inning and more than eight hours after it began, the game was stopped.[3] 
There were 19 fans left in the seats—not including David Cregg, who had 
fallen asleep[1]—all of whom received season[2][3] or lifetime[1] passes 
to McCoy Stadium. As the players went home to rest before returning at 
11 a.m. for an afternoon game that Sunday,[1][4] they saw people going 
to Easter sunrise service.[3] When Boggs' father complimented him for getting 
four hits in the game, the player admitted that he had had 12 at bats.[5] 
Both teams signed a baseball on Sunday for display at the Baseball Hall 
of Fame. Cooper had suggested that the game resume that day, but Rochester 
manager Doc Edwards requested a delay because of the risk of injury.[6] 
Instead, it resumed on the evening of Tuesday, June 23, the next time the 
Red Wings were in town. A sellout crowd of 5,746 and 140 reporters from 
around the world were present, partly because the major leagues were on 
strike at the time; the players voted against an offer to resume the game 
at Fenway Park to avoid crossing the picket line. On that evening, it took 
just one inning and 18 minutes to finish the game, with Koza driving in 
the winning run in the bottom of the 33rd. The losing pitcher was Steve 
Grilli, who had joined Rochester in the interim since the game's suspension.[3] 
The Pawtucket Red Sox celebrated the 25th anniversary of the game on June 
23, 2006. Many members of both teams attended a luncheon and round table 
discussion in Providence, Rhode Island, and a ceremony was held before 
the game against the Columbus Clippers that night.[5] Dennis Cregg thinks 
that David Cregg has never attended another baseball game.[1] McCoy Stadium, 
Pawtucket, Rhode Island No outs when winning run scored. Grilli pitched 
to 3 batters in the 33rd Speck pitched to 1 batter in the 33rd WP - Jones 
WP - Smithson, Hurst. Two future Hall of Famers were part of the historic 
game. Cal Ripken, Jr., who was inducted in 2007, went 2–for–13 on the night 
playing third base for Rochester. Ripken was the American League's Rookie 
of the Year the following year. Wade Boggs, who was inducted in 2005, played 
third base for Pawtucket and went 4–for–12 with a double and an RBI. The 
Baseball Hall of Fame possesses other artifacts of the game, including 
the official scorecard.[3] Twenty-three other future major leaguers played
