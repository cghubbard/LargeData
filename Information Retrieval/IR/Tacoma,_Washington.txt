Tacoma (/təˈkoʊmə/, US dict: tə·kō′·mə) is a mid-sized urban port city 
in and the county seat of Pierce County, Washington, United States.[6] 
The city is on Washington's Puget Sound, 32 miles (51 km) southwest of 
Seattle, 31 miles (50 km) northeast of the state capital, Olympia, and 
58 miles (93 km) northwest of Mount Rainier National Park. The population 
was 198,397, according to the 2010 census.[7] Tacoma is the second-largest 
city in the Puget Sound area and the third largest in the state. Tacoma 
also serves as the center of business activity for the South Sound region, 
which has a population of around 1 million people. Tacoma adopted its name 
after the nearby Mount Rainier, originally called Takhoma or Tahoma. It 
is locally known as the "City of Destiny" because the area was chosen to 
be the western terminus of the Northern Pacific Railroad in the late 19th 
century. The decision of the railroad was influenced by Tacoma's neighboring 
deep-water harbor, Commencement Bay. By connecting the bay with the railroad, 
Tacoma's motto became "When rails meet sails." Today, Commencement Bay 
serves the Port of Tacoma, a center of international trade on the Pacific 
Coast and Washington State's largest port. Like most central cities, Tacoma 
suffered a prolonged decline in the mid-20th century as a result of suburbanization 
and divestment. Since the 1990s, developments in the downtown core include 
the University of Washington Tacoma; Tacoma Link, the first modern electric 
light rail service in the state; the state's highest density of art and 
history museums; and a restored urban waterfront, the Thea Foss Waterway. 
Neighborhoods such as the 6th Avenue District have become revitalized. 
Tacoma-Pierce County has been named one of the most livable areas in the 
United States.[8] In 2006, Tacoma was listed as one of the "most walkable" 
cities in the country.[9] That same year, the women's magazine Self named 
Tacoma the "Most Sexually Healthy City" in the United States.[10] In contrast, 
Tacoma was also ranked as the "most stressed-out" city in the country in 
a 2004 survey.[11] Tacoma gained notoriety in 1940 for the collapse of 
the Tacoma Narrows Bridge, which earned the nickname "Galloping Gertie". 
The city of Tacoma and surrounding areas were inhabited for thousands of 
years by American Indians, predominantly the Puyallup people, who lived 
in settlements on the delta. In 1852, a Swede named Nicolas Delin constructed 
a sawmill powered by water on a creek near the head of Commencement Bay, 
but the small settlement that grew up around it was abandoned during the 
Indian War of 1855–56. In 1864, pioneer and postmaster Job Carr, a Civil 
War veteran and land speculator who hoped to profit from the selection 
of Commencement Bay as the terminus of the Transcontinental Railroad, built 
a cabin (a replica of Job Carr's cabin, which also served as Tacoma's first 
post office, was erected in "Old Town" in 2000 near the original site), 
and later sold most of his claim to developer Morton M. McCarver (1807–1875), 
who named his project Tacoma City, derived from the indigenous name for 
the mountain. Tacoma was incorporated on November 12, 1875, following the 
merger of Old Tacoma and New Tacoma on January 7, 1884. Its hopes to be 
the "City of Destiny" were stimulated by selection in 1873 as the western 
terminus of the Northern Pacific Railroad, thanks to lobbying by McCarver, 
future mayor John Wilson Sprague, and others. The transcontinental link 
was effected in 1887, but the railroad built its depot on "New Tacoma", 
two miles (3 km) south of the Carr-McCarver development. The two communities 
grew together and joined. The population grew from 1,098 in 1880 to 36,006 
in 1890. Rudyard Kipling visited Tacoma in 1889 and said it was "literally 
staggering under a boom of the boomiest".[12] George Francis Train was 
a resident for a few years in the late 19th century. In 1890, he staged 
a global circumnavigation starting and ending in Tacoma to promote the 
city. A plaque in downtown Tacoma marks the start and finish line. In November 
1885, white citizens led by then-mayor Jacob Weisbach expelled several 
hundred Chinese residents peacefully living in the city. As described by 
the account prepared by the Chinese Reconciliation Project Foundation, 
on the morning of November 3, 1885, "several hundred men, led by the mayor 
and other city officials, evicted the Chinese from their homes, corralled 
them at 7th Street and Pacific Avenue, marched them to the railway station 
at Lakeview and forced them aboard the morning train to Portland, Oregon. 
The next day two Chinese settlements were burned to the ground." The discovery 
of gold in the Klondike in 1898 led Tacoma's prominence in the region to 
be eclipsed by the booming development of Seattle. A major tragedy marred 
the end of the 19th century, when a streetcar accident resulted in significant 
loss of life on July 4, 1900. From May to August 1907, the city was the 
site of a smelter workers' strike organized by Local 545 of the Industrial 
Workers of the World (IWW), with the goal of a fifty-cent per day pay raise.[13][14] 
The strike was strongly opposed by the local business community, and the 
smelter owners threatened to blacklist organizers and union officials. 
The IWW opposed this move by trying to persuade inbound workers to avoid 
Tacoma for the duration of the strike.[15] By August, the strike had ended 
without meeting its demands.[13] Tacoma was briefly (1915–22) a major destination 
for big-time automobile racing, with one of the nation's top-rated racing 
venues located just outside the city limits, at the site of today's Clover 
Park Technical College. The 1929 crash of the Stock Market, also known 
as the Great Depression, was only the first event in a series of bad misfortunes 
to hit Tacoma in the winter of 1929–30. One of the coldest winters on record, 
Tacoma experienced mass power outages and eventually the shut down of major 
power supply dams, leaving the city without sufficient power and heat.[16] 
During the 30-day power shortage in the winter of 1929 and 1930, Tacoma 
was provided with electricity from the engines of the aircraft carrier 
USS Lexington.[17][18] A power grid failure paired with a newly rewritten 
city constitution put in to place in order to keep political power away 
from a single entity such as the railroad, created a stand still in the 
ability to further the local economy. Local businesses felt the pinch as 
the sudden stop of loans limited progression of expansion and renewal funds 
for maintenance leading to foreclosures.[19] Families all over the city 
experience the fallout of economic depression growing the problem of "where" 
and "how" breadwinners were going to find the food that their families 
needed to survive. Local makeshift inner shanty town politics began to 
develop as the occupants needed some form of leadership to keep the peace.[20] 
At the intersection of Dock Street EXD and East D Street in the train yard, 
a shantytown became the solution to the growing scar of the depression. 
Tacoma's Hooverville grew in 1924 as the homeless community moved onto 
the waterfront as a place to settle. The population boomed in November 
1930 through early 1931 as families from the neighboring McKinley and Hill 
Top areas fell victim to eviction notices and the inability to find steady 
work. Collecting scraps of metal and wood from local lumber stores and 
recycling centers, families began building shanties (shacks) in order to 
supply a roof over their heads. Alcohol and suicide became a common event 
in the Hooverville that eventually gave it its nickname of "Hollywood", 
because of the Hollywood-style crimes and events taking place in the camp. 
It would not be until 1956 when the last occupant of "Hollywood" was evicted 
and the police used fire to level the grounds and make room for industrial 
growth.[21] (Timeline constructed from following sources: Tacoma News Tribune 
(1940–74)[22] and The Tacoma Daily Ledger (1924–40) [23] In 1935, Tacoma 
received national attention when George Weyerhaeuser, the nine-year-old 
son of prominent lumber industry executive J.P. Weyerhaeuser, was kidnapped[24] 
while walking home from school. FBI agents from Portland handled the case, 
in which payment of a ransom of $200,000 secured release of the victim. 
Four persons were apprehended and convicted. The last to be released was 
paroled from McNeil Island in 1963. George Weyerhaeuser went on to become 
chairman of the Board of the Weyerhaeuser Company. In 1951, an investigation 
by a state legislative committee revealed widespread corruption in Tacoma's 
government, which had been organized commission-style since 1910. Voters 
approved a mayor and city-manager system in 1952. Tacoma was featured prominently 
in the garage rock sound of the mid-1960s with bands including The Wailers 
and The Sonics. The surf rock band The Ventures were also from Tacoma. 
Downtown Tacoma experienced a long decline through the mid-20th century. 
Harold Moss, later the city's mayor, characterized late 1970s Tacoma as 
looking "bombed out" like "downtown Beirut" (a reference to the Lebanese 
Civil War that occurred at that time); "Streets were abandoned, storefronts 
were abandoned and City Hall was the headstone and Union Station the footstone" 
on the grave of downtown.[25] This picture began to change somewhere around 
1990. Among the projects associated with the downtown renaissance were 
the federal courthouse in the former Union Station (1991); the Washington 
State History Museum (1996), echoing the architecture of Union Station; 
the adaptation of a group of century-old brick warehouses into the University 
of Washington Tacoma campus; the numerous privately financed renovation 
projects near that UW Tacoma campus; the Museum of Glass (2002); the Tacoma 
Art Museum (2003); and the region's first light-rail line (2003).[26] The 
first local referendums in the U.S. on computerized voting occurred in 
Tacoma in 1982 and 1987. On both occasions, voters rejected 3-1 the computer 
voting systems that local officials sought to purchase. The campaigns, 
organized by Eleanora Ballasiotes, a conservative Republican, focused on 
the vulnerabilities of computers to fraud.[27] In 1998, Tacoma installed 
a high-speed fiber optic network throughout the community. The municipally 
owned power company, Tacoma Power, wired the city. Tacoma's Hilltop neighborhood 
started struggling with crime in the 1980s and early 1990s. Due to its 
high crime rate, Washington residents nicknamed the city "Tacompton", in 
reference to Compton, California.[28] The beginning of the 21st Century 
has seen a marked reduction in crime, as neighborhoods have enacted community 
policing and other policies.[29] Bill Baarsma (mayor from 2002–2010) is 
a member of the Mayors Against Illegal Guns Coalition,[30] a bi-partisan 
group with a stated goal of "making the public safer by getting illegal 
guns off the streets." The coalition was co-chaired by Boston Mayor Thomas 
Menino and New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. In 2004, Tacoma was ranked 
among the top 30 Most Livable Communities in an annual survey conducted 
by the Partners for Livable Communities.[31] In 2009 Tacoma elected its 
second African-American mayor, Marilyn Strickland. Beginning in the early 
1990s, city residents and planners have taken steps to revitalize Tacoma, 
particularly its downtown. The University of Washington established a branch 
campus in Tacoma in 1990. The same year, Union Station (Tacoma) was restored. 
The Museum of Glass opened in downtown Tacoma in 2002, showing glass art 
from the region and around the world. It includes a glassblowing studio 
and is connected to the rest of the Museum District by the Bridge of Glass, 
which features works by Tacoma native glass artist Dale Chihuly. Tacoma's 
downtown Cultural District is the site of the Washington State History 
Museum (1996) and the Tacoma Art Museum (2003). America's Car Museum was 
completed in late 2011 and resides near the Tacoma Dome in Tacoma. The 
glass and steel Greater Tacoma Convention and Trade Center opened in November 
2004.[32] The Theatre District of downtown Tacoma is anchored by the Pantages 
Theater (first opened in 1918). The Broadway Center for the Performing 
Arts[33] manages the Pantages, the Rialto Theater, and the Theatre on the 
Square, as well as Tacoma Little Theatre. Other attractions include the 
Grand Cinema and the Temple Theatre. Tacoma is at 47°14′29″N 122°27′34″W﻿ 
/ ﻿47.24139°N 122.45944°W﻿ / 47.24139; -122.45944 (47.241371, -122.459389).[34] 
Its elevation is 381 feet (116 m). According to the United States Census 
Bureau, the city has a total area of 62.34 square miles (161.46 km2), of 
which 49.72 square miles (128.77 km2) is land and 12.62 square miles (32.69 km2) 
is water.[1] Tacoma straddles the neighboring Commencement Bay with several 
smaller cities surrounding it. Large areas of Tacoma have excellent views 
of Mt. Rainier. In the event of a major eruption of Mount Rainier, portions 
of Tacoma's industrial area are at risk from lahars. The city is located 
several miles north of Joint Base Lewis-McChord, formerly known separately 
as Fort Lewis and McChord Air Force Base. According to the Köppen climate 
classification, Tacoma lies has a Mediterranean Oceanic climate (Köppen 
Csb). As of 2000 the median income for a household in the city was $37,879, 
and the median income for a family was $45,567. Males had a median income 
of $35,820, versus $27,697 for females. The per capita income for the city 
was $19,130. About 11.4% of families and 15.9% of the population were below 
the poverty line, including 20.6% of those under the age of 18 and 10.9% 
of those 65 and older. As of the census[2] of 2010, there were 198,397 
people, 78,541 households, and 45,716 families residing in the city. The 
population density was 3,864.9 inhabitants per square mile (1,492.2/km2). 
There were 81,102 housing units at an average density of 1,619.4 per square 
mile (625.3/km2). The racial makeup of the city was 64.9% White (60.5% 
Non-Hispanic White[40]), 12.2% African American, 8.2% Asian (2.1% Vietnamese, 
1.6% Cambodian, 1.3% Korean, 1.3% Filipino, 0.4% Chinese, 0.4% Japanese, 
0.2% Indian, 0.2% Laotian, 0.1% Thai), 1.8% Native American, 1.2% Pacific 
Islander (0.7% Samoan, 0.2% Guamanian, 0.1% Native Hawaiian), and 8.1% 
were from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino residents of any race were 
11.3% of the population (8.1% Mexican, 1.1% Puerto Rican). There were 78,541 
households of which 31.0% had children under the age of 18 living with 
them, 37.8% were married couples living together, 14.8% had a female householder 
with no husband present, 5.6% had a male householder with no wife present, 
and 41.8% were non-families. 32.3% of all households were made up of individuals 
and 9.6% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The 
average household size was 2.44 and the average family size was 3.10. The 
median age in the city was 35.1 years. 23% of residents were under the 
age of 18; 10.9% were between the ages of 18 and 24; 29.6% were from 25 
to 44; 25.3% were from 45 to 64; and 11.3% were 65 years of age or older. 
The gender makeup of the city was 49.4% male and 50.6% female. The government 
of the city of Tacoma operates under a council-manager system. The city 
council consists of an elected mayor (Marilyn Strickland) and eight elected 
council members, five from individual city council districts and three 
others from the city at-large. All serve four-year terms and are elected 
in odd-numbered years. The council adopts and amends city laws, approves 
a two-year budget, establishes city policy, appoints citizens to boards 
and commissions, and performs other actions. The council also meets in 
"standing committees", which break down the council's work into more defined 
areas, such as "Environment & Public Works", "Neighborhoods & Housing", 
and "Public Safety, Human Services & Education". The council meets as a 
whole most Tuesdays at 5:00 p.m. in the council chambers at 747 Market 
St. Meetings are open to the public and provide for public input.. Normal 
day-to-day operations of the city government are administered by Tacoma's 
city manager, who is appointed by the city council.Tacoma's City Manager, 
T.C. Broadnax, was appointed to the office in January 2012.[41] Tacoma 
is the home of several international companies including staffing company 
True Blue Inc. (formerly Labor Ready), lumber company Simpson and the food 
companies Roman Meal and Brown and Haley. Frank C. Mars founded Mars, Incorporated 
in 1911 in Tacoma. Beginning in the 1930s, Tacoma became known for the 
"Tacoma Aroma", a distinctive, acrid odor produced by paper manufacturing 
on the industrial tide flats. In the late 1990s, Simpson Tacoma Kraft reduced 
total sulfur emissions by 90%. This largely eliminated the problem; where 
once the aroma was ever-present, it is now only noticeable occasionally 
downtown, primarily when the wind is coming from the east. U.S. Oil and 
Refining operates an oil refinery on the tide flats in the Port of Tacoma. 
Built in Tacoma in 1952, it currently refines 39,000 barrels of petroleum 
per day. The Tacoma Mall is the largest shopping center in Tacoma. It is 
owned by Simon Property Group. Anchor tenants include JC Penney, Sears, 
Macy's, and Nordstrom. An economic setback for the city occurred in September 
2009 when Russell Investments, which has been located in downtown Tacoma 
since its inception in 1936, announced it was moving its headquarters to 
Seattle along with several hundred white collar jobs.[42] Hospitals in 
Tacoma are operated by MultiCare Health System and Franciscan Health System. 
Hospitals include MultiCare Tacoma General Hospital, Mary Bridge Children's 
Hospital, MultiCare Allenmore Hospital and St. Joseph Medical Center. According 
to Tacoma's 2011 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report,[43] the top employers 
in Pierce County are: Tacoma's system of transportation is based primarily 
on the automobile. The majority of the city has a system of gridded streets 
oriented in relation to A Street (one block east of Pacific Avenue) and 
6th Avenue or Division Avenue, both beginning in downtown Tacoma. Within 
the city, and with a few exceptions, east-to-west streets are numbered 
and north-to-south streets are given a name or a letter. Some east-to-west 
streets are also given names, such as S. Center St. and N. Westgate Blvd. 
Streets are generally labeled "North", "South", "East", or "North East" 
according to their relationship with 6th Avenue or Division Avenue (west 
of 'Division Ave' '6th Avenue' is the lowest-numbered street, making it 
the dividing street between "North" and "South"), 'A' Street (which is 
the dividing line between "East" and "South"), or 1st Street NE (which 
is the dividing line between "East" and "North East"). This can lead to 
confusion, as most named streets intersect streets of the same number in 
both north and south Tacoma. For example, the intersection of South 11th 
Street and South Union Avenue is just ten blocks south of North 11th Street 
and North Union Avenue. To the east of the Thea Foss waterway and 'A' Street, 
streets are similarly divided into "East" and "Northeast", with 1st Street 
NE being in-line with the Pierce-King county line. "North East" covers 
a small wedge of Tacoma and unincorporated Pierce County (around Browns 
Point and Dash Point) lying on the hill across the tideflats from downtown. 
Tacoma does have some major roads which do not seem to follow any naming 
rules. These roads include Schuster Pkwy, Pacific Ave, Puyallup Ave, Tacoma 
Mall Blvd, Marine View Dr (SR 509), and Northshore Pkwy. Tacoma also has 
some major roads which appear to change names in different areas (most 
notable are Tyler St/Stevens St, Oakes St/Pine St/Cedar St/Alder St, and 
S. 72nd St/S. 74th St). These major arterials actually shift over to align 
with other roads, which causes them to have the name changed. This numeric 
system extends to the furthest reaches of unincorporated Pierce County 
(with roads outside of the city carrying "East", "West", "North West", 
and "South West", except on the Key Peninsula, which retains the north-south 
streets but chooses the Pierce-Kitsap county line as the zero point for 
east-west streets. Key Peninsula's roads also carry a "KP N" or "KP S" 
designation at the end of the street name. In portions of the city dating 
back to the Tacoma Streetcar Period (1888–1938), denser mixed use business 
districts exist alongside single family homes. Twelve such districts have 
active, city-recognized business associations and hold "small town"-style 
parades and other festivals. The Proctor District, Tacoma, Old Town, Dome, 
6th Avenue, Stadium, Lincoln Business District, and South Tacoma Business 
Districts are some of the more prominent and popular of these and coordinate 
their efforts to redevelop urban villages through the Cross District Association 
of Tacoma. In newer portions of the city to the west and south, residential 
culs-de-sac, four-lane collector roads and indoor shopping centers are 
more commonplace. Seven highways end in or pass through Tacoma: I-5, I-705, 
SR 7, SR 16, SR 163, SR 167, and SR 509.[44] The dominant intercity transportation 
link between Tacoma and other parts of the Puget Sound is Interstate 5, 
which links Tacoma with Seattle to the north and Portland, Oregon, to the 
south. State Route 16 runs along a concrete viaduct through Tacoma's Nalley 
Valley, connecting Interstate 5 with Central and West Tacoma, the Tacoma 
Narrows Bridge, and the Kitsap Peninsula. Seattle-Tacoma International 
Airport lies 22 miles (35 km) north, in the city of SeaTac. Public transportation 
in Tacoma includes buses, commuter rail, light rail, and ferries. Public 
bus service is provided by Pierce Transit, which serves Tacoma and Pierce 
County. Pierce Transit operates a total of 43 bus routes (5 of which through 
Sound Transit), using mostly buses powered by compressed natural gas. Bus 
service operates at 30-60 minute frequencies daily, while three heavily 
ridden "trunk" routes are mostly served every 20 minutes on weekdays and 
every half hour to an hour on weekends as of October 2, 2011 Sound Transit, 
the regional transit authority, provides weekday Sounder Commuter Rail 
service and daily express bus service to and from Seattle. Sound Transit 
has also established Tacoma Link light rail, a 1.6-mile (2.6 km) free electric 
streetcar line linking Tacoma Dome Station with the University of Washington, 
Tacoma, Tacoma's Museum District, and the Theater District. Expansion of 
the city's rail transit system is currently in planning stages by the city 
of Tacoma and Sound Transit. The line will be extended north along Commerce 
St/Stadium Way and then west along Division Ave. It will then turn south 
along Martin Luther King Jr Way and end near South 19th Street. The Washington 
State Ferries system, which has a dock at Point Defiance, provides ferry 
access to Tahlequah at the southern tip of Vashon Island. Greyhound intercity 
bus service is accessible via Tacoma Dome Station. Amtrak, the national 
passenger rail system, provides service to Tacoma from a station on Puyallup 
Avenue, one block east of the Tacoma Dome Station. The Cascades trains, 
operating as far north as Vancouver, British Columbia and as far south 
as Eugene, Oregon, serve Tacoma several times daily in both directions. 
The long-distance Coast Starlight operates daily between Seattle and Los 
Angeles via the San Francisco Bay Area. Tacoma's relationship with public 
utilities extends back to 1893. At that time the city was undergoing a 
boom in population, causing it to exceed the available amount of fresh 
water supplied by Charles B. Wright's Tacoma Light & Water Company. In 
response to both this demand and a growing desire to have local public 
control over the utility system, the city council put up a public vote 
to acquire and expand the private utility. The measure passed on July 1, 
1893, with 3,195 in favor of acquiring the utility system and 1,956 voting 
against. Since then, Tacoma Public Utilities (TPU) has grown from a small 
water and light utility to be the largest department in the city's government, 
employing about 1,200 people. Tacoma Power, a division of TPU, provides 
residents of Tacoma and several bordering municipalities with electrical 
power generated by eight hydroelectric dams located on the Skokomish River 
and elsewhere. Environmentalists, fishermen, and the Skokomish Indian Tribe 
have criticized TPU's operation of Cushman Dam on the North Fork of the 
Skokomish River; the tribe's $6 billion claim[45] was denied by the U.S. 
Supreme court[46] in January 2006. The capacity of Tacoma's hydroelectric 
system as of 2004 was 713,000 kilowatts, or about 50% of the demand made 
up by TPU's customers (the rest is purchased from other utilities). According 
to TPU, hydroelectricity provides about 87% of Tacoma's power; coal 3%; 
natural gas 1%; nuclear 9%; and biomass and wind at less than 1%. Tacoma 
Power also operates the Click! Network, a municipally owned cable television 
and internet service. The residential cost per kilowatt hour of electricity 
is just over 6 cents. Tacoma Water provides customers in its service area 
with water from the Green River Watershed. As of 2004, Tacoma Water provided 
water services to 93,903 customers. The average annual cost for residential 
supply was $257.84. Tacoma Rail, initially a municipally owned street railway 
line running to the tideflats, was converted to a common-carrier rail switching 
utility. Tacoma Rail is self-supporting and employs over 90 people. In 
addition to municipal garbage collection, Tacoma offers commingled recycling 
services for paper, cardboard, plastics, and metals. Parks and recreation 
services in and around Tacoma are governed by Metro Parks Tacoma, a municipal 
corporation established as a separate entity from the city government in 
1907. Metro Parks maintains over fifty parks and open spaces in Tacoma.[47] 
Point Defiance Park, one of the largest urban parks in the country (at 
700 acres), is located in Tacoma.[48] Scenic Five-Mile Drive allows access 
to many of the park's attractions, such as Owen Beach, Camp Six, Fort Nisqually, 
and the Point Defiance Zoo & Aquarium. There are many historic structures 
within the park, including the Pagoda, which was originally built as a 
streetcar waiting room. It was restored in 1988 and now serves as a rental 
facility for weddings and private parties.[49] The Pagoda was nearly destroyed 
by fire on August 15, 2011.[50] Repair work began immediately after the 
fire and continued until January 2013, at which time the Pagoda was reopened 
for public use. Ruston Way is a waterfront area along Commencement Bay 
north of downtown Tacoma that hosts several public parks connected by a 
multi-use trail and interspersed with restaurants and other businesses. 
Public parks along Ruston Way include Jack Hyde Park, Old Town Dock, Hamilton 
Park, Dickman Mill Park, Les Davis Pier, Marine Park, and Cummings Park.[51] 
The trail is popular with walkers, runners, cyclists, and other recreationalists. 
There are several beaches along Ruston Way with public access, some of 
which are also popular for scuba diving. Another large park in Tacoma is 
Wapato Park, which has a lake and walking trails that circle the lake. 
Wapato is located in the south end of Tacoma, at Sheridan and 72nd St. 
Titlow Beach, located at the end of 6th Avenue, is a popular scuba diving 
area. Wright Park, located near downtown, is a large, English-style park 
designed in the late 19th century by Edward Otto Schwagerl and Ebenezer 
Rhys Roberts. It contains Wright Park Arboretum and the W. W. Seymour Botanical 
Conservatory. This beautiful historic park is also the home of local festivals 
such as Ethnic Fest,[52] Out in the Park (Tacoma's Pride festival [53]), 
and the Tacoma Hempfest (Tacoma's annual gathering advocating decriminalization 
of marijuana). Jefferson Park in North Tacoma is the location of a new 
sprayground, an area designed to be a safe and unique play area where water 
is sprayed from structures or ground sprays and then drained away before 
it can accumulate. Frost Park in downtown Tacoma is often utilized for 
sidewalk chalk contests. In response to the Tacoma area's growing dog population, 
dog parks have become a natural addition to the city. Rogers Off-Leash 
Dog Park is a metro public park established in 1949 Tacoma. The park's 
homepage Tacoma includes several landmarks and was home to some prolific 
architects, including Everett Phipps Babcock, Frederick Heath, Ambrose 
J. Russell, and Silas E. Nelsen. Two suspension bridges currently span 
a narrow section of the Salish Sea called the Tacoma Narrows. The Tacoma 
Narrows Bridges link Tacoma to Gig Harbor and the Kitsap Peninsula. The 
failure of the first Tacoma Narrows Bridge, which was the third longest 
suspension bridge in the world, is a famous case study in architecture 
textbooks. Tacoma has many properties that are listed on the City of Tacoma 
Register of Historic Places, the Washington State Heritage Register, and 
the National Register of Historic Places. The city of Tacoma has an active 
municipal historic preservation program, which includes 165 individual 
City Landmarks and over 1,000 historic properties included within five 
locally regulated historic overlay zones. Engine House No. 9 is a fire 
station built in 1907. The building was placed on the National Register 
of Historic Places in 1975. Currently, the building houses a pub that brews 
its own beer. Stadium High School and the Stadium Bowl, part of the Tacoma 
School District, provided a setting for the movie 10 Things I Hate About 
You starring Heath Ledger and Julia Stiles. Fireboat No. 1 was built in 
1929 for the Port of Tacoma by the Coastline Shipbuilding Company. After 
54 years of service in waterfront fire protection, harbor security patrols, 
search and rescue missions, and water pollution control, Fireboat No. 1 
was put up on a permanent dry berth at a public beach near Tacoma's Old 
Town neighborhood. She is one of only five fireboats designated as a National 
Historic Landmark. Visitors are able to walk around her exterior, but her 
interior is closed to the public. William Ross Rust House is a home in 
Colonial/Classic Revival style built in 1905 by Ambrose J. Russell (architect) 
and Charles Miller (contractor). Murray Morgan Bridge is a 1911 steel lift 
bridge across the Thea Foss Waterway; it closed in 2007 to all automobile 
traffic due to its deteriorating condition but was reopened in February 
2013 to all traffic following a substantial rehabilitation. Other notable 
buildings include the National Realty Building, Lincoln High School (Tacoma, 
Washington), Rhodes House (Tacoma), Pythian Temple (Tacoma, Washington), 
Perkins Building, Tacoma Dome, Rhodesleigh, and Engine House No. 9 (Tacoma, 
Washington). The famous Luzon Building and Nihon Go Gakko (Tacoma) school 
house have been demolished, and the MV Kalakala was scrapped in early 2015. 
University of Puget Sound, Cushman Dam No. 1, Cushman Dam No. 2, Rialto 
Theater (Tacoma, Washington), and Tacoma Union Station are also noteworthy. 
Tacoma's main public school district is Tacoma Public Schools. The district 
contains 36 elementary schools, eleven middle schools, five high schools, 
one alternative high school, a Science and Math Institute (SAMI), and one 
school of the arts (SOTA). Henry Foss High School operates an International 
Baccalaureate program. Sheridan Elementary School operated three foreign 
language immersion programs (Spanish, French, and Japanese). Mount Tahoma 
High School opened a brand new building in South Tacoma in the fall of 
2004. Stadium High School and Wilson High School were remodeled/refurbished 
and reopened in September 2006. Tacoma School of the Arts, opened in 2001, 
is an arts-focused high school that serves as a national model for educational 
innovation. SOTA is a public school, part of the Tacoma Public Schools 
and is one of the first schools in the nation to implement standards based 
instruction, as well as influence the design of many schools in the nation. 
SOTA is located in multiple venues around Downtown Tacoma and uses Community 
Museums and Universities for instructional space. The Science and math 
institute partners with SOTA, sharing administrators and class space. SAMI 
and SOTA are the only schools in Tacoma to offer University of Washington 
in the Classroom college credit options from the University of Washington. 
Lincoln High School reopened in the fall of 2007 after a $75 million renovation 
and expansion.[54][55] The area also has numerous private schools, including 
the Annie Wright School, Bellarmine Preparatory School, Life Christian 
Academy, Charles Wright Academy and Seabury School. Tacoma's Covenant High 
School [56] is associated with Faith Presbyterian Church.[57][58] Tacoma's 
institutions of higher learning include the University of Puget Sound, 
Tacoma Community College, City University of Seattle-Tacoma, Bates Technical 
College, The Evergreen State College Tacoma Campus, Corban University School 
of Ministry/Tacoma Campus, and University of Washington Tacoma. Pacific 
Lutheran University is located in Parkland, just south of the city; nearby

The city's major daily newspaper is The News Tribune, a subsidiary of McClatchy 
Newspapers since 1986. Its circulation is about 85,000 (100,000 on Sundays), 
making it the third-largest newspaper in the state of Washington. A daily 
newspaper has been in circulation in Tacoma since 1883. Between 1907 and 
1918, four dailies were published: The Tacoma Ledger, The News, The Tacoma 
Tribune, and The Tacoma Times. Tacoma receives Seattle-area TV and radio 
stations. Tacoma is home to KBTC Public Television, a PBS member station 
serving viewers throughout western Washington. KBTC is housed at the former 
home of long-time Tacoma broadcaster, KSTW. The property was purchased 
from KSTW when that station moved to Renton in 2001. It broadcasts on digital 
channel 27, (28.1, 28.2, MHz Worldview, and 28.3, TVW). KBTC Public Television 
is a service of Bates Technical College. Local papers include the Tacoma 
Weekly, the legal paper Tacoma Daily Index, the South Sound alternative 
newsweekly Weekly Volcano and the military publication the Fort Lewis Ranger.[68] 
The city has struggled to keep a minor league hockey franchise. The Tacoma 
Rockets of the WHL were lost to relocation and moved to Kelowna, British 
Columbia. The Tacoma Sabercats of the former West Coast Hockey League closed 
their doors due to financial woes. The Tacoma Dome still hosts traveling 
sports and other events, such as pro wrestling, figure skating tours, and 
the Harlem Globetrotters. At one point, the Tacoma Dome was home to a professional 
indoor soccer team, the Tacoma Stars. For the 1994–95 season, the Seattle 
SuperSonics played in the Tacoma Dome while the Seattle Center Coliseum 
was renovated (and renamed KeyArena). The Tacoma Dome also hosted the 1988 
and 1989 Women's NCAA Final Four. Tacoma is home to the all-female flat
