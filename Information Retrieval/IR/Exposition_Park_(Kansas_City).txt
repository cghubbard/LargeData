Exposition Park is a former baseball ground located in Kansas City, Missouri, 
USA. The ground was home to the Kansas City Cowboys of the American Association 
for the 1888 and 1889 seasons. It was located at 15th & Montgall from 1888 
to 1902 in the 18th and Vine-Downtown East, Kansas City neighborhood.[1] 
It was on the grounds of the Kansas City exposition park which had opened 
in 1886 between 12th and 15th Street on Kansas Street -- the center piece 
of which was a 80,000 square foot building modeled on the The Crystal Palace 
until it was destroyed in 1901 in a fire that had occurred just a week 
after plans were announced to dismantle it.[2] The first football game 
between Kansas and Missouri was played here on October 31, 1891 (Kansas 
beat Missouri 22-8 before a crowd of about 3,000).[3] It was site of one 
of the first night games when the Kansas City Blues played the Sioux City 
Cornhuskers on August 28, 1894 --- an event in which the players dressed 
in costume. [4] The Cornhuskers were bought by Charles Comiskey following 
the 1894 season and eventually became the Chicago White Sox. The stadium 
was also home to other Kansas City teams: Coordinates: 39°05′41″N 94°33′03″W﻿
