The Western Michigan Broncos are a National Collegiate Athletic Association 
(NCAA) Division I Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) team representing Western 
Michigan University (WMU). They compete in the Mid-American Conference 
in men's baseball, basketball, football, soccer and tennis; and women's 
basketball, cross-country, golf, gymnastics, soccer, softball, track and 
field, and volleyball. The men's ice hockey team competes in the National 
Collegiate Hockey Conference. The Broncos also have a flight team, the 
SkyBroncos, who have won the National Intercollegiate Flying Association 
(NIFA) National Championship award five times. The Broncos have won two 
NCAA national championships. The men's cross country team won the NCAA 
title in 1964 and 1965. WMU finished as national runners up in 1955 for 
baseball and 1958 for men's cross country. The facilities include Waldo 
Stadium (football), University Arena (men's and women's basketball, volleyball), 
Lawson Arena (hockey), Hyames Field (baseball), Ebert Field (softball), 
Sorensen Courts/West Hills Athletic Club (men's and women's tennis), and 
Kanley Track (women's track and field). The soccer teams compete at the 
WMU Soccer Complex located near the Parkview Campus. The school's primary 
rival is Central Michigan University. WMU athletic teams were once known 
as the Hilltoppers, a reference to the school's location on top of Prospect 
Hill, but changed their nickname in 1939 to the Broncos to avoid confusion 
with teams of other schools such as the Western Kentucky Hilltoppers. John 
Gill, an assistant coach on the football team who later served as head 
coach, coined the new athletic nickname after approval for the name change 
was granted by the school's athletic board. In 2011, WMU commissioned artist 
Revere La Noue to create a 6,500-square-foot building wrap representing 
the Broncos for the 2011 ArtPrize competition. WMU president John Dunn 
has said that the work, "Epic Broncos", captures the "history and pride 
of being a Bronco".[2] The baseball team has represented WMU since its 
first season in 1911, compiling an overall record of 1,822–1349–23 (.574) 
through 2012.[3] They have appeared in the College World Series six times, 
most recently in 1963. In the 1955 College World Series, WMU finished as 
the NCAA runner-up, losing to Wake Forest 7–6 in the championship game.[3] 
WMU has won 15 Mid-American Conference championships, including 13 of 19 
from 1949 to 1967 and most recently, the conference tournament in 2016. 
The Broncos are coached by Billy Gernon. The men's soccer team won the 
MAC tournament championship in 2003. They are coached by Chad Wiseman. 
A famous former player is Rob Friend, who transferred to the University 
of California, Santa Barbara's Men's Soccer program. He plays in Major 
League Soccer (MLS) for the LA Galaxy, as well as the Canadian National 
Team. On November 9, 2013, Western Michigan women's soccer team won the 
Mid-American Conference tournament championship and a trip to the NCAA 
tournament. The MAC Championship is the second for the program, coming 
10 years from the first one in 2003. The Bronco softball team has appeared 
in three Women's College World Series, in 1980, 1981 and 1982 (NCAA).[4] 
The volleyball team has been competing at Western Michigan University since 
1965. In that span, the team has won 7 MAC regular season championships 
(1983, 1984, 1985, 1986, 1987, 1988, 2000) and 4 MAC tournament championships 
(1987, 1988, 1989, 2000). WMU's all-time overall record is 705-482-9 (.593)

in 1964 and 1965,[5] and finished as national runners up in 1958. The women's 
gymnastics team won the MAC championship in 2006 and 2013. The Broncos 
track and field sprint medley relay team is currently[when?] ranked #1 
in the NCAA.[6] For the 2010–11 season, WMU was awarded the Cartwright 
Award, given to one MAC program each season for excellence in academics, 
athletics and citizenship.[7] For the season, WMU won the Jacoby Trophy 
(most successful women's program) and finished second for the Reese Trophy 
(most successful men's program).[7] Although the sport of synchronized 
skating is not an official NCAA sport Western Michigan is home to an internationally 
competitive synchronized skating team, who have medalled at competitions 
around the world. The Bronco's synchronized skating program consists of 
a senior team, which competes internationally as well as a collegiate level 
team which is competitive among the top university and collegiate teams 
from around the United States. The team lost their athletic funding and 
Varsity status along with Men's Cross Country and Track & Field in the 
2003-2004 competitive season, and became a Club sport. Founded in 1990, 
Western Michigan plays college rugby in Division I in the north division 
of the MAC Conference.[8] The Broncos reached the MAC conference semifinals 
in 2014.[9] The Broncos play their home matches at UpJohn Park in Kalamazoo.
