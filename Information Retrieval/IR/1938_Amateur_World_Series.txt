The 1938 Amateur World Series was the inaugural tournament in what was 
later known as the Baseball World Cup. It was contested by Great Britain 
and the United States over a series of five games from August 13 through 
August 18 in England. It was won by Great Britain. In contrast to later 
years, the USA national squad was not composed of minor league players, 
who are by definition not amateurs. Rather, it consisted mainly of high 
school and college students preparing to compete in the 1940 Olympics (which 
eventually never actually occurred due to the Second World War). The team's 
the manager was Les Mann. The British team was chosen from the London and 
Yorkshire Major Leagues and included a large number of Canadian-born players.
