Stephen Bradley Wilkerson (born June 1, 1977) is an American former college 
and professional baseball player who was an outfielder and first baseman 
in Major League Baseball for eight seasons. Wilkerson played college baseball 
for the University of Florida, and was selected by the Montreal Expos in 
the first round of the 1998 Major League Baseball Draft. During his Major 
League career, he played for the Expos, Washington Nationals, Boston Red 
Sox, Texas Rangers, Seattle Mariners and Toronto Blue Jays. Wilkerson was 
born in Owensboro, Kentucky, where he attended and played baseball at Apollo 
High School. Wilkerson played for the US national junior baseball team 
in 1995. He was the most valuable player (MVP) of the World Junior Baseball 
Championship, pitching a three-hit shutout against Taiwan in the gold medal 
game, hitting .360, and leading Team USA with three home runs and eight 
runs batted in (RBI) for the tournament. A line drive hitter and versatile 
defensive player, Wilkerson received an athletic scholarship to attend 
the University of Florida in Gainesville, Florida, where he played for 
coach Andy Lopez's Florida Gators baseball team from 1996 to 1998. A three-time 
first-team All-American, Wilkerson led the Gators to the College World 
Series in 1996 and 1998 with both his hitting and pitching. In the 1996 
College World Series, he hit a dramatic grand slam to defeat the rival 
Florida State Seminoles. As a junior in 1998, he became the first player 
in college history to hit 20 home runs, steal 20 bases, and win 10 games 
as a pitcher in the same year. The Gators advanced to the 1998 College 
World Series, and he was named College Player of the Year by Rotary Smith.[1] 
Wilkerson was inducted into the University of Florida Athletic Hall of 
Fame as a "Gator Great" in 2010,[2][3] and the National College Baseball 
Hall of Fame in 2012.[4] In 2014, he received his bachelor's degree in 
sport management from the University of Florida.[5] Wilkerson was selected 
by the Montreal Expos in the first round (33rd pick) of the 1998 Major 
League Baseball Draft. Initially, he struggled in the minors. In 1999, 
Wilkerson hit .235 with eight home runs and 49 RBI at Double-A Harrisburg. 
Back in the Eastern League to start the (2000) season, Wilkerson tore up 
the league, hitting .336, 6, 44 with 36 doubles. He was on pace to break 
the Eastern League record for doubles in a season before he was promoted 
to Triple-A Ottawa, of the International League. For the season, he was 
hitting .304-15-75 with 47 doubles in 408 at-bats. While coming up through 
the minors, Wilkerson was a member of the gold medal-winning USA baseball 
team in the Sydney Olympics. In one of the biggest upsets in Olympic history, 
Team USA defeated Cuba 4–0 in the Gold Medal Game. Wilkerson debuted with 
Montreal on July 12, (2001), appearing in 38 games at left field. He recorded 
his first major league hit off Tim Wakefield of the Boston Red Sox on July 
17, 2001 and his first major league home run off of Atlanta Braves pitcher 
Jason Marquis on July 26, 2001. From 2002–2003, Wilkerson delivered almost 
identical seasons with a .266 average, 20 home runs and 59 RBI in (2002), 
and .268, 19, 77 in (2003). In 2002, he hit 20 home runs, an Expos rookie 
record and was named Rookie of the Year by The Sporting News. His most 
productive season came in (2004), when he posted career-highs in homers 
(32), hits (146), doubles (39), runs (112), walks (106), slugging percentage 
(.498) and OPS (.872), and hitting .255 with 67 RBI. In 2004, he hit the 
last home run in Expos history. He appeared once more in a Montreal Expos 
uniform during the Major League Baseball Japan All-Star Series shortly 
after the 2004 regular season. The Expos were to become the Washington 
Nationals for the 2005 season, prompting some to refer to Wilkerson as 
"The Last Expo." Wilkerson open the 2005 season as the regular center fielder 
and leadoff hitter with the Expos moved to Washington. On December 7, 2005, 
Wilkerson was traded to the Texas Rangers along with outfielder Terrmel 
Sledge and minor league pitching prospect Armando Galarraga for second 
baseman Alfonso Soriano. Wilkerson has hit for the cycle twice, the first 
on June 24, 2003, against Pittsburgh (with the Expos). In that occurrence, 
Wilkerson became the first player since 1957 to have the minimum four plate 
appearances and hit for a natural cycle. The second time was on April 6, 
2005, against Philadelphia (with the Nationals, in their second game after 
moving from Montreal). Wilkerson also hit the first grand slam home run 
hit by a Washington Nationals player While playing for the Texas Rangers 
in 2007, Wilkerson hit three home runs in one game – the third player to 
do so in 2007 behind Alfonso Soriano and Carlos Lee. An injury to, and 
later the trade of, Mark Teixeira led to Wilkerson making many of his starts 
at first base in 2007. On January 31, 2008, Wilkerson signed a one-year 
contract with the Seattle Mariners. On April 30, he was designated for 
assignment, and on May 8 was given his unconditional release. May 9, he 
signed with the Toronto Blue Jays. On August 22, he was put on the 15-day 
disabled list by the Toronto Blue Jays .[6] On October 30, 2008, Wilkerson 
filed for free-agency from Toronto.[7] On February 16, 2009, Wilkerson 
signed a minor league contract with an invitation to spring training with 
the Boston Red Sox.[8] Wilkerson decided to retire in 2009, having had 
one hit in nine Triple-A at-bats in the Boston minor league affiliate. 
He retired with a .247 batting average, .350 on-base percentage and 122 
home runs. On February 23, 2010, Wilkerson attempted a brief comeback by 
agreeing to a minor league contract with the Philadelphia Phillies. However, 
he was released on March 29. In 2014, Wilkerson agreed to manage a middle 
school baseball team at The King's Academy in West Palm Beach, Florida, 
leading the team to a league championship in his first year.[9] After the 
season, Wilkerson was hired as the school's varsity baseball coach.[10]
