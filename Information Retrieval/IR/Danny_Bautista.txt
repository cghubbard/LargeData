Daniel Bautista Alc√°ntara (born May 24, 1972 in Santo Domingo, Dominican 
Republic) is a former Major League Baseball (MLB) baseball outfielder. 
He is more commonly known as Danny Bautista. Bautista was signed by the 
Detroit Tigers in 1989. In 1993, he joined the major leagues with the Tigers. 
Although he hit for an average of .331 his first season as a Tiger, his 
power numbers there were not spectacular, and his batting average as a 
member of the Tigers decreased considerably over the next four seasons. 
In 1996, he was traded to the Atlanta Braves. He played three seasons there, 
but he also failed to produce good offensive numbers, his best batting 
average as a Brave being .250 in 1998. He produced somewhat better offensive 
numbers as a member of the Florida Marlins in 1999, hitting for an average 
of .288. In 2000, he continued his improvement in offensive numbers, hitting 
double digits in homeruns for the first time in his career (11), while 
hitting for an average of .317 after a midseason trade to the Arizona Diamondbacks.[1] 
He ended that year hitting a combined season average of .283. He would 
reach double digit homeruns once more in his final MLB season; hitting 
11 in 2004. Bautista won a World Series ring when the Diamondbacks beat 
the New York Yankees in seven games at the 2001 World Series, hitting .583 
in the Series, fifth all-time in a single World Series. In 2004, Bautista 
hit safely in 21 consecutive games. The streak ended during a game against 
the Philadelphia Phillies when Bautista went hitless in two at-bats. Bautista 
announced his retirement from baseball on March 19, 2005 following an ankle 
injury. Bautista had, at the time of his retirement, 685 hits at the major 
league level with a batting average of .272. Danny played in the Atlantic 
League of Professional Baseball, which is not affiliated with MLB, for 
the York Revolution in the first season of the team's existence. After
