Saint Paul (/ˌseɪnt ˈpɔːl/; abbreviated St. Paul) is the capital and second-most 
populous city of the U.S. state of Minnesota. As of 2015, the city's estimated 
population was 300,851.[3] Saint Paul is the county seat of Ramsey County, 
the smallest and most densely populated county in Minnesota.[5] The city 
lies mostly on the east bank of the Mississippi River in the area surrounding 
its point of confluence with the Minnesota River, and adjoins Minneapolis, 
the state's largest city. Known as the "Twin Cities", the two form the 
core of Minneapolis–Saint Paul, the 16th-largest metropolitan area in the 
United States, with about 3.52 million residents.[6] Founded near historic 
Native American settlements as a trading and transportation center, the 
city rose to prominence when it was named the capital of the Minnesota 
Territory in 1849. Though Minneapolis is better-known nationally, Saint 
Paul contains the state government and other important institutions.[7] 
Regionally, the city is known for the Xcel Energy Center, home of the Minnesota 
Wild,[8] and for the Science Museum of Minnesota.[9][10] As a business 
hub of the Upper Midwest, it is the headquarters of companies such as Ecolab.[11] 
Saint Paul, along with its Twin City, Minneapolis, is known for its high 
literacy rate. It was the only city in the United States with a population 
of 250,000 or more to see an increase in circulation of Sunday newspapers 
in 2007.[12] The settlement originally began at present-day Lambert's Landing, 
but was known as Pig's Eye after Pierre "Pig's Eye" Parrant established 
a popular tavern there. When Lucien Galtier, the first Catholic pastor 
of the region, established the Log Chapel of Saint Paul (shortly thereafter 
to become the first location of the Cathedral of Saint Paul), he made it 
known that the settlement was now to be called by that name, as "Saint 
Paul as applied to a town or city was well appropriated, this monosyllable 
is short, sounds good, it is understood by all Christian denominations".[13] 
Burial mounds in present-day Indian Mounds Park suggest that the area was 
originally inhabited by the Hopewell Native Americans about two thousand 
years ago.[14][15] From the early 17th century until 1837, the Mdewakanton 
Dakota, a tribe of the Sioux, lived near the mounds after fleeing their 
ancestral home of Mille Lacs Lake from advancing Ojibwe.[14][16] They called 
the area I-mni-za ska dan ("little white rock") for its exposed white sandstone 
cliffs.[17][18] Following the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, a U.S. Army officer 
named Zebulon Pike negotiated approximately 100,000 acres (40,000 ha; 160 sq mi) 
of land from the local Dakota tribes in 1805 in order to establish a fort. 
The negotiated territory was located on both banks of the Mississippi River, 
starting from Saint Anthony Falls in present-day Minneapolis, to its confluence 
with the Saint Croix River.[19] Fort Snelling was built on the territory 
in 1819 at the confluence of the Mississippi and Minnesota Rivers, which 
formed a natural barrier to both Native American nations. The 1837 Treaty 
with the Sioux ceded all local tribal land east of the Mississippi to the 
U.S. Government.[20] Taoyateduta (Chief Little Crow V) moved his band at 
Kaposia across the river to the south.[21][22] Fur traders, explorers, 
and missionaries came to the area for the fort's protection. Many of the 
settlers were French-Canadians who lived nearby. However, as a whiskey 
trade flourished, military officers banned settlers from the fort-controlled 
lands. Pierre "Pig's Eye" Parrant, a retired fur trader-turned-bootlegger 
who particularly irritated officials,[23] set up his tavern, the Pig's 
Eye, near present-day Lambert's Landing.[18] By the early 1840s, the community 
had become important as a trading center and a destination for settlers 
heading west. Locals called the area Pig's Eye (French: L'Œil du Cochon) 
or Pig's Eye Landing after Parrant's popular tavern.[23] In 1841, Father 
Lucien Galtier was sent to minister to the Catholic French-Canadians and 
established a chapel, named for his favorite saint, Paul the Apostle, on 
the bluffs above Lambert's Landing.[24][25] Galtier intended for the settlement 
to adopt the name Saint Paul in honor of the new chapel.[23] In 1847, a 
New York educator named Harriet Bishop moved to the area and opened the 
city's first school.[26] The Minnesota Territory was formalized in 1849 
and Saint Paul named as its capital. In 1857, the territorial legislature 
voted to move the capital to Saint Peter. However, Joe Rolette, a territorial 
legislator, stole the physical text of the approved bill and went into 
hiding, thus preventing the move.[27] On May 11, 1858, Minnesota was admitted 
to the union as the thirty-second state, with Saint Paul as the capital. 
That year, more than 1,000 steamboats were in service at Saint Paul,[26] 
making the city a gateway for settlers to the Minnesota frontier or Dakota 
Territory. Natural geography was a primary reason that the city became 
a landing. The area was the last accessible point to unload boats coming 
upriver due to the Mississippi River Valley's stone bluffs. During this 
period, Saint Paul was called "The Last City of the East."[28] Industrialist 
James J. Hill constructed and expanded his network of railways into the 
Great Northern Railway and Northern Pacific Railway, which were headquartered 
in Saint Paul. Today they are collectively part of the BNSF Railway.[28] 
On August 20, 1904, severe thunderstorms and tornadoes damaged hundreds 
of downtown buildings, causing USD $1.78 million ($46.96 million present-day) 
in damages to the city and ripping spans from the High Bridge.[29] In the 
1960s, during urban renewal, Saint Paul razed western neighborhoods close 
to downtown. The city also contended with the creation of the interstate 
freeway system in a fully built landscape.[30] From 1959 to 1961, the western 
Rondo neighborhood was demolished by the construction of Interstate 94, 
which brought attention to racial segregation and unequal housing in northern 
cities.[31] The annual Rondo Days celebration commemorates the African 
American community.[32] Downtown had short skyscraper-building booms beginning 
in the 1970s. The tallest buildings, such as Galtier Plaza (Jackson and 
Sibley Towers), The Pointe of Saint Paul condominiums, and the city's tallest 
building, Wells Fargo Place (formerly Minnesota World Trade Center), were 
constructed in the late 1980s.[33] In the 1990s and 2000s, the tradition 
of bringing new immigrant groups to the city continued. As of 2004, nearly 
10% of the city's population were recent Hmong immigrants from Vietnam, 
Laos, Cambodia, Thailand, and Myanmar.[34] Saint Paul is the location of 
the Hmong Archives.[35] Saint Paul's history and growth as a landing port 
are tied to water. The city's defining physical characteristic, the confluence 
of the Mississippi and Minnesota Rivers, was carved into the region during 
the last ice age, as were the steep river bluffs and dramatic palisades 
on which the city is built. Receding glaciers and Lake Agassiz forced torrents 
of water from a glacial river that undercut the river valleys.[36] The 
city is situated in east-central Minnesota. The Mississippi River forms 
a municipal boundary on part of the city's west, southwest, and southeast 
sides. Minneapolis, the state's largest city, lies to the west. Falcon 
Heights, Lauderdale, Roseville, and Maplewood are north, with Maplewood 
lying to the east. The cities of West Saint Paul and South Saint Paul are 
to the south, as are Lilydale, Mendota, and Mendota Heights, although across 
the river from the city. The city's largest lakes are Pig's Eye Lake, which 
is part of the Mississippi, Lake Phalen, and Lake Como. According to the 
United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 56.18 square 
miles (145.51 km2), of which 51.98 square miles (134.63 km2) is land and 
4.20 square miles (10.88 km2) is water.[1] Saint Paul's Department of Planning 
and Economic Development divides Saint Paul into seventeen Planning Districts, 
created in 1979 to allow neighborhoods to participate in governance and 
utilize Community Development Block Grants. With a funding agreement directly 
from the city, the councils share a pool of funds.[37] The councils have 
significant land-use control, a voice in guiding development, and they 
organize residents.[38] The boundaries are adjusted depending on population 
changes; as such, they sometimes overlap established neighborhoods.[39] 
Though these neighborhoods changed overtime, many of their historically 
significant structures have been saved by preservationists. The city's 
seventeen Planning Districts are: Saint Paul has a continental climate 
typical of the Upper Midwestern United States. Winters are frigid and snowy, 
while summers are hot and humid. On the Köppen climate classification, 
Saint Paul falls in the hot summer humid continental climate zone (Dfa). 
The city experiences a full range of precipitation and related weather 
events, including snow, sleet, ice, rain, thunderstorms, tornadoes, and 
fog.[40] Due to its northerly location in the United States and lack of 
large bodies of water to moderate the air, Saint Paul is sometimes subjected 
to cold Arctic air masses, especially during late December, January, and 
February. The average annual temperature of 47.05 °F (8.36 °C) gives the 
Minneapolis−Saint Paul metropolitan area the coldest annual mean temperature 
of any major metropolitan area in the continental U.S.[41] The earliest 
known inhabitants from about 400 A.D. were members of the Hopewell tradition 
who buried their dead in mounds (now Indian Mounds Park) on the bluffs 
above the river. The next known inhabitants were the Mdewakanton Dakota 
in the 17th century who fled their ancestral home of Mille Lacs Lake in 
central Minnesota in response to westward expansion of the Ojibwe nation.[16] 
The Ojibwe would later occupy the north (east) bank of the Mississippi 
River. By 1800, French-Canadian explorers came through the region and attracted 
fur traders to the area. Fort Snelling and nearby Pig's Eye Tavern also 
brought the first Yankees from New England and English, Irish, and Scottish 
immigrants who had enlisted in the army and settled nearby after discharge. 
These early settlers and entrepreneurs built houses on the heights north 
of the river. The first wave of immigration came with the Irish who settled 
at Connemara Patch along the Mississippi, named for their home in Connemara 
Ireland. The Irish would become prolific in politics, city governance, 
and public safety, much to the chagrin of the Germans and French who had 
grown into the majority. In 1850, the first of many groups of Swedish immigrants 
passed through Saint Paul on their way to farming communities in northern 
and western regions of the territory. A large group settled in Swede Hollow, 
which would later become home to Poles, Italians, and Mexicans. The last 
Swedish presence had moved up Saint Paul's East Side along Payne Avenue 
in the 1950s.[51] In terms of people who specified European ancestry in 
the 2005-2007 American Community Survey, the city was 26.4% German, 13.8% 
Irish, 8.4% Norwegian, 7.0% Swedish, and 6.2% English. There is also a 
visible community of people of Sub-Saharan African ancestry, representing 
4.2% of Saint Paul's population. By the 1980s, the Thomas Dale area, once 
an Austro-Hungarian enclave known as Frogtown (German: Froschburg), became 
home to Vietnamese people who left their war-torn country. Soon after a 
settlement program for the Hmong diaspora came, and by 2000, the Saint 
Paul Hmong were the largest urban contingent in the United States.[52][53][54] 
Mexican immigrants have settled in Saint Paul's West Side since the 1930s, 
and have grown enough that Mexico opened a foreign consulate in 2005.[55][56] 
The majority of residents claiming religious affiliation are Christian, 
split between the Roman Catholic Church and various Protestant denominations. 
The Roman Catholic presence comes from Irish, German, Scottish, and French 
Canadian settlers who, in time, would be bolstered by Hispanic immigrants. 
There are Jewish synagogues such as Mount Zion Temple and relatively small 
populations of Hindus, Muslims, and Buddhists.[57] The city has been dubbed 
"paganistan" due to its large Wiccan population.[58] As of the 2005-2007 
American Community Survey conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau, White Americans 
made up 66.5% of Saint Paul's population; of which 62.1% were non-Hispanic 
whites, down from 93.6% in 1970.[49] Blacks or African Americans made up 
13.9% of Saint Paul's population; of which 13.5% were non-Hispanic blacks. 
American Indians made up 0.8% of Saint Paul's population; of which 0.6% 
were non-Hispanic. Asian Americans made up 12.3% of Saint Paul's population; 
of which 12.2% were non-Hispanic. Pacific Islander Americans made up less 
than 0.1% of Saint Paul's population. Individuals from some other race 
made up 3.4% of Saint Paul's population; of which 0.2% were non-Hispanic. 
Individuals from two or more races made up 3.1% of Saint Paul's population; 
of which 2.6% were non-Hispanic. In addition, Hispanics and Latinos made 
up 8.7% of Saint Paul's population. As of the 2000 U.S. Census,[59] there 
were 287,151 people, 112,109 households, and 60,999 families residing in 
the city. The racial makeup of the city was 67.0% White, 11.7% African 
American, 1.1% Native American, 12.4% Asian (mostly Hmong), 0.1% Pacific 
Islander, 3.8% from other races, and 3.9% from two or more races. Hispanic 
or Latino of any race were 7.9% of the population. As of the census[2] 
of 2010, there were 285,068 people, 111,001 households, and 59,689 families 
residing in the city. The population density was 5,484.2 inhabitants per 
square mile (2,117.5/km2). There were 120,795 housing units at an average 
density of 2,323.9 per square mile (897.3/km2). The racial makeup of the 
city was 60.1% white, 15.7% African American, 1.1% Native American, 15.0% 
Asian, 0.1% Pacific Islander, 3.9% from other races, and 4.2% from two 
or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 9.6% of the population. 
There were 111,001 households of which 30.4% had children under the age 
of 18 living with them, 34.1% were married couples living together, 14.8% 
had a female householder with no husband present, 4.9% had a male householder 
with no wife present, and 46.2% were non-families. 35.8% of all households 
were made up of individuals and 8.5% had someone living alone who was 65 
years of age or older. The average household size was 2.47 and the average 
family size was 3.33. The median age in the city was 30.9 years. 25.1% 
of residents were under the age of 18; 13.9% were between the ages of 18 
and 24; 29.6% were from 25 to 44; 22.6% were from 45 to 64; and 9% were 
65 years of age or older. The gender makeup of the city was 48.9% male 
and 51.1% female. The Minneapolis–Saint Paul–Bloomington area employs 1,570,700 
people in the private sector as of July 2008, 82.43 percent of which work 
in private service providing-related jobs.[60] Major corporations headquartered 
in Saint Paul include Ecolab, a chemical and cleaning product company[61] 
which was named in 2008 by the Minneapolis / St. Paul Business Journal 
as the eighth best place to work in the Twin Cites for companies with 1,000 
full-time Minnesota employees,[62] Securian Financial Group Inc.[63] and 
Gander Mountain, a retailer of sporting goods which operates 115 stores 
in 23 states.[64] The 3M Company is often cited as one of Saint Paul's 
companies, though it is located in adjacent Maplewood, Minnesota. 3M employs 
16,000 people throughout Minnesota.[65] St. Jude Medical, a manufacturer 
of medical devices, is directly across the municipal border of Saint Paul 
in Little Canada,[66] though the company's address is listed in Saint Paul.[67] 
The city was home to the Ford Motor Company's Twin Cities Assembly Plant, 
which opened in 1924 and closed at the end of 2011. The plant was in Highland 
Park on the Mississippi River, adjacent to Lock and Dam No. 1, Mississippi 
River, which generates hydroelectric power.[68] The site is now being cleared 
of all buildings and tested for contamination to prepare for redevelopment.[69] 
In winter months, Saint Paul hosts the Saint Paul Winter Carnival, a tradition 
that originated in 1886 when a New York reporter called Saint Paul "another 
Siberia." Attended by 350,000 visitors annually, the event showcases ice 
sculpting, an annual treasure hunt, winter food, activities, and an ice 
palace.[70] The Como Zoo and Conservatory and adjoining Japanese Garden 
are popular year-round. The historic Landmark Center in downtown Saint 
Paul hosts cultural and arts organizations. The city's notable recreation 
locations include Indian Mounds Park, Battle Creek Regional Park, Harriet 
Island Regional Park, Highland Park, the Wabasha Street Caves, Lake Como, 
Lake Phalen, and Rice Park, as well as several areas abutting the Mississippi 
River. The Irish Fair of Minnesota is also held annually at the Harriet 
Island Pavilion area. And the country's largest Hmong American sports festival, 
the Freedom Festival, is held the first weekend of July at McMurray Field 
near Como Park. The city is associated with the Minnesota State Fair in 
nearby Falcon Heights just north of Saint Paul's Midway neighborhood and 
southeast of the University of Minnesota Saint Paul Campus. Though Fort 
Snelling is on the Minneapolis side of the Mississippi River bluff, the 
area including Fort Snelling State Park and Pike Island is managed by the 
Minnesota Department of Natural Resources headquartered in the city.[71] 
Saint Paul is the birthplace of cartoonist Charles M. Schulz (Peanuts), 
who lived in Merriam Park from infancy until 1960.[72] Schulz's Snoopy 
cartoon inspired giant, decorated Peanuts sculptures around the city, a 
Chamber of Commerce promotion in the late 1990s.[73] Other notable residents 
include writer F. Scott Fitzgerald, playwright August Wilson, who premiered 
many of the ten plays in his Pittsburgh Cycle at the local Penumbra Theater, 
painter LeRoy Neiman, and photographer John Vachon.[74] The Ordway Center 
for the Performing Arts hosts theater productions and the Minnesota Opera 
is a founding tenant.[75] RiverCentre, attached to Xcel Energy Center, 
serves as the city's convention center. The city has contributed to the 
music of Minnesota and the Twin Cities music scene through various venues. 
Great jazz musicians have passed through the influential Artists' Quarter, 
first established in the 1970s in Whittier, Minneapolis, and moved to downtown 
Saint Paul in 1994.[76] Artists' Quarter also hosts the Soapboxing Poetry 
Slam, home of the 2009 National Poetry Slam Champions. At The Black Dog, 
in Lowertown, many French or European jazz musicians (Evan Parker, Tony 
Hymas, Benoît Delbecq, François Corneloup...) have met Twin Cities musicians 
and started new groups touring in Europe. Groups and performers such as 
Fantastic Merlins, Dean Magraw/Davu Seru, Merciless Ghosts, and Willie 
Murphy are regulars. The Turf Club in Midway has been a music scene landmark 
since the 1940s.[77] Saint Paul is also the home base of the internationally 
acclaimed Rose Ensemble.[78] As an Irish stronghold, the city boasts popular 
Irish pubs with live music, such as Shamrocks, The Dubliner, and O'Gara's. 
The internationally acclaimed Saint Paul Chamber Orchestra is the nation's 
only full-time professional chamber orchestra.[79] The Minnesota Centennial 
Showboat on the Mississippi River began in 1958 with Minnesota's first 
centennial celebration.[80] Saint Paul hosts a number of museums, including 
the University of Minnesota's Goldstein Museum of Design,[81] the Minnesota 
Children's Museum,[82] the Schubert Club Museum of Musical Instruments,[83][84] 
the Minnesota Museum of American Art,[85][86] the Traces Center for History 
and Culture,[87] the Minnesota History Center, the Alexander Ramsey House, 
the James J. Hill House, the Minnesota Transportation Museum, the Science 
Museum of Minnesota, and The Twin City Model Railroad Museum. The Saint 
Paul division of Parks and Recreation runs over 1,500 organized sports 
teams.[88] In addition, the Parks and Recreation department is responsible 
for 160 parks and 41 recreation centers.[89] Saint Paul hosts a number 
of professional, semi-professional, and amateur sports teams. The Minnesota 
Wild[8] play their home games in downtown Saint Paul's Xcel Energy Center, 
which opened in 2000. The Wild brought the NHL back to Minnesota for the 
first time since 1993, when the Minnesota North Stars left the state for 
Dallas, Texas.[8] (The World Hockey Association's Minnesota Fighting Saints 
played in Saint Paul from 1972 to 1977.) Citing the history of hockey in 
the Twin Cities and teams at all levels, Sports Illustrated called Saint 
Paul the new Hockeytown U.S.A. in 2007.[90] The Xcel Energy Center, a multipurpose 
entertainment and sports venue, can host concerts and accommodate nearly 
all sporting events. It occupies the site of the demolished Saint Paul 
Civic Center. The Xcel Energy Center hosts the Minnesota high school boys 
hockey tournament, the Minnesota high school girls' volleyball tournament, 
and concerts throughout the year. In 2004, it was named the best overall 
sports venue in the US by ESPN.[91] The St. Paul Saints is the city's independent 
league baseball team. There have been several different teams called the 
Saints over the years. Originally founded in 1884, they were shut down 
in 1961 after the Minnesota Twins moved to Bloomington. The St. Paul Saints 
were brought back in 1993 as an independent baseball team in the Northern 
League, moving to the American Association in 2006. Their home games are 
played at the open-air CHS Field in downtown's Lowertown Historic District.[92] 
Four noted Major League All-Star baseball players are natives of Saint 
Paul: Hall of Fame outfielder Dave Winfield, Hall of Fame infielder Paul 
Molitor, pitcher Jack Morris, and catcher Joe Mauer. The all-black St. 
Paul Colored Gophers played four seasons in Saint Paul from 1907 to 1911.[93] 
The St. Paul Twin Stars of the National Premier Soccer League play their 
home games at Macalester Stadium.[94] The first curling club in Saint Paul 
was founded in 1888. The current club, the St. Paul Curling Club, was founded 
in 1912 and is the largest curling club in the United States.[95] The Minnesota 
RollerGirls are a flat-track roller derby league based in the Roy Wilkins 
Auditorium. Minnesota's oldest athletic organization, the Minnesota Boat 
Club, resides in the Mississippi River on Raspberry Island.[96] Saint Paul 
is also home to Circus Juventas, the largest circus arts school in North 
America.[97] On March 25, 2015, Major League Soccer announced that it had 
awarded its 23rd MLS franchise to Minnesota United FC, a team from the 
lower-level North American Soccer League. Bill McGuire and his ownership 
group, which includes Jim Pohlad of the Minnesota Twins, Glen Taylor of 
the Minnesota Timberwolves, former Minnesota Wild investor Glen Nelson, 
and his daughter Wendy Carlson Nelson of the Carlson hospitality company, 
had intended to build a privately financed soccer-specific stadium in Downtown 
Minneapolis near the Minneapolis Farmer's Market, but their plan was met 
with heavy opposition from Minneapolis Mayor Betsy Hodges, who said her 
city was suffering from "stadium fatigue" after building three stadiums, 
for the Minnesota Twins, Minnesota Vikings and the Minnesota Golden Gophers, 
within a six-year span.[98] On July 1, 2015, after failing to reach an 
agreement with the city of Minneapolis, McGuire and his partners turned 
their focus to St. Paul.[99] On October 23, 2015, Bill McGuire of Minnesota 
United FC and St. Paul Mayor Chris Coleman announced that a privately financed 
soccer-specific stadium would be built on the vacant Metro Transit bus 
barn site in St. Paul's Midway neighborhood near the intersection of Snelling 
Avenue and University Avenue. It is midway between downtown St. Paul and 
downtown Minneapolis. The stadium will open in 2018 and seat 20,000. The 
team will play in the MLS in 2017.[100] The Timberwolves, Twins, Vikings, 
and Lynx all play in Minneapolis.[101] Saint Paul has a variation of the 
strong mayor-council form of government.[104] The mayor is the chief executive 
and chief administrative officer for the city and the seven-member city 
council is the legislative body.[105][106] The mayor is elected by the 
entire city, while members of the city council are elected from seven different 
geographic wards of approximately equal population.[107][108] Both the 
mayor and council members serve four-year terms.[109] The current mayor 
is Chris Coleman (DFL), who is no relation to former mayor Norm Coleman. 
Coleman is Saint Paul's ninth Irish-American mayor since 1900. Aside from 
Norm Coleman, who became a Republican during his second term, Saint Paul 
has not elected a Republican mayor since 1952.[110] The city is also the 
county seat of Ramsey County, named for Alexander Ramsey, the state's first 
governor. The county once spanned much of the present-day metropolitan 
area and was originally to be named Saint Paul County after the city. Today 
it is geographically the smallest county and the most densely populated.[5] 
Ramsey is the only home rule county in Minnesota; the seven-member Board 
of Commissioners appoints a county manager whose office is in the combination 
city hall/county courthouse along with the Minnesota Second Judicial Courts.[111][112] 
The nearby Law Enforcement Center houses the Ramsey County Sheriff's office. 
Saint Paul is the capital of the state of Minnesota. The city hosts the 
capitol building, designed by Saint Paul resident Cass Gilbert, and the 
House and Senate office buildings. The Minnesota Governor's Residence, 
which is used for some state functions, is on Summit Avenue. The Minnesota 
Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party (affiliated with the Democratic Party) is 
headquartered in Saint Paul. Numerous state departments and services are 
also headquartered in Saint Paul, such as the Minnesota Department of Natural 
Resources. The city is split into four Minnesota Senate districts (64, 
65, 66 and 67) and eight Minnesota House of Representatives districts (64A, 
64B, 65A, 65B, 66A, 66B, 67A and 67B), all of which are held by Democrats.[113][114] 
St. Paul is the heart of Minnesota's 4th congressional district, represented 
by Democrat Betty McCollum. The district has been in DFL hands without 
interruption since 1949. Minnesota is represented in the US Senate by Democrat 
Amy Klobuchar, a former Hennepin County Attorney, and Democrat Al Franken, 
a former comedian and political commentator. *District also includes Falcon 
Heights, Lauderdale and Roseville . Saint Paul is second in the United 
States in the number of higher education institutions per capita.[115] 
Higher education institutions that call Saint Paul home include three public 
and eight private colleges and universities and five post-secondary institutions. 
Well-known colleges and universities include the Saint Catherine University, 
Concordia University, Hamline University, Macalester College, and the University 
of St. Thomas. Metropolitan State University and Saint Paul College, which 
focus on non-traditional students, are based in Saint Paul, as well as 
a law school, Mitchell Hamline School of Law.[116] The Saint Paul Public 
Schools district is the state's second largest school district and serves 
approximately 42,000 students. The district is extremely diverse with students 
from families speaking 70 different languages, although only four languages 
are used for most school communication: English, Spanish, Hmong, and Somali. 
The district runs 82 different schools, including 52 elementary schools, 
twelve middle schools, seven high schools, ten alternative schools, and 
one special education school, employing over 6,500 teachers and staff. 
The school district also oversees community education programs for pre-K 
and adult learners, including Early Childhood Family Education, GED Diploma, 
language programs, and various learning opportunities for community members 
of all ages. In 2006, Saint Paul Public Schools celebrated its 150th anniversary.[117] 
Some students attend public schools in other school districts chosen by 
their families under Minnesota's open enrollment statute.[118] A variety 
of K-12 private, parochial, and public charter schools are also represented 
in the city. In 1992, Saint Paul became the first city in the US to sponsor 
and open a charter school, now found in most states across the nation.[119] 
Saint Paul is currently home to 21 charter schools as well as 38 private 
schools.[120] The Saint Paul Public Library system includes a Central Library 
and twelve branch locations.[121] Residents of Saint Paul can receive 10 
broadcast television stations, five of which broadcast from within Saint 
Paul. One daily newspaper, the St. Paul Pioneer Press, two weekly neighborhood 
newspapers, the East Side Review and City Pages (owned by The Star Tribune 
Company), and several monthly or semimonthly neighborhood papers serve 
the city. Several media outlets based in neighboring Minneapolis also serve 
the Saint Paul community, including the Star Tribune. Saint Paul is home 
to Minnesota Public Radio, a three-format system that broadcasts on nearly 
40 stations[122] around the Midwest. MPR locally delivers news and information, 
classical, and The Current (which plays a wide variety of music). The station 
has 110,000 regional members and more than 800,000 listeners each week 
throughout the Upper Midwest, the largest audience of any regional public 
radio network.[123] Also operating as part of American Public Media, MPR's 
programming reaches five million listeners, most notably through A Prairie 
Home Companion, hosted by Garrison Keillor, who also lives in the city.[123] 
The Fitzgerald Theater, renamed in 1994 for St. Paul native and novelist 
F. Scott Fitzgerald, is home to the show.[124] Residents utilize Interstate 
35E running north-south and Interstate 94 running east-west. Trunk highways 
include U.S. Highway 52, Minnesota State Highway 280, and Minnesota State 
Highway 5. Saint Paul has several unique roads such as Ayd Mill Road, Phalen 
Boulevard and Shepard Road/Warner Road, which diagonally follow particular 
geographic features in the city. Biking is also gaining popularity, due 
to both the creation of more paved bike lanes that connect to other bike 
routes throughout the metropolitan area[125] and the creation of Nice Ride 
Minnesota, a seasonally operated nonprofit bicycle sharing and rental system 
that has over 1,550 bicycles and 170 stations in both Minneapolis and Saint 
Paul.[126] Downtown Saint Paul has a five mile (8 km) enclosed skyway system 
over twenty-five city blocks.[127] The 563-mile (906 km) Avenue of the 
Saints connects Saint Paul with Saint Louis, Missouri. The layout of city 
streets and roads has often drawn complaints. While he was Governor of 
Minnesota, Jesse Ventura appeared on the Late Show with David Letterman,[128] 
and remarked that the streets were designed by "drunken Irishmen".[129] 
He later apologized, though people had already been complaining about the 
fractured grid system for more than a century by that point.[129] Some 
of the city's road design is the result of the curve of the Mississippi 
River, hilly topography, conflicts between developers of different neighborhoods 
in the early city, and grand plans only half-realized. Outside of downtown, 
the roads are less confusing, but most roads are named, rather than numbered, 
increasing the difficulty for non-natives to navigate.[130] Metro Transit 
provides bus service and light rail in the Minneapolis–Saint Paul area. 
The METRO Green Line is an 11-mile (18 km) light rail line that connects 
downtown Saint Paul to downtown Minneapolis with 14 stations in Saint Paul. 
The Green Line runs west along University Avenue, through the University 
of Minnesota campus, until it links up and then shares stations with the 
Blue Line in downtown Minneapolis. Construction began in November 2010 
and the line began service on June 14, 2014.[131] Roughly 45,000 people 
rode on the first day; an average 28,000 riders are expected per day.[132] 
Metro Transit opened the A Line, Minneapolis–Saint Paul's first arterial 
bus rapid transit line, along Snelling Avenue and Ford Parkway. The A Line 
connects the Blue Line at 46th Street station to Rosedale Center with a 
connection at the Green Line Snelling Avenue station. The A Line is the 
first in a series of planned arterial bus rapid transit lines and is set 
to open in early 2016.[133] Amtrak's Empire Builder between Chicago and 
Seattle stops once daily in each direction at the newly renovated Saint 
Paul Union Station.[134] Ridership on the train is increasing, about 6% 
from 2005 to over 505,000 in fiscal year 2007.[135] Increased ridership 
has prompted southern Minnesota leaders to plan for an expansion of Amtrak's 
service in the area.[135] Saint Paul is the site of the Pig's Eye Yard, 
a major freight classification yard for Canadian Pacific Railway.[136] 
As of 2003, the yard handled over 1,000 freight cars per day.[136] Both 
Union Pacific and Burlington Northern Santa Fe run trains through the yard, 
though they are not classified at Pig's Eye.[136] Burlington Northern Santa 
Fe operates the large Northtown Yard in Minneapolis, which handles about 
600 cars per day.[137] There are several other small yards located around 
the city. Saint Paul is served by the Minneapolis–Saint Paul International 
Airport (MSP), which sits on 3,400 acres (14 km2)[138] southwest of the 
city on the west side of the Mississippi River between Minnesota State 
Highway 5, Interstate 494, Minnesota State Highway 77, and Minnesota State 
Highway 62. The airport serves three international, twelve domestic, seven 
charter, and four regional carriers[139] and is a hub and home base for 
Delta Air Lines, Mesaba Airlines and Sun Country Airlines.[140] Saint Paul 
is also served by the St. Paul Downtown Airport located just south of downtown, 
across the Mississippi River. The airport, also known as Holman Field, 
is a reliever airport run by the Metropolitan Airports Commission. The 
airport houses Minnesota's Air National Guard and is tailored to local 
corporate aviation.[141] There are three runways that serve about 100 resident 
aircraft and a flight training school. The Holman Field Administration 
Building and Riverside Hangar are on the National Register of Historic 
Places.[141] Saint Paul has eight sister cities, as designated by Sister
