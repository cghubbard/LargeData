In the sport of baseball, a baserunner is said to be in scoring position 
when he is on second or third base. The distinction between being on first 
base and second or third base is that a runner on first can usually only 
score if the batter hits an extra-base hit, while a runner on second or 
third can score on a single. This is also known as "ducks on the pond". 
Runners left in scoring position refers to the number of runners on second 
or third base at the end of an inning and is an inverse measure of a team's 
offensive efficiency. Many of baseball's "small ball" or "one run" tactics 
center on attempts to move a runner on first base into scoring position. 
Such tactics were dominant in the 1890s and the dead-ball era, when extra-base 
hits were relatively rare. Batting average with runners in scoring position 
(abbreviated BA/RISP or BA/RSP) is a baseball statistic derived by dividing 
a players hits with runners in scoring positions by his at bats with runners 
in scoring position. BA/RISP is often used as an indicator of clutch ability, 
as a hit with a runner on second base or third will likely score the runner 
and is thus considered a clutch situation. Recently, however, the statistic 
has been replaced with Win Probability Added, considered to be a better 
measure of clutch ability. A variation to this statistic is called Batting 
Average with two outs and Runners in Scoring Position, which is also calculated 
by dividing a players' hits with runners on second or third by his at bats 
in this situation. A hit is more likely to score at least one or two runs-depending 
on the speed of the runner, the strength of the outfielder's arm, the number 
of runners in scoring position, etc.-because the runners will be going 
on contactâ€”that is, they run once the batter hits the ball. But if the 
batter records an out, then the inning ends with those runners left on
