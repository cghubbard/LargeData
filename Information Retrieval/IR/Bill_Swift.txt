William Charles Swift (born October 27, 1961 in Portland, Maine) is a former 
Major League Baseball right-handed pitcher. After graduating South Portland 
High School, Swift attended the University of Maine, where he played college 
baseball for the Maine Black Bears baseball team from 1981 to 1984,[1] 
making four consecutive College World Series appearances. Swift pitched 
for the 1984 U.S. Olympic team and was a first-round draft pick (second 
selection) by the Seattle Mariners following his senior year at Maine. 
In 1991 he was traded to the San Francisco Giants along with pitchers Mike 
Jackson and Dave Burba for outfielder Kevin Mitchell and pitcher Mike Remlinger. 
The Giants immediately moved Swift from the bullpen to the starting rotation, 
where he emerged as one of the league's best pitchers, leading the league 
with a 2.08 ERA in 1992 and winning 21 games in 1993. Between 1995 and 
1997 he played for the Colorado Rockies. While the Rockies had high hopes 
for Swift, he struggled with a shoulder injury, back pains, and the psychological 
difficulties of the thin air of Colorado, and never again put up numbers 
comparable to his days with the Giants. He was eventually released by the 
Rockies due to shoulder trouble and triceps tightness. In 1998, Swift returned 
to the Seattle Mariners. He struggled, posting an 11-9 record with a 5.85 
ERA and 1.62 WHIP. After the season, he retired from baseball. On December 
22, 1999, USA Today named Bill Swift as one of Maine's best athletes of 
the 20th century.[1] Bill Swift coached High School Baseball for the school 
where his three daughters Aubrey, Mackenzie, and Brynlie attended Scottsdale 
Christian Academy in Phoenix, Arizona. He now is head baseball coach at
