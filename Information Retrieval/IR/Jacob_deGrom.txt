Jacob Anthony deGrom (born June 19, 1988), is an American professional 
baseball pitcher for the New York Mets of Major League Baseball (MLB). 
Prior to playing professionally, deGrom attended Stetson University and 
played college baseball for the Stetson Hatters. DeGrom began playing baseball 
as a shortstop and was converted into a pitcher during his junior year 
at Stetson. The Mets selected him in the ninth round of the 2010 MLB Draft, 
and he made his MLB debut with the Mets on May 15, 2014. That year, deGrom 
was named the National League's (NL) Rookie of the Month twice, and the 
NL Rookie of the Year. In 2015, deGrom was selected as an MLB All-Star. 
DeGrom attended Calvary Christian Academy in Ormond Beach, Florida, where 
he played for the school's baseball and basketball teams.[1] As a senior, 
the Florida Sports Writers Association named deGrom to the All-Florida 
second team.[2] He also played American Legion baseball, where he was noticed 
by the coaches for the Stetson Hatters, the college baseball team of Stetson 
University.[3] DeGrom was not selected in the Major League Baseball (MLB) 
Draft out of high school.[4] He enrolled at Stetson University and joined 
their baseball team where he played exclusively as a shortstop during his 
freshman and sophomore seasons. Though he was considered a good fielder 
with a strong throwing arm, deGrom was a light hitter, with a career .263 
batting average.[3] He made his first appearance as a pitcher in May 2009.[5] 
In the summer of 2009, between his sophomore and junior years, deGrom received 
an invitation to play collegiate summer baseball for the DeLand Suns of 
the Florida Collegiate Summer League, which he declined after discovering 
that they wanted him to play as a pitcher.[3] When deGrom returned to Stetson 
that fall, the team used him as a relief pitcher, filling the role of their 
closer, in addition to playing shortstop.[3][6] He quickly became one of 
Stetson's best pitchers, so the team moved deGrom into their starting rotation 
midway through the season.[6][7] In addition to a fastball, deGrom learned 
to throw a changeup and a slider.[8] MLB scouts began to take notice of 
deGrom when he pitched against Chris Sale of Florida Gulf Coast University.[3][6][8] 
In that game, deGrom hit his only home run of the season.[4] He made 12 
starts for the Hatters,[8] pitching to a 4–5 win–loss record with a 4.48 
earned run average.[4] The New York Mets selected deGrom in the ninth round 
as a pitcher, with the 272nd overall selection, of the 2010 MLB Draft. 
He signed with the Mets, receiving a $95,000 signing bonus.[9] The Mets 
assigned deGrom to the Kingsport Mets of the Rookie-level Appalachian League, 
where he made six starts[6][10] before he was diagnosed with a partial 
tear of the ulnar collateral ligament (UCL) in his pitching elbow. He attempted 
to rehabilitate his arm for four months, but underwent Tommy John surgery 
to repair the UCL in October.[6][11] He did not pitch in 2011 while he 
recovered from the surgery.[3] While rehabilitating, deGrom worked on his 
changeup with Johan Santana.[8][10] DeGrom pitched for the Savannah Sand 
Gnats of the Class A South Atlantic League and the St. Lucie Mets of the 
Class A-Advanced Florida State League in 2012, finishing the year with 
a 2.43 ERA in 19 games started.[8] In 2013, he began the season with St. 
Lucie, but was promoted to the Binghamton Mets of the Class AA Eastern 
League after two starts due to injuries to Binghamton's Luis Mateo and 
Cory Mazzoni.[7][12] He received a promotion to the Las Vegas 51s of the 
Class AAA Pacific Coast League in June after the Mets promoted Zack Wheeler 
and Carlos Torres to the major leagues and traded Collin McHugh.[12][13] 
He had a combined 4.51 ERA for the season, due to a broken finger suffered 
during the offseason, which altered the way he threw the ball.[8] The Mets 
added deGrom to their 40-man roster on November 20, 2013, to protect him 
from being eligible in the Rule 5 draft.[14] During the offseason, deGrom 
improved his mechanics, and learned to throw a curveball.[8] He began the 
2014 season with Las Vegas, and had a 4–0 win–loss record and a 2.58 ERA 
in his first seven games started.[8][15] The Mets promoted deGrom to the 
major leagues on May 12, 2014, after Gonzalez Germen was placed on the 
disabled list.[15] The Mets planned to use deGrom in relief, but an injury 
to Dillon Gee required the Mets to insert him into their starting rotation.[3] 
DeGrom made his major league debut on May 15 against cross-town rival New 
York Yankees in Citi Field.[16] He faced fellow rookie Chase Whitley, also 
making his MLB debut. He pitched seven innings, allowing only one run and 
striking out six, but the Yankees shut out the Mets and won 1–0. DeGrom 
also collected his first MLB hit in the game in his first career at bat. 
It was the first hit by a Mets pitcher in the 2014 season ending an 0-for-64 
hitless streak, the worst collective mark by a pitching staff to begin 
a season in MLB history.[17] DeGrom compiled four quality starts in his 
first four MLB starts, but did not record a win in any of them.[18] On 
July 8, deGrom pitched seven scoreless innings and recorded 11 strikeouts 
in giving the Mets their 4,000th franchise victory.[19] Along with Steve 
Cishek of the Miami Marlins, deGrom was named the National League's (NL) 
Co-Player of the Week for the period of July 21 to July 27 after allowing 
only one earned run in two starts that week.[20] He was named the NL Rookie 
of the Month for July.[21] On August 11, deGrom went on the disabled list 
with rotator cuff tendinitis. Rafael Montero was called up on August 12 
in deGrom's place.[22] On August 23, Montero was re-sent back to the 51s 
to make room for deGrom coming off the disabled list.[23] On September 
15, 2014, deGrom faced the Marlins and struck out his first eight batters, 
tying the MLB record.[24] Near the end of the season, deGrom was shut down 
for the year, ending his season with a 9–6 record, a 2.69 ERA and 144 strikeouts.[25] 
DeGrom won the 2014 Sporting News NL Rookie of the Year Award[26] and was 
named the NL Rookie of the Year by the Baseball Writers' Association of 
America, (the first by a Met since Dwight Gooden in 1984) receiving first 
place votes on 26 of the 30 ballots.[27] DeGrom and Clayton Kershaw of 
the Los Angeles Dodgers were selected as NL Co-Players of the Week for 
the week ending June 7, 2015.[28] He began the 2015 season with a 8–6 win-loss 
record and a 2.30 ERA through the end of June, and was named to the NL 
roster in the 2015 MLB All-Star Game.[29] During the All-Star Game, deGrom 
struck out the three batters he faced on ten pitches, becoming the first 
person to do so since pitch counts were recorded.[30] DeGrom pitched to 
a 14–8 record with a 2.54 ERA and a 0.99 walks plus hits per inning pitched 
ratio during the 2015 season.[31] Starting Game 1 of the 2015 NLDS, he 
allowed no runs and five hits over seven innings pitched and tied a Mets 
franchise postseason record with 13 strikeouts (set by Tom Seaver, Game 
1 of the 1973 NLCS).[32] DeGrom won the deciding Game 5 with a six-inning, 
two-run effort.[33] In Game 3 of the 2015 NLCS against the Chicago Cubs, 
deGrom pitched seven-inning game, allowing just two runs on four hits, 
one walk and seven strikeouts, putting the Mets ahead 3–0 and within one 
game of their first World Series appearance since the 2000 Subway Series.[34] 
DeGrom started Game 2 of the 2015 World Series on October 28; he allowed 
four runs on six hits and three walks over five innings and took the loss 
as the Royals went up, 2–0, in the series.[35] Following the season, deGrom 
received a Wilson Defensive Player of the Year Award as the best defensive 
player statistically at his position in Major League Baseball.[36] He also 
placed seventh on Cy Young award voting.[37] DeGrom is from DeLeon Springs, 
Florida.[38] He was raised by his parents, Tony, an AT&T lineman, and Tammy, 
a customer service representative for a credit card rewards program.[6] 
Tony built a batting cage in the backyard for his son to practice. He credits 
his father for his quiet intensity and humility.[39] He has two sisters, 
Sarah and Jessica.[40] DeGrom met his wife, Stacey, shortly after high 
school.[41] They were married in November 2014,[4][42] and live in DeLand, 
Florida. They have a Morkie,[39] and welcomed their first son in April 
2016.[43] DeGrom is known for his long hair, which he began to grow out 
while at Stetson. His starts with the Mets led to the trending hashtag 
on Twitter of "#hairwego".[44] His hair inspired a promotional "Jacob deGrom 
Hair Hat" giveaway at Citi Field during the 2016 season.[45] After learning 
that an unnamed MLB hitter said that deGrom's hair made it harder to pick 
up the ball out of his hand, deGrom said that he would never cut his hair.[46]
