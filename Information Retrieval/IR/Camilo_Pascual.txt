Camilo Alberto Pascual Lus (born January 20, 1934) is a Cuban former Major 
League Baseball right-handed pitcher. During an 18-year baseball career 
(1954–71), he played for the Washington Senators (which became the Minnesota 
Twins in 1961), the second Washington Senators franchise, Cincinnati Reds, 
Los Angeles Dodgers, and the Cleveland Indians. He was also known by the 
nicknames "Camile" and "Little Potato."[1] Pascual's best pitches were 
his fastball and devastating overhand curveball, described by Ted Williams 
as the "most feared curveball in the American League for 18 years".[2] 
His curveball has been rated in the to 10 of all-time. Over his career, 
he compiled 174 wins, 2,167 strikeouts, and a 3.63 earned run average. 
He was elected to the American League All-Star team 5 times (from 1959 
to 1962, and in 1964). In the second 1961 All-Star Game, he pitched three 
hitless innings and struck out four. As a 17-year-old, Pascual left Havana 
and spent the 1951 season as a minor league free agent pitching for the 
Class-D Chickasha Chiefs in the Oklahoma Sooner State League and two Class-C 
teams, the Big Spring Broncs in the Longhorn League and Geneva Robins in 
the New York Border League.[3] The latter team was made up largely of Cuban 
players signed by Washington Senator's scout Joe Cambria including future 
Minnesota Twins teammate Julio Becquer.[4][5] Pascual would finish the 
season with a combined record of 5–4 with a 4.64 ERA and 46 walks in 64 
innings. Despite his less than overwhelming stats, the 18-year-old Pascual 
was signed by the Washington Senators as an amateur free agent prior to 
the start of the 1952 season.[1] Pascual would spend the 1952 season in 
Class-B pitching for the Havana Cubans and the Tampa Smokers in the Florida 
International League, improving to an 8–6 record with a 2.88 ERA and only 
66 walks in 122 innings over 24 games. He would be back at Havana for the 
entire 1953 season and would compile similar stats as the year before (10-6, 
3.00 ERA, 68 walks, 141 Inn in 25 games). Following the season, he would 
play for his hometown Elefantes de Cienfuegos competing for the Caribbean 
World Series. He would continue to play for Cienfuegos or Tigres de Marianao 
until Fidel Castro closed the country in 1961.[6] Pascual would go north 
with the Senators in 1954 and would make his major league debut on April 
15, mopping up the last 3 innings of a 6–1 loss to the Boston Red Sox for 
losing pitcher Bob Porterfield.[7] the 20-year-old Pascual would put in 
an encouraging rookie season for the 66–88 Senators, finishing 4–7 with 
a 4.22 ERA, 3 saves and one complete game in 48 appearances (3 starts). 
However walks would continue to plague the young pitcher, as he would finish 
the season with a strikeout-to-walk ratio of less than one (60 strikeouts 
and 61 walks). Pascaul would continue to be used primarily as a reliever 
in 1955 and would improve his strikeout ratio, but this would be about 
the only statistic where he would improve on over his rookie season as 
he would finish with a 2–12 record and 6.14 ERA – mirroring the club as 
a whole which won only 53 games. However, Pascual would steadily improve, 
lowering his ERA and increasing his Win total every year from 1955 to 1959, 
and he would be named to his first of four consecutive All-Star teams in 
1959. Pascual finished 1959 with 17–10 record, a 2.64 ERA, and 185 strikeouts 
in 238 2/3 innings. He also led the league in both complete games (33) 
and shutouts (6), while also receiving some support in the MVP balloting.[8] 
The period from 1959 to 1964 would see Pascaul's peak years. He would win 
at least 12 games every season while leading the league in complete games, 
shutouts, and strikeouts three times each and racking up all five of his 
All-Star games appearances. In 1962 Pascual went 20-11 and led the league 
in complete games, shutouts and strikeouts to help notch his first 20-win 
season.[9] In 1963 he had arguably his best season with a 21-9 win lost 
record, a 2.46 ERA, leading the league in complete games and strikeouts. 
1965 would see the Twins/Washington franchise return to the World Series 
for the first time since Washington lost the 1933 series to the New York 
Giants. However, after starting the season 8–2, injuries limited Pascual 
to nine relatively ineffective second-half starts and he lost his World 
Series matchup with Claude Osteen in Game 3. Pascual would continue to 
have arm problems in 1966 and would pitch only 103 innings in 21 games, 
both career lows. Seeing the writing on the wall, the Twins traded Pascual 
and once-promising second baseman Bernie Allen on December 3, 1966 to the 
new Washington Senators for 35-year-old relief pitcher Ron Kline. Although 
no longer over-powering or the durable innings-eater he had once been, 
Pascual would have a minor renaissance during the 1967 and 1968 seasons 
while in Washington winning a total of 25 games while leading the Senator' 
staff in wins and finishing second in both innings and strikeouts both 
seasons.[10][11] However Pascual would get off to a brutal start in 1969 
(2-5, 6.83 ERA, 38 walks in 55 1/3 innings) and Washington would sell him 
to the Cincinnati Reds on July 7, where he gave up seven runs in seven 
innings over the rest of the year. Unable to make the club in spring training 
1970, the Reds released Pascual on April 13 with the Los Angeles Dodgers 
signing him the same day. He would pitch for the Dodgers until August and 
for the Cleveland Indians for the first half of the 1971 season, but would 
only see action in a total of 19 games and he would retire at the end of 
the season. Over his career, Pascual led the league in strikeouts in 1961 
(221), 1962 (206), and 1963 (202) and as at the start of the 2011 season, 
he is 55th on the all-time strikeout list. However, he was also in the 
top 10 in the league in walks and home runs allowed five times in his career 
and is 84th and 90th all-time in those categories as of the start of the 
2011 season. Pascual led the league in complete games three times (1959, 
62, 63), and came in second two more times (1961, 64). Pascual was a 20-game 
winner twice, in 1962–63, and also finished with a career-high in complete 
games (18) in both of those seasons. After his playing career ended, Pascual 
retired to Miami where he had lived since 1960.[6] From 1978 to 1980, Pascual 
was the Minnesota Twins pitching coach for manager Gene Mauch. Since 1989, 
he has worked as international scout for the Oakland Athletics, New York 
Mets, and the Los Angeles Dodgers, for whom he currently scouts Venezuela.[12][13] 
Among the major leaguers Pascual has signed are Jose Canseco, Alex Cora, 
Omar Daal, Miguel Cairo, and Franklin Gutiérrez.[13] In 1983, Pascual was 
elected to the Cuban Baseball Hall of Fame. Then, in 1996 he gained induction 
into the Caribbean Baseball Hall of Fame as part of their first class. 
His six victories in the Caribbean Series ties him with José Bracho and 
Rubén Gómez for the most all-time wins in the tournament.[citation needed] 
On May 29, 2010, he was elected in the inaugural class of the Latino Baseball 
Hall of Fame at the Roman Amphitheater in Altos de Chavón, in the Dominican 
Republic.[14] He later became the 24th former Twins player inducted into
