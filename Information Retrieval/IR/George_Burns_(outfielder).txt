George Joseph Burns (November 24, 1889 – August 15, 1966) was an American 
left fielder in Major League Baseball who spent most of his career as the 
leadoff hitter for the New York Giants. A soft-spoken person, he was nicknamed 
"Silent George" by his teammates, and he was said to be one of the best 
pool players ever to play major league baseball. He led the National League 
in runs scored a record five times, later equaled by only Rogers Hornsby 
and Stan Musial, and also led the league in walks five times and stolen 
bases twice. He holds the Giants franchise record for stolen bases in a 
single season (62, in 1914), and held the club's career record from 1919 
to 1972. At the end of his career, his 1262 games in left field ranked 
eighth in major league history, and his total of 1844 games in the outfield 
ranked sixth in NL history. Born in Utica, New York, Burns started his 
baseball career as a catcher, and reached the Giants in the latter half 
of the 1911 season. Because of his strong throwing arm and outstanding 
speed, manager John McGraw converted him into an outfielder. He joined 
the regular lineup in 1913 and, becoming one of the first players to wear 
sunglasses and using a long-billed cap, came to excel defensively in left 
field at the Polo Grounds with its difficult angles; the left field bleachers 
came to be known as "Burnsville", and his teammates would later describe 
him as the "greatest 'sunfielder' in the history of the game." In his rookie 
season he hit 37 doubles, bettering Jim O'Rourke's 1889 club record of 
36; the mark would stand for only two years, however, before Larry Doyle 
hit 40 in 1915. 1913 also marked Burns' first World Series appearance, 
though he only batted .158 as the Giants lost. In 1914 he led the NL in 
runs for the first time and batted a career-high .303, and also edged Josh 
Devore's 1911 club record of 61 steals by one; he finished fourth in the 
voting for the Chalmers (MVP) Award, in the last year such an award would 
be given in the NL until 1924. In 1917 he batted .302, led the NL in runs 
a third time and in walks for the first time, and finished second in the 
NL in total bases behind Hornsby; he also appeared in his second World 
Series, but had another poor performance, hitting .227 as the Giants again 
lost. In 1919 he led the league in runs, walks and steals again, and also 
led NL outfielders in fielding percentage for the first time. He surpassed 
his teammate Doyle's franchise record for career stolen bases; his eventual 
record of 334 was broken by Willie Mays in 1972. Burns hit for the cycle 
on September 17, 1920, and led the NL in runs for the fifth time that year. 
In the 1921 World Series, Burns finally had a successful postseason; he 
had four hits in Game 3 as the Giants rolled to a 13–5 win, and had a 2-run 
double in the 8th inning of Game 4, breaking a 1–1 tie as New York evened 
the Series at two games each. He scored the deciding run in Game 6, and 
batted .333 for the Series as the Giants won their first title since 1905. 
Two months later he was sent to the Cincinnati Reds in a trade that brought 
third baseman Heinie Groh to the Giants. In 1922 Burns set an NL record 
with his 28th steal of home, surpassing the old mark held by Honus Wagner; 
Max Carey broke his record later in the decade. He also set a Reds club 
record with 631 at bats (Hughie Critz broke the mark in 1928). In the Reds' 
first game at New York that season, he was given a day in his honor and 
presented with a diamond-studded watch. Burns ended his major league career 
with the Philadelphia Phillies in 1925. In a 15-season career, he was a 
.287 hitter with 1,188 runs, 41 home runs and 611 runs batted in in 1853 
games played. He collected 2,077 hits with a .366 on-base percentage, and 
his 383 stolen bases ranked 12th all-time at that point. Although he never 
had more than 181 hits in a season, playing in an era of diminished hitting, 
he was among the league's top five players six times. His NL record of 
leading the league in outfield games six times was later matched by Billy 
Williams and Dale Murphy; his Giants record of 1184 games in left field 
was broken by Jo-Jo Moore in 1941. In 1927 he became a player-coach with 
Williamsport in the New York–Penn League, and he returned to the Giants 
in 1937 as a coach. He later worked for a tannery, and retired in 1957.
