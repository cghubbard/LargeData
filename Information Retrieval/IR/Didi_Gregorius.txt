Mariekson Julius "Didi" Gregorius, OON (born February 18, 1990), is a Dutch 
professional baseball shortstop for the New York Yankees of Major League 
Baseball (MLB). He previously played in MLB for the Cincinnati Reds in 
2012 and the Arizona Diamondbacks in 2013 and 2014. Gregorius was born 
in Amsterdam to Johannes Gregorius, Sr. and Sheritsa Stroop. At the time, 
Johannes pitched for the Amsterdam Pirates in Honkbal Hoofdklasse and worked 
as a carpenter.[1] Stroop played for the Dutch national softball team.[2] 
His older brother, Johannes, Jr., pitched professionally in Honkbal Hoofdklasse 
and the Italian Baseball League and most recently played as an infielder 
in Curaçao.[1][3][4] His paternal grandfather, Antonio, was one of the 
greatest Curaçaoan pitchers of the mid-20th century. Gregorius began playing 
tee-ball in the Netherlands before moving to Curaçao at the age of five 
years where he was raised. He also played soccer and basketball in his 
youth.[1] Gregorius, his father and his brother all go by the nickname 
"Didi." He began using the name in the United States when teammates could 
not pronounce "Mariekson." He speaks four languages: Dutch, Papiamentu, 
English and Spanish.[2] Gregorius was first discovered by a Cincinnati 
Reds scout assigned to the Netherlands while he was playing at an under-18 
tournament in The Hague in 2006.[1] Gregorius signed with the Reds as an 
amateur free agent in 2007.[5] He chose to sign with the Reds rather than 
the Seattle Mariners or San Diego Padres because the Reds were willing 
to bring him to the United States, while San Diego and Seattle planned 
to start Gregorius' career in either the Dominican Summer League or the 
Venezuelan Summer League.[3] He made his professional debut with the Gulf 
Coast Reds of the Rookie-level Gulf Coast League in 2008, playing in 31 
games and recording a .155 batting average in 109 plate appearances. The 
next year, the Reds assigned Gregorius to the Billings Mustangs of the 
Rookie-level Pioneer League, and batted .314 in 255 plate appearances. 
The Reds promoted Gregorius to the Sarasota Reds of the Class A-Advanced 
Florida State League, where he had a .254 average in 74 plate appearances.[6] 
Gregorius played for the Dayton Dragons of the Class A Midwest League in 
2010, where he batted .273.[7] In 2011, Gregorius missed the first two 
months of the season after he was diagnosed with a kidney disorder.[8] 
He was assigned to the Bakersfield Blaze of the Class A-Advanced California 
League, and was promoted to the Carolina Mudcats of the Class AA Southern 
League. Combined, he batted .289 with seven home runs and 44 runs batted 
in (RBIs) in 89 games played. After the season, the Reds added Gregorius 
to their 40 man roster to protect him from being selected in the Rule 5 
draft.[9] Gregorius played for the Canberra Cavalry in the 2010–11 Australian 
Baseball League season. In 36 games, he batted .189.[10] He was awarded 
Golden Glove for the 2010–11 Australian Baseball League season. Gregorius 
began the 2012 season with the Pensacola Blue Wahoos, the Reds' new affiliate 
in the Southern League, where he had a .278 batting average in 81 games. 
The Reds promoted him to the Louisville Bats of the Class AAA International 
League, where he batted .243 in 48 games.[11] On September 1, 2012, the 
Reds promoted Gregorius to the major leagues as a September call-up.[12] 
Gregorius made his major league debut on September 5. He played in eight 
games for the Reds,[3] and recorded six hits in 20 at-bats (.300).[11] 
After the season, the Reds assigned Gregorius to play in the Arizona Fall 
League.[6] As Gregorius was blocked on the Reds by starting shortstop Zack 
Cozart,[3] the Reds traded Gregorius to the Arizona Diamondbacks as part 
of a three team trade that also involved the Cleveland Indians after the 
2012 season. The Reds sent Gregorius to Cleveland along with Drew Stubbs 
in exchange for Shin-Soo Choo and Jason Donald. The Indians then traded 
Gregorius to Arizona with reliever Tony Sipp and infielder Lars Anderson 
for pitchers Trevor Bauer, Bryan Shaw and Matt Albers.[13][14] Gregorius 
began the 2013 season in the minor leagues. He was promoted to the Diamondbacks 
on April 18,[15] due to an injury to starting second baseman Aaron Hill. 
In his first game with the Diamondbacks, Gregorius hit his first career 
home run off of Phil Hughes on the first pitch of his first at-bat.[16] 
On April 27, he was hit in the batting helmet by a 93-mile-per-hour (150 km/h) 
fastball thrown by Josh Outman,[17] which caused a mild concussion. He 
was placed on the seven-day disabled list for concussions, and returned 
to the Diamondbacks' lineup the next week.[18] Gregorius batted .252 in 
103 games for the Diamondbacks, but began to lose playing time later in 
the season due to his struggles against left-handed pitching; he batted 
.200 with a .267 on-base percentage against left-handers.[15] In spring 
training in 2014, Gregorius competed for the starting shortstop role with 
Chris Owings, a prospect in the Diamondbacks' organization.[19] The Diamondbacks 
named Owings their starting shortstop for Opening Day, and sent Gregorius 
to the Reno Aces of the PCL.[20] On April 19, 2014, Gregorius hit three 
home runs which gave the Aces a 10-7 win over the Las Vegas 51s.[21] In 
June, the Diamondbacks promoted Gregorius after an injury to backup infielder 
Cliff Pennington, and he split playing time with Owings.[22] Needing to 
acquire a shortstop to replace the retiring Derek Jeter, the New York Yankees 
acquired Gregorius in a three-team trade on December 5, 2014, in which 
the Yankees sent Shane Greene to the Detroit Tigers and the Tigers sent 
Robbie Ray and Domingo Leyba to the Diamondbacks.[23] Gregorius struggled 
in April and May, batting .222 and committing six defensive errors. By 
the beginning of August, he increased his batting average to .260 and became 
more consistent in the field.[24] On July 27, 2015, he went 3 for 4 with 
a home run and, a career high, 4 RBIs. The following day, July 28, he had 
four hits, three RBI and two runs in a game against the Texas Rangers.[25] 
On August 28, he went 4 for 5 with a home run and, a new career high, 6 
RBIs. Gregorius hit a game-winning two-run home run June 29, 2016 to cap 
a six-run comeback in the Yankees' 9-7 victory over Texas, which came into 
the game with the AL's best record at 51-27. [26] In 153 games of 2016, 
Gregorius batted .276 with 20 home runs and 76 RBI. Gregorius played for 
the Dutch national baseball team in the 2011 Baseball World Cup. After 
beating Cuba in the final, the members of the team were received the Order 
of Orange-Nassau, 5th class(Knight).[27] Gregorius strained the ulnar collateral 
ligament in the elbow of his throwing arm while preparing for the 2013 
World Baseball Classic, which prevented him from competing in the tournament.[11]
