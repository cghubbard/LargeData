Forrest Harrill "Smoky" Burgess (February 6, 1927 – September 15, 1991)[1] 
was an American professional baseball player, coach and scout. He played 
in Major League Baseball as a catcher from 1949 to 1967. Later in his career, 
he became known for his ability as a pinch hitter, setting the major league 
career record for career pinch-hits with 145.[2][3] In his playing days, 
he stood 5'8" (173 cm), weighed 188 pounds (85 kg), batted left-handed 
and threw right-handed.[4] Born in Caroleen, North Carolina, Burgess was 
signed as an amateur free agent by the Chicago Cubs in 1944.[5] In 1947, 
he led the Tri-State League with a .387 batting average.[6] He followed 
that by leading the Southern Association with a .386 average in 1948.[7] 
Burgess made his major league debut at the age of 22 with the Chicago Cubs 
on April 19, 1949.[4] In October 1951, he was traded to the Cincinnati 
Reds, who promptly traded him to the Philadelphia Phillies for catcher 
Andy Seminick before the start of the 1952 season.[5] With the Phillies, 
he platooned alongside the right-hand hitting Stan Lopata.[8] He had his 
best season in 1954, when he had a .368 batting average in 108 games for 
the Phillies, earning his first All-Star Game selection.[4][9] At the beginning 
of the 1955 season, he was once again traded for Andy Seminick and returned 
to Cincinnati, where he finally got the chance to play every day.[5][8] 
He rose to the occasion, hitting for a .306 batting average for the rest 
of the season along with 20 home runs and 77 runs batted in, gaining his 
second consecutive berth on the National League All-Star team.[4][10] On 
July 29, 1955, Burgess hit three home runs and had nine runs batted in 
during a game against the Pittsburgh Pirates.[11] Burgess began the 1956 
season as the Reds' starting catcher, but when the team faltered early 
in the season, Reds manager Birdie Tebbetts decided to shake things up 
and replaced Burgess with a younger man, Ed Bailey.[12] In 1959, Burgess 
was traded along with Harvey Haddix and Don Hoak to the Pittsburgh Pirates 
for Whammy Douglas, Jim Pendleton and John Powers.[5] Burgess was the Pirates 
catcher on May 26, 1959 when Haddix took a perfect game into the 13th inning 
against the Milwaukee Braves before losing the game.[13][14] Burgess also 
won a World Series with the Pirates in 1960, batting .333 in the seven-game 
series.[15][16] By 1963, Jim Pagliaroni had taken over as the Pirates' 
starting catcher and in late 1964, Burgess was acquired by the Chicago 
White Sox, who were in the heat of the pennant race.[5] In his first plate 
appearance with the White Sox on September 15 against the Detroit Tigers, 
he hit a game-tying home run off pitcher Dave Wickersham.[17] Over the 
next three years, he was used almost exclusively as a pinch hitter, appearing 
in just 7 games behind the plate.[4] In 1966 Burgess set a Major League 
record which still stands for the most games in a season (79) by a non-pitcher 
who did not score a run.[18] Burgess played his final major league game 
on October 1, 1967 at the age of 40.[4] During an eighteen-year major league 
career, Burgess played in 1,691 games hitting for a .295 career batting 
average with 126 home runs, 673 RBI and a .362 on-base percentage. He accumulated 
1,318 career hits with 230 doubles and 33 triples.[4] His .295 career batting 
average ranked him 10th among Major League catchers as of 2006.[19] A six-time 
All-Star, Burgess led National League catchers in fielding percentage three 
times, in 1953, 1960 and 1961.[20] His Major League record of 145 career 
pinch hits was broken by Manny Mota in 1979. Along with Curt Simmons, he 
was the last player to formally retire who had played in the major leagues 
in the 1940s (not counting Minnie Miñoso, who un-retired twice). When his 
playing career ended, Burgess spent many years with the Atlanta Braves 
as a scout and minor league batting coach with the Pulaski Braves in Pulaski, 
VA. He was inducted into the Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame in 1975.[21] 
He was inducted into the North Carolina Sports Hall of Fame in 1978.[22]
