Hiram Bithorn Stadium (Estadio Hiram Bithorn in Spanish) is a baseball 
park in San Juan, Puerto Rico, operated by the municipal government of 
the city of San Juan. Its name honors the first Puerto Rican to play in 
the major leagues, Hiram Bithorn, who first played with the Chicago Cubs 
in 1942. Built in 1962, under the mayoral administration of Felisa Rincón 
de Gautier, replacing Estadio Sixto Escobar, the stadium is home to the 
Santurce Crabbers, of the Puerto Rico Baseball League. It was added to 
the National Register of Historic Places in 2014.[1] The stadium has approximately 
18,000 seats. The stadium is 325 feet (99 m) down the left field line, 
325 feet (99 m) down the right field line and 404 feet (123 m) to center 
field. The fences are 8 feet (2.5 m) high. When the Expos played home games 
at Hiram Bithorn, the field dimensions were set to match Olympic Stadium 
in Montreal.[citation needed] The first outdoor National Basketball Association 
game was played between the Phoenix Suns and the Milwaukee Bucks on September 
24, 1972 during that year's preseason. The Suns defeated the Bucks, 116–103. 
The stadium hosted Major League Baseball's Opening Day Game in 2001, in 
which the Toronto Blue Jays faced the Texas Rangers in an American League 
match-up.[2] However, 4,000 who bought tickets were turned away when the 
police determined the safe capacity of the park had been vastly exceeded. 
It was the object of a major overhaul under the mayoral administration 
of Jorge Santini, before becoming the part-time home of the Montreal Expos 
of the National League in 2003 and 2004 prior to their move to Washington, 
D.C. as the Washington Nationals. The Expos played 22 "home" games in each 
season as a result of poor attendance at their home Olympic Stadium in 
Montreal. Prior to Major League Baseball's announcement of the Montreal 
Expos move to Washington, Puerto Rico and San Juan made an effort to lure 
the Expos franchise to the island territory permanently. Hiram Bithorn 
Stadium hosted parts of the first two rounds of the 2006 World Baseball 
Classic. Pool C, which included the teams of Puerto Rico, Cuba, Panama, 
and the Netherlands, was played there. It also hosted Pool 2 of the second 
round of the Classic which featured Cuba, Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, 
and Venezuela, the top two finishers from Pool C and Pool D. Pool D games 
of the 2009 were played there between March 7 and March 11, 2009. The Hiram 
Bithorn Stadium hosted the 2013 World Baseball Classic with Puerto Rico, 
Venezuela, the Dominican Republic and newcomers Spain in Pool C. In 2008, 
it served as the stadium for Atléticos de San Juan and Academia Quintana, 
two soccer teams in the Puerto Rico Soccer League, Puerto Rico's first 
ever professional soccer league. In 2010, Major League Baseball returned 
to the stadium, as the Florida Marlins faced the New York Mets in a three-game 
series during the regular season. [3] The Marlins were to return to play 
the Pittsburgh Pirates on May 30 and 31, 2016 in honor of Roberto Clemente 
Day. However, on May 6, 2016, it was announced that the Puerto Rico games 
would be postponed due to the ongoing Zika virus outbreak, and moved to 
Marlins Park.[4] Along with sporting events, the stadium has hosted concerts 
by many famous artists. Metallica were scheduled to perform during their 
Nowhere Else to Roam Tour on April 28, 1993, but it was rained out and 
never rescheduled. Shakira has performed twice, during her Tour Anfibio, 
on April 9, 2000 and during the Tour of the Mongoose, on March 22, 2003.
