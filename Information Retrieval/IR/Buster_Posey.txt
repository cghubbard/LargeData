Gerald Dempsey "Buster" Posey III[1] (born March 27, 1987) is an American 
professional baseball catcher for the San Francisco Giants of Major League 
Baseball. He stands 6 feet 1 inch (1.85 m) tall and weighs 220 pounds (100 kg). 
He bats and throws right-handed. Posey has also filled in at first base 
for the Giants. Posey grew up in Leesburg, Georgia. He played four sports 
in high school; when playing baseball, he excelled at hitting and pitching. 
He attended Florida State University, where he began playing the catcher 
position. He won the Golden Spikes Award in 2008 and was selected by the 
Giants with the fifth overall pick in the 2008 Major League Baseball draft. 
Posey made his major league debut on September 11, 2009. After starting 
the 2010 season in the minor leagues, he was called back up to the major 
leagues in May. With the presence of then full-time catcher Bengie Molina, 
Posey played first base when originally called up to the majors, but became 
the Giants' regular catcher at the end of June when Molina was traded to 
the Texas Rangers, the team the Giants would later face in the World Series. 
As a rookie, he finished with a .305 batting average, 18 home runs, and 
67 runs batted in. He was named the National League (NL) Rookie of the 
Year. He caught every inning of the playoffs as the Giants won the 2010 
World Series. In 2011, Posey missed most of the year after he was severely 
injured in a collision with Scott Cousins at home plate. Posey returned 
from his injury in 2012 and posted a .336 batting average to win the 2012 
NL batting title. He became the second San Francisco Giant to win the batting 
title and was named the NL Most Valuable Player for 2012. He won his second 
World Series that year as the Giants swept the Detroit Tigers in four games. 
In 2013, Posey signed an eight-year contract extension worth $167 million, 
a record in sum and in length for a player with his level of experience.[2] 
He won his third World Series the following year as the Giants defeated 
the Kansas City Royals. Posey, the oldest of four children, was born to 
Gerald Dempsey "Buster" Posey II and Traci Posey on March 27, 1987, in 
Leesburg, Georgia.[3] His nickname, "Buster", came from his father's childhood 
nickname. He played football, soccer, and basketball growing up, but baseball 
was his main sport.[4] As a junior at Lee County High School, Posey pitched 
and played shortstop. That year he hit 9 doubles, 3 triples, and 7 home 
runs while setting school records for batting average (.544) and runs batted 
in (RBI) (46). His pitching achievements included a 10–1 record and a 1.53 
earned run average (ERA). In his senior year, he batted .462 with 40 RBI 
while setting a school record with 14 home runs. In 13 starts as a pitcher 
that year, he had a 12–0 record with a 1.06 ERA and 108 strikeouts. In 
the Georgia AAAA State Championship, Lee County was defeated by Henry County 
High, for whom fellow future major leaguer Jason Heyward played.[5] After 
his senior season, Posey was named the Georgia Gatorade Player of the Year, 
the Louisville Slugger State Player of the Year, an EA Sports All-American, 
and a Baseball America All-American. He graduated with a 3.94 grade point 
average in high school, fourth in his class of 302 students. Although he 
was drafted in the 50th round of the 2005 Major League Baseball (MLB) Draft 
by the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, he chose to enroll in college instead 
of signing a professional baseball contract.[3] Posey played college baseball 
for the Florida State Seminoles under coach Mike Martin. He played shortstop 
as a freshman at Florida State, starting all 65 games for the Seminoles. 
He was named a Louisville Slugger Freshman All-American. He finished his 
freshman season with a .346 batting average, four home runs and 48 RBI.[3] 
As a sophomore, Posey moved to the catcher position on the suggestion of 
assistant coach Mike Martin, Jr.[6] He batted .382 with three home runs 
and 65 RBI. After one season of playing the position, Posey finished second 
to Ed Easley in Johnny Bench Award voting.[7][8] In 2008, as a junior, 
he hit .463 with 26 home runs and 93 RBI, won the Johnny Bench Award, and 
garnered the Collegiate Baseball Player of the Year award.[8][9] On May 
12, he hit a grand slam and played all nine fielding positions in a 10–0 
victory over Savannah State University; as a pitcher that day, he struck 
out both batters he faced.[10][11] Posey was awarded the Dick Howser Trophy 
and the Golden Spikes Award at the end of the year.[12][13] During the 
college offseason, Posey started at shortstop for the Yarmouth-Dennis Red 
Sox in 2006 when they won the Cape Cod Baseball League championship. He 
started at catcher in 2007 when they won another championship.[14] Buster 
was considered by Baseball America to be the best catcher available in 
the 2008 Major League Baseball draft.[15] He was drafted by the San Francisco 
Giants with the fifth overall pick.[16] On August 16, the Giants signed 
Posey shortly before the signing deadline for draftees and gave him a $6.2 
million bonus, the largest up-front bonus in Giants history.[17] Entering 
the 2009 season, Baseball America ranked him the number two prospect in 
the Giants' organization (behind Madison Bumgarner).[18] He was invited 
to the Giants' spring training in 2009. Following spring training, Posey 
was assigned to the Giants' Class A Advanced affiliate, the San Jose Giants 
of the California League.[19] In 80 games with San Jose, he batted .326 
with 63 runs, 95 hits, 23 doubles, 13 home runs, and 58 RBI.[20] On July 
13, Posey was promoted to the Giants' Class AAA team, the Fresno Grizzlies 
of the Pacific Coast League.[21] In 35 games with Fresno, he batted .321 
with 21 runs scored, 42 hits, eight doubles, five home runs, and 22 RBI.[20] 
Because of an injury to Giants starting catcher Bengie Molina, Posey was 
called up to the majors for the first time on September 2, 2009.[22] He 
made his major league debut on September 11, striking out in his first 
at bat against Hiroki Kuroda of the Los Angeles Dodgers.[23] Posey got 
his first major league hit on September 19 against Jeff Weaver of the Dodgers.[24] 
In 17 at-bats with the Giants in 2009, Posey had two hits.[25] Coming into 
2010, Baseball America ranked Posey as the top prospect in the Giants' 
organization.[26] After again appearing in the Giants' spring training 
camp,[27] Posey began the 2010 season at Fresno, batting .349 with 31 runs 
scored, 60 hits, 13 doubles, six home runs, and 32 RBI in 47 games.[20] 
Posey was called up to the major leagues on May 29, 2010, and started at 
first base against the Arizona Diamondbacks. Posey drove in the first runs 
of his major league career, going three for four with three RBIs.[28] He 
appeared primarily at first base through the end of June. Posey hit his 
first career home run against Aaron Harang of the Cincinnati Reds on June 
9.[29] Following Molina's trade to the Texas Rangers on June 30, Posey 
became the starting catcher for the Giants.[30][31] Posey hit his first 
career grand slam against Chris Narveson of the Milwaukee Brewers on July 
7, en route to a two-home run, four-hit, six-RBI night.[32] This was part 
of a ten-game streak from July 1 to July 10 during which he batted .514 
with 19 hits, six home runs, and 13 RBI to set a National League (NL) record 
for rookies during any ten-day stretch according to the Elias Sports Bureau.[33] 
This performance also earned him the NL Player of the Week honors for the 
week of July 5–11, 2010.[34] In a July 10 game against the Washington Nationals, 
Posey was inserted into the Giants' batting order as the clean-up hitter, 
which became his regular position in the lineup.[35] He had a 21-game hitting 
streak that started July 4 and ended July 29 when Aníbal Sánchez of the 
Florida Marlins threw a one-hitter against the Giants. During the streak, 
which fell one game short of tying the San Francisco Giants' rookie mark 
set by Willie McCovey and five short of the team record, Posey batted .440 
with 37 hits, six home runs, and 23 RBI.[36][37] Posey was awarded both 
the NL Player of the Month and NL Rookie of the Month awards for his excellent 
July.[38] On September 21, Posey hit an eighth-inning home run against 
Andrew Cashner of the Chicago Cubs to win the game, 1-0. He hit another 
eighth-inning home run against Luke Gregerson of the San Diego Padres in 
the final game of the year on October 3 as Giants secured the NL West Division 
championship by defeating the Padres 3-0.[39] In 108 games, Posey batted 
.305 with 58 runs scored, 124 hits, 23 doubles, 18 home runs, and 67 RBI.[25] 
Posey was named the NL Rookie of the Year; Posey had 20 first place votes 
while Heyward, now playing for the Atlanta Braves, finished second with 
nine.[40] Posey was the sixth Giant to win the award, joining Willie Mays, 
Orlando Cepeda, Willie McCovey, Gary Matthews and John Montefusco. He was 
also the sixth catcher in NL history to win the award.[41] Posey was named 
by his peers as the NL Players Choice Awards Outstanding Rookie.[42] He 
was named the catcher on Baseball America's All-Rookie Team[43] and the 
2010 Topps Major League Rookie All-Star Team.[44] He finished 11th in NL 
Most Valuable Player (MVP) voting.[45] In the NL Division Series (NLDS) 
against the Braves, Posey batted .375 as the Giants won the series in four 
games.[46] In Game 4 of the NL Championship Series (NLCS) against the Philadelphia 
Phillies, he became the first rookie to get four hits in an NLCS game as 
the Giants won 6–5.[47] He batted .217 with five hits and three RBI in 
the series as the Giants defeated the Phillies in six games.[46] In Game 
4 of the World Series against the Texas Rangers, Posey and Madison Bumgarner 
formed the first rookie starting pitcher-catcher tandem in a World Series 
since Yogi Berra caught Spec Shea in Game 1 of the 1947 World Series. Posey 
hit his first postseason home run against Darren O'Day in the 4-0 victory, 
making him the fifth rookie catcher to hit a home run in the World Series.[48] 
The Giants won the series four games to one, giving Posey (who batted .300 
with a home run and two RBI in the Series) his first World Series ring. 
Posey caught every inning of the playoffs for the Giants.[46] Posey set 
season highs with three hits and four RBI on April 6, 2011, including a 
two-run home run against Tim Stauffer in an 8–4 victory over the Padres.[49] 
On May 25, during a game against the Florida Marlins, Posey was injured 
during a collision with Scott Cousins at home plate as Cousins scored the 
winning run in the 12th inning of a 7–6 Giants' loss. Posey suffered a 
fractured fibula and torn ligaments in his ankle, requiring season-ending 
surgery.[50][51] Cousins, who was not disciplined, said he hit Posey intentionally 
in order to score. "If you hit them, you punish them and you punish yourself, 
but you have a chance of that ball coming out."[52] He expressed regret 
over injuring Posey, saying "I certainly didn’t want him to get hurt."[53] 
Cousins received threats from fans, but Posey denounced them: "I appreciate 
the continued support of Giants fans and others as I begin the process 
of working my way back ... But in no way do I condone threats of any kind 
against Scott Cousins or his family. As I said last week, I'm not out to 
vilify Scott."[54] In 45 games, Posey batted .284 with 17 runs scored, 
46 hits, five doubles, four home runs, and 21 RBI.[25] Posey started at 
catcher during Matt Cain's perfect game on June 13, 2012,[55] the 22nd 
in major league history.[56] He stated afterwards that the game had him 
feeling "as nervous as I've ever been on a baseball field."[57] He played 
in the 2012 Major League Baseball All-Star Game, his first, on July 10, 
going 0-2 with a walk and a run scored.[58] After batting .289 with 10 
home runs and 43 RBI in 77 games before the All-Star break, Posey batted 
.385 with 14 home runs and 60 RBI in the final 71 games of the season.[59] 
On July 17, he had three hits and five RBI in a 9–0 victory over the Braves.[60] 
Four days later, he had four hits and three RBI, including a two-run home 
run against Cole Hamels in a 10-inning, 6–5 victory over the Phillies.[61] 
Two days later, he had three hits and four RBI, including a three-run home 
run against Clayton Richard in a 7–1 victory over the Padres.[62] He hit 
a game-winning three-run home run against Lance Lynn on August 7 in a 4–2 
victory over the St. Louis Cardinals.[63] On September 17, he had three 
hits, including a game-winning two-run home run against Wade Miley in a 
3–2 victory over the Diamondbacks.[64] In 148 games, Posey had 78 runs 
scored, 178 hits (tied for eighth in the NL with David Wright), 39 doubles 
(tied for eighth with Yonder Alonso), 24 home runs, and 103 RBI (sixth).[65] 
Posey's teammate Melky Cabrera batted .346 in 2012, but he asked MLB to 
rule him ineligible for the batting title after receiving a 50-game suspension 
for raised testosterone levels.[66] As a result, Posey led both leagues 
in batting in 2012 with an average of .336, becoming the first catcher 
to lead the NL in hitting since Ernie Lombardi of the Boston Braves in 
1942.[67] He also became only the second San Francisco Giant to win the 
batting title, following Barry Bonds in 2002 and 2004.[68] Posey's .433 
batting average against left-handed pitching (71 for 164) led all batters 
in the major leagues in 2012.[69] In Game 5 of the NLDS against the Reds 
on October 11, Posey hit a grand slam against Reds starter Mat Latos to 
give the Giants a 6-0 lead and subsequently won the game. The Giants become 
the second NL team to win a Division Series after being down two games 
to none and first since the LDS became a permanent standard in the playoffs 
in 1995. Posey became just the third catcher in MLB history to hit a grand 
slam in the playoffs, along with Berra and Eddie Pérez.[70] He also completed 
a strikeout-throw out double play at third base in the sixth inning to 
help preserve the victory.[71] He batted .154 with four hits and one RBI 
in the NLCS as the Giants defeated the Cardinals in seven games.[46] He 
hit a two-run home run against Max Scherzer in Game 4 of the World Series 
as the Giants swept the Detroit Tigers, giving Posey his second World Series 
ring.[72] After the season, the Baseball Writers' Association of America 
named Posey the NL MVP.[73] He won the Silver Slugger Award for the catcher 
position.[74] He won the NL Hank Aaron Award, and Miguel Cabrera of the 
Tigers won the American League (AL) award, marking the first time in history 
that World Series opponents won the award in the same year.[75] He was 
named the NL Comeback Player of the Year,[76] and he received the Willie 
Mac Award from the Giants' organization.[77] Eligible for salary arbitration 
for the first time, Posey signed a one-year, $8 million contract with the 
Giants prior to the 2013 spring training season.[78] On March 29, Posey 
agreed to an eight-year contract extension worth $167 million, said by 
the Giants to be the most lucrative in franchise history. The contract 
wiped out three arbitration years and five years of free agency for Posey, 
locking in his services through the 2021 season with a club option for 
2022. The agreement was the second largest in major league history for 
a catcher, exceeded only by that of Joe Mauer in 2010 with the Minnesota 
Twins.[79] On July 1, 2013, Posey was named National League Player of the 
Week for the week of June 23-June 29. It was the second time Posey earned 
the award during his career, and the first since 2010. In six games Posey 
hit .500, to raise his average from .307 to .322, had an on-base percentage 
of .560, a slugging percentage of 1.182, stroked four home runs, and drove 
in six.[80] On July 13, 2013, Posey caught Tim Lincecum's first no-hitter 
against the San Diego Padres. The no-hitter also marks the 15th ever in 
Giants history as well as the second performed in an away ballpark. On 
July 16, 2013, Posey played in his second straight All-Star Game, striking 
out in his only at-bat.[81] Posey's offense regressed in 2013 following 
his 2012 MVP season, especially in the second half of the season where 
he hit just 3 home runs. However, he still finished with a solid .294 batting 
average, 15 home runs and 72 runs batted in.[82] On July 13, 2014, Posey 
and pitcher Madison Bumgarner hit grand slam home runs against the Arizona 
Diamondbacks. It marked the first time in Major League Baseball history 
that a catcher and a pitcher hit grand slams in the same game.[83] On August 
29, 2014, in a 13–2 win over the Milwaukee Brewers at AT&T Park, Posey 
went 5-for-5 in 6 innings, and became the only catcher in Giants franchise 
history to have two career five-hit games.[84] In the 2014 World Series 
the Giants defeated the Kansas City Royals in seven games, giving Posey 
his third ring in five years. On June 9, 2015, Posey caught rookie Chris 
Heston's no-hitter against the New York Mets at Citi Field, including the 
final out, a strikeout. It marks the seventeenth no-hitter in Giants franchise 
history. This was the third no-hitter during which Posey played catcher 
and the fourth overall, as he started at first base in Tim Lincecum's second 
career no-hitter. This puts him one behind the record for no-hitters caught, 
held by the Philadelphia Phillies' Carlos Ruiz and the Boston Red Sox' 
Jason Varitek. On June 19, 2015, in a 9–5 win over the Los Angeles Dodgers 
at Dodger Stadium, Posey hit a grand slam and stole a base, becoming the 
first Giants catcher in 112 years since Roger Bresnahan to accomplish the 
feat.[85] Four days later, in a 6–0 win over the San Diego Padres at AT&T 
Park, Posey hit another grand slam. On July 5, 2015, Posey was selected 
to his third career All-Star Game and was number one in voting for NL catchers.[86] 
On September 6, 2015, at Coors Field, in a 7-4 win over the Colorado Rockies, 
Posey hit his 100th career home run.[87] On November 11, 2015, Posey was 
named winner of the 2015 Wilson Defensive Player of the Year award, given 
to the best defensive catcher in MLB.[88] The following day, Posey was 
named winner of the 2015 National League Silver Slugger award at catcher.[89] 
Posey finished 2015 with a .318 batting average, 19 homeruns, and 95 RBI's 
On May 28, in a 10–5 win over the Colorado Rockies at Coors Field, Posey 
hit two three-run home runs en route to a career-high six runs batted in.[90] 
It is the second most RBIs in a single game by a Giants catcher in the 
San Francisco Era. Posey was selected by Fan Voting to start at catcher 
in the 2016 MLB All Star Game, Posey's fourth career MLB All-Star Game, 
the most all-time by a Giants catcher in franchise history. He was the 
catcher for battery mate Johnny Cueto, the second battery mate he started 
and caught for in the Midsummer Classic after teammate Matt Cain in 2012.[91] 
On September 27, in a 12–3 win over the Colorado Rockies, Posey recorded 
the 1000th hit of his career, a solo home run off Germán Márquez.[92] Posey 
married his high school sweetheart, Kristen, in January 2009.[93] They 
had twins in 2011.[94] Posey lives with his family in the East Bay during 
the season, and they also have a home in Georgia during the off-season. 
Posey's younger sister, Samantha, played softball for Valdosta State University.
