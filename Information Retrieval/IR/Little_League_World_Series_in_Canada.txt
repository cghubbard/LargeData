Little League Baseball has been played in Canada since 1951. Cape Breton, 
Nova Scotia and Vancouver, British Columbia were the first leagues outside 
the United States. Approximately 500 leagues now operate in Canada, making 
it the second-largest country in Little League participation.[1] In 1952, 
Montreal, Quebec was the first foreign entry in the Little League World 
Series.[2] In 1953, Little Mountain Little League of Vancouver advanced 
to the World Series as representative of the Western Region. In 1958, Canada 
was given an automatic berth in the LLWS and have since participated in 
every tournament, with the exception of 1975. Until 1965, the Canadian 
region consisted of only teams from Ontario and Quebec.[3] Prior to this, 
the western provinces participated in tournament play with American teams 
in the Western Region, while the Maritime provinces were excluded. In 1965, 
Canada began play as a full region. Canada has never won the series, but 
in 1965 Stoney Creek Optimist Little League of Ontario reached the final. 
Valleyfield Little League (Salaberry-de-Valleyfield) is the league with 
the most championships (8), while Glace Bay LL, Whalley LL (Surrey), and 
Trail are second with five. As of the 2016 Little League World Series. 
Of the provinces where Little League-affiliated leagues operate, New Brunswick 
is the only one yet to be represented in the LLWS. The provinces of Manitoba, 
Newfoundland and Labrador, and Prince Edward Island have no leagues affiliated 
with Little League Baseball; the same holds true for Canada's three territories.
