The South Region was a region that competed in the Little League World 
Series between 1957 and 2000 until it was split into the Southwest and 
Southeast regions in 2001. The South Region was inaugurated in 1957. [1] 
The Region originally consisted of teams from Alabama, Arkansas, Delaware, 
Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, North Carolina, Oklahoma, 
South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, and West Virginia. In 1957, 
the Industrial Little League of Monterrey, Mexico won the South Region 
championship before Latin America was given its own berth starting with 
the 1958 LLWS. In 1968, Delaware and Maryland moved to the East Region. 
In 2000, Oklahoma replaced Kentucky in the region for one year before the 
region split into two. The tournament was held in Saint Petersburg, Florida 
each year between 1972 and 2000. Little League Baseball expanded the LLWS 
to sixteen teams for the 2001 Little League World Series. The South Region 
was split into the Southeast region – Alabama, Florida, Georgia, North 
Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia – and 
the Southwest region – Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Texas 
East, and Texas West, plus West Region teams Colorado and New Mexico. The
