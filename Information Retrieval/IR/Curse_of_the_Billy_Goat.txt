The Curse of the Billy Goat was a sports-related curse supposedly placed 
on the Chicago Cubs Major League Baseball franchise in 1945 by Billy Goat 
Tavern owner William Sianis that lasted in a 71-year period from 1945 to 
2016. Because the odor of his pet goat, named Murphy, was bothering other 
fans, Sianis was asked to leave Wrigley Field, the Cubs' home ballpark, 
during game 4 of the 1945 World Series.[1][2] Outraged, Sianis allegedly 
declared, "Them Cubs, they ain't gonna win no more," which had been interpreted 
to mean that either the Cubs would never win another National League (NL) 
pennant, or that they would never again win a World Series. The Cubs lost 
the 1945 World Series to the Detroit Tigers, and did not win a World Series 
championship again until 2016. After the incident with Sianis and Murphy, 
the Cubs did not play in the World Series for the next 71 years until, 
on the 46th anniversary of Billy Sianis' death,[3] they defeated the Los 
Angeles Dodgers 5–0 in game 6 of the 2016 National League Championship 
Series to win the NL pennant.[4] The Cubs defeated the American League 
(AL) champion Cleveland Indians 8–7 in game 7 (which lasted 10 innings) 
to win the 2016 World Series, thus ending the curse.[5] The exact nature 
of Sianis' curse differs in various accounts of the incident. Some state 
that he declared that no World Series games would ever again be played 
at Wrigley Field, while others believe that his ban was on the Cubs appearing 
in the World Series, making no mention of a specific venue. Sianis’ family 
claims that he dispatched a telegram to team owner Philip K. Wrigley which 
read, “You are going to lose this World Series and you are never going 
to win another World Series again. You are never going to win a World Series 
again because you insulted my goat.”[6][7] Whatever the truth, the Cubs 
were up two games to one in the 1945 Series, but ended up losing Game 4, 
as well as the best-of-seven series, four games to three. The curse was 
immortalized in newspaper columns over the years, particularly by syndicated 
columnist Mike Royko. The curse gained widespread attention during the 
2003 postseason, when Fox television commentators played it up during the 
Cubs-Marlins matchup in the National League Championship Series (NLCS).[8] 
According to an account in the Chicago Sun of October 7, 1945, the goat 
was turned away at the gate, and Sianis left the goat tied to a stake in 
a parking lot and went into the game alone. There was mention of a lawsuit 
that day, but no mention of a curse. Some believe that the curse actually 
goes back to 1908, the last time the Cubs won the World Series, due to 
the 'underhanded' way the Cubs advanced to that year's World Series, which 
'angered' the baseball gods.[9]Between that 1908 triumph, which was the 
Cubs' second world championship (they'd also won the Series in 1907 to 
become baseball's first back-to-back winners as well as the first franchise 
to appear in three consecutive World Series), and 1945, the first year 
of the alleged Billy Goat curse, the Cubs won the National League pennant 
six times but failed to win the Series: in 1910, in 1918 (won by the Boston 
Red Sox who themselves would soon become victims of an alleged baseball 
curse and not win another Series for 86 years), in 1929, in 1932 (known 
for Babe Ruth's called shot at Wrigley Field), in 1935 (a re-match of the 
1908 series against the Detroit Tigers, with the Tigers winning this time, 
their first Series triumph in five appearances dating back to the early 
1900s), and in 1938. On September 9, 1969, at Shea Stadium, the Cubs played 
the New York Mets in a critical pennant race game. A stray black cat walked 
between Cubs captain Ron Santo, who was on deck, and the Cubs dugout. The 
Mets would pull ahead of the Cubs in that series and eventually win the 
1969 World Series.[10] In 1984, the Cubs’ postseason appearance was dashed 
by the San Diego Padres. The Cubs were victorious in the first two games 
of the best-of-five series. However, in game five, first baseman Leon Durham 
let a ground ball get past his allegedly wet glove in the bottom of the 
seventh inning. The Padres went on to score four runs to win the game and 
the series.[11] Bill Buckner played for the Chicago Cubs for seven seasons 
before being traded to the Boston Red Sox halfway through the 1984 season. 
The Red Sox were at the time also considered a cursed franchise, and had 
not won a World Series since 1918 - when, coincidentally, they had beaten 
the Cubs. Buckner and the Red Sox advanced to the 1986 World Series against 
the New York Mets, and took a 3–2 series lead coming into Game 6. On October 
25, 1986, in one of the most famous baseball errors of all time, Buckner 
allowed a ball to pass between his legs at first base, allowing the Mets 
to score the winning run in the 10th inning and win Game 6. Later analysis 
of a photograph of Buckner walking off the field after his blooper showed 
that he had been wearing a Cubs batting glove under his glove at the moment 
he committed his error.[12] On October 14, 2003, in the eighth inning of 
Game 6 of the National League Championship Series (NLCS), with Chicago 
ahead 3–0 and holding a three games to two lead in the best of seven series, 
several spectators attempted to catch a foul ball off the bat of Marlins 
second baseman Luis Castillo. One of the fans, Steve Bartman, reached for 
the ball, deflecting it and disrupting a potential catch by Cubs outfielder 
Moisés Alou. If Alou had caught the ball, it would have been the second 
out in the inning and the Cubs would have been just four outs away from 
winning their first National League pennant since 1945. Instead, the Cubs 
ended up surrendering eight runs in the inning and losing the game, 8–3. 
When they were eliminated in the seventh game the next day, the incident 
was seen as the "first domino" in the turning point of the series.[13] 
Sianis' goat was named Murphy. In the 2015 National League Championship 
Series, this was referenced by fans of the New York Mets, who joked that 
Daniel Murphy, the Mets second baseman, was "not the first GOAT (Greatest 
of All Time, in reference to Murphy's postseason heroics to that point) 
named Murphy to keep the Cubs out of the World Series."[14] Prior to his 
death on October 22, 1970, Billy Sianis himself attempted to lift the curse. 
Sam Sianis, his nephew, has gone to Wrigley Field with a goat multiple 
times in attempts to break the curse, including on Opening Day in 1984 
and again in 1989, both years in which the Cubs went on to win their division. 
In 1994 Sam Sianis went again, with a goat, to stop a home losing streak, 
and in 1998 for the Wild Card tie-breaker game, which the Cubs won.[15] 
In 2003 (the Chinese zodiac's Year of the Goat), a group of Cubs fans headed 
to Houston with a billy goat named "Virgil Homer" and attempted to gain 
entrance to Minute Maid Park, home of the Astros, division rivals of the 
Cubs at the time.[16] After they were denied entrance, they unfurled a 
scroll, read a verse and proclaimed they were "reversing the curse." The 
Cubs won the division that year and then came within five outs of playing 
in the World Series, but were undone by the Florida Marlins' eight-run 
rally immediately following the Steve Bartman incident. The Cubs then lost 
the following game and with it the series. (The Marlins went on to win 
the World Series against the New York Yankees.) Further salting the wound, 
the Astros earned their first World Series berth two years later and their 
crosstown rival the Chicago White Sox won the series. On February 26, 2004, 
at the Harry Caray Restaurant in downtown Chicago, the Bartman baseball 
was electrocuted in an attempt to break the curse, leaving nothing but 
a heap of string behind. In another bizarre twist, it was reported that 
a butchered goat was hung from the Harry Caray statue on October 3, 2007, 
to which The Chicago Sun-Times noted: "If the prankster intended to reverse 
the supposed billy goat curse with the stunt, it doesn't appear to have 
worked."[17] While the Cubs did win the NL Central division title in 2007 
and 2008, they were swept in the first round of the postseason in both 
years: by the Arizona Diamondbacks in 2007 and the Los Angeles Dodgers 
in 2008. The elimination by Arizona came on October 6, the same date that 
the goat appeared at Wrigley Field in 1945.[18] In 2008, a Greek Orthodox 
priest sought to end the curse during the 2008 playoffs with a spraying 
of holy water in and around the Cubs dugout to no avail.[19] The act was 
repeated before the home opener in 2009, this time a goat's butchered head 
being hung from the statue. The act was futile as the Cubs were eliminated 
from postseason contention on September 26, 2009.[20] Cubs fans have also 
brought in priests that have blessed the field, stadium, and dugout. On 
April 1, 2011, a social enterprise called Reverse The Curse, dedicated 
to bringing innovations to poverty by giving goats to families in developing 
countries, was initiated.[21] The goats provide the family with milk, cheese, 
and alternative income to help lift them out of poverty. Reverse The Curse 
has expanded into reversing the "curses" that afflict the world's children 
in education and obesity. On February 25, 2012, a group of five Chicago 
Cubs fans calling themselves Crack the Curse set-out on foot from Mesa, 
Arizona (home to the Cubs' spring training facilities) to Wrigley Field. 
They brought along a goat named Wrigley whom they believed would be able 
to break the Curse of the Billy Goat upon arrival at Wrigley Field. Additionally, 
they attempted to raise $100,000 for the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research 
Center.[22] On April 10, 2013, a severed goat's head was delivered to the 
Cubs in a possible effort to lift the curse on the team. It was addressed 
to the club's owner Thomas S. Ricketts.[23] On September 22, 2015, Patrick 
Bertoletti, Tim Brown, Takeru Kobayashi, Kevin Strahle and Bob Shoudt consumed 
a 40-pound goat in 13 minutes and 22 seconds at Taco in a Bag restaurant 
in Chicago.[24] On October 7, 2016, The owners of The Chicago Diner, a 
local vegetarian eatery near Wrigley Field, teamed up with Farm Sanctuary 
to try to reverse the Curse of the Billy Goat by displaying posters in 
the windows at their locations. The posters feature a goat named Peanut 
who urges Chicagoans to “reverse the curse” by going meat-free.[25] Another 
factor that may play a role in the curse is the number of players (42 of 
them are listed below) who won World Series titles after leaving the Cubs 
(known as the Ex-Cubs Factor). These players include Andy Pafko (who, coincidentally, 
played in the 1945 World Series as a member of the Cubs), Gene Baker, Smoky 
Burgess, Don Hoak, Dale Long, Lou Brock (whose first title was in 1964 
after a mid-season trade to the St. Louis Cardinals), Lou Johnson, Jim 
Brewer, Moe Drabowsky, Don Cardwell, Ken Holtzman, Paul Noce, Billy North, 
Fred Norman, Bill Madlock, Manny Trillo, Greg Gross, Rick Monday, Burt 
Hooton, Bruce Sutter, Willie Hernández, Milt Wilcox, Joe Niekro, Dennis 
Eckersley, Joe Carter, Greg Maddux, Joe Girardi (as both a player and a 
manager), José Vizcaíno, Glenallen Hill (after his second stint with the 
Cubs; his title came in 2000 after a mid-season trade), Luis Gonzalez, 
Mike Morgan, Mark Grace, Mark Bellhorn, Bill Mueller, Scott Eyre (whose 
title came in 2008 after he had been traded from the Cubs during the season), 
Tom Gordon, Matt Stairs, Jamie Moyer, Mark DeRosa, Mike Fontenot, Ryan 
Theriot, Ángel Pagán, and, in 2013, Ryan Dempster. Dontrelle Willis and 
Jon Garland were traded as minor leaguers (coincidentally, the former won 
a World Series ring with the Marlins team that defeated the Cubs in the 
2003 NLCS). Tim Lincecum, who went on to win three World Series titles, 
was originally drafted by the Cubs, but he did not sign with them.[26] 
In 2016, the Cubs won the World Series for the first time since 1908, ending 
the historic 108 year drought and the "curse." The Cubs ended the 2016 
season with a 103–58 (.640) record. It was their first 100-win season since 
1935 (100–54, .649), their best since 1910 (104–50, .675), and the sixth 
100-win season in franchise history—the others being 1906 (116–36, .763), 
1907 (107–45, .704) and 1909 (104–50, .675). The Cubs won their first National 
League Championship Series (NLCS), their first pennant in 71 years, with 
a 5–0 shutout against the Los Angeles Dodgers at Wrigley Field on October 
22, 2016, the 46th anniversary of Billy Sianis' death.[3] The Cubs beat 
the Cleveland Indians in the 2016 World Series in seven games after they 
were down three games to one. They won Game 7 by a score of 8–7 in 10 innings.
