Joseph "Joe" Patrick Mauer (born April 19, 1983) is an American professional 
baseball player. He has played as a catcher, designated hitter, and first 
baseman for the Minnesota Twins in Major League Baseball (MLB).[1] He is 
the only catcher in MLB history to win three batting titles, and the only 
catcher to ever win a batting title in the American League. He also won 
three consecutive Gold Glove awards (2008–2010), and the 2009 American 
League (AL) Most Valuable Player (MVP) Award.[2] Mauer played football, 
basketball, and baseball for St. Paul's Cretin-Derham Hall Raiders, the 
high school of Hall of Fame member Paul Molitor,[3][4] In his senior year 
he became the only athlete ever to be selected as the USA Today High School 
Player of the Year in two sports (football in 2000 as a quarterback and 
baseball in 2001 as a catcher).[5] In December 2009, Sports Illustrated 
magazine included Mauer in its article on ten "signature" moments in U.S. 
high-school sports in the 2000–2009 decade, referring to his selection 
by the Minnesota Twins as the first pick in the 2001 amateur draft.[6] 
Mauer attended the same high school as Baseball Hall of Famer and former 
Milwaukee Brewer Paul Molitor who is his current manager.[7] Molitor has 
said that Mauer "has the best swing he had ever seen".[8] Jim O'Neill, 
Mauer's baseball coach at Cretin-Derham Hall, said his former student "has 
been groomed for this job since he was a little boy. Mauer's dad, Jake, 
created a contraption for Joe he later named the 'Quickswing'. The device 
dropped balls down a tube from eye level and released them at waist level." 
Mauer had been asked to leave his T-ball league at the age of four, because 
he was hitting the ball too hard for the other players.[9] "Another guy 
that came from Cretin-Derham Hall, Paul Molitor, was very similar, [and] 
had a good short swing", O'Neill said. "And they're both able to wait on 
the ball so long because they don't have the big swing. Like anything, 
you keep simple and keep it small or short, there's not a lot of holes 
in it and not a lot of room for errors."[10] A stand-out in baseball, Mauer 
struck out only once during his four-year high school career, and hit .605 
during his senior season.[8][11] Years later, Mauer laughingly told an 
interviewer: "I can remember the time I did strike out. It was junior year, 
and it was in the state tournament. I came back to the bench and everybody 
thought something was wrong with me."[9] Mauer's high school batting average 
exceeded .500 every year.[10] He also set a Minnesota high school record 
and tied the national preps mark by hitting a home run in seven consecutive 
games.[7] Mauer caught for the Team USA Junior National team from 1998 
to 2000 and hit .595 during his final year on the team. He was voted best 
hitter at the World Junior Baseball Championship in Canada in 2000. In 
2001, Mauer was voted the United States District V Player of the Year. 
Mauer averaged more than 20 points a game as a point guard for Cretin-Derham 
Hall.[10] He was also named to the All-State team during his final two 
years on Cretin-Derham's basketball team.[12] Mauer had an extremely accomplished 
high school football career. In 2000, he appeared in the Faces in the Crowd 
section in Sports Illustrated. During his senior season as the Raiders' 
quarterback, Mauer completed 178 of 269 passes (66% completion percentage), 
for 3,022 yards, 41 touchdowns and 5 interceptions.[13] He finished his 
two-year career as a starter with 5,528 yards and 73 touchdowns,[8] leading 
the Raiders to two consecutive Class 5A State Championship Game appearances 
and winning the title in 1999, the Raiders' first of all time. Mauer was 
honored as the 2001 Gatorade National Player of the Year, was named to 
the USA Today All-USA high school football team, was honored as USA Today's 
Player of the Year, was a Reebok/ESPN High School All-American, and was 
awarded Player of the Year for the game that would go on to be known as 
the U.S. Army All-American Bowl. Mauer was also named National High School 
Quarterback of the Year in 2000 by The National Quarterback Club.[12] After 
committing to play football at Florida State University, Mauer ultimately 
decided instead to enter the Major League Baseball Draft.[12] Mauer was 
selected by the Twins as the first overall pick of the 2001 draft, ahead 
of college pitcher Mark Prior, who was taken second overall by the Chicago 
Cubs.[14] Mauer was part of the United States' roster at the 2003 All-Star 
Futures Game at U.S. Cellular Field before being promoted to the Twins' 
roster in 2004 after his predecessor, A. J. Pierzynski, was traded to the 
San Francisco Giants, in the 2003 offseason. Mauer went 2-for-3 in his 
Major League debut, hitting a single off Rafael Betancourt of the Cleveland 
Indians for his first major-league hit. A knee injury to his left medial 
meniscus on April 7, 2004, required surgery and sidelined Mauer for more 
than a month. After a rehabilitation stint with the Twins' AAA affiliate 
Rochester Red Wings, Mauer returned to the Twins' lineup in June. In July, 
pain and swelling in his knee forced an early end to Mauer's 2004 season. 
Following his injury-shortened 2004, Mauer signed a contract for $5.7 million 
with the Twins on January 24, 2005. In 2005, Mauer returned to the Twins' 
lineup for his first full major league season and had 144 hits in 131 games, 
with 9 home runs and 55 RBI. He ended the year with an average of .294. 
In his breakout 2006 season, Mauer became the first catcher in American 
League history to lead the American League in batting average, finishing 
with an average of .347.[15] Mauer's performance during the months of May 
and June garnered attention from the national media. He recorded a .528 
batting average over the first ten days of June and hit .452 over the course 
of the month.[16] He was also the first player since Mike Piazza in 1997 
to reach base four or more times for five consecutive games.[17] On June 
12, Mauer was named the American League Player of the Week by Major League 
Baseball for his performance the week of June 4–11, during which he hit 
.625 (15-for-24) with 5 doubles, 4 RBI and 2 stolen bases.[18] Mauer recorded 
his first five RBI game June 26, against the Los Angeles Dodgers.[16] Mauer 
followed that up with his first career five-hit game on June 27, also against 
the Los Angeles Dodgers.[16] He was also named MLB Player of the Month 
for June after batting .452 with a .624 slugging percentage and .528 on-base 
percentage, 11 doubles, 14 RBI and 18 runs. Along with Johan Santana (Pitcher 
of the Month) and Francisco Liriano (Rookie of the Month), Mauer was part 
of the first-ever single-team sweep of MLB's three monthly awards.[19] 
On July 2, Mauer was selected by the players to his first All-Star Game.[20] 
Mauer appeared on the cover of the August 7, 2006 issue of Sports Illustrated.[21] 
Mauer finished the 2006 regular season with a .347 batting average, edging 
the New York Yankees' Derek Jeter and Robinson Canó to win the American 
League batting title and become the first-ever American League catcher 
to win the crown and the first catcher to claim the title since Ernie Lombardi 
in 1942 with the Boston Braves. His .347 average was the highest in the 
Major Leagues, a feat not achieved by the previous three catchers to win 
NL batting titles.[15][22] He was the youngest player to win a batting 
title since Alex Rodriguez in 1996.[22] After going 2-for-4 in the last 
game of the 2006 regular season, Mauer confessed to reporters, "When I 
told you I wasn’t thinking about the batting title? I was lying. I’ve never 
been that nervous in my life. I haven’t felt anything like that since Opening 
Day as a rookie." Mauer won his first Silver Slugger Award in 2006, along 
with teammate Justin Morneau.[23] On February 11, Mauer agreed to a four-year, 
$34 million contract with the Twins to avoid arbitration. The deal ensured 
that Mauer would remain in Minnesota long enough to play in the Twins' 
Target Field in 2010.[24] On July 21, Mauer hit his first career inside-the-park 
home run against Angels pitcher Scot Shields. It was his fifth home run 
of the season, and there were two players on base when he hit the homer. 
It was the first inside-the-park home run by a catcher since Kelly Stinnett 
did it for the Arizona Diamondbacks in 2005.[25] In 2008, he became the 
first American League catcher to win the batting title twice when he led 
the AL with an average of .328. On July 6, Mauer was announced as the starting 
catcher for the American League in the 2008 Major League Baseball All-Star 
Game.[26] Mauer underwent surgery for kidney obstruction on December 22. 
Mauer won his first Gold Glove award in 2008, announced on November 6.[27] 
He finished fourth in the balloting for American League Most Valuable Player, 
behind Dustin Pedroia, Justin Morneau, and Kevin Youkilis.[28] In 2009, 
he became the first catcher to lead the league in batting average, on-base 
percentage, and slugging percentage in a single year, and the first player 
to lead the American League in all three since George Brett did so in 1980. 
Mauer's .365 average, which is the highest mark among catchers (with at 
least 3.1 plate appearances per game) since 1901, and the highest by a 
Twin since Rod Carew's .388 in 1977, led Major League Baseball.[29][30] 
Mauer also won his second consecutive Gold Glove in 2009.[31] Mauer was 
named the American League's 2009 MVP by a near-unanimous decision (27 out 
of 28 first place votes).[32] On March 11, Mauer was diagnosed with inflammation 
in the sacroiliac joint by team doctors following a magnetic resonance 
arthrogram. He was unable to take part in team workouts during spring training 
due to the pain in his lower back, which he first began experiencing late 
in the 2008 season.[33] Mauer missed the start of the 2009 regular season 
and returned on May 1. He went 2 for 3 with an RBI and three runs scored 
in his first game back, hitting a home run on his first swing of the season.[34] 
He returned May 1, and had the best month of his career. Mauer hit 11 home 
runs and drove in 32 RBI, becoming the first-ever Twins player to reach 
that mark in a single month. During the week of May 18–24, Mauer led the 
major leagues in batting average at .458 (11–24), RBI with 13, and runs 
scored with 12, also hitting 4 HR and accumulating 25 total bases. On May 
26, he was named MLB Player of the Week for his performance.[35] Through 
the month of May, Mauer lead the major leagues in AVG at .414, OBP at .500, 
and SLG at .838, in addition to his HR and RBI totals, earning him his 
second Player of the Month Award honors.[36] Mauer appeared on the cover 
of Sports Illustrated for a second time on June 24. An additional 25,000 
copies of the magazine were sent to Minnesota for the occasion.[37] He 
was selected to the 2009 MLB All Star Game as the starting catcher and 
participated in the Home Run Derby, losing a tiebreaker to Albert Pujols 
in the first round. The Twins trailed the Detroit Tigers by seven games 
in the American League Central division at the start of September, but 
rallied, winning 17 of their last 21 games to finish the season tied atop 
the division. On October 6, the Twins beat the Tigers 6–5 in Game 163, 
a 12 inning one-game playoff, to secure the division title.[38] In 2009 
Mauer led the American League in batting average (.365), on-base percentage 
(.444), slugging percentage (.587), and OPS (1.031)[39] Mauer became the 
first catcher to lead the league in all four offensive categories in a 
single season, and the first catcher to win three batting titles.[40] He 
had won as many batting championships in a span of four years as all other 
Major League catchers in the history of baseball through 2009 combined. 
Two National League catchers had won a total of three batting titles: Eugene 
"Bubbles" Hargrave in 1926, and Hall of Famer Ernie Lombardi in 1938 and 
1942 (Buster Posey would go on to win it in 2012).[41] On October 29, Baseball 
America named Mauer its 2009 Major League Player of the Year.[42] On November 
23 Mauer was named the 2009 American League Most Valuable Player by the 
Baseball Writers' Association of America, with 27 of 28 first place votes. 
This made Mauer the third catcher in 33 years to win the AL MVP.[43] On 
March 21, 2010, Mauer agreed to an eight-year contract extension with the 
Twins worth $184 million, which took effect in the 2011 and will run through 
the 2018 season.[7] It remains the richest contract in the history of major 
league baseball for a catcher.[7] On July 26, 2010, Mauer hit a home run 
and drove in a career-high seven runs in the Twins' 19-1 win over the rival 
Kansas City Royals. He hit his 1,000th career Major League hit on 9/14/10 
against the Chicago White Sox at U.S. Cellular Field. Mauer underwent arthroscopic 
knee surgery after the 2010 season, and missed most of spring training 
due to a difficult recovery from the operation.[44] After further difficulties 
during the first days of the season, he was placed on the disabled list 
immediately after the Twins' game on April 15.[45] Team doctors believed 
his problem, termed a "bilateral leg weakness", was due to too light a 
workload during spring training.[46] Mauer returned to game action as a 
designated hitter in extended spring training on May 25,[47] and made his 
first post-DL appearance as a catcher in another extended spring training 
game on June 2.[44] The following week, he went on a further rehabilitation 
assignment to the Twins' Class A affiliate, the Fort Myers Miracle, a team 
managed by his older brother Jake.[47] After Mauer caught several games 
with the Miracle, it was speculated he could return to the Twins as early 
as June 16 or 17, but Twins manager Ron Gardenhire did not commit to a 
return date.[48] Joe Mauer returned to play with the Minnesota Twins on 
June 17, 2011 and received a standing ovation from the fans.[49] He made 
his first Major League start at first base on July 7, 2011 in Chicago, 
where he turned the first ball hit to him into an unassisted double play. 
In all he had 13 putouts and 2 assists and went 3-for-5 at the plate with 
2 RBI in a 6–2 victory over the White Sox.[50] On August 18, 2011 Mauer 
played his first game in right field. He had 3 putouts and went 1-for-3 
with 1 RBI in an 8 to 4 Twins loss against the New York Yankees.[51] Mauer 
struggled the entire summer with various ailments, from complications due 
to surgery in the beginning pnemonia at the end of the season, and had 
undoubtedly the worst season of his career. He played in only 82 games 
all year (career 126 average per season, not counting the 35 games he played 
in 2004), batted only .287 (career .323), and caught only 52 games.[52] 
He hoped to return to form in 2012.[53] At the start of spring training, 
Mauer expressed strong dissatisfaction with the previous season, saying 
"I've kind of been answering...questions [about last season] all winter, 
and it left a bad taste in a lot of people's mouths, and mine included, 
but it's a new year, and as soon as we can forget about 2011, the better, 
and focus on not letting it happen again." [54] On July 1, it was announced 
that he would be headed for his fifth All-Star Game. Mauer's batting average 
was .325 in the first half of the season, including 4 homers and 36 RBI.[55] 
By mid-July, Mauer had the second highest batting average in the American 
League.[56] On August 27, Mauer played his 832nd game at catcher for the 
Twins, breaking a franchise record set by Earl Battey.[57] Mauer was the 
Twins Opening Day catcher, with Ryan Doumit as his backup, and also saw 
time at first base and designated hitter. Through the first half, he hit 
.320 with 8 HR, 32 RBI and 50 runs including consecutive 4-hit games against 
the Angels in April and a 15-game hitting streak from April 30 to May 18. 
He was named to his 6th All-Star Game as the starting catcher. On August 
20, Mauer went on the 7-day disabled list with concussion-like symptoms 
suffered the previous game. In his absence, Doumit, Chris Herrmann and 
Josmil Pinto started at catcher. Mauer never returned to line-up and his 
season ended after 113 games. For the season, he hit .324/.404/.476 with 
11 HR, 47 RBI, 62 runs, 35 doubles and 61 walks, while earning the 2013 
AL Silver Slugger Award at catcher. He and former Yankee Horace Clarke 
the only hitters ever to break up three no-hitter bids in the ninth inning.[58] 
On November 11, the Twins announced that Mauer would permanently move to 
first base in order to protect their star player from further concussions 
and the day-to-day physical wear of being a major league catcher.[59] In 
2014, Mauer played in 120 games, compiling a slash line of .277/.361/.371 
with 4 HR, 55 RBI, 60 runs, and 27 doubles. Mauer was selected as a catcher 
and first baseman for Team USA in the 2013 World Baseball Classic. Mauer 
modeled for Perry Ellis in the 2004–05 off-season, and is featured in television 
commercials for Head & Shoulders, Pepsi, ESPN, Fox Sports Net, PlayStation 
3, Gatorade and my29.[63] Mauer's Quickswing Camp is held annually in the 
winter at a St. Paul area college. The camp teaches youth the basics of 
batting skills. Mauer taped an episode of Homecoming with Rick Reilly for 
ESPN on January 27, 2010 at Cretin-Derham Hall High School, his alma mater, 
in St. Paul, Minnesota. The episode aired on April 12, 2010. Mauer appeared 
in a TV commercial for Explore Minnesota, the state tourism agency, in 
March 2011.[64] Mauer was the cover athlete for Sony Computer Entertainment's 
MLB 10: The Show and MLB 11: The Show game for the PlayStation platform.[65] 
The game's tagline, "Well played, Mauer", used by actor Jerry Lambert (playing 
the role of fictional vice president Kevin Butler) in television commercials 
promoting the game (in the ad, Mauer and Butler were playing MLB 11 and 
Mauer hits a home run to deep right field), was mimicked by Twins announcer 
Dick Bremer during a game versus the visiting Kansas City Royals on June 
10, 2010. Royals outfielder Mitch Maier fouled back a pitch from Twins 
pitcher Brian Duensing. The ball traveled over the protective net behind 
the home plate area. Mauer tracked the ball, reached around the screen, 
and caught it, leading Bremer to exclaim, "Did he catch that? Oh, well 
played, Mauer!" The catch is featured in MLB 11: The Show's "Joe Mauer" 
introductory vignette.[66] Mauer appeared as a playable pro in Backyard 
Baseball 2009.[67] Mauer shared a house with former Twins teammate Justin 
Morneau in St. Paul during the 2006 season.[68][69] Mauer is also notable 
for the long sideburns that he has worn ever since joining the big leagues. 
On August 10, 2006, the Minnesota Twins held "Joe Mauer Sideburns Night" 
in honor of the catcher. The first 10,000 fans were given synthetic replica 
sideburns with double-sided tape to share in Mauer's trademark look.[70] 
On December 11, 2011, Mauer announced his engagement to St. Paul nurse 
Maddie Bisanz, his girlfriend of about 18 months and a fellow graduate 
of Cretin-Derham Hall High School. The couple were married on December 
1, 2012 at Nativity of Our Lord Catholic Church in St. Paul, Minnesota. 
Justin Morneau was a groomsman.[71][72][73] Their fraternal twin daughters
