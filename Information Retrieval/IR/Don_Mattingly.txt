As player As manager As coach Donald Arthur Mattingly (born April 20, 1961) 
is an American professional baseball first baseman, coach and current manager 
of the Miami Marlins. Nicknamed "The Hit Man" and "Donnie Baseball", he 
spent his entire 14-year career playing with the New York Yankees and later 
managed the Los Angeles Dodgers for five years. Mattingly graduated from 
Reitz Memorial High School in Evansville, Indiana, and was selected by 
the Yankees in the amateur draft. Debuting with the Yankees in 1982 after 
three seasons in minor league baseball, Mattingly emerged as the Yankees' 
starting first baseman after a successful rookie season in 1983. Mattingly 
was named to the American League (AL) All-Star team six times. He won nine 
Gold Glove Awards, three Silver Slugger Awards, the 1984 AL batting title, 
and was the 1985 AL Most Valuable Player. Mattingly served as captain of 
the Yankees from 1991 through 1995, when he retired as a player. The Yankees 
retired Mattingly's uniform number, 23, after his retirement. Returning 
to the Yankees as a coach in 2004 for manager Joe Torre, he followed Torre 
to the Dodgers in 2008, and succeeded him as the Dodgers' manager in 2011. 
The Dodgers and Mattingly mutually parted ways after the 2015 season, and 
he became manager of the Miami Marlins. Mattingly is ambidextrous. He pitched 
in Little League Baseball and was a first baseman also, throwing both righthanded 
and lefthanded, and was a member of the 1973 Great Scot Little League championship 
team in Evansville, Indiana under the coaching of Pete Studer and Earl 
Hobbs. In American Legion baseball for Funkhouser Post #8, Mattingly played 
at second base, throwing right-handed.[1] Mattingly attended Reitz Memorial 
High School in Evansville. Playing for the school's baseball team, the 
Tigers, Mattingly led the school to a state record 59 straight victories 
through the 1978–79 season. The Tigers won the state championship in 1978 
and finished as the runner-up in 1979. Mattingly was the L.V. Phillips 
Mental Attitude recipient in 1979. He was All-City, All-Southern Indiana 
Athletic Conference, and All-State in both 1978 and 1979. During the four 
years he played in high school, the Tigers compiled a 94–9–1 win-loss record, 
as Mattingly had a .463 batting average. He still holds Reitz Memorial 
records for hits (152), doubles (29), triples (25), runs batted in (RBIs) 
(140), and runs scored (99). His 25 triples are also an Indiana state record.[2] 
A multi-sport athlete, he was also selected 'All-Conference' in the always 
tough SIAC[3] Following his high school career, Mattingly accepted a scholarship 
to play baseball for the Indiana State Sycamores. His father, Bill, informed 
Major League Baseball (MLB) teams that his son intended to honor that commitment, 
and would not sign a professional contract. Mattingly lasted in the 1979 
MLB draft until the 19th round, when he was selected by the New York Yankees. 
He was not interested in attending college, so he chose to sign with the 
Yankees, receiving a $23,000 signing bonus.[1][4] Mattingly began his professional 
career in Minor League Baseball with the Oneonta Yankees of the Class A-Short 
Season New York–Penn League in 1979. He hoped to bat .500 for Oneonta, 
and was disappointed with his .349 batting average, which never went lower 
than .340.[1] He batted .358 in 1980, and .316 in 1981. Despite Mattingly's 
hitting ability, there was concern about his lack of speed and power. Bob 
Schaefer, his manager with the Greensboro Hornets of the Class A South 
Atlantic League in 1980, said that the organization considered moving Mattingly 
to second base, where he would throw right-handed.[1] Mattingly was hitting 
.325 for the Columbus Clippers of the Class AAA International League when 
he made it to the majors late in the 1982 season.[5] Mattingly made his 
Major League debut on September 8, 1982, as a late inning defensive replacement 
against the Baltimore Orioles.[6] He recorded his first at-bat on September 
11 against the Milwaukee Brewers, popping out to third base in the seventh 
inning.[7] His first career Major League hit occurred in the bottom of 
the 11th inning against the Boston Red Sox on October 1, a single to right 
field off of Steve Crawford.[8] He only had 2 hits in 12 at-bats that season. 
Mattingly spent his rookie season of 1983 as a part-time first baseman 
and outfielder. He hit .283 in 279 at-bats. He hit his first home run on 
June 24 against John Tudor of the Red Sox.[9] Mattingly became the Yankees' 
full-time first baseman in 1984 after the trade of Steve Balboni to the 
Kansas City Royals.[10][better source needed] Heading into the final game 
of the season, Mattingly and teammate Dave Winfield were competing for 
the American League batting title, with Mattingly trailing Winfield by 
.002. On the final day of the season. Mattingly went 4-for-5, while Winfield 
batted 1-for-4. Mattingly won the batting title with a .343 average, while 
Winfield finished second with a .340 average.[1] Mattingly also led the 
league with 207 hits. He hit a league-leading 44 doubles to go with 23 
home runs. He was second in the league in slugging percentage (.537) and 
at bats per strikeout (18.3), fourth in total bases (324), fifth in RBIs 
(110), sixth in sacrifice flies (9), and tenth in on-base percentage (.381).[11] 
Mattingly followed up his breakout season with a spectacular 1985, winning 
the MVP award in the American League. He batted .324 (3rd in the league) 
with 35 home runs (4th), 48 doubles (1st), and 145 RBIs (1st), then the 
most RBIs in a season by a left-handed major league batter since Ted Williams 
drove in 159 in 1949. His 21-RBIs lead in the category was the most in 
the American League since Al Rosen's led the league in RBIs in 1953. He 
led the league in sacrifice flies (15), total bases (370), and extra base 
hits (86), and was 2nd in the AL in hits (211) and slugging percentage 
(.567), 3rd in intentional walks (13) and at bats per strikeout (13.9), 
6th in runs (107), and 9th in at bats per home run (18.6). He batted .354 
with two out and runners in scoring position. Mattingly was also recognized 
in 1985 for his defense, winning his first of nine Gold Glove Awards.[11] 
He was considered such an asset defensively that Yankees management assigned 
him to play games at second base and third base early in his career, even 
though he was a left-handed thrower. Mattingly appeared as a left-handed 
throwing second baseman for one-third of one inning, during the resumption 
of the George Brett "Pine Tar Incident" game in 1983. He also played three 
games as a left-handed throwing third baseman during a five-game series 
against the Seattle Mariners in 1986.[12] Mattingly did just as well in 
1986, leading the league with 238 hits, 53 doubles, and breaking the single-season 
franchise records set by Earle Combs (231 hits) and Lou Gehrig (52 doubles); 
both records had been set in 1927.[13] He also recorded 388 total bases 
and a .573 slugging percentage. He batted .352 (second in the league), 
hit 31 home runs (sixth) and drove in 113 runs (third). However, he was 
beaten in the American League MVP voting by pitcher Roger Clemens, who 
also won the Cy Young Award that year.[14] In 1987, Mattingly tied Dale 
Long's major league record by hitting home runs in eight consecutive games, 
from 8–18 July (the All-Star game occurred in the middle of the streak; 
Mattingly, starting at first base, was 0 for 3). This record was later 
tied again by Ken Griffey, Jr., of Seattle in 1993. Mattingly also set 
a record by recording an extra base hit in ten consecutive games. Mattingly 
had a record 10 home runs during this streak (Long & Griffey had eight 
during their streaks). Also that season, Mattingly set a major league record 
by hitting six grand slams in a season (two during his July home run streak), 
a record matched by Travis Hafner during the 2006 season. Mattingly's grand 
slams in 1987 were also the only six grand slams of his career.[15][better source needed] 
In June 1987, it was reported that Mattingly injured his back during some 
clubhouse horseplay with pitcher Bob Shirley though both denied this.[16] 
Nevertheless, he finished with a .327 batting average, 30 home runs, and 
115 RBIs, his fourth straight year with at least 110 RBIs. Between 1985 
and 1987, Mattingly hit 96 home runs with just 114 strikeouts.[11] Mattingly 
hit 18 home runs and recorded 88 RBIs in 1988, but nonetheless was still 
in the top 10 in the league in batting average at a .311 clip.[1] He rebounded 
in 1989 to 113 RBIs, but his average dipped to .303. Mattingly's five runs 
scored on April 30, 1988, marked the 12th time it has been done by a Yankee. 
Mattingly's back problems flared up anew in 1990; after struggling with 
the bat, he had to go on the disabled list in July, only returning late 
in the season for an ineffective finish. His stat line—a .256 average, 
5 home runs and 42 RBIs in almost 400 at-bats—came as a shock. Mattingly 
underwent extensive therapy in the offseason, but his hitting ability was 
never quite the same. Though he averaged .290 over his final five seasons, 
he became more of a slap hitter, hitting just 53 home runs over that timeframe. 
Mattingly's defense remained stellar, but he was not always physically 
able to play. Mattingly made his major league debut in 1982, the year after 
the Yankees lost the World Series. The team did not reach the postseason 
in any of Mattingly's first 13 years, although they arguably would have 
made the playoffs in 1994, when the players' strike ended the season prematurely 
with the Yankees having the best record in the American League. In 1995, 
Mattingly finally reached the playoffs when the Yankees won the AL wild 
card on the next-to-last day of the season. In the only postseason series 
of his career, facing the Seattle Mariners, Mattingly batted .417 with 
six RBIs and a memorable go-ahead home run in Game Two, his final game 
at Yankee Stadium. In the final game of the series (and of his career), 
Mattingly again broke a tie with a two-run double. The New York bullpen 
faltered and Seattle won in the 11th inning of the decisive Game Five. 
The Yankees acquired Tino Martinez to succeed Mattingly after the 1995 
season.[17] Unsigned for the 1996 season, Mattingly decided to sit out 
for the year, and rebuffed an inquiry by the Baltimore Orioles, who tried 
to sign him at midseason. Mattingly officially announced his retirement 
in January 1997.[18] For his career, Mattingly never appeared in the World 
Series, and his tenure with the Yankees marks the team's largest drought 
without a World Series appearance. Interestingly, the Yankees made the 
Series both the year prior to Mattingly's rookie year, 1981, and the year 
after his last with the club, 1996. After retiring as a player, Mattingly 
spent seven seasons as a special instructor during Yankees' spring training 
in Tampa, Florida from 1997 through 2003. Following the 2003 season, the 
Yankees named Mattingly the hitting coach. He spent three seasons in that 
role, receiving much praise from the Yankees organization and his players. 
Under Mattingly, the Yankees set an all-time franchise record with 242 
home runs in 2004. After the 2006 season, Mattingly shifted to bench coach, 
replacing Lee Mazzilli.[19] After the 2007 season, Mattingly was a finalist 
for the Yankees' manager position, after Joe Torre declined a one-year 
contract extension, along with Joe Girardi and Tony Peña. The Yankees offered 
the managerial position to Girardi, who accepted.[20] After not being offered 
the position of manager for the Yankees, Mattingly joined Torre with the 
Los Angeles Dodgers as the team's hitting coach. On January 22, 2008, Mattingly 
was replaced as hitting coach, citing family reasons, instead serving as 
major league special assignment coach for the Dodgers in 2008.[21] Mattingly 
succeeded Mike Easler as Dodgers' hitting coach that July.[22] The Dodgers 
were the National League Runner-up in 2008 and 2009 (losing to the Philadelphia 
Phillies in both National League championship series), largely behind the 
bat of mid-season acquisition Manny Ramirez. In the 2009–10 offseason, 
Mattingly was a finalist for the managerial position with the Cleveland 
Indians, for which Manny Acta was eventually hired.[23] When Torre decided 
to retire at the end of the 2010 season, Mattingly was announced as his 
replacement.[24] To acquire some managerial experience, Mattingly managed 
the Phoenix Desert Dogs of the Arizona Fall League in 2010.[25] Mattingly 
made his managerial debut on March 31, 2011 by defeating in-state rival 
and defending champion San Francisco Giants 2–1 at Dodger Stadium.[26] 
Despite the background of a bitter divorce battle between Dodgers' owner 
Frank McCourt and his wife that put the fiscal health of the Dodgers into 
jeopardy, Mattingly managed to take the Dodgers to a winning record that 
season due to his mentorship of many young players such as MVP candidate 
Matt Kemp and Cy Young Award winner Clayton Kershaw: "He's so positive", 
Kershaw said. "All he asks of us is just go out there and play the way 
we're supposed to. Do things the right way on the field, and he's happy 
with you. When it's simple like that, it's easy to play for, and it's fun 
to play for."[27] In 2013 Mattingly and the Dodgers got off to a rough 
start due to various injuries and were in last place in May, leading to 
much media speculation that he would soon be fired.[28] However, once players 
got healthy the team went on a tear and managed to win the NL West and 
beat the Atlanta Braves in the NLDS in four games. They then lost to the 
St. Louis Cardinals in the NLCS in six games. After the season, Mattingly 
called out Dodger management for its perceived lack of support of him during 
the season and said that he wanted a multi-year contract in place in order 
to return in 2014.[29] Mattingly finished second in the voting for National 
League Manager of the Year.[30] Mattingly stated that one of his managerial 
idols was Tony La Russa. Mattingly admired La Russa from his playing days 
with the Yankees in the late 1980s. LaRussa had managed the dominant Oakland 
Athletics teams of the era. Mattingly recalled that despite the A's superiority 
to the Yankees, they still played intensely.[27] On January 7, 2014, Mattingly 
and the Dodgers agreed on a three-year contract extension for him to remain 
as manager of the Dodgers.[31] On September 29, 2015, Mattingly became 
the first manager in the history of the Dodgers franchise, in both Brooklyn 
and Los Angeles, to lead the team to the playoffs in three consecutive 
seasons. The Dodgers lost in five games to the New York Mets in the National 
League Divisional Series. On October 22, 2015 the Los Angeles Dodgers and 
Mattingly mutually agreed to part ways, and he stepped down from his position 
in Los Angeles with one year left on his contract.[32] He had a 446–363 
record[33] with the Dodgers, with a winning percentage of .551[33] which 
is second best in Los Angeles Dodgers history.[34] He finished with a post–season 
record of eight wins and 11 losses[33] and was the only manager in franchise 
history to guide the team to three straight post-season appearances.[34] 
On October 29, 2015, it was reported that Mattingly would be signing a 
four-year contract to manage the Miami Marlins.[35][36] Mattingly finished 
his career with 2,153 hits, 222 home runs, 1,099 RBI, and a .307 lifetime 
average. He is commonly cited as the best Yankee player to have never played 
in a World Series. His career had bad timing, as the Yankees lost the World 
Series the year before he broke into the big leagues and they ended up 
winning the World Series in the first year of Mattingly's retirement, not 
to mention the Yankees had the best record in the American League in 1994 
before the strike. This World Series drought (1982–1995) was the longest 
in Yankees history since the start of the Babe Ruth era and it was worsened 
by the player's strike in 1994, which ended a promising chance for a World 
Series title. Buck Showalter, Mattingly's last manager during his playing 
days and a former teammate in the minor leagues, attributed Mattingly's 
calmness to the controversies he was subjected to during his time with 
the Yankees.[37] The Yankees retired Mattingly's number 23 and dedicated 
his plaque for Monument Park at Yankee Stadium on August 31, 1997. The 
plaque calls him "A humble man of grace and dignity, a captain who led 
by example, proud of the pinstripe tradition and dedicated to the pursuit 
of excellence, a Yankee forever."[38] Mattingly's jersey number (18) was 
also retired by the Nashville Sounds in 1999.[39] Mattingly was on the 
Hall of Fame ballot from 2001 to 2015, never getting enough votes for induction. 
In his first year, he received 145 votes (28.2%), but this had steadily 
declined, by 2009, only 12% of voters still put him on their ballots.[40] 
In 2015, Mattingly's eligibility expired after fifteen attempts. He had 
been grandfathered onto the ballot after the committee restricted eligibility 
to ten years. In 1994, Mattingly was inducted into the South Atlantic League 
Hall of Fame;[41] he led the South Atlantic League with a .358 average 
and 177 hits in 1980 while leading the Greensboro Hornets to a league title. 
He was an All-Star and was awarded the league MVP. In 2001, Mattingly was 
inducted into the Indiana Baseball Hall of Fame;[42] his plaque lays out 
his phenomenal high school and professional career. In 1987, he was named 
the American Legion Graduate of the Year, for his success in the Major 
Leagues following his American Legion baseball career.[43] Mattingly married 
Kim Sexton on September 8, 1979; they are now divorced. They have three 
sons: Taylor, Preston, and Jordon, two of whom attempted careers at professional 
baseball. Taylor was drafted in the 42nd round (1,262nd overall) of the 
2003 Major League Baseball draft by the New York Yankees, and played in 
24 games for the Gulf Coast Yankees in the rookie league before an injury 
cut short his season. After sitting out all of 2004 and 2005, Taylor retired 
from baseball in 2005 after only 58 professional at bats. Of his eldest 
son, Don observed: "He loved the game, not the lifestyle."[44] Preston 
was chosen in the first round (31st overall) of the 2006 Major League Baseball 
draft by the Los Angeles Dodgers and was rated as a B- prospect in John 
Sickels' 2007 Baseball Prospect Book. Sickels noted, "Position a question 
but has promising tools and bloodlines."[45] Preston was traded to the 
Cleveland Indians on September 26, 2010, just nine days after his father 
was announced as the manager of the Dodgers for the 2011 season.[46] He 
was subsequently released by the Indians at the end of spring training, 
and re-signed with the Dodgers.[47] On January 11, 2012, the Yankees signed 
Preston to a minor league contract[48] but they released him again on March 
27.[49] Preston is now a sophomore at Lamar University in Beaumont, Texas. 
He is currently a starting guard for the Lamar Cardinals basketball team, 
an NCAA Division I program in the Southland Conference.[citation needed] 
In the 1980s, while with the Yankees, Mattingly was a resident of Tenafly, 
New Jersey.[50][51] Mattingly remarried on December 10, 2010, in his hometown 
of Evansville, Indiana. The wedding, as well as his managing the Phoenix 
Desert Dogs of the Arizona Fall League, prevented him from attending the 
Fall 2010 Winter Meetings.[52] During the late 1980s and early 1990s, Don 
Mattingly was the owner of a restaurant in Evansville, Indiana, called 
"Mattingly's 23", after the uniform number he wore for most of his career.[53] 
In 2005, Mattingly launched Mattingly Sports, a baseball and softball equipment 
company, based primarily around the patented V-Grip baseball and softball 
bats.[54] Mattingly is the founder of Mattingly Charities, a non-profit 
organization that serves underprivileged youth by supporting programs which 
promote baseball and softball participation in conjunction with other developmentally 
related activities. [55] Mattingly appeared in a baseball-themed episode 
of The Simpsons, entitled "Homer at the Bat". In the episode (originally 
aired on February 20, 1992), team owner Mr. Burns repeatedly demands that 
Mattingly trim his sideburns, even though Mattingly has no sideburns (and 
in fact wonders if Mr. Burns even knows what sideburns are). A confused 
Mattingly returns with 1/3 of his head shaved from one ear over the top 
of the head to the other. The irate Burns cuts him from the team because 
he would not "trim those sideburns!" As he departs, the exasperated Mattingly 
says to himself, "I still like him better than Steinbrenner."[56] Coincidentally, 
in 1991, before the episode aired but after it was produced, then-Yankees 
manager Stump Merrill told him that until he cut his hair, he would not 
play. This was in accord with Yankee owner George Steinbrenner's policy 
requiring his players to maintain well-kept head and facial hair. Mattingly 
was sporting a longish or mullet-like hair style, and when he refused to 
cut it, he was benched.[57][58] Mattingly has also appeared in public service 
announcements airing on the Spike TV network advocating fathers spending 
time with their children as part of the "True Dads" campaign to encourage 
men to take an active role in their children's lives.[59] Mattingly is 
referred to by name in several episodes of Seinfeld. In one memorable episode, 
his uniform pants split because they were made of 100% cotton at the behest
