Melvin Lloyd Parnell (June 13, 1922 – March 20, 2012) was a Major League 
Baseball left-handed starting pitcher. Parnell spent his entire ten-year 
career with the Boston Red Sox (1947–1956), compiling a 123-75 record with 
732 strikeouts, a 3.50 earned run average, 113 complete games, 20 shutouts, 
and 1752.2 innings pitched in 289 games (232 as a starter). He has the 
third-highest career winning percentage for a left-hander in Fenway Park 
(minimum of more than 25 decisions), at 71-30 (.703). Following a victory 
in Fenway Park during which Johnny Pesky hit the deciding home run near 
the right field foul pole, Parnell christened it the "Pesky Pole" or Pesky's 
Pole. Parnell enjoyed his best season in 1949 when he went 25-7, leading 
the league in wins, ERA (2.77), complete games (27) and innings (295.1). 
He was the starting pitcher for the American League in that year's All-Star 
Game and was selected again in 1951. After two 18-win seasons in 1950 and 
1951, and a 12-12 record in 1952, Parnell went 21-8 in 1953 with a 3.06 
ERA and a career-high 136 strikeouts. On July 14, 1956, he no-hit the Chicago 
White Sox 4-0 at Fenway Park. The no-hitter was the first for a Red Sox 
pitcher since Howard Ehmke in 1923, though this would prove the final highlight 
of his career, which would come to a premature end after the 1956 season, 
due to a torn muscle in his pitching arm. It would take 52 years until 
another Red Sox lefty would throw a no-hitter, a feat accomplished by Jon 
Lester in 2008. Parnell still holds the club career mark for left-handed 
pitchers in games started, innings and victories. After his playing career, 
Parnell managed the New Orleans Pelicans of the Class AA Southern Association 
in 1959 and a series of Red Sox farm clubs from 1961 to 1963. He was a 
member of Boston's radio and television announcing crew from 1965 to 1968 
and the Chicago White Sox' TV crew in 1969. Parnell was mentioned in the 
1981 Terry Cashman song "Talkin' Baseball". Parnell was selected to the 
Boston Red Sox Hall of Fame in 1997. He thereafter resided in New Orleans, 
Louisiana until his death in 2012 following a long battle with cancer.[1][2] 
"Little soft pop-up...Petrocelli will take it...he does! The ball game 
is over! The Red Sox win it! And what a mob on this field! They're coming 
out of the stands from all over!" – Parnell on WHDH-TV, calling the last 
out of the final game of the Red Sox' regular season at Fenway Park, October 
1, 1967, against the Minnesota Twins. The Sox had yet to learn whether 
they clinched the American League pennant or would need to travel to Detroit 
for a one-game playoff. The Detroit Tigers lost to the California Angels, 
and the Red Sox went on to the 1967 World Series against the St. Louis 
Cardinals. Parnell once said the southpaw's enemy at Fenway Park was the
