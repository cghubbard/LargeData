Opposite field is a baseball term that refers to the area of the outfield 
that faces the hitter, which would be right field for a right-hander and 
left field for a left-hander. A hitter is said to hit to "all fields" if 
he or she hits the ball consistently to left, right, and center fields. 
Opposite field home run hitters are less common than pull hitters, who 
hit the ball to the same side as their body, because to do so requires 
more strength as contact with the ball is made earlier in the swing and 
the bat is not at full speed. Contemporary prominent opposite field home 
run hitters include Mike Trout, Miguel Cabrera, Paul Goldschmidt, Giancarlo 
Stanton, David Wright, Albert Pujols, Alex Rodriguez, Jim Thome, Raúl Ibáñez, 
Adrian Gonzalez, Joey Votto, Ryan Howard, Robinson Cano, Ryan Braun, and
