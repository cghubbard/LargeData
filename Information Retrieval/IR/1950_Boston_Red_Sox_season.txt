The 1950 Boston Red Sox season involved the Red Sox finishing 3rd in the 
American League with a record of 94 wins and 60 losses, four games behind 
the AL and World Series Champion New York Yankees. The team scored 1,027 
runs, one of only six teams to score more than 1,000 runs in a season in 
the modern era (post-1900), and, along with the 1999 Cleveland Indians, 
are one of two teams to do so post-WWII. This was the last time that the 
Red Sox would win at least 90 games until their return to the World Series 
in 1967. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] Infielders Other batters Coaches
