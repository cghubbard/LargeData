Leland Stanford MacPhail, Jr. (October 25, 1917 – November 8, 2012) was 
an American front-office executive in Major League Baseball. MacPhail was 
a baseball executive for 45 years, serving as the director of player personnel 
for the New York Yankees, the president and general manager of the Baltimore 
Orioles, chief aide to Commissioner of Baseball William Eckert, executive 
vice president and general manager of the Yankees, and president of the 
American League. He and Larry MacPhail are the only father-and-son pair 
to be inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame. Lee was honored in 1998.[1] 
At his death, MacPhail was the oldest living Hall of Famer. Born in Nashville, 
Tennessee, he was the son of Larry MacPhail, front office executive with 
the Cincinnati Reds, Brooklyn Dodgers and the Yankees. His brother Bill 
MacPhail was president of CBS Sports and later was president of CNN Sports, 
brought on by Ted Turner to create the department upon the network's launch. 
Lee MacPhail's son Andy is the president of the Philadelphia Phillies. 
He was general manager of the Minnesota Twins from 1986–94, president/CEO 
of the Chicago Cubs from 1994–2006, and president/baseball operations of 
the Orioles from 2007–11. Son Lee MacPhail III had begun a career in baseball 
and was an executive with the Reading Phillies of the Eastern League upon 
his untimely death at age 27 in an automobile accident on February 18, 
1969.[2][3] In addition, grandson Lee MacPhail IV is active in baseball 
as director of professional scouting for the Seattle Mariners.[4] Lee MacPhail 
entered baseball in his father's Brooklyn Dodger organization, then joined 
the Yankees when Larry MacPhail became a co-owner of the team in 1945.[5] 
The younger MacPhail rose through the Yankees system, eventually becoming 
farm system director in the late 1940s and contributing to the organization's 
seven World Series championships from 1949 to 1958. He then moved to the 
Baltimore Orioles front office as general manager and, later, club president.[6] 
Under MacPhail's seven-year stewardship (1959–65), the Orioles became pennant 
contenders in the American League, winning 612 of 1,118 games (.547) and 
finishing in the league's first division four times. Led by Most Valuable 
Player Brooks Robinson, the 1964 Orioles finished only two games behind 
the pennant-winning Yankees. At the time of his departure from Baltimore, 
MacPhail and his successor, Harry Dalton, were beginning negotiations with 
the Reds for a blockbuster trade that would bring Frank Robinson to Baltimore; 
Robinson would lead the Orioles to the 1966 world championship and win 
the American League Triple Crown and Most Valuable Player award.[7] After 
a brief term as top aide to the new commissioner, Eckert, in 1965–66,[8] 
MacPhail served as the Yankees' general manager from October 14, 1966 to 
1974, a rebuilding phase of the Yanks marked by the promotion of Bobby 
Murcer and Thurman Munson to the club, but no pennants or postseason appearances. 
After the 1973 season, in late October, MacPhail was elected the fifth 
American League president,[9] serving from January 1, 1974, to December 
31, 1983. In replacing Joe Cronin, he moved the league's headquarters to 
New York City from Boston. Although no AL franchise moved during MacPhail's 
term, he was in office for the dawning of the free agency era in 1976, 
and nine of the 12 league clubs in existence in 1974 underwent ownership 
changes. MacPhail also oversaw the league's 1977 expansion to 14 teams 
with the creation of the Toronto Blue Jays and the Seattle Mariners, and 
was credited with bringing an end to the 1981 baseball strike when he stepped 
in for the owners to handle stalled negotiations. During his ten full years 
in office, the American League continued to struggle against the National 
League in All-Star Game competition: it lost the first nine midsummer classics 
it played under MacPhail's presidency, winning only in his last season, 
1983, by a 13–3 score.[10] The Junior Circuit compiled a 4–6 mark in World 
Series play over the same period. MacPhail also played a major role in 
the 1983 Pine Tar Game, where a home run was taken away from Kansas City 
Royals slugger George Brett. After his retirement as AL president, MacPhail 
spent two final years in baseball as chairman of Major League Baseball's 
Player Relations Committee. MacPhail lived in Delray Beach, Florida, where 
he died November 8, 2012, at his home. He was 95. At time of his death 
he was the oldest living Hall of Famer.[11] He was elected to the Baseball 
Hall of Fame in 1998, joining his father, who had been elected in 1978, 
as the only father and son members. In 1966, he received the Sporting News 
Executive of the Year Award. The American League Championship Series Most
