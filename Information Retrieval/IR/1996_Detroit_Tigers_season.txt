The 1996 Detroit Tigers had a record of 53-109 for the third worst winning 
percentage (.327) in team history. With a number of capable batters (Cecil 
Fielder, Tony Clark, Bobby Higginson, Alan Trammell, Rub√©n Sierra, and 
Damion Easley), the team scored a respectable 783 runs. However, the 1996 
Tigers lacked pitching and allowed their opponents to score 1,103 runs. 
No team in American League history and only one in major league history 
(the 1930 Philadelphia Phillies) has given up more runs. No pitcher on 
the team had more than 7 wins. The Tigers made more unwanted history when 
they were swept 12-0 by the Cleveland Indians in the regular season series, 
losing all twelve games played while being outscored, 79-28. [1] [2] [3]
