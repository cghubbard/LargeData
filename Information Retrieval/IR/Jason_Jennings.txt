Jason Ryan Jennings (born July 17, 1978) is an American former professional 
baseball pitcher. He pitched in Major League Baseball with the Colorado 
Rockies (2001-2006), Houston Astros (2007) and Texas Rangers (2008-2009). 
Jennings attended Poteet High School in Mesquite, Texas, and was a standout 
in both football and baseball. In football, he won All-District honors 
at both kicker and punter. In baseball, as a senior, he was named the District 
MVP and posted a .410 batting average, hit seven home runs, and pitched 
his way to a 10-3 record and a 0.92 ERA with 132 strikeouts. After graduating 
from Poteet, he attended Baylor University where he played baseball from 
1997 to 1999. Following his junior season at Baylor, Jennings was named 
by both Baseball America and Collegiate Baseball as the 1999 National Player 
of the Year. In what would be his final season at Baylor, he struck out 
172 hitters in 146.2 innings and hit .382 with 17 homers and 68 RBIs. He 
also won the Golden Spikes Award, his second consecutive Big 12 Player 
of the Year, consensus All-America honors, the Outstanding Player on the 
1999 Big 12 All Tournament Team, and a spot on the 1999 All-Big 12 Academic 
First Team. As a member of the Colorado Rockies, Jason posted his most 
impressive numbers in the 2002 season when he won the Major League Baseball 
Rookie of the Year Award in the National League, beating out Brad Wilkerson 
and Austin Kearns. In his major league debut, Jennings hit a home run and 
tossed a complete game shutout, becoming the first major leaguer to accomplish 
that feat.[1] From 2003 to 2005, Jennings had three losing seasons and 
posted an ERA above 5 each year. In 2006, Jennings pitched much better, 
ending the season with a 3.78 ERA, but had only a 9-13 record due to a 
lack of run support that ranked near the bottom of the league. From May 
29 to the end of the season, Jennings had a 3.17 ERA, which was 4th in 
the Majors and 2nd in the NL behind Roy Oswalt. He also finished with over 
200 innings pitched. He ended his career with the Rockies as the franchise's 
all-time winningest pitcher.[2] He was surpassed in wins by a Rockies pitcher 
on June 23, 2009 by former teammate Aaron Cook. On December 12, 2006 the 
Rockies traded Jennings, along with Miguel Asencio, to the Houston Astros 
for Willy Taveras, Taylor Buchholz and Jason Hirsh.[3] The deal seemed 
to work in favor of the 2007 Rockies, who made it to the 2007 World Series 
with Taveras at the top of the order. Both Buchholz and Hirsh pitched decently 
in their first season with the Rockies. 2007 was a lackluster year with 
the Astros for Jennings. In a game against the Padres, he gave up 11 earned 
runs on 8 hits in two-thirds of an inning with three walks and no strikeouts.[4] 
On January 17, 2008, he signed a one-year contract with the Texas Rangers. 
Jennings ended up going on the DL after just six starts, all in April (missing 
the rest of the season), in which he struggled mightily. He went 0-5 with 
an 8.56 ERA, allowing eight home runs in 27 1⁄3 innings of work, and he 
made it past the fifth inning only once. On February 6, 2009, he re-signed 
with the Rangers to a minor league contract with an invitation to spring 
training.[5] On August 27, 2009, Jennings was designated for assignment, 
then given his outright release by the Rangers. During the 2009–2010 MLB 
offseason, Jennings was signed by the Oakland Athletics to a minor-league 
contract with an invite to spring training.[6] On May 25, 2011, the Grand 
Prairie AirHogs of the American Association of Independent Professional 
Baseball signed Jennings to a contract for the remainder of their season. 
On September 12, 2011, Jennings started Game 5 of the AA Championship and 
pitched 6 2⁄3 innings to pick up the win and help lead the AirHogs to their 
first American Association Championship - his first championship at any
