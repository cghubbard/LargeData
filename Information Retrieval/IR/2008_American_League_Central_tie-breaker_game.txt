The 2008 American League Central tie-breaker game was a one-game extension 
to Major League Baseball's (MLB) 2008 regular season, played between the 
Chicago White Sox and Minnesota Twins to determine the champion of the 
American League's (AL) Central Division. It was played at US Cellular Field 
in Chicago, Illinois, on September 30, 2008. The White Sox won the game, 
1–0, on a home run by Jim Thome, the lowest-scoring game in MLB tie-breaker 
history. The Sox advanced to the 2008 AL Division Series, where they lost 
to the Tampa Bay Rays, three games to one; the Twins failed to qualify 
for the postseason. The game was necessary after both teams finished the 
season with identical win–loss records of 88–74. The White Sox won a coin 
flip late in the season which, by rule, awarded them home field in the 
game. The tie-breaker counted as the 163rd regular season game by both 
teams, with all events in the game added to regular season statistics. 
Prior to the start of the season, the Detroit Tigers and Cleveland Indians, 
the division's top two finishers in the previous season,[1] were predicted 
to be the strongest teams by journalists such as Tom Verducci of ESPN and 
Joe Sheehan of Baseball Prospectus.[2][3] However, the Indians lineup was 
weakened by injuries[4] and spent just 13 days of the season in the division 
lead, last on May 17.[5] The Tigers never led the AL Central and finished 
the season in last place, 14 games back.[6] The White Sox led for most 
of the season starting with a tie for first on May 17, held at least a 
share of the lead for 154 days, and never dropped more than a game behind 
the leader.[7] The Twins spent much of the season in second place behind 
the White Sox, along with 54 days in the lead.[8] Despite going 11–15 in 
September, the Twins took a half-game lead with an extra innings win over 
the White Sox on September 25 that capped a three-game sweep of Chicago.[9] 
The Twins maintained that lead through their final game,[8] forcing Chicago 
to play a make-up on September 29 against the Tigers which had been rained 
out earlier that month.[10] The White Sox won, 8–2, leaving the Sox and 
Twins tied atop the AL Central with 88–74 records, forcing a tie-breaker 
to decide the division.[7][8][10] Tickets for the tie-breaker sold out 
within an hour of the end of the September 29 game.[11] The White Sox won 
the right to play at U.S. Cellular Field, their home field, as a result 
of a coin flip earlier in September.[12] Fans were encouraged to wear all-black 
clothing to show support for the White Sox.[11][13] The game was broadcast 
on TBS.[12] The White Sox used John Danks on three days rest as their starter, 
and the Twins started Nick Blackburn.[12] Box score for "Blackout Day" 
on Tuesday September 30, 2008—6:37 p.m. (CT) at US Cellular Field in Chicago, 
Illinois Both Blackburn and Danks held the game scoreless early on, allowing 
only six baserunners through the first four innings of the game.[14] The 
Twins' Michael Cuddyer led off the top of the fifth with a double, the 
only Twins runner in scoring position for the entire game.[14] Danks induced 
a deep flyball out from Delmon Young, which allowed Cuddyer to advance 
to third.[14] Brendan Harris hit a deep flyball to center field which was 
caught for an out by Ken Griffey, Jr. Cuddyer tried to score on the ball 
as a sacrifice fly, but Griffey delivered an accurate throw to home plate 
and White Sox catcher A. J. Pierzynski blocked the plate and tagged out 
Cuddyer to end the inning.[15] This play drew praise after the game as 
a "nice throw"[16] and a "defensive gem".[15] The only run of the game 
scored when White Sox designated hitter Jim Thome led off the bottom of 
the seventh inning with a solo home run.[14] Blackburn got Paul Konerko 
to ground out, but allowed a double to Griffey and, following an intentional 
walk to Alexei Ramírez, José Mijares relieved him.[14] John Danks lasted 
through eight innings without allowing a run and was relieved by closer 
Bobby Jenks in the ninth.[14] Jenks recorded three outs, securing the White 
Sox' 1–0 victory with his 30th save of the season.[14] Twins batters Joe 
Mauer, Justin Morneau, and Cuddyer had a combined 22 hits in 40 at-bats 
(.550 batting average) against Danks for their careers but in the tie-breaker 
they combined to go 1–for-9 (.111) with 3 strikeouts.[17] This game saw 
the lowest combined score of any tie-breaker game in MLB history, three 
runs lower than the 3–1 score of the first game of the 1951 National League 
tie-breaker series.[18] With the victory, the White Sox earned their first 
playoff berth since their win in the 2005 World Series.[19] However, they 
lost to the eventual pennant-winning Tampa Bay Rays, three games to one.[20] 
Statistically, the game counted as the 163rd regular season game.[21] Thome's 
home run, for example, was his 34th of the season. This total brought him 
a tie for fourth most in the league.[22] Danks lowered his earned run average 
from 3.47 to 3.32 in the game, which moved him from a tie for tenth-best 
in the league with Zack Greinke to fifth place.[23][24] Mauer, Morneau, 
and White Sox outfielder Carlos Quentin won Silver Slugger Awards for their 
offensive performances in the 2008 regular season.[25] Mauer also won a 
Rawlings Gold Glove Award that year.[25] This was the last tie-breaker 
with home field determined by a coin flip. Following the 2008 season MLB 
amended their rules, leaving future tie-breaker sites to be determined 
on a series of performance-based criteria beginning with the head-to-head
