As player As manager Frank Francis Frisch (September 9, 1898 [1] – March 
12, 1973), nicknamed The Fordham Flash or The Old Flash, was a German American 
Major League Baseball player and manager of the first half of the twentieth 
century.[2] Frisch was a switch-hitting second baseman who threw right-handed. 
He played for the New York Giants (1919–1926) and St. Louis Cardinals (1927–1937). 
He managed the Cardinals (1933–1938), Pittsburgh Pirates (1940–1946) and 
Chicago Cubs (1949–1951). He is a member of the National Baseball Hall 
of Fame and Museum and the St. Louis Cardinals Hall of Fame Museum. Born 
in The Bronx, New York City, Frisch attended Fordham Preparatory School, 
graduating in 1916.[3] He went on to Fordham University where he continued 
to star in four sports: baseball, football, basketball and track. His speed 
earned him the nickname "The Fordham Flash." [4] In 1919, Frisch left Fordham 
[5] to sign with the New York Giants of the National League, moving directly 
to the majors without playing in the minor leagues. He made an immediate 
impact, finishing third in the NL in stolen bases and seventh in RBI in 
1920, his first full season. Manager John McGraw was so impressed by Frisch 
that he soon named him team captain, giving him advice in baserunning and 
hitting. The Giants played Frisch at both third base and second base early 
in his career, but by 1923 he was installed as the team's full-time second 
baseman. Frisch batted over .300 in his last six seasons with New York. 
He was also an expert fielder and a skilled baserunner. In 1921, he led 
the National League with 48 steals, in 1923 in hits, and in 1924 in runs. 
With Frisch adding his fiery competitiveness to the team, the Giants won 
the World Series in 1921 and 1922, winning the NL pennant the following 
two seasons as well. Frisch is tied with Pablo Sandoval for the franchise 
post-season multi-hit games record of 15. After the 1926 season, Frisch 
was traded – with pitcher Jimmy Ring – to the St. Louis Cardinals in exchange 
for star Rogers Hornsby. After an August 1926 loss in which Frisch had 
missed a sign, costing the Giants a run, McGraw had loudly berated Frisch 
in front of the team; Frisch responded by leaving the team, and his previously 
close relationship with McGraw virtually ended. Playing second base for 
the Cardinals, Frisch appeared in four more World Series (1928, 1930–31, 
1934), bringing his career total to eight. He was the driving force of 
the "Gashouse Gang", the nickname for the Cardinals clubs of the early 
1930s, which were built around him to reflect his no-holds-barred approach. 
The Cardinals had won only one pennant before Frisch joined the team; the 
Giants would win the pennant only once in Frisch's nine seasons as the 
Cards' regular second baseman. Frisch played eleven seasons with the Cardinals. 
In 1931, he was voted the Most Valuable Player in the National League after 
batting .311 with 4 home runs, 82 RBI and leading the League in stolen 
bases with 28. The 1931 Cardinals also triumphed in the World Series, defeating 
Connie Mack's defending two-time champion Philadelphia Athletics in seven 
games. Frisch became player-manager of the Cardinals in 1933, and was named 
to the NL's first three All-Star teams from 1933-35. In 1934, he managed 
the Cardinals to another seven-game World Series victory – this time over 
the Detroit Tigers. Frisch finished his playing career in 1937. His career 
statistics totaled a .316 batting average, still the highest ever for a 
switch hitter, with 2880 hits, 1532 runs, 105 home runs and 1244 RBI. He 
also stole 419 bases in his nineteen playing seasons. His hit total stood 
as the record for switch-hitters until Pete Rose surpassed it in 1977. 
Frisch also hit .300 for his career from each side of the plate; the only 
other switch-hitter with more than 5,000 at-bats with this distinction 
is Chipper Jones.[6] Frankie Frisch was elected to the Baseball Hall of 
Fame in 1947. After no players had been selected by the writers in the 
previous two years (the only elections since 1942), the rules were revised 
to limit eligibility to those players who had retired after 1921; Frisch 
was among the first four players to benefit from the more reasonable field 
of candidates. After his retirement as an active player, Frisch continued 
to manage the Cardinals, but was never able to capture another pennant. 
Frisch also had managerial stints with the Pittsburgh Pirates (1940–46) 
and the Chicago Cubs (1949–51), but without the success he had in St. Louis. 
Frisch's career ledger as a manager shows a 1,138–1,078 (.514) mark, including 
the pennant in 1934. He also spent the first two months of the 1949 season 
as a New York Giants' coach, working under his old double-play partner, 
Leo Durocher, before leaving June 14 to replace Charlie Grimm as manager 
of the Cubs. Frisch also worked for several years as a baseball color commentator 
on radio and television. In 1939, he called games for the Boston Bees and 
the Boston Red Sox on the Colonial Network,[7] a regional radio network 
serving five New England states. He also called Giants radio in 1947-48, 
then worked as a post-game host for the team's telecasts in the 1950s. 
His broadcasting trademark was worrying about pitchers walking batters: 
"Oh, those bases on balls!" After a heart attack in September 1956 forced 
Frisch to curtail his activities, Phil Rizzuto (recently released by Yankees 
as a player) filled in for him on Giants post-game shows for the rest of 
the season. From 1959-61, Frisch teamed with Jack Whitaker to form the 
backup crew for Saturday Game of the Week coverage on CBS. A number of 
years after Frisch left the playing field as a manager, he became a member 
of the Hall of Fame's Committee on Baseball Veterans, which is responsible 
for electing players to the Hall of Fame who had not been elected during 
their initial period of eligibility by the Baseball Writers; he later became 
chairman of the committee. In the years just prior to his death, a number 
of Frisch's Giants and Cardinals teammates were elected to the Hall; some 
notable writers, chiefly among them Bill James, have criticized these selections 
– including Jesse Haines, Dave Bancroft, Chick Hafey, Rube Marquard, Ross 
Youngs and George Kelly – which include some of the most widely questioned 
honorees in the Hall's history. Critics have complained that many of these 
selectees had accomplishments which were less outstanding than those of 
other players who were bypassed, and were only selected because of Frisch's 
influence.[8] Frisch died in Wilmington, Delaware from injuries suffered 
from a car accident near Elkton, Maryland one month earlier. He was 75 
years old. Frisch had been returning to Rhode Island from the meeting of 
the Veterans' Committee in Florida when he lost control of his car. Frisch 
died in the same manner as other N.Y. Giant Hall of Famers Mel Ott (1958) 
and Carl Hubbell (1988). He is interred at Woodlawn Cemetery in The Bronx, 
New York City. During his lifetime, Frisch used 1898 as his year of birth, 
although other records (Social Security death index, Census records, World 
War I Draft registration, and passport application) indicate an 1897 birth. 
In 1999, he ranked number 88 on the The Sporting News list of the 100 Greatest 
Baseball Players,[9] and was a nominee for the Major League Baseball All-Century 
Team. In January, 2014, the Cardinals announced Frisch among 22 former 
players and personnel to be inducted into the St. Louis Cardinals Hall 
of Fame Museum for the inaugural class of 2014.[10] Frisch is mentioned 
in the poem "Line-Up for Yesterday" by Ogden Nash: F is for Fordham And 
Frankie and Frisch; I wish he were back With the Giants, I wish. Years 
later, Nash added a footnote to this stanza: "p.s. Thanks to Durocher, 
now everything's kosher." For many years, he lived at 184 Fenimore Road 
in the Bonnie Crest neighborhood of New Rochelle, New York. He had two 
hounds named Flash and Patches who kept him company. Frisch eventually 
moved to Charlestown, Rhode Island, devoting himself mainly to his interests
