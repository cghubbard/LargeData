The 1945 Major League Baseball season. There were only 16 teams, eight 
in both the American League and the National League respectively. The Sporting 
News Most Valuable Player Award went to Detroit Tigers third baseman Eddie 
Mayo; however, following a post-season vote the official AL MVP Award was 
given to fellow Detroit Tiger Hal Newhouser, a pitcher.[1][2] Newhouser 
ended the season with an ERA of 1.81, a record of 25 wins and 9 losses, 
and 212 strikeouts.[2] Both of them helped lead the Detroit Tigers to a 
World Series win, and Newhouser remarked that Eddie Mayo was the driving 
force behind the 1945 pennant chase and that Mayo was a "take-charge kind 
of guy in our field."[1] The NL Most Valuable Player Award went to Chicago 
Cubs first baseman and outfielder Phil Cavarretta.[3] He ended the season 
with an impressive batting average of .355 and an on-base-percentage of 
.455.[4] The second-place finisher was Boston Braves player Tommy Holmes 
who finished the season with a batting average of .352 and an impressive 
slugging percentage of .577.[3] Hal Newhouser won the pitching Triple Crown 
in addition to the official AL MVP Award.[5] To win this award you have 
to lead the league in wins, strikeouts, and ERA. There was no hitter that 
was awarded the Triple Crown, which entails leading the league in batting 
average, home runs, and runs batted in.[5] There were nine players and 
one manager inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame during the year 1945.[6] 
The players were: Jim O'Rourke, King Kelly, Hughie Jennings, Hugh Duffy, 
Ed Delahanty, Jimmy Collins, Fred Clarke, Dan Brouthers, and Roger Bresnahan.[6] 
Wilbert Robinson was the manager that was inducted in the Hall of Fame.[6] 
The World Series was between the Detroit Tigers (88-65) and the Chicago 
Cubs (98-56), and the series went 4-3 in favor of the Detroit Tigers.[7] 
Hal Newhouser, the official AL MVP of this year, pitched three of the games. 
He was the losing pitcher Game 1 of the Series, but was the winning pitcher 
in Game 5 and the pivotal Game 7. In Game 7, the Detroit Tigers gave Newhouser 
an early lead to work with by scoring five runs in the first inning. The 
Chicago Cubs would use six pitchers throughout the game while Newhouser 
pitched a complete game only allowing three runs, which led to a 9-3 Detroit
