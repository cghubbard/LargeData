As player As manager Gene William Mauch (November 18, 1925 – August 8, 
2005) was an American professional baseball player and manager. He played 
in Major League Baseball as a second baseman for the Brooklyn Dodgers (1944, 
1948), Pittsburgh Pirates (1947), Chicago Cubs (1948–49), Boston Braves 
(1950–51), St. Louis Cardinals (1952) and the Boston Red Sox (1956–57). 
Mauch was best known for managing four teams from 1960 to 1987. He is by 
far the winningest manager to have never won a league pennant (breaking 
the record formerly held by Jimmy Dykes), three times coming within a single 
victory. He managed the Philadelphia Phillies (1960–68), Montreal Expos 
(1969–75, as their inaugural manager), Minnesota Twins (1976–80), and California 
Angels (1981–82, 1985–87). His 1,902 career victories ranked 8th in major 
league history when he retired, and his 3,942 total games ranked 4th. He 
gained a reputation for playing a distinctive "small ball" style, which 
emphasized defense, speed and base-to-base tactics on offense rather than 
power hitting. Born in Salina, Kansas, and raised there and in Los Angeles, 
Mauch played in all or parts of nine MLB seasons between 1944 and 1957 
with the Brooklyn Dodgers, Pittsburgh Pirates, Chicago Cubs, Boston Braves, 
St. Louis Cardinals and Boston Red Sox. In 304 games and 737 at-bats, Mauch 
hit .239, with 176 hits, five home runs and 62 RBIs, striking out 82 times. 
He missed part of 1944 and all of the 1945 season while serving in the 
United States Army Air Forces during World War II. At age 27 in 1953, the 
Braves named Mauch the player-manager of their Double-A Atlanta Crackers 
farm team in the Southern Association, his first managerial assignment. 
His team finished 84–70, in third place, three games behind the Memphis 
Chickasaws, and fell in the first round of the playoffs to the eventual 
league champion Nashville Vols. The combative Mauch was known for frequent 
skirmishes with the league's umpires and later conceded he was too young 
for the assignment.[1] But seven years later, John J. Quinn, the Braves' 
general manager who hired him for the Crackers' job, would give him his 
first big-league managerial opportunity with the 1960 Phillies. From 1954 
to 1957, Mauch was strictly a player, first for the Los Angeles Angels 
of the Pacific Coast League, then the Red Sox. His final big-league season, 
1957 with Boston, was his most productive. He started 65 games as the Bosox' 
second baseman and batted a career-high .270 with 60 hits. But the following 
season, he began his managerial career in earnest. In 1958–59, he piloted 
the Red Sox' Triple-A affiliate, the Minneapolis Millers of the American 
Association, reaching the Junior World Series as American Association champion 
each season, and winning the 1958 JWS championship. Mauch declined an offer 
to interview with Quinn for an opening on the Phillies' 1960 coaching staff, 
saying he wanted to focus on managing. At the close of spring training, 
on the eve of beginning his third season as the Millers' boss, Quinn called 
him again and asked him to replace veteran pilot Eddie Sawyer, who had 
resigned after the Phils' opening game of the 1960 season on April 12. 
Mauch, 34 years old at time, became the youngest manager in the Major Leagues. 
Mauch was a strong advocate of "small ball", the emphasis on offensive 
fundamentals such as bunting, sacrifice plays, and other ways of advancing 
runners, as opposed to trying to score runs primarily through slugging. 
His teams generally played in ballparks that were not friendly to home 
run hitters, which increased the effectiveness of this approach. While 
his teams occasionally featured power hitters such as Dick Allen, Rusty 
Staub and Reggie Jackson, they depended just as heavily on hitters adept 
at getting on base through contact hitting and patience at the plate, such 
as Rod Carew, and on strong defensive play by such stars as Bobby Grich 
and Bob Boone. Renowned as an excellent manager of his bench, Mauch also 
had a reputation for provoking opposing teams with taunting, and of having 
a strong temperament that stressed himself and his teams excessively in 
the belief that he could win by sheer will.[2] Mauch had frequent fiery 
exchanges with umpires. Mauch was not shy when arguing an umpiring play. 
He used his bombastic personality to help his team gain any possible advantage 
on the baseball diamond. Mauch had a brilliant baseball mind and is sometimes 
credited with starting the "double player switch". Mauch gained a reputation 
for being loyal to his players and became known as the Little General. 
Mauch came tantalizingly close to the World Series on three occasions. 
In late September 1964, his Phillies had a record of 90–60, a 6 1⁄2 game 
lead in the National League with 12 games left to play, and were starting 
a 7-game home stand. Mauch decided to start his two pitching aces, Jim 
Bunning and Chris Short, in 7 of the last 10 games, 4 of those starts on 
2 days rest (all of which they lost). The Phillies faded, losing 10 games 
in a row before winning their last 2 games to finish tied for second place 
with the Cincinnati Reds, one game behind the St. Louis Cardinals in a 
collapse infamously known as the "Phold." The other 2 near-World-Series 
cases came with the Angels. In 1982, his Angels team won the American League's 
Western Division, and won the first two games, at home, in a best-of-5 
ALCS against the Milwaukee Brewers. The Angels needed only one more victory 
to advance to their first World Series. Chances were great, since no team 
had ever lost the ALCS after winning the first two games. But Milwaukee 
came back to win all three remaining games (in Milwaukee) and the AL pennant. 
Some blamed Mauch, who chose to start Tommy John and Bruce Kison, winners 
of the first two games, in Games 4 and 5 on three days' rest each. In 1986, 
the Angels again won the Western title, and led in the fifth game of the 
(by now best-of-7) ALCS against the Boston Red Sox, just one strike away 
from the Fall Classic, but Boston's Dave Henderson hit a home run off Angels 
reliever Donnie Moore to put the Red Sox ahead. The Angels tied the game 
in the bottom of the 9th, but the Red Sox went on to win the game in extra 
innings as well as the remaining two games in Boston to take the Series, 
and denied Mauch his last real chance to win a pennant and a World Series 
championship. Mauch suddenly retired for health reasons as manager of the 
Angels during spring training in 1988 at age 62.[3] The team's advance 
scout, Cookie Rojas, who had played for Mauch with the Phillies, took command 
of the club. Seven years after his retirement as a manager, Mauch returned 
in 1995 as bench coach with the Kansas City Royals to assist Bob Boone, 
who was in his first year as a big league skipper. Compounding his ill-starred 
reputation as a manager, he was the skipper during two of the longest losing 
streaks in Major League history. His 1961 Phillies lost 23 in a row, one 
short of the Major League record. His expansion 1969 Expos lost 20 in a 
row before finally ending it, as Mauch had to endure media reminders of 
his teams' previous loss streaks in 1961 and 1964. He managed his nephew 
Roy Smalley III during his tenure with the Minnesota Twins. Smalley's father, 
Roy, Jr., married Mauch's sister, Jolene. Roy Jr. and Mauch grew up and 
played sandlot baseball together in Los Angeles, California.[citation needed] 
Mauch died at age 79 at Eisenhower Medical Center in Rancho Mirage, California
