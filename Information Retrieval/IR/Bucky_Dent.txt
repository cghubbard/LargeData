As player As manager Russell Earl "Bucky" Dent (born Russell Earl O'Dey; 
November 25, 1951) is a former American Major League Baseball player and 
manager. He earned two World Series rings as the starting shortstop for 
the New York Yankees in 1977 and 1978, both over the Los Angeles Dodgers, 
and he was voted the World Series MVP in 1978. Dent is most famous for 
his home run in a tie-breaker game against the Boston Red Sox at the end 
of the 1978 season. Dent was born 25 November 1951, in Savannah, Georgia, 
to Dennis O'Dey and Russell "Shorty" Stanford.[1] He went home from the 
hospital with his mother's brother James Earl Dent, and James' wife, Sarah. 
He and his half-brother were raised by the Dents, and they changed his 
last name to "Dent", but his mother would not allow them to legally adopt. 
He and his half-brother were led to believe the Dents were their biological 
parents, until he was ten years old.[2] Dent was told the woman he knew 
as his aunt was in fact his mother.[1] Later in life, he was told the name 
of his father, whom he then found, thus sparking and developing a relationship.[2] 
Dent grew up in Sylvania, Georgia, and Hialeah, Florida, graduating from 
Hialeah High School. The sixth pick in the 1970 major league draft, by 
the age of 21 he was playing shortstop for the Chicago White Sox, wearing 
uniform number 30. The pressure of succeeding Luis Aparicio at the position 
was problematic, however, and in 1977 the White Sox traded him to the Yankees 
for Oscar Gamble, LaMarr Hoyt, a minor leaguer and $200,000.[3] The Yankees 
gave him uniform number 20. Dent is widely remembered for hitting a three-run 
home run that gave the Yankees a 3-2 lead in the 1978 AL East division 
playoff game against the Boston Red Sox. This was all the more remarkable 
due to the fact that Dent was not known as a power hitter. Indeed, the 
home run was one of only 40 he hit in his entire 12-year career. Further, 
Dent occupied the ninth spot in the batting order, not generally considered 
a power slot. The Yankees went on to win the game 5-4, securing the division 
title in the process. Ever since then, Red Sox fans have called him "Bucky 
Fucking Dent."[4] Dent continued his unusually high production by batting 
.417 in the 1978 World Series, earning Series Most Valuable Player honors, 
as the Yankees defeated the Los Angeles Dodgers, four games to two. A three-time 
All-Star, Dent remained the Yankees' shortstop until 1982, when he was 
traded to the Texas Rangers for outfielder Lee Mazzilli. During his six 
years with the Yankees, Dent lived in a home in Wyckoff, New Jersey that 
he later rented to Don Zimmer, after Dent was traded.[5][6] On the Rangers, 
his uniform number was 7. Dent returned to the Yankees briefly in 1984 
(but never played a game) before finishing his career that season with 
the Kansas City Royals, wearing uniform number 21. He retired having spent 
his full 12-year playing career in the American League, with a .247 batting 
average and 423 RBI. After retiring as a player, Dent managed in the Yankees' 
minor-league system, notably with the Columbus Clippers. He served the 
Yankees as manager of the big-league club for portions of two seasons, 
compiling an 18–22 record in 1989 and an 18–31 record in 1990. In 1989 
Dent opened a baseball school at Delray Beach, Florida, which featured 
a miniature version of Fenway Park.[7] Although Dent had his greatest moment 
as a player at Fenway Park, his worst moment also came at Fenway Park when 
he was fired as manager of the Yankees.[8] Dan Shaughnessy of The Boston 
Globe criticized Yankees Owner George Steinbrenner for firing Dent in Boston 
and said he should "have waited until the Yankees got to Baltimore" to 
fire Dent.[9] He said that "if Dent had been fired in Seattle or Milwaukee, 
this would have been just another event in an endless line of George's 
jettisons. But it happened in Boston and the nightly news had its hook".[9] 
He also said that "the firing was only special because...it's the first 
time a Yankee manager...was purged on the ancient Indian burial grounds 
of the Back Bay".[9] From 1991 to 1994, Dent served on the coaching staff 
of the St. Louis Cardinals under manager Joe Torre, moving to the coaching 
staff of the Texas Rangers from 1995 to 2001. In 2002, Dent served as the 
manager for the Omaha Royals, the Triple A affiliate of the Kansas City 
Royals. In 2003, when the Green Monster seats were added to Fenway Park, 
Dent attended the first game and sat in a Green Monster seat that was very 
near to where his 1978 home run landed. No animosity was displayed towards 
him by Red Sox fans at that game, who were all cordial to him. Dent threw 
out the first pitch to Yogi Berra in the seventh and final game of the 
2004 American League Championship Series. In November 2005, Dent became 
the bench coach for the Cincinnati Reds. The Cincinnati Reds released Dent 
on July 3, 2007; just a few days after releasing manager Jerry Narron. 
At the time, the Reds had the worst record in Major League Baseball. He 
now lives in South Florida. His wife Marianne died on October 22, 2015; 
they were the parents of four children. One of his daughters, Caitlin, 
played NCAA Division I softball at North Carolina State from 2010–2013[10] 
and was an assistant coach for the Hofstra softball team during the 2015 
season,[11] while Cody Dent played baseball at Florida.[12] In 1979, Dent 
posed for a pin-up poster. That year he also appeared in the TV movie Dallas 
Cowboys Cheerleaders, portraying a wide receiver who was the love interest 
of one of the cheerleaders. He also appeared in the September 1983 issue 
of Playgirl magazine wearing a swimsuit. In 2014, Dent made a cameo as
