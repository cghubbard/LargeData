The 1979 Philadelphia Phillies season was a season in American baseball. 
The team finished fourth in the National League East, 14 games behind the 
first-place Pittsburgh Pirates. Prior to the 1979 season, Pete Rose signed 
a four-year, $3.2-million contract with the Philadelphia Phillies, temporarily 
making him the highest-paid athlete in team sports. The Phillies were in 
the middle of the greatest era in the history of the franchise when Rose 
came on board. They had won the National League East three years running 
(1976–78) two of which were won with 101 win seasons. The Phillies entered 
the 1979 season with one of the strongest lineups in the league with the 
addition of Rose but with numerous injuries on the pitching staff. AP sports 
writer Hal Bock picked the Phils to finish second behind the Pirates as 
the Phillies would enter the season with pitchers Larry Christenson, prospect 
Jim Wright, and Dick Ruthven all injured.[1] On April 18, in a victory 
versus the Pirates, Greg Luzinski became the first visiting player to hit 
a home run into the fifth level of Three Rivers Stadium.[13] On May 17, 
1979, the Phillies beat the Cubs 23-22 at Wrigley Field in ten innings 
with a 30-mph wind blowing out to left field.[14] After the game, the Phils 
were 14 games over .500 and in first place by 3½ games over the Montreal 
Expos.[15] On July 10 Del Unser hit his third consecutive pinch hit home 
run. Unser tied a Major League Baseball record with homers in three straight 
pinch at bats. The at bats were on June 30, July 5, and July 10.[16] By 
August 29, the team had fallen to fifth place and two games under .500, 
12½ games behind the Pirates.[17] Mid-season injuries to Manny Trillo, 
Larry Bowa, and Greg Luzinski contributed to hurt the club. The team's 
decline led to the firing of manager Danny Ozark on August 31 who was replaced 
by Dallas Green.[18] Green was named interim manager, a position made permanent 
shortly after the end of the season.[19] The Phillies front office introduced 
an alternate all-burgundy version of the team uniform for the 1979 season 
to be worn for Saturday games.[20] They were called "Saturday Night Specials", 
in a derisive nod to cheap handguns then called by that name and were worn 
for the first and last time on May 19, 1979,[21] a 10-5 loss to the Expos.[22] 
The immediate reaction of the media, fans, and players alike was negative, 
with many describing the despised uniforms as pajama-like. Infielders Coaches
