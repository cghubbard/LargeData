As player As manager John Francis "Shano" Collins (December 4, 1885 â€“ September 
10, 1955) was an American right fielder and first baseman in Major League 
Baseball for the Chicago White Sox and Boston Red Sox. In 1910, Collins 
played first base for the White Sox, but he was quickly moved to right 
field, where he would enjoy a reputation for having one of the strongest 
throwing arms in baseball. He won a World Series with the Sox in 1917, 
delivering the game-winning hit in the pennant-clinching game. He batted 
.286 (6 for 21) in the 1917 World Series, going 3-for-4 in Game 1. In 1918, 
he set a record with three bases-loaded triples in one season, which would 
stand alone for 31 years until Elmer Valo tied the mark in 1949.[1] Collins 
still holds the MLB career record of eight triples with the bases loaded.[2] 
During the notorious 1919 World Series, tainted by the Black Sox Scandal, 
Collins went 4-for-16 at the plate for the White Sox. He was not among 
those implicated in the scandal. In 1921, he was traded to the Red Sox, 
with whom he finished his career. In 1930, he was named manager of the 
Red Sox, but he only won a total of 73 games in parts of two seasons. He 
was fired after 55 games in 1931. In the indictments of the key figures 
in the Black Sox scandal John F. Collins is named as the wronged party. 
The indictment claims that by throwing the World Series the alleged conspirators 
defrauded him of $1,784 dollars.[3] Collins died in Newton, Massachusetts,
