Louis Norman "Bobo" Newsom (August 11, 1907 – December 7, 1962) was an 
American starting pitcher in Major League Baseball. Also known as "Buck", 
Newsom played for nine of the 16 then-existing big-league teams from 1929 
through 1953 over all or parts of 20 seasons, appearing in an even 600 
games pitched and 3,759 1⁄3 innings pitched. He batted and threw right-handed, 
stood 6 feet 3 inches (1.91 m) tall and weighed 200 pounds (91 kg). Born 
in Hartsville, South Carolina, Newsom was known as a somewhat eccentric 
and emotional personality, typically referring to everyone in the third 
person, including referring to himself as "Bobo". Newsom pitched valiantly 
in a losing cause in Game Seven of the 1940 World Series with the Detroit 
Tigers, two days after pitching a shutout in honor of his father, who had 
died while visiting from South Carolina and watching his son win the opener. 
Bobo had said before pitching Game Five, "I'll win this one for my daddy." 
When manager Del Baker named Newsom to take the mound for Game Seven, Bobo 
was asked by reporters, "will you win this one for your daddy too?" "Why, 
no", Newsom said, "I think I'll win this one for old Bobo."[1][2] Newsom's 
performance in 1941 was a disappointment, as he lost 20 games, winning 
only 12. When Tigers' general manager Jack Zeller negotiated a contract 
with Newsom, he said, "You'll have to take a salary cut, Newsom, since 
you lost 20 games last season." The plain-spoken Bobo, remembering what 
Commissioner Landis had done to release players on minor-league teams that 
were under major-league teams' control, snapped, "Hell, you lost ninety-one 
of Briggs' [the team owner] ball players last year, and I don't see you 
taking no cut." Zeller was not amused and traded Newsom to the Washington 
Senators. Although Newsom pitched poorly in Game 3, allowing five runs 
in less than two innings, he garnered a Series ring while with the New 
York Yankees in 1947. In a 20-season career, Newsom posted a 211–222 record 
with 2082 strikeouts and a 3.98 ERA in 3759.1 innings pitched. He also 
made the American League All-Star team from 1938–1940 and in 1944. With 
211 wins, he is one of the 100 winningest pitchers of all time. His 222 
losses also make him one of only two major league pitchers to win 200 games 
and still have a sub .500 career winning percentage, the other being Jack 
Powell. Upon his retirement in 1953, he was the last major leaguer to have 
played in the 1920s to still be active. Newsom is one of only 29 players 
in baseball history to date to have appeared in Major League games in four 
decades. Al Benton is the only major-league pitcher to have faced both 
Babe Ruth and Mickey Mantle.[3] Newsom was the only other pitcher whose 
career spanned that of both hitters. He did face Ruth in 1934; however, 
in 1951, Mantle's first year, Newsom was out of the majors, and in 1952, 
Newsom never faced the Yankees—and the one time he faced them in 1953, 
Mantle was out of the lineup with an injury. Newsom died in Orlando, Florida 
at age 55 from cirrhosis of the liver and was buried at Magnolia Cemetery 
in his home town of Hartsville, which also has a street named in his honor. 
Newsom is mentioned in the poem "Line-Up for Yesterday" by Ogden Nash, 
where he is the only player mentioned still not in the Hall of Fame as 
of 2016: N is for Newsom, Bobo's favorite kin. You ask how he's here, He
