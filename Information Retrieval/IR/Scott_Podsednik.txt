Scott Eric Podsednik (/pədˈsɛdnᵻk/; born March 18, 1976) is an American 
former professional baseball outfielder in Major League Baseball (MLB). 
Best known for his baserunning, Podsednik led the major leagues in stolen 
bases in 2004 with 70, in times caught stealing in 2005 with 23, and the 
American League in times caught stealing in 2006 with 19. He won the World 
Series with the 2005 Chicago White Sox, hitting a walk-off home run in 
Game 2. Podsednik was drafted out of West High School in the 3rd round, 
85th overall, in the 1994 Major League Baseball draft by the Texas Rangers. 
He began his professional career with the Gulf Coast Rangers in 1994. The 
Rangers traded him (along with Wilson Heredia) to the Florida Marlins for 
pitcher Bobby Witt on October 8, 1995. He spent the next two seasons playing 
for the Marlins class-A affiliates. On December 15, 1997 he returned to 
the Rangers in the minor league portion of the Rule 5 draft. He was promoted 
to the Double-A Tulsa Drillers in 1998. He remained with Tulsa through 
the 2000 season when he was granted free agency. He signed with the Seattle 
Mariners as a minor league free agent and was placed at the Triple-A level 
with the Tacoma Rainiers. He made his Major League debut on July 6, 2001 
against the Los Angeles Dodgers, pinch-running for Ichiro Suzuki. In his 
first career major league at-bat, against the Arizona Diamondbacks on July 
15, he hit a bases loaded triple.[1] In 2002, Podsednik played mostly at 
Triple-A Tacoma, but was activated for 14 Major League games, hitting his 
first major-league home run during that time. After the 2002 season, Podsednik 
was acquired by the Milwaukee Brewers organization from Seattle for $20,000. 
Podsednik rebounded with a fine rookie season in Milwaukee, compiling a 
.314 batting average, 43 stolen bases, 100 runs scored, 175 hits, 29 doubles, 
eight triples, nine home runs, 58 runs batted in, 56 walks and a .379 on-base 
percentage for the Brewers. While only inserted permanently into the starting 
lineup in mid-May, Podsednik still finished second to the Florida Marlins' 
Dontrelle Willis in the official Rookie of the Year balloting.[2] The 2004 
season saw Podsednik lead the league with 70 stolen bases. In December 
2004 Podsednik was dealt to the Chicago White Sox (along with Travis Hinton 
and Luis Vizcaíno) for Carlos Lee. After leading all of the Major Leagues 
in steals the first half of 2005 he was selected to his first All-Star 
game via the MLB's All-Star Final Vote. He saw only defensive time in the 
All-Star game in Detroit that year and did not get a chance to bat. Podsednik 
ended 2005 with 59 steals (second in the American League) and 23 times 
caught stealing (leading the major leagues) despite missing several games 
due to injury. In the post-season he started all 12 games and hit .286 
while stealing 6 bases on 9 attempts. In Game 2 of the 2005 World Series, 
while facing Brad Lidge in the bottom of the 9th inning, with the White 
Sox and Astros tied at 6, Podsednik hit a 2-1 fastball into the right field 
stands for a walk-off home run, only the 14th in World Series history. 
The feat was all the more improbable because Podsednik did not hit any 
home runs during the regular season in 2005, and had only hit 1 in the 
ALDS against the Red Sox. Two days later in Game 3, he set a World Series 
record of eight bats in a single World Series Game. In 2006, Podsednik 
once again led the league with 19 times caught stealing. On November 20, 
2007, Podsednik was designated for assignment and released on November 
28, 2007.[3] On February 5, 2008, he signed a minor league contract with 
an invitation to spring training with the Colorado Rockies.[4] He appeared 
in 93 games for the Rockies and hit .253. A free agent at the end of the 
season, he re-signed with the Rockies on January 14, 2009.[5] But he was 
released before the 2009 season started. On April 14, 2009, Podsednik agreed 
to return to the White Sox on a minor-league deal, assigning him to the 
AAA Charlotte Knights. On April 30, the White Sox called Podsednik from 
Charlotte to play on White Sox 25-man roster. Podsednik was given plenty 
of playing time upon his recall, with injuries to Sox center fielders DeWayne 
Wise and Brian Anderson, as well as left fielder Carlos Quentin. He hit 
.304 in his return to the South Side. On January 8, 2010, Podsednik signed 
a contract with the Kansas City Royals. He hit .309 in 94 games with the 
Royals, including stealing 30 bases. On July 28, 2010, the Royals traded 
Podsednik to the Los Angeles Dodgers in return for two minor league players, 
catcher Lucas May and pitcher Elisaul Pimentel. He appeared in 39 games 
for the Dodgers, with a .262 batting average and 5 stolen bases. He was 
shut down for the season in early September because of a foot injury.[6] 
After the season, he declined his half of a mutual option and became a 
free agent. On February 16, 2011, Podsednik signed a minor league contract 
with an invitation to spring training. He played for the Las Vegas 51s 
in the Pacific Coast League as a member of the Toronto Blue Jays organization. 
He was released on May 11.[7] Podsednik signed a minor league contract 
with the Philadelphia Phillies on May 22, 2011.[8] He was assigned to their 
Triple-A affiliate, the Lehigh Valley Iron Pigs, but was limited to playing 
in just 14 games due to injuries. The Phillies signed Podsednik to another 
minor league deal on November 30, 2011.[9] Even after an impressive Spring 
training, Podsednik was again sent to Triple-A Lehigh Valley. On May 11, 
2012, Podsednik was traded to the Boston Red Sox for cash considerations. 
Podsednik was promoted to Boston May 22 to help with an outfield that saw 
seven players on the disabled list. On May 22, 2012 he made his debut, 
pinch hitting for Marlon Byrd in the seventh inning of a game against the 
Baltimore Orioles. On the following day also against the Baltimore Orioles, 
Podsednik made his first start in right field and hit a home run. On July 
31, 2012, Podsednik was traded to the Arizona Diamondbacks, along with 
RHP Matt Albers, for LHP Craig Breslow. He was released the next day after 
refusing a Triple-A assignment. On August 9, 2012, Podsednik re-signed 
with the Red Sox on a major league contract. He retired after the 2012 
season. He is married to Playboy Playmate Lisa Dergan Podsednik. They have 
twins and live in Colleyville, Texas. His sister Shana is married to former
