Brad Martin Hennessey (born February 7, 1980) is a former American professional 
baseball pitcher for the San Francisco Giants of Major League Baseball. 
He stands 6 feet 2 inches (1.88 m) tall and weighs 185 pounds (84 kg). 
He played for the Giants from 2004–08 and threw five pitches: a fastball, 
a slider, a changeup, a curveball, and a cutter. Hennessey attended Youngstown 
State University and set several school records during his tenure with 
the team. In 2001, he was selected by the Giants in the first round of 
the draft. He did not pitch in 2002 because of surgery to remove a non-cancerous 
tumor from his back. In 2004, he reached the major leagues for the first 
time. He spent much of the 2005 season in the major leagues, making 21 
starts and posting a 4.64 earned run average (ERA). In 2006, Hennessey 
spent time both in the Giants' starting rotation and the bullpen. He became 
a relief pitcher full-time in 2007, spending the entire season in the majors 
and closing for the Giants part of the time. After posting a 7.81 ERA with 
the Giants in 2008, Hennessey was outrighted to the minors; he refused 
the assignment and became a free agent. He attempted to pitch for the Baltimore 
Orioles in 2009 but was unable due to injury. Hennessey then spent parts 
of 2010 and 2011 in the minor leagues. Hennessey was born on February 7, 
1980, in Toledo, Ohio. In 1997, he graduated from Whitmer High School, 
where he was named a USA Today honorable mention All-American and won All-Ohio 
honors for his baseball playing. He went to Youngstown State University, 
where he played shortstop and pitched until his senior year, when he converted 
exclusively to pitching. As a senior, he had a 6–5 record and a 4.06 earned 
run average (ERA) in 16 games while setting school single-season records 
for innings pitched ( 88 2⁄3) and strikeouts (126). That year, he was named 
the Mid-Continent Conference co-Pitcher of the Year.[1] Hennessey was drafted 
by the San Francisco Giants in the first round (21st overall) of the 2001 
Major League Baseball draft.[2] He began his career with the Salem-Keizer 
Volcanoes of the Single-A short season Northwest League, where he had a 
1–0 record, a 2.38 ERA, 22 strikeouts, and 34 innings pitched in nine starts.[3] 
That year, Salem-Keizer won the Northwest League championship.[4] While 
pitching in an instructional league later that year, Hennessey began experiencing 
soreness that was initially attributed to a muscle strain but turned out 
to be a non-cancerous tumor in his back. He had it removed in February 
2002, but it grew back later that season, and he missed the entire year 
while undergoing a second surgery.[5] Hennessey began 2003 in extended 
spring training but pitched for the Hagerstown Suns of the Single-A South 
Atlantic League from June 14 to the end of the season.[1] With Hagerstown, 
Hennessey had a 3–9 record, a 4.21 ERA, 44 strikeouts, one complete game, 
and 79 1⁄3 innings pitched in 15 starts. He began the 2004 season with 
the Norwich Navigators of the Double-A Eastern League, where he had a 5–5 
record, a 3.56 ERA, 55 strikeouts, and 101 innings pitched in 18 starts.[3] 
On July 14, he was promoted to the Fresno Grizzlies of the Triple-A Pacific 
Coast League.[1] In 5 starts with Fresno, he had a 4–1 record, a 2.02 ERA, 
16 strikeouts, and 35 2⁄3 innings pitched.[3] Following an injury to Jerome 
Williams in 2004, Hennessey was called up to join the Giants' starting 
rotation.[6] He made his debut on August 7 against Greg Maddux of the Chicago 
Cubs, who was looking for his 300th win. Hennessey allowed four runs in 
4 2⁄3 innings and took the loss in the 8–4 defeat, becoming the first pitcher 
to lose his debut to a pitcher who won his 300th game since 1901, when 
Cy Young defeated John McPherson.[1][7] In his next start, against the 
Philadelphia Phillies on August 13, he allowed four unearned runs in five 
innings, got his first career hit (against Brian Powell), and earned his 
first career win in a 16–6 victory.[8] After another start, he was sent 
to Fresno on August 18 when Wayne Franklin returned from the disabled list, 
but he was called up on August 28 when David Aardsma was demoted.[9][10] 
On September 16, he threw a season-high seven shutout innings in a 4–0 
victory over the Milwaukee Brewers.[11] Hennessey finished the season with 
a 2–2 record, a 4.98 ERA, 25 strikeouts, and 34 1⁄3 innings pitched in 
seven starts.[3] Hennessey began 2005 in the minors. He was called up to 
make a start on May 1, and he gave up three runs over seven innings while 
earning the win in an 8–3 victory over the Pittsburgh Pirates.[12] After 
the game, he was returned to Fresno to make room for Jeremy Accardo on 
the roster, but he was called up on May 12 to replace the injured Jason 
Schmidt in the rotation.[13][14] He made four starts on this stint; after 
he gave up six runs in two innings in a 6–5 loss to the Phillies on June 
2, he was replaced in the rotation by Jeff Fassero and returned to Fresno.[15][16] 
On July 9, he was called up to rejoin the Giants' rotation as Kirk Rueter 
was demoted to the bullpen.[17][18] Facing the St. Louis Cardinals that 
day, he pitched seven shutout innings and earned the win in the Giants' 
2–0 victory.[19] For the rest of the year, he remained in the Giants' rotation.[20] 
In a start against the Brewers on July 28, Hennessey pitched 7 shutout 
innings, striking out seven and allowing only three hits, and won the game 
3–0. The three runs came on a home run by Hennessey himself against Víctor 
Santos.[21] He allowed one run over a career-high 7 2⁄3 innings on September 
21 and hit a home run against John Patterson as he defeated the Washington 
Nationals 5–1.[22] He ended up making 21 starts for the Giants, tallying 
a 5–8 record, a 4.64 ERA, 64 strikeouts, and 52 walks in 118 1⁄3 innings 
pitched. With Fresno, he had a 4–2 record, a 5.19 ERA, 46 strikeouts, 22 
walks, and 67 2⁄3 innings pitched.[1] Kevin Correia and the newly acquired 
Jamey Wright competed for the Giants' fifth starting job with Hennessey 
in 2006;[23] Hennessey struggled and began the season with the Grizzlies 
as Wright won the job.[24] Hennessey was called up on April 16 due to an 
injury to Noah Lowry.[25] After posting a 2–1 record and a 3.33 ERA, he 
was sent to the bullpen upon Lowry's return to the starting rotation on 
May 9, though Hennessey was frequently called upon to make spot starts.[26][27] 
He got his first career save on June 5, pitching the final four innings 
of the Giants' 14–2 victory over the Florida Marlins.[28] On August 11, 
Giants' manager Felipe Alou announced that Hennessey would replace the 
struggling Wright in the rotation.[29] In his first start since rejoining 
the rotation on August 14, he threw 5 2⁄3 shutout innings, earning the 
win in a 1–0 victory over the San Diego Padres.[30] He posted an 8.62 ERA 
over his next four starts and returned to the bullpen when Lowry returned 
from an injury in September, though he made one more start before the end 
of the year.[27][31] In 34 games (12 starts), Hennessey had a 5–6 record, 
a 4.26 ERA, 42 strikeouts, and 42 walks in 99 1⁄3 innings pitched.[1] Hennessey 
spent the entire 2007 season in the bullpen for the Giants.[1] At the beginning 
of June, he was named the closer by Giants' manager Bruce Bochy after Armando 
Benítez was traded.[32] From June 30 to August 31, he converted saves in 
14 straight save opportunities, the longest streak by a Giant since Robb 
Nen had a 28-save streak in 2000; overall, Hennessey converted 17 out of 
19 saves from May 30 to August 31.[1] Afterwards, he converted only two 
out of five opportunities before Brian Wilson took over the closer role.[33][34][35][36] 
In 2007, he went 4–5 and had a 3.42 ERA and 19 saves (out of 24 opportunities).[1] 
On January 18, 2008, the Giants and Hennessey avoided arbitration and agreed 
to a $1.6 million, one-year deal.[37] After he posted a 12.94 in his first 
11 games of the season, he got sent down to the minors on May 6 to make 
room for Billy Sadler.[38] Used as a starter at Fresno, Hennessey posted 
a 7–10 record, a 4.83 ERA, 69 strikeouts, 37 walks, and 132 1⁄3 innings 
pitched in 21 starts.[3] He was called back up when rosters expanded on 
September 1.[39] After initially pitching out of the bullpen, he was moved 
to the rotation to replace Correia.[40] On September 15, he threw the only 
complete game of his career, allowing three runs in eight innings in a 
3–1 loss to the Arizona Diamondbacks at Chase Field.[41] In 17 games (four 
starts), he had a 1–2 record, a 7.81 ERA, 21 strikeouts, and 15 walks in 
40 1⁄3 innings pitched.[1] He was outrighted to the minors in October, 
but he refused the assignment and became a free agent.[42] Hennessey signed 
a minor league deal with the Baltimore Orioles on November 17, 2008.[43] 
Spencer Fordin of MLB.com wrote that Hennessey was "consistently hyped 
as a favorite to break camp in the rotation" for the Orioles.[44] However, 
an elbow injury kept Hennessey from making any appearances with the Orioles 
or their affiliates.[3][45][46] On June 1, 2009, Hennessey was released.[47] 
On March 2, 2010, Hennessey signed with the Minnesota Twins.[47] He spent 
the 2010 season with the Rochester Red Wings of the Triple-A International 
League, posting a 1–3 record, a 7.76 ERA, 13 strikeouts, and eight walks 
in 26 2⁄3 innings. After 14 games (one start),[3] Hennessey was released 
on August 5.[47] The Houston Astros signed Hennessey to a minor league 
contract on May 31, 2011.[47] He played for the Double-A Corpus Christi 
Hooks of the Texas League and the Triple-A Oklahoma City RedHawks of the 
Pacific Coast League. His four games with Corpus Christi were all relief 
appearances; he had an 0–1 record and a 1.80 ERA. In seven games (six starts) 
with Oklahoma City, he had an 0–3 record, an 11.45 ERA, 10 strikeouts, 
and five walks in 22 innings pitched.[3] On August 1, Hennessey was released 
by the Astros.[47] Hennessey threw five pitches: a fastball, a slider, 
a changeup, a curveball, and a cutter. The fastball was Hennessey's main 
pitch; he threw it over 60% of the time in the majors. He did not throw 
it very hard, averaging speeds under 90 mph in 2007 and 2008. His slider 
was his secondary pitch, and his changeup was his third most-used pitch. 
Hennessey rarely used the cutter except for in 2006, when he threw it 10.1% 
of the time.[48] Henessey often was plagued by a big inning, displaying 
a tendency to allow several runs in an inning during his starts.[49] Hennessey 
married a nurse, Erin Bullard, on December 14, 2002.[5] The couple has 
two children: Emma (born April 18, 2003) and Colin Jacob (born October 
26, 2006). Hennessey participated in numerous charitable events during
