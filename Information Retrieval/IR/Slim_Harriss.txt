William Jennings Bryan Harriss (December 11, 1897 – September 19, 1963) 
was a pitcher who played in Major League Baseball between the 1920 and 
1928 seasons. Listed at 6 ft 6 in (1.98 m), 180 lb., Harriss batted and 
threw right-handed. A native of Brownwood, Texas, he studied at Howard 
Payne University. A tall, lanky hurler, Harriss entered the majors in 1920 
with the Philadelphia Athletics, playing for them six and a half years 
before joining the Boston Red Sox (1926–28). Twice he led the American 
League in losses, with 20 in 1922 and 21 in 1927. His most productive season 
came with the 1925 Athletics, when he recorded career-highs with 19 wins, 
a 3.49 ERA, and 252⅔ innings pitched. During the 1926 midseason, he was 
sent by the Athletics along Fred Heimach and Baby Doll Jacobson to the 
Red Sox in the same transaction that brought Tom Jenkins and Howard Ehmke 
to Philadelphia. That year he became the last pitcher (through the end 
of the 2015 Major League Baseball season) to throw more than 150 innings 
in a season without allowing a single home run. In 1928, he led the hapless 
pitching staff of Boston with 14 wins and 77 strikeouts. In a nine-season 
career, Harriss posted a 95–135 record with 644 strikeouts and a 4.26 ERA 
in 349 appearances, including 228 starts, 89 complete games, seven shutouts, 
78 games finished, 16 saves, and 1750⅓ innings of work. Harriss died in
