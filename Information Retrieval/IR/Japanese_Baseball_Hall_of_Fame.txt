The Japanese Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum (野球体育博物館, Yakyū Taiiku Hakubutsukan?) 
is a museum which includes a library, reference rooms and Japanese Baseball 
Hall of Fame (野球殿堂, Yakyū Dendō?). It first opened in 1959 next door to 
Korakuen Stadium in Tokyo, Japan. In 1988, the museum moved to a new site 
within the Tokyo Dome. The Hall of Fame and Museum was created as a means 
to contribute to the development of baseball in Japan through dedication 
of baseball greats—players, executives, and umpires—as Hall of Famers. 
In addition, the facility houses many memorable baseball materials including 
various kinds of baseball literature. Coordinates: 35°42′20.37″N 139°45′6.89″E﻿
