The 2015 New York Yankees season was the 113th season in New York City, 
and 115th season overall, for the New York Yankees, who play in the American 
League East of Major League Baseball. They finished the regular season 
with a record of 87-75, six games behind the Toronto Blue Jays and second 
in the AL East. They clinched the host Wild Card berth, but lost to the 
Houston Astros in the 2015 American League Wild Card Game. This was the 
New York Yankees' first full season in over twenty years without team captain 
and shortstop Derek Jeter, who retired at the end of the 2014 season. In 
addition, the Yankees retired the jersey numbers of center fielder Bernie 
Williams (51), catcher Jorge Posada (20), and pitcher Andy Pettitte (46) 
during the season, bringing the total amount of retired numbers to twenty, 
for 22 different players. The Yankees fired Kevin Long, the hitting coach, 
and Mick Kelleher, the first base coach on October 10.[2] They also re-signed 
GM Brian Cashman to a three-year deal that same day.[2] On November 8, 
the Yankees re-signed free agent outfielder Chris Young to a 1-year, $2.5 
million contract with incentives.[3] On November 12, the Yankees signed 
left-hander José de Paula to a 1-year major league contract worth $500,000.[4] 
That same day, the Yankees traded longtime backup catcher Francisco Cervelli 
to the Pittsburgh Pirates in exchange for left-hander Justin Wilson.[5] 
On December 3, the Yankees signed reliever Esmil Rogers to a 1-year, $1.48 
million contract.[6] On December 5, the Yankees acquired shortstop Didi 
Gregorius from the Arizona Diamondbacks in a three-team trade involving 
the Detroit Tigers. The Yankees sent Shane Greene to the Tigers as part 
of the trade.[7] That same day, the Yankees signed reliever Andrew Miller 
to a 4-year, $36 million deal.[8] On December 15, the Yankees re-signed 
free agent third baseman Chase Headley, to a 4-year deal worth $52 million.[9] 
On December 16, the Yankees re-signed left-hander Chris Capuano to a 1-year, 
$5 million deal.[10] On December 19, the Yankees traded utility infielder 
Martín Prado to the Miami Marlins, along with pitcher David Phelps, in 
exchange for pitcher Nathan Eovaldi, 1B/OF Garrett Jones, and pitching 
prospect Domingo German.[11] Also on December 19, the Yankees acquired 
relief pitcher Gonzalez Germen from the New York Mets, in exchange for 
cash considerations. He was later traded to the Texas Rangers on January 
20, again in exchange for cash considerations.[12] On December 29, the 
Yankees traded reliever Shawn Kelley to the San Diego Padres, in exchange 
for minor league pitcher Johnny Barbato.[13] On January 1, the Yankees 
traded pitching prospect Manny Banuelos to the Atlanta Braves, in exchange 
for relievers David Carpenter, and Chasen Shreve.[14] On January 6, the 
Yankees signed infielder Stephen Drew to a 1-year contract, worth $5 million 
with incentives.[15] On January 11, the Yankees hired Jeff Pentland to 
be their main hitting coach, along with Alan Cockrell to be the assistant 
hitting coach. In addition, the Yankees also hired Joe Espada to be their 
third base coach.[16] On January 13, the Yankees acquired reliever Chris 
Martin from the Colorado Rockies in exchange for cash considerations.[17] 
On February 16, the Yankees signed pitcher Jared Burton to a minor league 
contract and invited him to spring training.[18] In February, the Yankees 
announced they will retire Bernie Williams number 51 on May 24, Jorge Posada's 
number 20 on August 22, and Andy Pettitte's number 46 on August 23.[19] 
On March 11, Yankees pitcher Chris Capuano left a spring training game 
with a strained right quad.[20] On March 26, the Yankees released pitcher 
Jared Burton, before resigning him three days later.[21] On April 1, the 
Yankees acquired Gregorio Petit from the Houston Astros for cash or a player 
to be named later.[22] The Yankees lost their Opening Day game on April 
6 against Toronto, losing 6-1.[23][24] The Yankees only accumulated three 
total hits that first game, with a home run by Brett Gardner accounting 
for the only run scored by the Yankees.[24] They bounced back to win the 
next game 4–3 on April 8, which was the first Yankees win of the season.[25] 
On April 28, ace pitcher Masahiro Tanaka was placed on the 15-day disabled 
list with a tendinitis in his right wrist and a slight strain on his forearm. 
It was not connected to the elbow injury he suffered in the previous season.[26] 
The Yankees would later finish the first month with a 13–9 record atop 
the American League East division. The success of the New York Yankees 
in April was a result of good hitting against opposing team's bullpens 
and good offense to keep games close. In fact, seven of the thirteen wins 
in April were decided by one or two runs. Mixing and matching both pitching 
and offense was also key in the part of manager Joe Girardi.[27] Some notable 
contributions came from players such as Alex Rodriguez, Jacoby Ellsbury, 
Mark Teixeira, Chris Young, Brett Gardner,[28] Dellin Betances, and even 
from the Yankees closer Andrew Miller. Miller, who had joined the Yankees 
during the off-season, had been impressive with eight saves in eight chances 
in the month of April.[29][30] In April, Brett Gardner had also started 
the trend of having the team grow mustaches and it caught on.[31] The Yankees 
beat the Boston Red Sox 4–2 on May 2, during which Andrew Miller had set 
Yankees club history by securing nine saves in the first 23 games the Yankees 
had played in a season. Mariano Rivera, the former Yankees closer who had 
retired following the 2013 season, had not even performed this feat during 
his 19-year career.[32] It was the same game that Alex Rodriguez hit a 
pinch-hit home run off of Red Sox pitcher Junichi Tazawa, his first as 
a pinch-hitter, and tied Willie Mays for fourth on the all-time home run 
list at 660 homers.[33] Rodriguez was emotional following the game. The 
Yankees not long after had announced they would not be paying Rodriguez 
the $6 million in bonuses that he was promised when he had signed a contract 
years before for reaching these marks.[34] On May 19, Jacoby Ellsbury was 
placed on the 15-day disabled list with a sprained right knee. This was 
his first DL stint in his career with the Yankees.[35] May did not turn 
out well for the Yankees as they finished the month winning 13 ball games 
but losing 16. June saw a turn in play for the Yankees, as they won seven 
straight to begin the month of June. In the month, various achievements 
were reached. Alex Rodriguez hit his 3000th career hit at home on June 
19, hitting a home run to right field off from Detroit Tigers pitcher Justin 
Verlander.[36] The achievement was similar to Derek Jeter's 3000th hit 
in 2011,[37] when he homered to left off from Tampa Bay Rays pitcher David 
Price. Price and Verlander happen to both be winners of the Cy Young Award.[38] 
Ironically, Price and Verlander were both members of the Tigers organization 
the date of Rodriguez's 3000th hit. A few weeks later, Rodriguez was given 
the ball back from Zack Hample, the fan who caught it.[39] In the same 
month, the disabled list saw a bit of action. Notable to mention, Jacoby 
Ellsbury's injury took longer than expected to heal up.[40] His rehab assignment 
began on June 29.[41] In a home series against the Philadelphia Phillies, 
pitcher Iván Nova had returned to the hill for the first time since being 
injured in the prior season, winning for the Yankees and preventing a sweep.[42] 
Another notable injury-related movement was the placement of closing pitcher 
Andrew Miller onto the disabled list early in June with a strained forearm 
muscle.[43] The Yankees finished the month of June winning 15 games and 
losing 12. When the roster for the American League all-star team was announced, 
Dellin Betances and Mark Teixeira were revealed to be on the roster, with 
Teixeira replacing an injured Miguel Cabrera of the Tigers. In addition, 
the final vote held Brett Gardner as a candidate.[44][45] Gardner later 
was announced as the replacement on the roster for an injured Alex Gordon 
of the Royals. None of them were starters. On July 28 against the Texas 
Rangers, the Yankees score 21 unanswered runs – 11 of them in the 2nd inning 
– after giving up 5 runs in the first inning en route to a 21-5 win.[46] 
On July 30, the Seattle Mariners traded Dustin Ackley to the Yankees for 
José Ramírez and Ramón Flores.[47] The next day, Garrett Jones was designated 
for assignment.[48][49] (Jones was later re-signed in early August and 
then re-designated for assignment not long after)[50][51] The Yankees finished 
July with 17 wins and 7 losses. The beginning of August saw the Yankees 
begin to struggle. With the Toronto Blue Jays in a hot streak since the 
end of July (where they revamped their team with a few big name players), 
a once respectable lead in the division had shrunk down to just a half 
game ahead of the Jays by the end of August 11. That night, the Yankees 
had traveled to Cleveland to face the Indians. Entering that game, the 
Yankees had gone 31 straight innings without scoring a run. Despite having 
a 4–2 lead in the 10th inning, closer Andrew Miller blew the save. The 
game was decided in the 16th inning, where Michael Brantley had walked 
off for the Indians. The Yankees lost 5-4.[52] They lost the next day and 
the Blue Jays took lead of the division by half a game. On August 5, Luis 
Severino had his major league debut starting against the Red Sox.[53] On 
August 13 the New York Yankees called up Greg Bird who went 0 for 5 in 
his debut.[54] He got his first career hit on August 15 and his first and 
second career home runs on August 19. The Yankees retook the division the 
lead on August 14 in one of the most intense games of the season. Down 
3–1 in the top of the eighth, Yankees outfielder Carlos Beltrán hit a pinch-hit 
three-run home run to put the Yankees up 4–3; closer Andrew Miller finished 
the game for the Yankees in a nail-biting fashion, striking out Troy Tulowitzki 
on a slider after a 12-pitch at bat. This also stopped the Blue Jays' 11 
game win streak.[55] By the end of August 23, the lead was lost to the 
Jays once again after the Yankees lost three out of four games at home 
against the Cleveland Indians.[56] This series also saw CC Sabathia suffer 
a knee injury that was declared as possibly season-ending with Sabathia 
on the DL.[57] After walking off against the Houston Astros in the first 
game at home during a series starting on August 24, the Yankees became 
tied with the Jays in 1st place in the AL East after Toronto took an off-day. 
On August 25, the Yankees lost 15-1 to the Astros and lost first place 
once again to the Blue Jays, who became the first American League East 
team to win 70 wins.[58][59] On August 28, the Yankees routed the Atlanta 
Braves at Turner Field 15–4 and gained their 70th win of the season.[60] 
They finished the month with 14 wins and 14 losses. Mark Teixeira, who 
bruised his bone on his shin in August, was announced to be out for the 
rest of season after an MRI scan showed he had in fact fractured it.[61] 
Nathan Eovaldi's regular season ended after suffering an elbow injury.[62] 
The Yankees finished September with a record of 14–14. On October 1, the 
Yankees clinched a playoff spot for the first time since 2012 with a 4–1 
win over the Boston Red Sox. This was also their 10,000th franchise victory.[63] 
The Yankees finished October with 1 win and 3 losses. Their final season 
record was 87–75, which was good enough to win the first American League 
Wild Card spot, earning the right to host the Houston Astros at Yankee 
Stadium on Tuesday, October 6. However, a day prior, CC Sabathia left the 
team as he checked himself into an alcohol rehabilitation center.[64] It 
was later announced by the Yankees that Sabathia would not be with the 
team during the postseason. The Yankees were shut out 3–0 in the 2015 American 
League Wild Card Game by the Houston Astros, in a contest that turned on 
two solo home runs against the game's losing pitcher Masahiro Tanaka, hit 
by Houston's Carlos Gómez and Colby Rasmus. The winning pitcher was Dallas 
Keuchel who tossed six scoreless innings.[65] Infielders Coaches Note:
