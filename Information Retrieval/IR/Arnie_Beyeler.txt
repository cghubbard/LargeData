Arnold H. Beyeler (born February 13, 1964) is an American professional 
baseball manager and former Major League coach. In 2016 he will manage 
the New Orleans Zephyrs of the Pacific Coast League (PCL), the Triple-A 
affiliate of the Miami Marlins.[1] Previously, he spent three seasons (2013–15) 
as first-base and outfield coach of the Boston Red Sox, winning a 2013 
World Series ring. During that season, Beyeler helped veteran centerfielder 
Shane Victorino convert to right field, a notoriously difficult position 
at Boston's home stadium, Fenway Park. When Victorino won a 2013 Gold Glove 
for defensive excellence, he invited Beyeler to the off-season awards ceremony 
in New York as his guest.[2] During 2014–15, Beyeler converted infielders 
Mookie Betts and Brock Holt into outfielders; Betts became the Red Sox' 
regular centerfielder in 2015 and won a Gold Glove as a right fielder (and 
the Wilson Defensive Player of the Year Award) in 2016.[3] But veteran 
shortstop Hanley Ramírez' conversion to leftfielder was a disaster in 2015,[4] 
and Boston released Beyeler on October 4, 2015.[5][6] In 2016, Beveler 
spent his 13th season as a manager, his first in the Marlins' system. Before 
being appointed to Boston's coaching staff in November 2012,[7] he was 
the pilot of the Triple-A Pawtucket Red Sox of the International League, 
the Red Sox' top-level minor league affiliate, from 2011–12.[8] Beyeler 
previously had served for four seasons (2007–10) as skipper of the Portland 
Sea Dogs of the Eastern League, the Red Sox' Double-A farm club.[9] In 
his two years as manager of the Pawtucket Red Sox, Beyeler led the team 
to an International League North Division title in 2011 and its third Governors' 
Cup championship in 2012. Beyeler, a native of Moab, Utah, graduated from 
Grand County High School, Lamar Community College, and Wichita State University, 
where he played varsity baseball and majored in communications. A second 
baseman and shortstop in professional baseball, he threw and batted right-handed, 
and stood 5 feet 9 inches (1.75 m) tall and weighed 195 pounds (88 kg). 
Beyeler played six seasons (1986–91) in the Detroit Tigers farm system, 
compiling a batting average of .254 with 69 stolen bases in 584 games played, 
including 29 games with the Triple-A Toledo Mud Hens in 1991.[10] After 
his retirement as an active player, Beyeler began his off-field career 
as a Florida-based area scout for the Tigers (1992–96). He then spent three 
seasons, 1997–99, in the New York Yankees organization as a batting and 
infield coach for the Double-A Norwich Navigators and the Triple-A Columbus 
Clippers. In 2000 he joined the Red Sox system for the first time as manager 
of the Lowell Spinners (2000–01) of the Short Season-A New York–Penn League 
and the Augusta GreenJackets (2002) of the Class A South Atlantic League. 
When an ownership change in Boston resulted in a turnover of the player 
development department, Beyeler departed for the Texas Rangers organization, 
managing the Stockton Ports (2003–04) and the Bakersfield Blaze (2005) 
of the Class A California League. He then spent the 2006 campaign as batting 
coach for the Mobile BayBears, the Double-A Southern League affiliate of 
the San Diego Padres, before his return to the Boston organization as Portland's 
manager in 2007.[11] Through 2016, in 13 years as a minor league manager, 
Beyeler has compiled a record of 871 wins and 826 losses (.513). His 2016 
Zephyrs finished third overall in the PCL American Southern Division, with
