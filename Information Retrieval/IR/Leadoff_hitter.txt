In baseball, a leadoff hitter is a batter who bats first in the lineup. 
It can also refer to any batter who bats first in an inning. Leadoff hitters 
must possess certain traits to be successful: they must reach base at a 
proficient on-base percentage rate and be able to steal bases. Sabermetric 
analysis has indicated that the ability to steal bases is often an overrated 
quality of leadoff hitters; however, the leadoff hitter should still take 
a large lead at first and draw a throw from the pitcher. This is useful 
because it shows the team the pitcher's pick-off move. Many managers also

counts, to give their teammates a feel for the opposing pitcher, as well 
as raising his pitch count. Another job, often unknown and unappreciated, 
is also the responsibility of the leadoff hitter. In the National League, 
after the pitcher bats (he usually drops a sacrifice bunt), the next hitter 
is usually the first man in the lineup. His responsibility is to take his 
time walking to the plate so the pitcher doesn't have to run back to the 
dugout, which would waste energy and risk unwanted injury. Also, because 
the leadoff hitter is first in the lineup cycle of batters, he will usually 
be the player who at least ties for most plate appearances per game on
