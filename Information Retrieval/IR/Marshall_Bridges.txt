Marshall Bridges (June 2, 1931 – September 3, 1990) was an American professional 
baseball player who pitched in the Major Leagues from 1959 to 1965 for 
the St. Louis Cardinals, Cincinnati Reds, New York Yankees and Washington 
Senators. A strong left-handed pitcher blessed with an excellent fastball, 
Bridges broke into the majors with St. Louis in 1959, posting a 6–3 won/lost 
record and a 4.26 earned run average, striking out 76 hitters in 76 innings. 
Used almost exclusively as relief pitcher throughout his seven-season career, 
Bridges' best season came in 1962 while a member of the Yankees, anchoring 
the world champions' relief staff while recording a team-leading 18 saves 
to go with an 8–4 record and a 3.14 earned run average. However, that same 
season he also became the first American League pitcher to give up a World 
Series grand slam home run when Chuck Hiller of the San Francisco Giants 
got hold of one in Game 4. One of the era's most colorful characters, Bridges' 
nickname, as recorded in the Baseball Encyclopedia was "Sheriff". He was 
known as a teller of tall tales and an instigator or victim of elaborate 
practical jokes. During 1963 spring training in a Fort Lauderdale, Florida, 
bar, a disagreement between Bridges and a female patron resulted in her 
shooting him in the leg. The resulting negative publicity annoyed the image-conscious 
Yankee brass and may have been a major factor in them selling his contract 
to last-place Washington on November 30, 1963. His recovery from the gunshot 
wound was apparently complete, but Bridges never regained the dominance 
that he had shown in 1962. The 1965 Senators were Bridges' last stop in 
his major league career. His lifetime totals include a won/lost record 
of 23–15, 25 saves, an ERA of 3.75 and 302 strikeouts in 345+ innings pitched. 
Bridges died of cancer on September 3, 1990, at the age of 59 at the University
