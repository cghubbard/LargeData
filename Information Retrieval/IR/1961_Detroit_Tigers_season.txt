The 1961 Detroit Tigers won 101 games but finished in second place, eight 
games behind the Yankees. The team's 1961 record tied the 1934 Tigers team 
record of 101 wins, and only twice in team history have the Tigers won 
more games: 1968 (103 wins) and 1984 (104 wins). On January 1, the Tigers' 
home park, Briggs Stadium. was renamed Tiger Stadium. The 1961 Tigers were 
led by Norm Cash, Rocky Colavito, and Al Kaline. Cash won the AL batting 
title with a .361 batting average, and had 132 RBIs, and Colavito hit 45 
home runs and had 140 RBIs. Kaline led the AL with 41 doubles and finished 
second to Cash for the batting title with a .324 average. Frank Lary led 
the pitching staff with 23 wins. The 1961 Tigers' winning percentage ranks 
as the 6th best in team history. Catcher Dick Brown had his best two seasons 
with Detroit in 1961 and 1962. He hit 16 home runs in 1961, including back-to-back-to-back 
home runs with Norm Cash and Steve Boros on May 23, 1961. He hit a grand 
slam less than one month earlier on April 29, 1961. Brown shared catching 
duties with rookie Mike Roarke who played in 86 games and hit .223 with 
2 home runs and 22 RBIs. Roarke was a 30-year-old rookie in 1961. Roarke 
graduated from Boston College in 1952 where he was captain of the football 
and baseball teams in his senior season.[3] Brown appeared in 91 games 
at catcher in 1961, and Roarke in 85. First baseman Norm Cash was the hitting 
star for the 1961 Tigers. He won the AL batting crown with a .361 average 
and also led the league with a .488 on-base percentage and 193 hits. He 
was also among the league leaders with 41 home runs (6th in the AL), 132 
RBIs (4th in the AL), 119 runs scored (4th in the AL), 124 walks (2nd in 
the AL), 354 total bases (2nd in the AL), and a .662 slugging average (2nd 
in the AL). He also led the AL in putouts in 1961. While Cash's performance 
was overshadowed by the 61 home runs of Roger Maris, his .361 average would 
be the highest by any major league player in the 1960s. Cash was 4th in 
the MVP voting. Cash later admitted to using an illegal corked bat during 
the 1961 season, demonstrating how he had drilled a hole in his bats and 
filled it with a mixture of sawdust, cork and glue. His 1961 statistics 
turned out to be career highs which he rarely approached again – in later 
years, he never reached 100 runs or 100 RBI, and never batted above .283. 
His 118-point drop to a .243 average in 1962 was the largest ever by a 
batting champion. Cash later said of the 1961 season: "It was a freak. 
Even at the time, I realized that. Everything I hit seemed to drop in, 
even when I didn't make good contact. I never thought I'd do it again."[citation

seasons from 1960 to 1962. In 1960, he led American League shortstops with 
34 errors. After six seasons in which he never hit more than 6 home runs, 
Fernández hit 20 home runs and 59 RBIs for the Tigers in 1962. Second baseman 
Jake Wood was the Tigers' starting second baseman from 1961 to 1963. 1961 
was his rookie season, and he led the AL in triples with 14 and in strikeouts 
with 141. He was also third in the AL in stolen bases with 30. Third baseman 
Steve Boros signed a bonus contract with the Detroit Tigers in 1957. He 
was named the most valuable player of the Class AAA American Association 
in 1960 after he tied for the lead in runs batted in with 119. In his first 
full MLB season, 1961, Boros appeared in 116 games for the Tigers as a 
third baseman and hit .270 with 62 runs batted in. It was his best season, 
but was cut short when he collieded with Frank Lary and broke his collarbone. 
Left fielder Rocky Colavito came to the Tigers in 1960 in a trade for Harvey 
Kuenn, who had won the 1959 batting title. The trade proved to be a good 
one for the Tigers. In 1961 with the Tigers, Colavito enjoyed career highs 
of 45 home runs, 140 RBI and 129 runs scored as the team led the major 
leagues in scoring. Colavito placed eighth in the MVP race, but Tiger fans 
didn't take to him.[citation needed] Sportswriter Joe Falls, who viewed 
Colavito as a "self-ordained deity,"[citation needed] started a feature 
chronicling the runs he failed to drive in. In one game, Falls – acting 
as the official scorer – charged Colavito with a controversial error, and 
the outfielder tried to attack him.[citation needed] And on May 12, 1961, 
he was ejected from the game after climbing into the stands to go after 
a drunken fan who had been harassing his wife and father.[citation needed] 
After his excellent 1961 season, he drew the local fans' criticism by holding 
out for a higher salary than established team star Al Kaline.[citation 
needed] He was traded to the Athletics after the 1963 season. Center fielder 
Bill Bruton put in a strong performance as the Tigers' center fielder. 
His range factor of 2.67 was far above the league average of 1.98. Bruton 
played in 160 games for the 1961 Tigers, scored 99 runs, collected 153 
hits, and had 17 home runs, 63 RBIs, 22 stolen bases and a .257 batting 
average. Right fielder Al Kaline finished second in the AL with a .324 
batting average and led the league with 41 doubles. Kaline also had 19 
home runs, 82 RBIs, 116 runs scored, finished 9th in the AL MVP voting, 
and won a Gold Glove award for his fine performance in right field. Frank 
Lary was 23–9 in 1961, leading the team in wins and finishing second in 
the AL behind Whitey Ford. He also won a Gold Glove award in 1961, led 
the AL with 22 complete games, threw a one-hitter, appeared in the All 
Star Game, finished 7th in the AL MVP voting, was 3rd in the AL Cy Young 
voting. Known as "The Yankee Killer", Lary had a career record of 27–13 
against the Yankees, including a 13–1 run from 1958 to 1959. Future Hall 
of Famer Jim Bunning went 17–11 for the Tigers in 38 games in 1961. He 
was chosen for the AL All-Star team and was among the AL leaders with a 
3.19 ERA (7th best in AL), 17 wins (4th best in AL), 194 strikeouts (3rd 
in AL), 12 complete games (4th in AL), and 4 shutouts (3rd in AL). Don 
Mossi pitched the greatest season of his career in 1961, going 15–7 with 
a 2.96 ERA. Nicknamed "The Sphinx" and "Ears", baseball historian Bill 
James dubbed Mossi "The Man Who Invented Winning Ugly." James wrote: "Mossi's 
ears looked as if they had been borrowed from a much larger species, and 
reattached without proper supervision. His nose was crooked, his eyes were 
in the wrong place, and though he was skinny he had no neck to speak of, 
just a series of chins that melted into his chest. . . . Don Mossi was 
the complete five-tool ugly player. He could run ugly, hit ugly, throw 
ugly, field ugly and ugly for power." [4] The Tigers #4 starter Paul Foytack 
played 10 seasons for the Tigers (1953, 1955–63) and is best known for 
giving up the longest home run in Tigers Stadium history—a 1960 blast by 
Mickey Mantle that landed in the Brooks lumberyard across Trumbull Avenue 
from the stadium. In 1961, Foytack was 11–10 with a 3.93 ERA. Relief pitcher 
Phil Regan became known as "The Vulture" because of his skill as a closer. 
In 1961, Regan was 10–7 in 32 games (16 as a starter, 16 in relief). He 
pitched 120 innings with a 5.25 ERA. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9]
