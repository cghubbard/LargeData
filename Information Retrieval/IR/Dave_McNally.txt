David Arthur "Dave" McNally (October 31, 1942 – December 1, 2002) was a 
Major League Baseball left-handed starting pitcher from 1962 until 1975. 
He was signed by the Baltimore Orioles and played with them every season 
except for his final season with the Montreal Expos.[1] McNally is the 
only pitcher in Major League history to hit a grand slam in a World Series 
game (Game 3, 1970, a 9–3 victory). The bat (lent to him by teammate Curt 
Motton) and ball are in the National Baseball Hall of Fame Museum in Cooperstown, 
New York. McNally is also part of World Series history for his (and his 
pitching mates') performance in the 1966 World Series, which the Orioles 
swept over the defending champion Los Angeles Dodgers. In the fourth game, 
he and Don Drysdale matched four-hitters; one of Baltimore's hits was Frank 
Robinson's fourth-inning home run for a 1–0 Oriole victory. McNally's shutout 
capped a World Series in which Baltimore pitchers set a Fall Classic record 
by pitching 33 1⁄3 consecutive shutout innings, beginning with Moe Drabowsky's 
6 1⁄3 scoreless innings in relief of McNally in Game One, followed by shutouts 
from Jim Palmer and Wally Bunker. Ironically, the trio had pitched one 
shutout total during the regular season—that by McNally on August 6 against 
the Washington Senators. He won more than 20 games for 4 consecutive seasons 
(1968 through 1971) and was one of four 20-game winners for the 1971 Orioles 
(Pat Dobson, Jim Palmer, and Mike Cuellar were the other three). He was 
the only pitcher other than Roger Clemens to win 12 decisions in a row 
3 times, including 17 consecutive at one time. After winning the last 2 
decisions of the 1968 season, he opened the 1969 season with a 15–0 record. 
On September 28, 1974, McNally gave up Al Kaline's 3,000th career hit. 
In an article in 1976 in Esquire magazine, sportswriter Harry Stein published 
an "All Time All-Star Argument Starter", consisting of five ethnic baseball 
teams. Because of space limitations the Irish team, including McNally as 
left-handed pitcher, was omitted. He is also known for his role in the 
historic 1975 Seitz decision which led to the downfall of major league 
baseball's reserve clause and ushered in the current era of free agency. 
McNally and Andy Messersmith were the only two players in 1975 playing 
on the one year reserve clause in effect at the time. Neither had signed 
a contract at the time but both were held with their team under the rule. 
The two challenged the rule and won their free agency. McNally retired 
after the 1975 season and had no intention of claiming his free agency. 
According to John Helyar's book The Lords of the Realm, players union executive 
director Marvin Miller called McNally—technically still an unsigned player—to 
ask him to add his name to the grievance it had filed in opposition to 
the reserve clause and he agreed. The reason Miller thought of McNally, 
Helyar wrote, was "insurance" in the grievance in the event Andy Messersmith 
decided to sign a new contract after all. Baseball owners wanted his name 
off the grievance so the Expos offered McNally a $25,000 ($110,127 today) 
signing bonus and a $125,000 ($550,634 today) contract if he made the team, 
but McNally declined. The hope was to sign Messersmith at the same time, 
thus eliminating the challenge. After retiring McNally owned car dealerships 
in Billings, Montana. He lived in his hometown of Billings, Montana, until 
his death from lung cancer on December 1, 2002. He was buried at Yellowstone
