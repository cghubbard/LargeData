As player As manager Bradley David "Brad" Ausmus (/ˈɔːsməs/; born April 
14, 1969) is a former catcher in Major League Baseball, and the current 
manager of the Detroit Tigers. He has also previously managed the Israel 
national baseball team. A 1987 draft pick of the New York Yankees, he chose 
to alternate between attending Dartmouth College and playing minor league 
baseball. He then had an 18-year major league playing career with the San 
Diego Padres, Detroit Tigers, Houston Astros, and Los Angeles Dodgers. 
During his playing days he was an All Star in 1999, a three-time Gold Glove 
Award winner (2001, '02, and '06), and won the 2007 Darryl Kile Award "for 
integrity and courage".[1][2][3] A five-time league-leader at catcher in 
fielding percentage, he also led the league twice each in range factor 
and in percentage caught stealing, and once each in putouts and assists.[4][5] 
He finished his career in 2010 ranked third in major league history with 
12,839 putouts as a catcher (trailing only Iván Rodríguez and Jason Kendall), 
seventh in games caught with 1,938, and 10th in both range factor/game 
(7.12) and fielding percentage (.994). He also ranked first all-time among 
all Jewish major leaguers in career games played (1,971), fifth in hits 
(1,579), and eighth in runs batted in (607; directly behind Mike Lieberthal).[6][7][8][9] 
He was inducted into the National Jewish Sports Hall of Fame in 2004.[10] 
He worked in the Padres' front office as a special assistant from 2010 
to 2013. On November 3, 2013, Ausmus became the 38th manager in the history 
of the Detroit Tigers, succeeding Jim Leyland. Ausmus is Jewish, and was 
born in New Haven, Connecticut.[11][12][13] His mother, Linda Susan (née 
Dronsick), is Jewish, and his father, Harry Jack Ausmus, is Protestant.[14][15] 
His father is a retired professor of European history at Southern Connecticut 
State University, and the author of A Schopenhauerian Critique of Nietzsche's 
Thought, which Ausmus calls his "favorite book."[16] Ausmus' mother is 
Jewish, but he was not raised in the Jewish religion.[17] Nonetheless, 
he still takes pride in his heritage. Ausmus stated in an interview with 
the Jewish Journal: "I wasn't raised with the Jewish religion, so in that 
sense I don't really have much feeling toward it. But, however, in the 
last 10 or so years, I have had quite a few young Jewish boys who will 
tell me that I am their favorite player or they love watching me play or 
they feel like baseball is a good fit for them because it worked for me 
or it worked for Shawn Green or other Jewish players at the major league 
level. It has been a sense of pride. If you can have a positive impact 
on a kid, I'm all for it."[18] In 2001 he did not play on Yom Kippur, the 
Jewish Day of Atonement, quipping that he "was trying to atone for my poor 
first half."[19] Ausmus was the manager of the Israeli team at the 2013 
World Baseball Classic. The Classic's rules permit non-Israeli citizens 
of Jewish heritage to play for the Israeli team. Ausmus and his wife, Liz, 
were married in 1995. They live in New Haven, Connecticut, and have two 
daughters, Sophie and Abigail.[20] Ausmus was a star in baseball at Cheshire 
High School; as a freshman he was a teammate of National Hockey League 
defenseman Brian Leetch, who was then a pitcher on the school's Connecticut 
state championship team in 1984.[5] As a sophomore Ausmus played shortstop 
and batted .327. As a junior (when his coach moved him to catcher) he hit 
.436, and as a senior he hit .411 and was named the Cheshire Area High 
School Player of the Year.[21] He was named to the All-State team both 
his junior and senior years.[22] Ausmus was also a standout athlete in 
high school as a basketball guard.[23] Academically, Ausmus scored a 1220 
on his SAT exam.[24] Ausmus chose an unusual route to the major leagues. 
He initially refused to sign with the New York Yankees after the 1987 draft 
in which the team picked him in the 47th round, instead choosing to pursue 
another childhood dream, that of attending Dartmouth College.[5][25] The 
Yankees allowed him to attend classes at the Ivy League school while playing 
in the minor leagues during his off terms.[26] (Dartmouth has a quartered 
academic calendar, which allowed Ausmus some flexibility.) Given NCAA rules 
barring paid professional athletes from playing college sports, Ausmus 
could not play for the Dartmouth Big Green, and instead served as a volunteer 
coach and bullpen catcher. He graduated in 1991 with an A.B. in Government, 
and was a member of Chi Gamma Epsilon fraternity and the Sphinx Senior 
Society. While at Dartmouth, the lowest grade he received was a B.[27] 
College graduates are uncommon in major league baseball, with only 26 players 
and managers with four-year degrees in 2009.[28] In 2005, Ausmus became 
the first Ivy League catcher to play in the World Series since Dartmouth's 
Chief Meyers in 1916.[29] Ausmus was also one of six Ivy Leaguers on major 
league rosters at the beginning of the 2009 season.[30] In 2010, The Sporting 
News named him the ninth-smartest athlete in sports.[24] Though Ausmus 
was not drafted until the 47th round of the 1987 draft, he played in MLB 
longer than any of the 1,150 players drafted ahead of him did.[31] Ausmus 
spent five years in the Yankees' minor league system with the Gulf Coast 
Yankees (1988), Oneonta Yankees (1988–89), Prince William Cannons (1990–91), 
Albany-Colonie Yankees (1991–92) and Columbus Clippers (1992). He was subsequently 
selected by the Colorado Rockies with the 54th pick of the 1992 expansion 
draft. He spent less than a year in the Colorado organization (with the 
Colorado Springs Sky Sox) before he was traded to the San Diego Padres 
with Andy Ashby and Doug Bochtler for Bruce Hurst and Greg Harris in July 
1993. He made his major league debut two days later, when he started for 
the Padres against the Chicago Cubs, and had a single in three at bats.[32] 
In 1995 he batted .293, a career best, and stole 16 bases (the most by 
any catcher since Craig Biggio stole 19 in 1991). Within three years, Ausmus 
was on the move again. In June 1996, after 149 at bats in which he batted 
just .181, the Padres traded him, Andújar Cedeño and minor leaguer Russ 
Spear to the Detroit Tigers for John Flaherty and Chris Gomez. As of 2010, 
Ausmus was second among the Padres' all-time catchers stolen bases, fourth 
in hits, and fifth in games played.[3] Despite bouncing back somewhat in 
Detroit, hitting .248, Ausmus was again traded in December 1996, along 
with José Lima, Trever Miller, C. J. Nitkowski, and Daryle Ward, to the 
Houston Astros for Doug Brocail, Brian Hunter, Todd Jones, Orlando Miller, 
and cash. This marked the first of three times Ausmus would be exchanged 
between the two teams. In January 1999 he was traded by the Astros with 
C. J. Nitkowski to the Tigers for Paul Bako, Dean Crow, Brian Powell, and 
minor leaguers Carlos Villalobos and Mark Persails. Generally considered 
light-hitting but sure-handed, Ausmus had his best offensive season in 
1999 at the age of 30, when he batted .275 and set career highs in on-base 
percentage (.365) and slugging percentage (.415), and made the All-Star 
team. He was hit by pitches 14 times, sixth in the league and a career 
high. Ausmus batted leadoff for the Tigers seven times, the first catcher 
since Bruce Kimm in 1976 to do so. In December 2000, he was traded by the 
Tigers with Doug Brocail and Nelson Cruz to the Astros for Roger Cedeño, 
Chris Holt and Mitch Meluskey. In November 2003, he signed as a free agent 
with the Astros, and he did the same in December 2005. In 2004 he batted 
.308 against left-handers, and .364 in situations that were "late and close" 
(in the seventh inning or later, with the score tied or the tying run on 
base, at the plate, or on deck).[33] In 2005, he had more walks (51) than 
strikeouts (48). He batted .304 with two out and runners in scoring position. 
In 2006, Ausmus hit .230 and set a career high with nine sacrifice hits. 
In 2007, Ausmus batted .235, but was tied for second among all National 
League catchers with six stolen bases. He recorded his 100th career stolen 
base on July 27, becoming the 21st catcher all time to record that many 
steals.[34][35] Ausmus, lauded for his baseball smarts and highly regarded 
by teammates, was widely considered managerial material once his playing 
career ended.[36] "I have to keep him playing, because if he starts managing, 
he'll be better than me." "Yeah, but if he keeps playing me more, he may 
end up losing his job anyway".[37] Ironically, Garner was fired on August 
27. Ausmus won the 2007 Darryl Kile Award "for integrity and courage", 
presented annually by local chapters of the Baseball Writers' Association 
of America (BBWAA) to players on the Astros and St. Louis Cardinals.[1][2][3] 
In October 2007, Ausmus accepted a one-year, $2 million (plus incentives 
based on playing time) contract.[38] The Astros planned for Ausmus to play 
on a part-time basis and mentor J. R. Towles, who would catch the majority 
of the games. Were Towles to struggle, however, the Astros were prepared 
to turn to Ausmus.[34] In May 2008, Ausmus (along with Johnny Damon, Andruw 
Jones, and Derek Lowe) was one of only four active major league players 
who had played at least 10 years in the majors without ever going on the 
disabled list.[39] On May 13, 2008, Ausmus got his 1,500th career hit. 
He is one of only eight catchers in major league history to get 1,500 hits 
and steal at least 100 bases. In early June, with Towles batting only .145, 
the Astros optioned him to the minors and re-inserted Ausmus as a starter.[40] 
Towles was replaced by journeyman minor-leaguer Humberto Quintero. Towles 
eventually came back, but during the season Ausmus, at 39, made more starts 
behind the plate (61) than either Towles or Quintero.[41] In July, Ausmus 
played at Nationals Park, appearing in his 44th major league stadium. Among 
active players, only Chris Gomez (47), Gary Sheffield (47), and Ken Griffey, 
Jr. (45) had competed in more stadiums.[42] In August, he scored his 700th 
career run, becoming the 25th catcher to reach that mark.[43] Later in 
the month he said: "This will be my last year in Houston. It's just time 
to be closer to home."[44] He has a home in San Diego, which narrowed it 
down to the Padres (which had expressed interest in him),[45] Dodgers, 
and Angels. The Red Sox were also tempting, since Ausmus had a home near 
Boston, in Cape Cod.[46] On Sunday, Aug 24, the Astros played the NY Mets 
during the Mets International Heritage Week, an annual promotion. It happened 
to be Jewish Heritage Day, but though Ausmus is Jewish, he did not get 
to start the game. Ausmus had his only at bat during extra-innings, with 
the score at 4–4. Ausmus led off the 10th inning with his second homer 
of the season, and the Astros rallied for a 6–4 win.[47] Before his final 
game as an Astro on September 28, the team paid tribute to Ausmus with 
a humorous video. Ausmus went on to hit a 2-run home run in the 3rd inning 
of the game. Ausmus was Houston's all-time leader for catchers as of 2010 
with 1,259 games, 1,119 starts, 970 hits, and 415 runs.[48][49][50] On 
January 26, 2009, Ausmus agreed to a 1-year, $1 million deal (plus incentives) 
to be a back-up catcher for the Los Angeles Dodgers.[51] "There's no question 
he can be a manager", Joe Torre said. "He's a smart cookie, everybody knows 
that, and he has an engaging personality."[52] At the end of the season 
Torre had Ausmus manage the Dodgers for a game.[53] In 2009, Ausmus batted 
.295, including .333 with runners in scoring position, and .385 with 2 
out and runners in scoring position, while limited to a career-low 107 
at bats.[54] He had never been on the disabled list in his 17-year career, 
giving him the most consecutive seasons of not going on the DL among all 
active players.[55] Ausmus became a free agent after the 2009 season, and 
on January 26, 2010, he agreed to a one-year $850,000 salary deal (with 
total compensation guaranteed at $1 million) to return to the Dodgers for 
his 18th major league season.[55][56] The deal also included a mutual option 
for 2011 worth $1 million; if either Ausmus or the Dodgers declined the 
option, Ausmus would be paid $150,000. In 2010, Ausmus was the 5th-oldest 
player in the NL.[57] On April 10, 2010, he was placed on the disabled 
list for the first time in his 18-year career in the Majors.[58] He missed 
most of the season after having surgery in April to repair a lower back 
herniated disc, playing in only 21 games that season, and hitting .222.[59] 
Ausmus announced his retirement on October 3, 2010. Prior to 2009, Ausmus 
had played in the postseason five times, all with the Astros, including 
the 2005 World Series. In Game 4 of the 2005 National League Division Series 
against the Atlanta Braves, Ausmus homered with two outs in the bottom 
of the ninth inning to tie the game at 6–6 and send it to extra innings; 
the Astros went on to win in the 18th inning, in what was the longest postseason 
game in history. Ausmus caught 17 innings, as well as playing 1 inning 
at first base. "I feel like when they say I'm one of the smarter ballplayers, 
it's just their way of saying I don't hit very much."[60] Known as "a brilliant 
defensive catcher,"[61] "an incredibly smart catcher,"[62] and "one of 
the most respected game-callers and pitching-staff handlers" in the game,[41] 
In 2010, he was chosen as the ninth-smartest athlete in sports by Sporting 
News.[63][64][64] Ausmus has exhibited superior range at catcher than the 
league average each season in his career. He is known for his strong arm, 
quick release, nimble footwork, framing pitches deftly, and smart handling 
of pitchers, as well as being able to block pitches very well. While the 
vast majority of his games have been as a catcher, Ausmus has also played 
a handful of games at first base, second base, third base, and shortstop, 
all of them without making an error. He led NL catchers in putouts in 1994, 
with 683.[5] Ausmus nabbed a league-leading 39 opposing baserunners (41.9%) 
in 1995, second in the NL to Florida Marlins' Charles Johnson, and led 
the league's catchers with 14 double plays and 63 assists.[5] On August 
2, 1997, he was the first catcher to wear the FOX mini-camera, in a Houston-New 
York Mets game. In 1997, he had 16 double plays, a career best, and led 
the league in caught-stealing percentage (49.5%), as he threw out 46 of 
93 runners. In 1998, he finished second to Charles Johnson in the NL Gold 
Glove voting.[9] In 1999, he led the American League with a .998 fielding 
percentage. In 2000, he appeared in 150 games (leading the AL), starting 
140 (the most ever by a Detroit catcher). He led the league with 68 assists 
and 898 putouts, and threw out 30 of 74 baserunners attempting to steal 
(47.5%), second in the AL in that category. In 2001, he led the NL with 
a .997 fielding percentage and only one passed ball, had the second best 
caught-stealing percentage (47.7%) in the majors, and won the first of 
two consecutive National League Gold Gloves with the Astros. He led the 
league again with a .997 fielding percentage and an 8.40 range factor, 
while being charged with only two passed balls in 2002. In 2003, Ausmus 
had a .997 fielding percentage, for the third season in a row. He led the 
league with a .999 fielding percentage, 884 putouts, and 134 games caught 
in 2005.[9] Ausmus led the league again in a league-leading 138 games caught 
with a .998 fielding percentage (the fifth-best of any catcher ever at 
the time) and a 7.94 range factor, with a league-leading 929 putouts and 
only one passed ball, and won his third Gold Glove in 2006. That year he 
caught the second-most games ever by a catcher at the age of 37—only Bob 
Boone, with 147 games, caught more at that age.[9][65] He made his franchise-record 
eighth Opening Day start at catcher for the Astros in 2007, breaking a 
tie with Alan Ashby. On July 22 of that year, Ausmus passed Gary Carter 
to move into sole possession of second place in major league career putouts 
by a catcher. In addition, he passed Ted Simmons that day to take sole 
possession of 12th place all-time on the games caught list, with 1,772.[66] 
In 2007, he had the second-best fielding percentage (.995) and range factor 
(8.04) of all catchers in the NL, while being charged with only two passed 
balls. In 2008, the Astros named Ausmus as an "emergency infielder."[67] 
In April, he played second base in the ninth inning of a game, and later 
in the season he played first base and third base. In 2005, he even played 
an inning at shortstop.[68] Through 2008, Ausmus ranked ninth all-time 
in games caught (1,887) and starts at catcher (1,720).[69] Ausmus's 1,141 
games at catcher in that decade ranked second in the majors.[70] As of 
July 12, 2009, he was third all-time among catchers in fielding percentage.[71] 
Among active catchers with at least 600 games played, he finished the 2009 
season ranked tied for fourth with a .994 career fielding percentage behind 
Mike Redmond (.996), Joe Mauer (.996), and A. J. Pierzynski (.995).[49] 
He finished his career in 2010 ranked third in major league history with 
12,839 putouts as a catcher, trailing only Iván Rodríguez and Jason Kendall, 
seventh in games caught with 1,938, and 10th in both range factor/game 
(7.12) and fielding percentage (.994). For his career, he threw out 30.2% 
of potential basestealers.[3][9] On November 3, 2013, Ausmus was named 
the 38th manager in the history of the Detroit Tigers, succeeding Jim Leyland. 
In his first year as manager, Ausmus led the Detroit Tigers to a 90–72 
record, winning the American League Central division title.[72][73] The 
Tigers were ousted in that season's ALDS by the Baltimore Orioles, three 
games to none. In his second year as manager, Ausmus led the Tigers to 
a disappointing 74–87 record, finishing in last place in their division.[74] 
In his third season, Ausmus and the Tigers finished in second place in 
the AL Central division with an 86–75 record, 2.5 games out of the second 
postseason Wild Card spot. Shortly after the 2016 season concluded, the 
Tigers announced they would exercise the fourth year option on Ausmus' 
contract, keeping him as manager for the 2017 season.[75] As of games played 
on October 1, 2016 Ausmus managed the Israel national baseball team in 
the Qualification Round to the 2013 World Baseball Classic from May 2012 
through their series in September 2012.[77] Team Israel, under the Classic's 
rules, was entitled to have non-Israeli citizens of Jewish heritage play 
for the team.[78][79][80][81][82][83] Israel lost to Spain in extra innings 
in the Pool Finals, missing out on a spot in the World Baseball Classic.[84][85][86] 
Ausmus was inducted into the National Jewish Sports Hall of Fame in 2004.[87] 
"I have had quite a few young Jewish boys who will tell me that I am their 
favorite player, or they love watching me play or they feel like baseball 
is a good fit for them because it worked for me, or it worked for Shawn 
Green or other Jewish players at the Major League level", said Ausmus. 
"It has been a sense of pride. If you can have a positive impact on a kid, 
I'm all for it."[7] He appeared on the ballot for the National Baseball 
Hall of Fame and Museum 2016 election and earned zero votes.[88] Ruttman,

This chapter in Ruttman's oral history, based on a February 29, 2008 interview 
with Ausmus conducted for the book, discusses Ausmus's American, Jewish,
