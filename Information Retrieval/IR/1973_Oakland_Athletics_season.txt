The 1973 Oakland Athletics season involved the A's winning their third 
consecutive American League West title with a record of 94 wins and 68 
losses. The A's went on to defeat the Baltimore Orioles in the ALCS for 
their second straight AL Championship, and won the World Series in seven 
games over the New York Mets to take their second consecutive World Championship. 
The 1973 A's had three 20-game winners in Jim (Catfish) Hunter, Ken Holtzman 
and Vida Blue.[10] The A's were on the receiving end of some milestones 
as well. On July 3, Nolan Ryan struck out Sal Bando of the Athletics for 
the 1000th strikeout in his career.[11] On July 30, Jim Bibby threw the 
first no-hitter in Texas Rangers history as he no-hit the Athletics.[12] 
The Rangers won the game 6-0. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10]

after six innings, but the Orioles scored four in the seventh off Blue 
to tie the game; the key blow was a three-run home run by catcher Andy 
Etchebarren. Baltimore second baseman Bobby Grich broke the tie with a 
solo home run in the 8th inning, and the Orioles went on to win, 5-4. October 
11, 1973 at Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum In Game 5, Hunter pitched a 
5-hit shutout as the Athletics won, 3-0, and took the series 3 games to 
2. The Athletics' victory over the New York Mets in the 1973 Series was 
marred by Charlie O. Finley's antics. Finley forced Mike Andrews to sign 
a false affidavit saying he was injured after the reserve second baseman 
committed two consecutive errors in the 12th inning of the A's Game Two 
loss to the Mets. This would allow Manny Trillo, ineligible because he 
was not a member of the team on Sep 1, to be activated.[25] By demeaning 
Mike Andrews, Finley brought on open rebellion, the logical progression 
for a team that has never deluded itself about being a happy ship. The 
A's worked out at Shea with Andrews' No. 17 taped to their uniforms as 
a sign of sympathy with him. By then he was back home in Peabody, Massachusetts.[25] 
When other team members, manager Dick Williams, and virtually the entire 
viewing public rallied to Andrews' defense, Kuhn forced Finley to back 
down. Andrews entered Game 4 in the eighth inning as a pinch-hitter. As 
he walked to the on-deck circle the crowd of 54,817 at Shea Stadium spotted 
his No. 17 and commenced cheering.[25] He promptly grounded out, and Finley 
ordered him benched for the remainder of the Series. Andrews never played 
another major league game. Williams was so disgusted by the affair that 
he announced his resignation as Manager while the Series was still being 
played.[26] Finley retaliated by vetoing Williams' attempt to become manager 
of the Yankees. Finley claimed that since Williams still owed Oakland the 
last year of his contract, he could not manage anywhere else. Finley relented 
later in 1974 and allowed Williams to take over as manager of the California 
Angels. The A's won the World Series in seven games after rallying from 
a three games to two deficit. AL Oakland Athletics (4) vs. NL New York
