Hy Turkin (May 9, 1915 in New York, New York â€“ June 24, 1955) was a sportswriter 
best known for co-editing the first baseball encyclopedia. Turkin was born 
in New York, one of seven children. He joined the staff of the New York 
Daily News after graduating from Cooper Union in 1936 with a degree in 
electrical engineering. Turkin covered baseball, basketball, and track 
for the paper. A chance meeting with baseball researcher S.C. Thompson 
in 1944 led the two to collaborate on what would become the first true 
baseball encyclopedia. Published by A.S. Barnes in 1951, the book contained 
a complete listing of every man who had played Major League Baseball, along 
with the years they had played, the teams they had played for, and some 
basic statistics. It was a remarkable contribution to the field of baseball 
history. The book earned the endorsement of Commissioner A.B. "Happy" Chandler, 
and nine revised editions were published after Turkin's death (the last 
in 1979). Turkin was one of the founders of the National Foundation for 
Muscular Dystrophy. He was married to the former Florence Kerr, and the 
couple had a daughter named Margery. Turkin died at the age of 40, following 
a six-month battle with liver disease. New York Times writer Arthur Daley 
described him as "a bustling little dynamo with an inquisitive turn of 
mind." There is a Little League baseball field called the Hy Turkin Memorial 
Field in Dongan Hills, Staten Island, New York. Following Turkin's death, 
the Metropolitan Basketball Writers Association named a new annual award 
after him. The Hy Turkin Memorial Award is given annually to professional
