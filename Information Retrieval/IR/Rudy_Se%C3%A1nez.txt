Rudy Caballero Seánez [Seh-ah-nez] (born October 20, 1968 in Brawley, California) 
is a former relief pitcher in Major League Baseball. Seanez, who is of 
Mexican American descent, was originally drafted by the Cleveland Indians 
in 1986.[1] He has made major league appearances for many teams between 
1989 and 2008, including the Cleveland Indians, San Diego Padres (four 
separate stints), Los Angeles Dodgers (twice), Atlanta Braves (twice), 
Texas Rangers, Boston Red Sox (twice), Kansas City Royals, Florida Marlins, 
and Philadelphia Phillies. He bats and throws right-handed. Seanez attended 
Brawley Union High School in Brawley, California, and was a letterman in 
football and baseball. He was drafted out of high school by the Cleveland 
Indians in the 4th round of the 1986 MLB draft. Seánez made his major league 
debut on September 7, 1989, for the Indians against the Toronto Blue Jays. 
He worked 2 scoreless innings in relief during the Indians 17-9 loss to 
the Blue Jays. Seánez' best season came in 2005 with the San Diego Padres. 
He posted a 7-1 record with a 2.69 ERA, setting career highs in wins (7), 
games pitched (57), innings (60.1) and strikeouts (84), while his 2.69 
ERA was his lowest since posting a 2.66 mark with the Dodgers in 1994. 
With only 22 walks issued, Seánez averaged nearly four strikeouts per walk. 
He limited opponents to a .222 batting average, including a .212 mark against 
right-handed hitters, and compiled a WHIP of 1.18. He also ranked second 
among National League relievers with 12.5 strikeouts per nine innings and 
tied for second in the league with seven relief wins. In a 16-season career, 
Seánez is 41-30 with 12 saves and a 4.12 ERA in 515 appearances, all in 
relief. Seánez showed ability to overcome numerous injuries, combining 
weightlifting with mixed martial arts during his off-season workout regimen.[2] 
Seánez also trained with professional Ultimate Fighting Championship fighters 
and sports several tattoos.[2][3] Seánez was an aggressive pitcher who 
challenged hitters with his 96 mile-per-hour fastball. His slider and changeup 
were also effective, and he was capable against batters from both sides 
of the plate. He did a better job than many middle relievers at holding 
on base runners, and was a competent fielder despite a history of back 
problems. In 2008, after 20 years in the big leagues, Seanez earned his 
first World Series ring as a member of the Philadelphia Phillies. He was 
not included on the club's postseason roster, but did travel with the team 
and was in uniform for all of the team's playoff games. On May 18, 2009, 
he passed a physical and signed a minor league deal to the Los Angeles 
Angels of Anaheim.[4] He was released on July 18. In November 2010, he 
retired from baseball. He currently owns Seanez Sports Academy. The 15,776 
square foot facility includes cages for batting and pitching. There is 
also an open area for agility training, and a sports performance gym.[5]
