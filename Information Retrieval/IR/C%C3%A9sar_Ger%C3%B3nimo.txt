César Francisco Gerónimo Zorrilla (born March 11, 1948), known as César 
Gerónimo, is a former outfielder in Major League Baseball, who was a member 
of the famed Big Red Machine of the Cincinnati Reds during the 1970s. He 
batted and threw left-handed. Gerónimo was born in El Seibo, Dominican 
Republic. His father was a driver for a car service, shuttling passengers 
on the three-hour drive from El Seibo to the capital of the Dominican Republic, 
Santo Domingo.[1] At age 14, César's parents sent him to school at a seminary 
with hopes that he would become a priest. However, his athletic prowess 
continued to develop, especially in basketball. He didn't start playing 
baseball until he was 17. Two years later in 1967, after watching him play 
on his father's softball team and seeing his prowess both pitching and 
hitting on the baseball diamond,[2] he was signed to a free agent contract 
by the New York Yankees.[3] The Yankees tried unsuccessfully to make Gerónimo 
a pitcher during his first professional season (1967). In spring training 
of 1968 he informed the Yankees that he wanted to end the pitching experiment, 
and later that year he was drafted out of the Yankees' minor league system 
in the Rule 5 Draft by the Houston Astros.[4] Gerónimo made his major league 
debut with the Astros at age 21 on April 16, 1969.[5] He notched his first 
career hit five days later in the ninth inning when, pinch-hitting for 
Jack Billingham, Gerónimo doubled off the Reds' Wayne Granger.[6] After 
the 1971 season, he went to the Cincinnati Reds in a blockbuster, eight-player 
deal along with, among others, Joe Morgan and Billingham. A winner of four 
consecutive Gold Glove Awards from 1974 to 1977, Gerónimo was an outstanding 
all-around defensive center fielder who combined speed and great range 
with a powerful arm. He was the starting centerfielder of Reds teams that 
won five divisional championships, three National League pennants and the 
1975-76 World Series Champion. In the 1975 World Series, he hit .280 with 
two home runs, but is best known for the iconic image of catching Carl 
Yastrzemski's fly ball for the final out of the World Series.[7] Gerónimo 
had his most productive season in 1976, with career-best totals in batting 
average (.307), hits (149), bases on balls (56), triples (11), stolen bases 
(22), and on-base percentage (.382). The following season he hit a career-high 
10 home runs.[8] He played the last three seasons of his career (1981-1983) 
in a reserve role with the Kansas City Royals. In his 15 Major League seasons, 
Gerónimo batted .258, with 51 home runs and 392 RBI, 460 runs scored, 977 
hits, 161 doubles, 50 triples and 82 stolen bases. He also held the dubious 
distinction of being the 3,000th strikeout victim of both Bob Gibson and 
Nolan Ryan.[9] "I was just in the right place at the right time," he joked.[10] 
After retiring, he worked for the Japanese Hiroshima Carp, as a coach in 
their Dominican baseball academy, and he has been on the board of trustees 
of the Dominican Republic Sports & Education Academy.[11] He currently 
resides with his family in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. In July 2008 
he was inducted into the Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame.[12] He continues 
to return to Cincinnati for the annual RedsFest, Big Red Machine reunions
