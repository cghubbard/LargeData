Brown, white           The Kansas City Cowboys were a National League baseball 
team that played one season in 1886. They played at Association Park and 
finished with a 30-91 record. They finished in seventh place, ahead of 
another new team, the Washington Nationals. They were not connected to 
the Union Association Cowboys. The Cowboys were admitted to the National 
League on a trial basis for the 1886 season.[1] The team went out of business 
in February, 1887, having been forced to sell its players back to the league 
for $6,000. They were replaced in the league by the Pittsburg Alleghenys,
