Michael Kendall Flanagan (December 16, 1951 – August 24, 2011)[1] was an 
American left-handed pitcher, front office executive, and color commentator. 
With the exception of four years with the Toronto Blue Jays (1987–90), 
he was with the Baltimore Orioles for his entire career in Major League 
Baseball (MLB). Flanagan was a starting pitcher for the Orioles from 1975 
through 1987. He was named to the American League (AL) All-Star Team once 
in 1978. The following year, the first of two times he would play on an 
AL pennant winner, his 23 victories led the circuit and earned him the 
league's Cy Young Award. He was a member of the Orioles' World Series Championship 
team in 1983. He returned to Baltimore to close out his playing career 
as a reliever in 1991 and 1992. During this second tour, he contributed 
to the most recent no-hitter thrown by the club. He was also the last Orioles 
pitcher to appear in a major-league contest at Memorial Stadium. In an 
18-season career, Flanagan posted a 167–143 record with 1491 strikeouts 
and a 3.90 ERA in 2770.0 innings pitched. He served in three different 
positions with the Orioles after his retirement as an active player. He 
was the pitching coach in 1995 and 1998 and the executive vice president 
of baseball operations from 2006 through 2008. At the time of his death, 
he was one of the team's broadcasters, a role he had previously held three 
times (1994, 1996–97, 1999–2002).[2] Born and raised in Manchester, New 
Hampshire, he was one of Ed and Lorraine Flanagan's four children and the 
younger of their two sons. Under the coaching of his father and grandfather 
Ed Sr., who both played in the Boston Red Sox organization, Flanagan once 
struck out 18 batters in a six-inning Little League game.[3][4] Flanagan 
graduated from Manchester (NH) Memorial High School, where he was on the 
baseball and basketball teams that each won consecutive New Hampshire Interscholastic 
Athletic Association (NHIAA) Class L titles in 1970 and 1971.[5] His pitching 
was limited in 1971 due to an arm injury he had sustained while playing 
American Legion Baseball for the local Henry J. Sweeney Post the previous 
summer.[6] This factored into him not signing a contract after he was picked 
by the Houston Astros in the 15th round (346th overall) of the 1971 Major 
League Baseball draft.[5][7] Flanagan attended the University of Massachusetts 
Amherst, where he played baseball in 1972 and 1973. He earned first team 
All-Yankee Conference and first team All-New England honors in 1973, after 
he compiled a 9–1 record with a 1.52 ERA and 91 strikeouts, to lead the 
team in all three categories. The nine wins and .900 winning percentage 
also set school single-season records at the time. Flanagan had a career 
ERA of 1.19 and a career winning percentage of .923 (12–1), which are both 
still the best marks in school history.[8] He also played in the outfield 
while at UMass, hitting .320 with six homers and 29 RBIs in 128 career 
at-bats. Flanagan also played freshman basketball at UMass, where he crossed 
paths with Julius Erving.[9] Flanagan said, "I really didn’t know much 
about Dr. J until I came down on a fast break and pulled up to take a jump 
shot. Dr. J was nowhere in the area but, out of nowhere, he blocked the 
shot and nine players were running the other way. First thing I thought? 
Better work on my slider, because this is a whole different level of play."[9] 
He received his degree from the UMass School of Education in 1975, and 
he was inducted into the UMass Athletic Hall of Fame in 2000.[10] He was 
a pitcher and outfielder for the Falmouth Commodores in the Cape Cod Baseball 
League (CCBL) during the summer of 1972. He had a 7–1 record and a 2.18 
earned run average (ERA), while batting .286 with seven home runs. He was 
a member of the CCBL's inaugural Hall of Fame class in 2000.[11] Flanagan 
was selected again in the 1973 MLB draft, this time by the Baltimore Orioles 
in the 7th round (159th overall).[12] When he signed with the Orioles, 
the ballclub agreed to finance the remainder of his college education.[3] 
He progressed through the organization, with stops in Miami (1973–74), 
Asheville (1974) and Rochester, where he went 13–4 with a 2.50 ERA in 1975.[13] 
His experience in the major leagues began with two appearances as a September 
call-up in 1975.[14] In his MLB debut on September 5, he pitched 1⅔ innings 
in relief of starter Wayne Garland in a 5–4 victory at home over the New 
York Yankees in the opener of a twi-night doubleheader.[15] His first decision 
was a 3–2 loss to the same opponent at Shea Stadium in the nightcap of 
another twin bill on September 28. He was on the verge of a complete-game 
shutout until the bottom of the ninth when the first three batters he faced 
reached base and Dyar Miller allowed all of them to score.[16] Flanagan's 
1976 campaign was split between Rochester and Baltimore.[13][14] He did 
not get his first major-league win until a 7–1 complete-game triumph at 
home over the eventual AL West champion Kansas City Royals on September 
1.[17] He joined the Orioles' starting rotation in 1977, finishing with 
a 15–10 record."[18] One of the team's most dependable pitchers for the 
next nine years, Flanagan went to the All-Star Game in 1978 and won the 
Cy Young Award in 1979 with a record of 23–9 and an ERA of 3.08. On September 
17, 1980, Flanagan was called for a balk, which led to Earl Weaver's most 
infamous tirade on YouTube. Flanagan suffered two major injuries during 
his tenure with the Orioles, a knee injury in 1983, and a torn achilles 
tendon from a pick-up basketball game. His time between tours with the 
Orioles was spent with the Toronto Blue Jays, beginning on August 31, 1987 
when he was traded for Oswaldo Peraza. José Mesa was sent to Baltimore 
to complete the deal on September 4. The Blue Jays released Phil Niekro 
to make room for Flanagan on their roster.[19] Flanagan's finest performance 
with the Blue Jays took place at Tiger Stadium in the penultimate game 
of the 1987 regular season on October 3.[20] With Toronto in a first-place 
tie with the Detroit Tigers and having lost its last five contests,[21] 
he outlasted Jack Morris by pitching eleven innings before departing with 
the match deadlocked at 2–2. The Blue Jays ended up losing the game 3–2 
one inning later and the AL East championship the following afternoon.[22] 
Morris said after the game, "Flanagan was so great, so competitive, that 
I considered my job to be survival – somehow keep us tied until he left 
the game. We weren't going to get to the playoffs beating him, we could 
only get there surviving him."[18] Flanagan's only postseason experience 
with the Blue Jays was a Game 4 start in the 1989 AL Championship Series 
on October 7. He pitched 4⅓ innings, giving up five runs and three homers. 
The only one not hit by Rickey Henderson, Jose Canseco's 480-foot (146.30 
meters) shot in the third inning, was the first ever to land in the top 
deck at SkyDome.[22][23] His final appearance with Toronto was a start 
that resulted in a 3–1 loss at home to the Tigers on May 4, 1990, as he 
surrendered all three runs in 4⅓ innings.[24] He was released on May 8.[25] 
His overall record with the Blue Jays was 26–27.[22] Returning as a free 
agent to Baltimore for the 1991 season, he pitched effectively that season 
as a reliever, including sharing a no-hitter with starter Bob Milacki, 
middle reliever Mark Williamson, and closer Gregg Olson.[26] After the 
1992 season, Flanagan retired from baseball. He served two stints each 
as a pitching coach and broadcaster for the Orioles. Flanagan was the Orioles' 
executive vice president of baseball operations. In recent years, positions 
in the Orioles' front office have been referred to by this title that would 
be known as general manager in other team organizations. However, with 
the appointment of Andy MacPhail as President of Baseball Operations, his 
responsibilities dwindled. According to Dave Johnson on the August 15, 
2009 episode of the Tom Davis Show, Flanagan's contract with the Orioles 
had ended in 2008 and he was no longer officially with the club. Flanagan's 
career as a color commentator on Orioles telecasts began with 20 contests 
on Home Team Sports (HTS) in 1994. His appointment by the network as the 
primary game analyst alongside Mel Proctor in early-January 1996 followed 
the controversial dismissal of John Lowenstein, an Orioles teammate of 
Flanagan's during their playing days.[27][28] He also teamed with Michael 
Reghi for a year before being succeeded by Rick Cerone prior to the 1998 
season.[29] He rejoined Reghi in the broadcast booth after replacing Cerone 
in 1999.[30] He continued in that capacity for four more seasons, during 
which HTS evolved into Comcast SportsNet Mid-Atlantic. He was followed 
behind the microphone by Buck Martinez in 2003.[31] He joined the Mid-Atlantic 
Sports Network (MASN) as the secondary analyst after Martinez became the 
Blue Jays' lead broadcaster on Rogers Sportsnet in 2010. Both he and Jim 
Palmer worked with rotating play-by-play announcers Gary Thorne and Jim 
Hunter.[32] Flanagan was noted for his sense of humor, especially when 
it involved using puns to create nicknames. In his baseball column in the 
Sunday issues of The Boston Globe during the late-1970s, Peter Gammons 
ran a regular feature called the Mike Flanagan Nickname of the Week. One 
example was John "Clams" Castino, which was a play on clams casino.[18] 
Another was "Mordecai Six Toe" Lezcano, based on Mordecai "Three Finger" 
Brown and given to Sixto Lezcano.[33] When the Blue Jays allowed Tony Solaita 
to sign with the Nippon-Ham Fighters after the 1979 campaign, he was dubbed 
"Tony Obsolaita".[18] During the 1980 season, Flanagan called himself "Cy 
Young", Jim Palmer "Cy Old", Steve Stone "Cy Present" and Scott McGregor 
"Cy Future." When Storm Davis, whose pitching motion resembled Palmer's, 
joined the Orioles two years later in 1982, he was "Cy Clone."[34] Flanagan 
added that pitchers became "Cy-bex" if they were injured and "Cy-onara" 
when they were no longer effective.[35] Two monikers that stuck were "Full 
Pack" and "Stan the Man Unusual", both of which coined for Don Stanhouse; 
the former nickname referred to the relief pitcher's causing manager Earl 
Weaver to smoke a full pack of cigarettes while Stanhouse was pitching, 
and the latter nickname was a play on "Stan the Man" Musial's nickname.[34] 
This nickname concept was later popularized by ESPN's Chris Berman, who 
was inspired by the feature in Gammons' column.[18] Flanagan's pitch selection 
included a slow curve, heavy sinker, fastball, and a changeup supposedly 
taught to him by Scott McGregor in 1979.[36] Flanagan's oldest daughter 
Kerry Ellen was the fourth American born through in vitro fertilization 
(IVF) and the first IVF baby not born by Caesarean section. She was born 
at the Greater Baltimore Medical Center on July 9, 1982. The conception 
had been performed at the Eastern Virginia Medical School.[37][38] When 
Flanagan's wife Alex did not hear from her husband on August 24, 2011, 
she called a neighbor to check on him. The neighbor went to the home and 
called 9-1-1 after failing to find him. Police discovered a body on the 
property but could not immediately determine the identity because the wounds 
were so severe.[39] The body was later identified as Flanagan, with the 
cause of death determined to be a self-inflicted shotgun wound to the head.[1][2] 
Police said that Flanagan was distressed about financial issues.[2][40] 
WBAL-TV reported that Flanagan was still despondent about perceived failures 
during his tenure in the Orioles' front office.[41] Approximately one year 
after her husband's death, Alex Flanagan told Dan Rodricks of the Baltimore 
Sun that her husband had struggled with depression for many years.[42] 
Since 2012, the Baltimore Orioles have kept his uniform number 46 out of 
circulation, with Jeremy Guthrie being the last player to wear Flanagan's
