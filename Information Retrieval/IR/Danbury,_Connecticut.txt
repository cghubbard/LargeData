Danbury is a city in northern Fairfield County, Connecticut, United States, 
approximately 70 miles from New York City. Danbury's population at the 
2010 census was 80,893.[1] Danbury is the fourth most populous city in 
Fairfield County, and seventh among Connecticut cities. The city is located 
within the New York metropolitan area. The city was named for the place 
of origin of many of the early settlers, Danbury, Essex, England, and is 
nicknamed the Hat City because of its prominent history in the hat industry. 
There is a mineral named for Danbury, danburite. Danbury is home to Danbury 
Hospital, Western Connecticut State University, Danbury Fair Mall and Danbury 
Municipal Airport. Danbury was settled by colonists in 1685, when eight 
families moved from what are now Norwalk and Stamford, Connecticut. The 
Danbury area was then called Pahquioque by its namesake, the Pahquioque 
Native Americans. One of the original settlers was Samuel Benedict, who 
bought land from the Paquioques in 1685, along with his brother James Benedict, 
James Beebe, and Judah Gregory. Also called Paquiack ("open plain" or "cleared 
land") by local Native Americans,[2] the settlers chose the name Swampfield 
for their town, but in October 1687, the general court decreed the name 
Danbury. The general court appointed a committee to lay out the boundaries 
of the new town. A survey was made in 1693, and a formal town patent was 
granted in 1702. During the American Revolution, Danbury was an important 
military supply depot for the Continental Army. On April 26, 1777, the 
British, under Major General William Tryon, burned and looted the city. 
The central motto on the seal of the City of Danbury is Restituimus (Latin 
for "We have restored"), a reference to the destruction caused by the Loyalist 
army troops. The American General David Wooster was mortally wounded at 
the Battle of Ridgefield by the same British forces which had attacked 
Danbury. He is buried in Danbury's Wooster Cemetery; the private Wooster 
School in Danbury also was named in his honor. In 1802, President Thomas 
Jefferson wrote a letter to the Danbury Baptist Association, a group expressing 
fear of persecution by the Congregationalists of that town, in which he 
used the expression "Separation of Church and State". It is the first known 
instance of the expression in American legal or political writing. The 
letter is on display at the Unitarian-Universalist Congregation of Danbury. 
The first Danbury Fair was held in 1821. In 1869, it became a yearly event; 
the last edition was in 1981. The fairgrounds were cleared to make room 
for the Danbury Fair Mall, which opened in autumn 1986.[3] In 1835, the 
Connecticut Legislature granted a rail charter to the Fairfield County 
Railroad, which saw no construction as investment was slow. In 1850, the 
organization's plans were scaled back, and renamed the Danbury and Norwalk 
Railroad. Work moved quickly on the 23 mi (37 km) railroad line. In 1852, 
it, the first railroad line in Danbury, opened,[4] with two trains making 
the 75-minute trip to Norwalk. The central part of Danbury was incorporated 
as a borough in 1822. The borough was reincorporated as the city of Danbury 
on April 19, 1889. The city and town were consolidated on January 1, 1965. 
The Kohanza Reservoir, one of many reservoirs built to provide water to 
the hat factories, broke on January 31, 1869. The ensuing flood of icy 
water killed 11 people within 30 minutes, and caused major damage to homes 
and farms.[5] Oglala Sioux tribesman Albert Afraid of Hawk died on June 
29, 1900, in Danbury during a tour with Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show at 
age 21. His interment was at Wooster Cemetery. Afraid of Hawk's remains 
were discovered by Robert Young, an employee of Wooster one hundred and 
twelve years later. The corpse covered in a bison robe was relocated to 
Saint Mark's Episcopal Cemetery in Rockyford for reburial by tribal descendants. 
A 60-acre (24 ha) tract near the Fairgrounds, known as Tucker's Field, 
was purchased by local pilots in 1928 and leased to the town. This became 
an airport, which is now Danbury Municipal Airport (ICAO: KDXR). Connecticut's 
largest lake, Candlewood Lake, was artificially created in 1929 where Wood 
Creek and the Rocky River meet near the Housatonic River. The land that 
is now the lake was owned and operated by Connecticut Light and Power Company 
as a hydroelectric power facility until sold for $9 million in June 2006. 
In the August 1988 issue of Money magazine, Danbury topped the magazine's 
list of the best U.S. cities to live in, mostly due to low crime, good 
schools, and location.[6] In 1780, what is traditionally considered to 
be the first hat shop in Danbury was established by Zadoc Benedict (although 
hat making existed in Danbury before the Revolution); it had 3 employees, 
and made 18 hats weekly.[7][8][9] By 1800, Danbury was producing 20,000 
hats annually, more than anywhere else in the U.S.[10] Due to the fur felt 
hat coming back into style for men and increasing mechanization in the 
1850s, by 1859 hat production in Danbury had risen to 1.5 million annually. 
By 1887, thirty factories were producing 5 million hats per year.[11] Around 
this time, fur processing was separated from hat manufacturing when the 
P. Robinson Fur Cutting Company (1884) on Oil Mill Road and the White Brothers' 
factory began operation.[10] By 1880, workers had unionized, beginning 
decades of labor unrest. Lockouts and strikes plagued the industry, affecting 
the economy of the entire town. In 1893, nineteen manufacturers locked 
out 4000 union hatters. In 1902, the American Federation of Labor union 
called for a nationwide boycott of a Danbury non-union hat manufacturer, 
Dietrich Loewe. The manufacturer sued the union under the Sherman Antitrust 
Act for unlawfully restraining trade. The U.S. Supreme Court, in 1908, 
held that the union was liable for damages. This also is known as the Danbury 
Hatters' case. In the '30's and '40's there were a number of violent incidents 
during several strikes, mostly involving scab workers.[12] Beginning in 
1892, the industry was revolutionized when the large hat factories began 
to shift to manufacturing unfinished hat bodies only, and supplying them 
to smaller hat shops for finishing. So while Danbury produced 24% of America's 
hats in 1904, the city supplied the industry with 75% of its hat bodies.[13] 
The turn of the century was the heyday of the hatting industry in Danbury, 
when it became known as the "Hat City" and the "Hatting Capitol of the 
World". Its motto was "Danbury Crowns Them All". But by the 1920s, the 
hat industry was in decline, and by 1923, only six manufacturers were left 
in Danbury. After WWII, returning GI's went hatless, a trend that accelerated 
through the 1950s, dooming the city's hat industry.[14] Stetson, the city's 
last major manufacturer, closed in 1965. The last hat was made in Danbury 
in 1987. During the Second World War, Danbury's prison was one of many 
sites used for the incarceration of conscientious objectors. One in six 
inmates in the United States' federal prisons was a conscientious objector, 
and prisons like Danbury found themselves suddenly filled with large numbers 
of highly educated men skilled in social activism. Due to the activism 
of inmates within the prison, and local laborers protesting in solidarity 
with the conscientious objectors, Danbury became one of the nation's first 
prisons to desegregate its inmates.[15][16][17] Main Street looking east

to the United States Census Bureau, Danbury has a total area of 44.3 square 
miles (115 km2), of which 42.1 square miles (109 km2) is land and 2.2 square 
miles (5.7 km2), or 4.94%, is water. The City is located in the foothills 
of the Berkshire Mountains on low-lying land just south of Candlewood Lake 
(the City includes the southern parts of the lake). Danbury borders Ridgefield 
to the southwest, Redding to the south, Bethel to the southeast, Brookfield 
to the northeast, New Fairfield to the north, and Southeast, New York to 
the west. The City's terrain includes rolling hills and not-very-tall mountains 
to the west and northwest called the Western Highland. Ground elevations 
in the City range from 378 feet to 1,050 feet above sea level.[18] A geologic 
fault known as Cameron's Line runs through Danbury. The Still River flows 
generally from west to east through Danbury. Danbury has a humid continental 
climate (Köppen Dfa), with four distinct seasons, resembling Hartford more 
than coastal Connecticut or New York City. Summers are hot and humid, while 
winters are cold with significant snowfall. The monthly daily average temperature 
ranges from 26.8 °F (−2.9 °C) in January to 73.9 °F (23.3 °C) in July; 
on average, temperatures reaching 90 or 0 °F (32 or −18 °C) occur on 18 
and 3.1 days of the year, respectively. The average annual precipitation 
is approximately 52.1 inches (1,320 mm), which is distributed fairly evenly 
throughout the year; snow averages 50 inches (127 cm) per season, although 
this total may vary considerably from year to year. Extremes in temperature 
range from 106 °F (41 °C) on July 22, 1926 and July 15, 1995 (the highest 
temperature recorded in Connecticut[19]) down to −18 °F (−28 °C) on February 
9, 1934. As of the census of 2010, there were 80,893 people and 29,046 
households in the City, with 2.73 persons per household. 44.1% of the population 
spoke a language other than English at home. The population density was 
1,921.4 people per square mile. There were 31,154 housing units at an average 
density of 740.0 per square mile. The racial makeup of the city was 68.2% 
White, 25.0% Hispanic or Latino, 7.2% African American, 0.40% Native American, 
6.8% Asian, less than 0.10% Pacific Islander, 7.6% from other races, and 
4.5% from two or more races. 32% of the population was foreign born. 6.7% 
of the population was under the age of 5, and 21.1% was under the age of 
18. 11.1% of the population was 65 years of age or older. 50.9% of the 
population was female. The median income for a household in the City was 
$65,981. The per capita income for the City was $31,411. 11.1% of the population 
was below the poverty line. The median gross monthly rent was $1,269. When 
ZIP codes were introduced in 1963, the 06810 code was given to all of Danbury; 
it was shared with a then-still-rural New Fairfield to its north. In 1984, 
the 06810 Zip Code was cut back to areas of Danbury south of Interstate 
84. A new 06811 ZIP code was created for areas north of Interstate 84. 
New Fairfield received its own code, 06812. According to the City's 2015 
Comprehensive Annual Financial Report,[27] the top employers in the City 
are: The chief executive officer of Danbury is the Mayor, who serves a 
two-year term. The current mayor is Mark D. Boughton (R). The Mayor is 
the presiding officer of the City Council, which consists of 21 members, 
two from each of the seven city wards, and seven at-large.[28] The City 
Council enacts ordinances and resolutions by a simple majority vote. If 
after five days the Mayor does not approve the ordinance (similar to a 
veto), the City Council may re-vote on it. If it then passes with a two-thirds 
majority, it becomes effective without the Mayor's approval. The current 
City Council consists of 15 Republicans and 6 Democrats.[28] Danbury has 
six state representatives as of 2016; Rep. Dan Carter D-2, Rep. Stephen 
Harding D-107, Rep. Richard Smith D-108, Rep. David Arconti D-109, Rep. 
Bob Godfrey D-110, and Rep. Jan Giegler R-138.[29][30] There is one state 
senator, Michael McLachlan R-24. Danbury is represented in the United States 
Congress by U.S. Rep. Elizabeth Esty (D). Danbury's 2015 mill rate is 28.26.[31] 
Danbury is the site of a low-security men's and women's prison, the Danbury 
Federal Correctional Institution, located near the border with New Fairfield.[32] 
Built in the 1940s to house men, the facility was converted to a women's 
prison in 1994 to address a shortage of beds for low-security female inmates 
in other facilities. However, overcrowding at federal facilities for low-security 
males prompted a reconversion to a male prison, beginning in 2013, and 
relocation of the female inmates from the low-security Pembroke Road facility 
to other locations.[33] As of 2016, an adjacent satellite camp houses up 
to 193 women.[32][34] Danbury has two public high schools: Danbury High 
School and Henry Abbott Technical High School, each which are for grades 
9 through 12. An alternative school by the name of Alternative Center for 
Excellence is housed off-campus, and its graduates receive Danbury High 
School diplomas upon completion of their studies.[35] Danbury also has 
3 public middle schools for grades 6 through 8: Broadview Middle School, 
Rogers Park Middle School and WestSide Middle School Academy.[36] There 
are 13 elementary schools in Danbury. These schools are Academy for International 
Studies Magnet School (K-5), Ellsworth Avenue (K-5), Great Plain (K-5), 
Hayestown (K-5), King Street Primary (K-3) and King Street Intermediate 
(4–5), Mill Ridge Primary (K-3), Morris Street (K-5), Park Avenue (K-5), 
Pembroke (K-5), Shelter Rock (K-5), South Street (K-5) and Stadley Rough 
(K-5).[37] Roman Catholic schools in Danbury reside within the administration 
of the Diocese of Bridgeport and include: Other parochial schools in Danbury 
are: Danbury is home to Western Connecticut State University, Ridley-Lowell 
Business & Technical Institute,[45] and a campus of Naugatuck Valley Community 
College[46] The Danbury Public Library was established in 1879.[citation 
needed] The Long Ridge Library is a small library occupying an old schoolhouse 
on Long Ridge Road in Danbury.[citation needed] The hat making fur removal 
process is known to be the source of serious pollution by mercury nitrate 
dumped into the Still River during the time of hat production in the late 
19th century, which then flowed into the Housatonic River and into the 
Long Island Sound.[8][49] The United Hockey League (UHL) expanded to Danbury 
in 2004. The Danbury Trashers played their first season at the Danbury 
Ice Arena in October 2004. Among those on the roster included Brent Gretzky 
(brother of hockey legend Wayne Gretzky) and Scott Stirling (son of former 
New York Islanders coach Steve Stirling). Scott's older brother, Todd, 
coached the Trashers in the 2004–05 season. On December 27, 2009, Danbury 
was named the first city to officially have a new team in the newly formed 
Federal Hockey League (FHL). The team was named the Danbury Whalers, bringing 
back the name "Whalers" to Connecticut for the first time since 1997 when 
Hartford Whalers of the WHA/NHL moved to North Carolina and became the 
Carolina Hurricanes. At the end of the 2014–15 season, the Danbury Ice 
Arena evicted the Danbury Whalers. The Whalers were announced as moving 
to neighboring Brewster, New York, and called the Stateline Whalers. However, 
a new FHL Danbury team called the Danbury Titans was approved for the 2015–16 
season, owned by local car dealership owner Bruce Bennett. As part of the 
approval of the new Danbury team, he took over the Stateline/Danbury market 
and created the Brewster Bulldogs instead of the Whalers (the Bulldogs 
folded after one season).[58] The Danbury Westerners, a member of the New 
England Collegiate Baseball League, play their home games at Rogers Park 
in Danbury. AC Connecticut is a soccer team based in the Danbury suburb 
of Newtown. The team plays in the Northeast Division of the USL Premier 
Development League (PDL), the fourth tier of the American soccer pyramid. 
Danbury High School carries a strong athletic tradition in wrestling, boys 
and girls track and field, boys cross country, baseball, tennis, basketball, 
and football. The wrestling, cross country, and track teams have all numerous 
state titles and New England championships. All three programs are considered 
to be nationally ranked annually. Western Connecticut State University 
is a member of the NCAA Division III, the Eastern College Athletic Conference, 
and the Little East Conference. The university fields teams in baseball, 
basketball, lacrosse, football, soccer, softball, swimming, tennis, and 
volleyball. WestConn also fields several nationally competitive club sports 
on campus including Men's Rugby, Women's Rugby, Dance Team, Cheerleading, 
and Men's Hockey. The Danbury Hatters Cricket Club formed in 2001 and has 
been playing cricket in Southern Connecticut along with other cities such 
as Norwalk, Stamford, Bridgeport, New Haven, Waterbury and West Haven. 
The Western Connecticut Militia is a semi-professional football team that 
joined the New England Football League in 2011. The team plays its home 
games in Danbury at both Danbury High School and Immaculate High School. 
Danbury is the terminus of the Danbury branch line of the MTA Metro-North 
Railroad which begins in Norwalk. The line was first built by the Danbury 
and Norwalk Railroad which was later bought by the New York, New Haven 
& Hartford Railroad Company. Danbury was an important junction between 
the Danbury Branch and the Maybrook Line. The Maybrook line was the New 
Haven's main freight line which terminated in Maybrook, New York, where 
the New Haven exchanged traffic with other railroads. After the ill-fated 
Penn Central took over the New Haven, the Maybrook line was shut down when 
a fire on the Poughkeepsie Bridge made the line unusable. Today, the historic 
station is part of the Danbury Railway Museum. The Providence and Worcester 
Railroad, along with the Housatonic Railroad provide local rail freight 
service in Danbury. Local bus service is provided by Housatonic Area Regional 
Transit (HART). The city is also the location of Danbury Municipal Airport 
(DXR). Interstate 84 and U.S. Route 7 are the main highways of the city. 
I-84 runs east-west from the Hudson Valley region of New York towards Waterbury 
and Hartford. US 7 runs north-south from Norwalk (connecting to I-95) to 
the Litchfield Hills region. The two highways overlap in the downtown area. 
The principal surface roads through the city are Lake Avenue, West Street, 
White Street, and Federal Road. Other secondary state highways are U.S. 
Route 6 in the western part of the city, Newtown Road, which connects to 
US 6 east of the city, Route 53 (Main Street and South Street), Route 37 
(North Street, Padaranam Road, and Pembroke Road), and Route 39 (Clapboard
