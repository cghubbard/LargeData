Archibald Wright "Moonlight" Graham (November 12, 1877 – August 25, 1965) 
was an American professional baseball player, then doctor, who appeared 
as a right fielder in a single major league game for the New York Giants 
on June 29, 1905. His story was popularized by Shoeless Joe, a novel by 
W. P. Kinsella, and the subsequent 1989 film Field of Dreams, starring 
Kevin Costner, and featuring Burt Lancaster and Frank Whaley, respectively, 
as older and younger incarnations of Graham. Graham was born in Fayetteville, 
North Carolina, the second of ten children born to Alexander (September 
12, 1844 – November 2, 1934) and Katherine B. Sloan Graham (March 8, 1855 – 
January 1, 1939). His brother, Frank Porter Graham, was president of the 
University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and was later a U. S. Senator. 
Every one of his brothers and sisters also finished college.[1] He played 
baseball at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where he was 
also a member of the Dialectic Society, a debating organization. Graham 
went on to play baseball in the minor leagues for seven seasons, starting 
with the Charlotte Hornets in the Class C North Carolina League in 1902. 
The following year, he played with Nashua, New Hampshire's team in the 
Class B New England League. Graham also played for the Lowell, Massachusetts 
and Manchester, New Hampshire teams that season, eventually batting .240 
in 89 games with seven triples. In 1904, he spent the entire season with 
Manchester, hitting .272 in 108 games.[2] Graham started the 1905 season 
with the Binghamton Bingoes in the Class B New York State League. He was 
purchased by the Giants, who had won the National League pennant the previous 
year (and had refused to play the Boston Americans in a World Series), 
reporting to the team on May 23, 1905.[3] On June 29, the Giants were the 
visiting team against the Brooklyn Superbas at Washington Park.[4] At the 
conclusion of the eighth inning, Graham replaced right fielder George Browne. 
In the top of the ninth inning, Graham was on deck when Claude Elliott 
flied out, resulting in the third and final out. Graham played the bottom 
of the ninth in right field, never having the ball hit in his direction. 
That game turned out to be his only appearance in the major leagues.[5] 
Graham returned to the New York State League, appearing with the Scranton 
Miners for the rest of the season and in 1906. For the 1905 minor league 
season, playing for two teams, he hit .288 in 64 games. The following season, 
he hit a career-best .329, split between two teams: Scranton, where he 
hit .336 in 124 games; and the Memphis Egyptians of the Class A Southern 
Association, where he hit .262 in a dozen games. He returned to Scranton 
for the 1907 and 1908 seasons, where he hit .285 and .263 in 131 and 130 
games, respectively.[2][6] Graham ranked second in batting average for 
the New York State League, losing the 1906 batting title by four points.[7] 
Graham completed his medical degree from the University of Maryland in 
1905. While there, he had also played on the school's 1904 and 1905 baseball 
teams.[8] Graham had also added some weight to his 5’ 10" frame and resumed 
his collegiate football career. He played halfback for Maryland's football 
team in 1904 and 1905.[1] He obtained his license the following year and 
began practicing medicine in Chisholm, Minnesota. "Doc" Graham, as he became 
known after his career as a ballplayer, served the people of Chisholm for 
fifty years. From 1919 to 1959, Graham was the doctor for the Chisholm 
schools. The Graham Scholarship Fund, established in his honor, provides 
financial assistance to two Chisholm High School graduating seniors each 
year. The award is given to one boy and one girl, $500 to each. For many 
years, "Doc" Graham made arrangements to have used eyeglasses sent to his 
Chisholm office. On Saturdays, he would have the children of the Iron Range 
miners, from Grand Rapids to Virginia, come to his office, have their eyes 
checked and then fit them with the proper set of glasses, all free of charge. 
Graham died in Chisholm in 1965. He is buried in Rochester, Minnesota. 
A biography of Graham, Chasing Moonlight: The True Story of Field of Dreams' 
Doc Graham, was written by sportswriter Brett Friedlander and college professor 
Robert W. Reising in April 2009.[9] In 1975, author W. P. Kinsella happened 
to notice Graham's entry in The Baseball Encyclopedia. He made note of 
his unusual career, and then incorporated Graham as a character in his 
1982 novel Shoeless Joe, on which the movie Field of Dreams was based. 
Much of the description of Graham's life in the novel came from the people 
of Chisholm as Kinsella visited seeking information on him.[10] In the 
novel, the dates of Graham's big-league appearance and death are kept as 
in real life, making the 1905 appearance 74 years prior to the book's 1979 
timeframe, and the Ray Kinsella character quickly finds out that Graham 
has been dead since 1965. The time-travel scene has Kinsella meeting Graham 
in 1955, ten years prior to Graham's death. In the movie, the Fenway Park 
scoreboard shows Graham's appearance as having taken place in 1922, 66 
years prior to the film's 1988 time frame. A woman in Chisholm, a long-time 
friend of Graham's who wrote his eulogy in the newspaper on the day of 
his death, later tells Ray Kinsella (Kevin Costner) and author Terrance 
Mann (James Earl Jones) that Graham had died in 1972. In the time-travel 
sequence of the movie, lead character Ray Kinsella goes back to the year 
of Graham's death, and is told by "Doc" Graham (Burt Lancaster) that his 
appearance was on the final day of the season, rather than the middle. 
In the background of the scene on the street when Ray and Moonlight meet, 
the Plaza Theatre sign shows The Godfather is playing, noting that it was 
"one of this year's 10 best" movies, and Ray notices a poster calling for 
Richard Nixon's re-election as President of the United States displayed,
