Throughout the history of Major League Baseball (MLB), franchises have 
had various postseason and World Series droughts. All 16 of the original 
Major League franchises (i.e., those in place when the first World Series 
was played in 1903) have won the World Series, with the longest wait for 
a franchise's first championship being for the Phillies (77 years, ending 
in 1980). Since expansion began in 1961, eight of the 14 expansion teams 
have never won the World Series. Further, one franchise (the Indians) has 
a current championship drought that pre-dates the expansion era. The three 
longest championship droughts in history were ended recently by the Red 
Sox (85 years, ending in 2004), the White Sox (87 years, ending in 2005), 
and the Cubs (107 years, ending in 2016). Discounting the 33 years in which 
there was no MLB franchise in Washington, there have been 59 seasons played 
in Washington since their last World Series championship (in 1924). Only 
two expansion franchises (the Expos/Nationals and the Mariners) have never 
won a pennant (i.e., the league championship, the two winners of which 
meet in the World Series). The two longest pennant droughts in history 
were recently ended by the Rangers (49 years, starting with the team's 
foundation, ending in 2010) and the Cubs (70 years, ending in 2016). The 
Expos/Nationals pennant drought includes 36 years in Montreal, which no 
longer hosts a team, and 12 years since the move to Washington; discounting 
the 33 years in which there was no MLB franchise in Washington, there have 
been 50 seasons played in Washington since their last pennant (in 1933). 
Every MLB franchise has at least been to the postseason, especially since 
expansion of the playoffs in 1994 made that feat easier. The Mariners have 
the longest active postseason drought at 15 years. Long postseason droughts 
were ended recently by the Nationals (30 years for the franchise, 45 seasons 
over 78 years for the city, ending in 2012), the Pirates (20 years, ending 
in 2013), the Royals (28 years, ending in 2014), and the Blue Jays (21 
years, ending in 2015). This list includes only the modern World Series 
between the American League (AL) and the National League (NL), not the 
various 19th-century championship series. Those teams which have never 
achieved a particular accomplishment in their franchise history are listed 
by the date they entered the leagues. The first World Series was played 
in 1903. Note that no World Series was played in 1904 or 1994. This list 
only shows droughts of 30 or more seasons. Active droughts are listed in 
bold type. * Year does not indicate a title won, but rather the team's 
first year of existence or the first year of the modern World Series (1903). 
This list only includes cities/regions with current Major League Baseball 
franchises. Years during which a city/region did not field a Major League 
Baseball team are not counted. *city without Major League Baseball franchise

for 4 seasons (1966–1969) †city without Major League Baseball franchise 
for 7 seasons (1970–1976) ‡number doesn't indicate a title won, but rather 
total seasons played. In these instances, the World Series matchup ensured 
that one team would win the first championship in its history. *In these 
cases, each team was making its first World Series appearance. Teams that 
had never won the World Series are included, even if they were less than 
30 seasons old at the time. Bold denotes team that won. Numbers marked 
with * indicates that the number is counted from either the franchise's 
first year of existence or the first year of the modern World Series (1903). 
List begins with 1903, about the time the current configuration of National 
League and American League stabilized and also the year of the first World 
Series. Note that no pennants were won in 1994 due to strike. This list 
only shows droughts of 20 or more seasons. Active droughts are listed in 
bold type. * Year does not indicate a pennant, but rather the team's first 
year of existence or the first year of the modern World Series (1903). 
Numbers reflect drought at start of current season. This list only includes 
cities/regions with current Major League Baseball franchises. Years during 
which a city/region did not field a Major League Baseball team are not 
counted. *city without Major League Baseball franchise for 33 seasons (1972–2004)

†number doesn't indicate a title won, but rather total seasons played. 
- Drought has ended, as franchise has qualified for the upcoming 2016 World 
Series; numbers reflect drought at start of current season. After the postseason 
was expanded in 1995 to include eight teams (further expanded in 2012 to 
ten teams), 18 of the 30 teams qualified within the first five years, and 
few teams went for long droughts without at least participating in the 
first round of the postseason. This list only shows droughts of 15 or more 
seasons that occurred primarily in the expanded-postseason era. Active
