. Manuel Eduardo Sarmiento Aponte (born February 2, 1956) is a Venezuelan 
former professional baseball pitcher who played with the Cincinnati Reds 
(1976–79), Seattle Mariners (1980; 1981 on the disabled list) and Pittsburgh 
Pirates (1982–83) in Major League Baseball. Sarmiento played for four years 
with Cincinnati's "Big Red Machine". While with the Reds, he posted a 14–8 
record with 138 strikeouts, six saves, and a 4.12 ERA in 132 appearances 
(including five as a starting pitcher). In 1980, Sarmiento was injured 
while with Seattle, requiring season-ending surgery and more than 18 months 
of rehabilitation. Sarmiento was traded in 1981 to the Pirates. For part 
of the season, he switched from the bullpen in an emergency move and had 
a 9–4 record with 81 strikeouts and 3.39 ERA record before returning to 
relief duties in the 1983 season. In a seven-season career, Sarmiento compiled 
a 26–22 mark with 283 strikeouts and a 3.49 ERA in 513 innings pitched. 
"Sarmiento was a fine fielder with a lively split-finger fastball and a 
singing voice good enough to once sing the National Anthem before a game. 
As a 20-year-old rookie in 1976, the slender Venezuelan helped the Reds 
to a World Championship with five relief wins". - Ed Walton, at Baseball
