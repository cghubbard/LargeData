The San Diego Padres are a Major League Baseball (MLB) franchise based 
in San Diego, California. They play in the National League West division. 
Since the institution of MLB's Rule 4 Draft, the Padres have selected 69 
players in the first round. Officially known as the "First-Year Player 
Draft",[1] the Rule 4 Draft is MLB's primary mechanism for assigning players 
from high schools, colleges, and other amateur clubs to its franchises. 
The draft order is determined based on the previous season's standings, 
with the team possessing the worst record receiving the first pick.[1] 
In addition, teams which lost free agents in the previous off-season may 
be awarded compensatory or supplementary picks.[2] The First-Year Player 
Draft is unrelated to the 1968 expansion draft in which the Padres initially 
filled their roster. Of the 69 players picked in the first round by San 
Diego, 30 have been pitchers, the most of any position; 20 of these were 
right-handed, while 10 were left-handed. Thirteen outfielders were selected, 
while nine shortstops, seven catchers, five third basemen, and four first 
basemen were taken as well. The team has also drafted one player at second 
base.[3] Eleven of the players came from high schools or universities in 
the state of California, and Florida and Georgia follow with ten and six 
players, respectively. None of the Padres' first-round picks have won a 
World Series championship with the team. None of these picks have won the 
MLB Rookie of the Year award, although Khalil Greene (2002) placed second 
in the voting in 2004.[4] Dave Winfield (1973) is the only first-round 
pick of the Padres in the Baseball Hall of Fame, inducted in 2001 as an 
outfielder.[5] Drafted as a pitcher, Winfield was named to 12 All-Star 
teams, won 7 Gold Gloves and 6 Silver Sluggers, and finished as high as 
third in MVP award voting (in 1979) over the course of his 22-season career.[5][6] 
The Padres have made 21 selections in the supplemental round of the draft. 
They have also made the first overall selection five times (1970, 1972, 
1974, 1988, and 2004), tied for the most such picks with the New York Mets.[3][7] 
They have also had 24 compensatory picks since the institution of the First-Year 
Player Draft in 1965.[3] These additional picks are provided when a team 
loses a particularly valuable free agent in the previous off-season,[2][8][V] 
or, more recently, if a team fails to sign a draft pick from the previous 
year.[9] The Padres have failed to sign two of their first-round picks, 
Karsten Whitson (2010) and Brett Austin (2011), and received the 10th pick 
in 2011 and 55th pick in 2012 as compensation.[10] (Palo Alto, California)
