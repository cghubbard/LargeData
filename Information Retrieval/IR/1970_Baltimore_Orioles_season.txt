The 1970 Baltimore Orioles season involved the Orioles finishing first 
in the American League East with a record of 108 wins and 54 losses, 15 
games ahead of the runner-up New York Yankees. The Orioles swept the Minnesota 
Twins for the second straight year in the American League Championship 
Series. They then went on to win their second World Series title over the 
National League champion Cincinnati Reds in five games, thanks to the glove 
of third baseman Brooks Robinson. The team was managed by Earl Weaver, 
and played their home games at Memorial Stadium. Following their upset 
loss to the New York Mets in the 1969 World Series, the Orioles picked 
up where they left off in 1969. They opened the season with five wins and 
ran away with their second straight American League East title, beating 
back a challenge from the New York Yankees in June. They won 19 of their 
last 22 games to finish with a 108-win season, one win fewer than the previous 
year. The team was mostly the same as 1969. Starting pitchers Mike Cuellar, 
Dave McNally, and Jim Palmer each won at least 20 games, and the veteran 
bullpen seldom faltered. On defense, Brooks Robinson, Center fielder Paul 
Blair, and second baseman Davey Johnson won Gold Gloves. Offensively, first 
baseman Boog Powell was the AL's Most Valuable Player, leading the team 
with 35 home runs and 114 RBIs. Don Buford and Blair continued to get on 
base, and Frank Robinson (.306, 25 home runs), Brooks Robinson (94 RBIs), 
and Powell continued to drive them home. Elrod Hendricks led a catching 
platoon that produced 17 homers and 74 RBIs, and outfielder Merv Rettenmund, 
a product of the farm system, hit .322 with 18 homers. There was a sobering 
moment early in the season when Blair was beaned on May 31 in Anaheim, 
California. The California Angels' Ken Tatum threw a pitch that hit Blair 
in the face. Blair was seemingly on his way to a second straight strong 
season after having 26 home runs and 76 RBIs in 1969. He missed three weeks 
after the beaning, coming back to finish with 18 home runs and 65 RBIs, 
but he seldom produced that well over the rest of his career, and some 
speculated[who?] he was never the same at the plate. One personnel change 
from '69 to '70 was the return of Moe Drabowsky, the eminent prankster 
relief pitcher who had been lost to the Kansas City Royals in the expansion 
draft before the '69 season. Now thirty-four and near the end of his career, 
he was reacquired during the '70 season and won four of six decisions, 
helping fill out a veteran bullpen. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9]
