Harvey "Gink" Hendrick[1] (November 9, 1897 – October 29, 1941) was an 
American Major League Baseball player who played for several different 
teams during an eleven-year career. Born near Mason, Tennessee on November 
9, 1897 to Richard T. and Nannie Harvey Hendrick, Hendrick went to elementary 
school in Brownsville, Tennessee.[2] Hendrick attended preparatory school 
at Fitzgerald & Clarke School in Tullahoma, Tennessee; also attended by 
the likes of Vanderbilt football greats Lynn Bomar and Hek Wakefield. He 
then attended Vanderbilt University, playing football and baseball for 
the Commodores. He was a favored target of Jess Neely on the football team. 
He signed with the Memphis Chicks after graduating from Vanderbilt, but 
was released from the team before playing a game. He began his professional 
career with the Chattanooga Lookouts in 1921, and had a .274 batting average 
in 141 games. He followed that up the following year with a .311 batting 
average in 134 games for the Galveston Sand Crabs.[2] During the offseason, 
shortly after being signed by the Boston Red Sox, Hendrick was traded to 
the New York Yankees with George Pipgras for Al DeVormer. He made his major 
league debut with the Yankees in 1923, where he had a .273 batting average 
in 37 games and had one at-bat in the 1923 World Series.[3] After one more 
year with New York where he played in 40 games, he joined the Cleveland 
Indians and played in 25 games for them. Hendrick spent 1926 in the minor 
leagues with the Newark Bears, then joined the Brooklyn Robins, arriving 
days before everyone else for spring training, as the team planned to use 
him as a utility player.[4] In 1927, he had a .310 average and 29 stolen 
bases in 128 games, then followed that up a .318 average in 1928, a .354 
average in 1929 which was ninth in the National League along with 14 home 
runs and 82 runs batted in, and a .257 average in 1930. After playing in 
one game for the Robins in 1931, he was traded to the Cincinnati Reds for 
Mickey Heath.[3] In 137 games for the Reds, he had a .314 batting average. 
Hendrick split 1932 with the Reds and St. Louis Cardinals, who he was traded 
to during the season for Chick Hafey. He then finished his career with 
the Chicago Cubs in 1933 and the Philadelphia Phillies in 1934. Hendrick 
died by his own hand, shooting himself in his Covington, Tennessee home,
