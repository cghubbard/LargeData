A game-winning RBI is the run batted in (RBI) that is credited to the batter 
whose plate appearance is responsible for bringing his team ahead for the 
final time in the game. The statistic was used in Major League Baseball 
(MLB) from 1980 to 1988.[1] For example: A batter on the winning team brought 
his team ahead 3–2 from a 2–2 tie at some point during the game and his 
team later led 5–2 as a result of the other batters. Then, the opposing 
team scored two more runs, making the final score 5–4. The batter on the 
winning team who batted in the third run would be credited with the game-winning 
RBI, even though the losing team scored four runs. The debate over whether 
the RBI should be credited to the batter who drove the third run or the 
batter who drove the fifth run in such situations led to the stat being 
abolished.[citation needed] Statistically, the pitcher of the losing team 
who gives up the game-winning RBI is charged with a loss; the pitcher of 
the winning team who finished the last half-inning before the game-winning
