Eisler Liván Hernández Carrera (Spanish pronunciation: [liˈβan erˈnandeθ]; 
born February 20, 1975) is a Cuban former professional baseball pitcher 
in Major League Baseball. He is the half-brother of pitcher Orlando "El 
Duque" Hernández. Liván Hernández is a baseball player from a poor family 
in Cuba. He was born in Villa Clara Province. After meeting recruiter Joe 
Cubas in Venezuela in 1994, the two planned an escape through Mexico. At 
the age of 20, Hernández gave up his $6 a month job as an official Cuban 
athlete and defected to the United States in 1995. His half-brother, Orlando, 
would defect two years later. Hernández has played for the Florida Marlins 
(1996–1999), the San Francisco Giants (1999–2002), the Montreal Expos (2003–2004), 
the Washington Nationals (2005–2006, 2009–2011), the Arizona Diamondbacks 
(2006–2007), the Minnesota Twins (2008), the Colorado Rockies (2008), the 
New York Mets (2009), the Atlanta Braves (2012) and the Milwaukee Brewers 
(2012). He bats and throws right-handed, and is known for throwing a "slow 
hook" curveball, sometimes below 60 miles per hour, as a strikeout pitch. 
A two-time All-Star, Hernández was considered to be a great defensive pitcher, 
having made just fifteen errors in his career. He is described as a workhorse; 
he throws many pitches, pitches many innings, and makes every start he 
needs to provide his team's bullpen much rest. Between 1998 and 2007, he 
never pitched fewer than 199 innings in any given season (in 1999 he threw 
only 199 2⁄3 innings). Hernández led the National League in innings pitched 
in three consecutive seasons, 2003 through 2005, and led the league in 
complete games for the first two of those years. In 2005, he once threw 
150 pitches in nine innings, although the game went into extra innings 
after he left. In 2004 and 2005, he led the major leagues with 3,927 and 
4,009 pitches, respectively. Hernández also is a dangerous hitter, helping 
his own cause with his bat, and won the Silver Slugger Award at the pitcher 
position in 2004. Hernández's actual age has been the subject of debate. 
Some believe he is older than his given birthday.[1][2] After meeting with 
numerous team officials in the Dominican Republic, he signed with the Florida 
Marlins in order to live in Miami. He made his first appearance for the 
team as a September call-up in 1996, and joined the team for good in June 
1997. His rookie season in 1997 coincided with the recent expansion franchise 
reaching the 1997 World Series. He started and won Games 1 and 5 of the 
series against the Cleveland Indians, and struck out a postseason-record 
15 batters in Game 5 of the NLCS against the Atlanta Braves. His efforts 
earned him the World Series MVP trophy. Before Game 7, Hernandez was able 
to meet his mother, Miriam Carreras, for the first time in two years. The 
moment was the result of concerted efforts by the Cuban and United States 
governments as well as a written plea from the entire roster of players. 
His mother and sister now reside in Miami. On July 25, 1999, the Florida 
Marlins traded Hernández to the San Francisco Giants for minor leaguers 
Nate Bump and Jason Grilli.[3] Hernández would go on to pitch in five postseason 
games during his stint with the Giants, one in 2000 and four in 2002. During 
the 2002 postseason, Hernandez had a record of 1-2 with an ERA of 6.20.[4] 
On March 23, 2003, following his loss in game seven of the 2002 World Series, 
Hernández, along with infielder Edwards Guzmán, was traded by the Giants 
to the Montréal Expos for relief pitchers Jim Brower and Matt Blank. From 
2003 to 2005, Hernández led the National League in innings pitched, and 
led the League in complete games 2003 and 2004. Hernández was selected 
to represent the Expos at the 2004 All-Star Game in Houston, Texas. This 
would turn out to be the first of two selections to the Midsummer Classic 
for Hernández during his career. Between the 2004 and 2005 MLB season, 
the Montréal Expos franchise, with Hernández in tow, relocated to Washington, 
D.C. to become the Washington Nationals. Hernandez started, and won, the 
first major league game in Washington since 1971, defeating the Arizona 
Diamondbacks 5-3. In 2005, Hernández would once again lead the National 
League in innings pitched, as well as earn his second All-Star selection. 
After the 2005 season, Hernández had knee surgery, and his performance 
in the first half of 2006 suffered. At the All-Star break, he had a 5.64 
ERA and allowed hitters a .308 average. But over his last five starts with 
the Nationals, he had a 3.27 ERA with four walks and 23 strikeouts.[5] 
On August 7, 2006, Hernández was traded from the Nationals to the Arizona 
Diamondbacks for two young pitching prospects, Matt Chico and Garrett Mock. 
He led the majors in home runs allowed in 2007, with 34, and had the lowest 
strikeout-to-walk ratio in the Major Leagues (1.14). On February 12, 2008, 
Hernández signed a one-year deal with the Minnesota Twins worth $5 million, 
with an additional $2 million for performance bonuses. Through July 20, 
2008, Hernández led Minnesota Twins starting pitchers with 10 wins and 
127.2 IP.[6] He was 10–6 with 5.29 ERA and 47 strikeouts. On August 1, 
2008, Hernández was designated for assignment to make room for Francisco 
Liriano. On August 6, Hernandez was claimed off waivers by the Colorado 
Rockies, and had a record of 3–3 with 13 strikeouts in 40.1 innings and 
finished the 2008 season there. Hernandez ended 2008 having given up 12.9 
hits per 9 innings, the highest rate in the majors, had a major-league-worst 
.342 batting-average-against, and his 3.4 strikeouts per 9 innings pitched 
were the lowest rate in the major leagues.[7][8] Batters also made contact 
with his pitches 91.3% of the time that they swung at them, easily the 
highest percentage among major league starters.[9] On February 14, 2009, 
Hernández signed a minor league deal with the New York Mets.[10] He won 
the fifth spot in the rotation, and was added to the major league roster 
when his turn came up on April 11.[11] In 2009, Hernández was one of only 
three active players, along with Derek Lowe and Brad Ausmus, to have played 
12 or more seasons without going on the disabled list.[12] Hernández securely 
established himself as a dependable starting pitcher early in the Mets' 
2009 pitching rotation. On May 26, 2009, Hernandez threw a complete game, 
giving just one earned run through his nine innings courtesy of an Adam 
Dunn home run in a 6–1 win over his former club, the Washington Nationals. 
He was the 1st pitcher to throw a complete game in Citi Field. He became 
the only active player that have thrown a complete game with six different 
teams.[citation needed] However, after struggling greatly in July and August, 
Hernández's job was put in jeopardy. After a 6–2 loss to the Diamondbacks, 
manager Jerry Manuel decided to start Hernandez against the Giants, who 
handed the Mets a 10–1 loss on August 17, 2009. Subsequently, on August 
20, 2009 the Mets released Hernández to make room for Billy Wagner on the 
active roster.[13] On August 26, 2009, Hernández re-signed with the Nationals, 
where he finished the season.[14] On February 24, 2010, he signed a minor 
league deal to stay with the Nationals.[15] He was called up on April 11.[16] 
Hernández went 10–12 with a 3.66 ERA in 2010 and agreed to a one-year contract 
extension with the Nationals after the season. He was the starting pitcher 
on Opening Day of the 2011 season, his fourth Opening Day appearance for 
the franchise. On August 30, 2011 against the Atlanta Braves, Hernandez 
threw his 50,000th pitch of his MLB career, getting Jair Jurrjens to ground 
out and end the inning. Since 1988, only 11 pitchers have thrown more pitches.[17] 
On January 31, 2012, Hernández signed a minor league contract with the 
Houston Astros with an invitation to attend spring training. He was released 
by the Astros on March 30. Within hours of being released by the Astros, 
Hernández was signed to a one-year Major League deal by the Atlanta Braves 
as a relief pitcher.[18] On May 5, 2012, he recorded his first career save 
in his 485th major league appearance.[19] On June 19, 2012, he was released 
from the Atlanta Braves. His release came after his relief appearance on 
June 10 where he allowed seven hits (including two home runs) in just 1.2 
innings as the Braves were defeated by the Toronto Blue Jays.[20] On June 
22, 2012, Hernández signed a one-year deal with the Milwaukee Brewers. 
Following the season, he was removed from the 40-man roster and opted to 
become a free agent. After not playing in the Major Leagues for a full 
season, Hernández officially retired from professional play on March 13, 
2014.[21][22] As a young man, Hernández had a fastball in the mid-90s, 
a slider, and a changeup.[23] With age he has become a finesse pitcher 
who relies on locating his pitches rather than generating great pitch speed.[24] 
His primary pitch is a sinker sitting at 83–87 mph. He also has a four-seam 
fastball in the same speed range. Another main pitch, used mostly against 
right-handed hitters, is a cut fastball at 79–82. His off-speed offering 
to right-handers is a curveball ranging from 65–70 mph. Against lefties, 
he also adds a changeup in the upper 70s.[25] His four-seam fastball was 
the slowest among all MLB starters in the 2011 season.[26] Hernández has 
been an excellent fielder throughout his career, finishing seven full seasons 
without making an error. As of 13 September 2014[update], he owns the 24th-best
