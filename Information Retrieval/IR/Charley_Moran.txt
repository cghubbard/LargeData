Charles Barthell Moran (February 22, 1878 – June 14, 1949), nicknamed "Uncle 
Charley", was an American sportsman who gained renown as both a catcher 
and umpire in Major League Baseball and as a collegiate and professional 
American football coach. Moran was born in Nashville, Tennessee, and played 
football for the University of Tennessee in 1897, but left after one year 
to go to Bethel College, where he coached football as well as playing the 
sport. After graduating, he became an assistant to Pop Warner at the Carlisle 
Indian Industrial School.[1] Moran coached the University of Nashville 
football team in 1900 and 1901.[2] The 1901 team was one of the South's 
greatest.[3] Moran played minor league baseball in 1902 for teams in Little 
Rock, Chattanooga and Dallas.[4] In 1903, Moran pitched for the National 
League's St. Louis Cardinals, who finished in last place, but he appeared 
in only three games (plus another as a shortstop) before injuring his arm. 
He posted a 5.25 earned run average in his brief tenure of 24 innings, 
being charged with a loss without earning a win, but also batted .429. 
He went back to the minor leagues to manage the Dallas Giants in 1904, 
and continued playing with teams in Galveston (1905), Waco and Cleburne 
(1906), Grand Rapids (1906–07) and Savannah (1908).[4] He returned to the 
Cardinals as a catcher in 1908 and played in 21 games, batting .175 as 
the team again finished last. His minor league career continued with teams 
in Milwaukee, Mobile, New Orleans, Dallas and Montgomery until he suffered 
a broken leg in 1912. He briefly played with teams in Chattanooga and Brunswick 
in 1913 before retiring as a player. After managing an Austin team in 1914, 
he began umpiring, in the Texas League in 1915–16 and the Southern Association 
in 1917.[4] Moran began coaching football in 1909 at Texas A&M, where he 
accumulated a 38–8–4 record as head coach over six seasons through 1914. 
Note. This may be incorrect as he was elevated to head coach after the 
second game of the 1909 season. He became a National League umpire in 1918, 
a job he held through the 1939 season. He officiated in four World Series 
(1927, 1929, 1933, and 1938), serving as crew chief on the last two occasions. 
He was behind the plate on May 8, 1929 when Carl Hubbell of the New York 
Giants pitched an 11–0 no-hitter against the Pittsburgh Pirates. Moran 
also resumed his career as a football head coach in 1917 at Centre College, 
where he had a 42–6–1 record in five seasons. He had previously been working 
as an assistant coach at Carlisle, and had visited Centre to see his son 
Tom—later an NFL player with the New York Giants—play; after helping the 
team prepare for an important contest he was offered the head coaching 
job by the school.[4] The first two games of the 1917 season were coached 
by Robert L. "Chief" Myers, and the rest by Moran. According to Centre 
publications, "Myers realized he was dealing with a group of exceptional 
athletes, who were far beyond his ability to coach. He needed someone who 
could the team justice, and found that person in Charles Moran."[5][6] 
His record including undefeated seasons in 1919 and 1921, when the team 
was led on the field by Hall of Fame quarterback Bo McMillin. On October 
29, 1921, Moran guided Centre College to a historic 6–0 upset of Harvard, 
which had been unbeaten the previous two seasons. The game, commonly appreviated 
"C6-H0", was ranked the 3rd biggest upset in college football history by 
ESPN.[7] During the 1921 season Moran began a friendship with future baseball 
commissioner Happy Chandler, who was then a player on an opposing Transylvania 
University team.[4] Moran then moved to Bucknell University, where he had 
a 19–10–2 record from 1924 through 1926. He was co-coach with Ed Weir of 
the NFL's Frankford Yellow Jackets in 1927, but left after the team managed 
only a 6–9–3 season. His final coaching job was at Catawba College from 
1930 through 1933, where he had a 22–11–5 record. Moran died of heart disease 
at age 71 in Horse Cave, Kentucky, and was buried at Horse Cave Cemetery. 
He was named to the Texas A&M Athletic Hall of Fame in 1968. Pound sign
