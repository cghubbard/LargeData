Walter Henry (Wally) Schang (August 22, 1889 – March 6, 1965) was a catcher 
in Major League Baseball. From 1913 through 1931, he played for the Philadelphia 
Athletics (1913–17, 1930), Boston Red Sox (1918–20), New York Yankees (1921–25), 
St. Louis Browns (1926–29) and Detroit Tigers (1931). Schang was a switch-hitter 
and threw right-handed. He was born in South Wales, New York. Most baseball 
historians agree that Wally Schang was the greatest offensive catcher of 
the deadball (pre-1920) era. When Schang wasn't catching, his managers 
usually played him in center field, right, or at third base, in order to 
keep his bat in the lineup. His defensive work was also regarded as outstanding, 
although he holds the American League career record for most errors by 
a catcher, with 218. Schang was discovered by George Stallings in 1912, 
when he played in the sandlots of upstate New York for the Buffalo Pullmans. 
Schang started his major league career with the Philadelphia Athletics 
in 1913, who won the World Series in five games against the New York Giants 
and returned the next year, only to be swept by the 1914 Miracle Braves, 
who were managed by Schang's mentor, George Stallings. After Connie Mack 
sold many of his players following the 1914 Series, Schang played for three 
last-place Athletics teams in 1915–1917, until being sold to the Boston 
Red Sox before the 1918 season. Schang was the regular catcher for that 
club, the last Red Sox team to win the title until 2004. Soon afterwards, 
Boston owner Harry Frazee sold Babe Ruth to the New York Yankees. Schang 
followed Ruth in 1921, becoming the first in the great string of Yankee 
catchers, including Bill Dickey, Yogi Berra, Elston Howard and Thurman 
Munson. Schang served as the Yankees' regular catcher for three straight 
American League pennants and was a member of the 1923 World Champion team. 
Three years later Schang moved again, this time to the St. Louis Browns, 
hitting a career-high .330 in his first season with St. Louis, as the team 
improved greatly, managing first-division finishes in 1928 and 1929. The 
following year, Schang returned to Philadelphia as a backup for Mickey 
Cochrane. The Athletics of 1930 were coming off a World Championship and 
repeated that year. It was the fourth title for Schang in his career, which 
ended the next season with the Detroit Tigers. In a 19-season career, Schang 
hit a .284 batting average with 59 home runs and 710 RBI in 1842 games 
played. In 32 World Series games, he hit .287 (27-for-94) with one home 
run and eight RBI. Following his major league career, Schang played for 
several seasons with Western Association and Canadian clubs, and then turned 
to managing in minor leagues. In 1945, he retired to a farm he operated 
at Dixon, Missouri, in the Ozark Mountains. Schang died in St Louis at
