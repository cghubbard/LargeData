Desmond DeChone "Chone" Figgins (/ˈʃɒn/; born January 22, 1978) is an American 
former professional baseball third baseman and outfielder. He played in 
Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, Seattle 
Mariners, and Los Angeles Dodgers. Figgins was a utility player, playing 
all positions except catcher, pitcher, and first base. Figgins played baseball 
at North Brandon Little League in Brandon, Florida. He attended Brandon 
High School where he was a third-team High School All-American as a senior. 
He was drafted in the fourth-round of the 1997 Major League Baseball draft 
by the Colorado Rockies. He was acquired by the Anaheim Angels in a trade 
in 2001 for Kimera Bartee.[1] Figgins made his major league debut as a 
pinch runner on August 25, 2002, against the Boston Red Sox. His first 
hit was an RBI single to right field off Aaron Myette of the Texas Rangers 
on September 15, 2002. His first full season in the majors was 2004. On 
May 14, 2004 he went 5 for 6 in a 10 inning game against the Baltimore 
Orioles and hit his first home run off Kurt Ainsworth of the Orioles. His 
breakout year came in 2005, when he was moved to leadoff hitter after original 
leadoff hitter David Eckstein signed with the St. Louis Cardinals. He used 
his speed to steal an American League-high 62 bases,[2] the second-most 
in Angels history. That year, he played two positions in the same game 
24 times. He was named team co-MVP of the 2005 season for the Angels, along 
with Bartolo Colón. Prior to the 2006 season, the Angels signed Figgins 
to a three-year, $10.5-million deal. He had been eligible for salary arbitration.[3] 
Figgins became the fifth Angel to hit for the cycle on September 16, 2006, 
in Rangers Ballpark in Arlington.[4] Against the Oakland Athletics on September 
29, 2006, Figgins hit his first career inside-the-park home run at Angel 
Stadium. Along with third base, Figgins also played shortstop, second base, 
and all three outfield positions. Although he was initially considered 
for the center field job in 2006, the Angels decided to move Darin Erstad 
back to the position. Figgins became the starter at third base.[5] With 
Erstad on the disabled list for much of the season, however, Figgins saw 
more time in center field. On March 21, 2007, in a spring training game 
against the Arizona Diamondbacks, Figgins suffered two broken fingers on 
his throwing hand while attempting to field a ground ball hit by Conor 
Jackson. He began the season on the disabled list and did not return till 
the end of April.[6] In June 2007, Figgins recorded an Angels team-record 
53 hits in a month, breaking the record set by Darin Erstad in April 2000. 
With six hits on June 18, 2007, against the Houston Astros, including a 
walk-off triple, Figgins matched the American League record for most hits 
in a nine-inning game. On July 15, 2007, Figgins stole his 187th base as 
an Angel, breaking the 20-year-old club record previously held by Gary 
Pettis, in attendance that day as a coach for the visiting Texas Rangers. 
In 2009, Figgins was selected to his first All-Star Game.[7] Although Figgins 
stole 42 bases in 2009, he was caught 17 times – tied for the most in the 
majors.[8] On December 4, 2009, it was reported that Figgins and the Seattle 
Mariners agreed to a four-year contract worth approximately $36 million.[9] 
During spring training for the 2010 season, Figgins was converted to second 
base, moving teammate Jose Lopez to third. Figgins had his worst year to 
date in 2010, batting just .259, though he did match his previous season 
stolen base total of 42. Following the season, Figgins converted back to 
third base, due to the departure of Lopez. Halfway through the 2011 season, 
he was replaced by Adam Kennedy as the everyday 3B. In only 81 games, with 
only 288 at bats, Figgins finished the season batting only .188. To begin 
the 2012 season, he was allowed the opportunity to bat leadoff for the 
Mariners in the hopes that the return to the spot in the lineup where he 
thrived during his time with the Angels would jump start his bat. On May 
4 of that season, manager Eric Wedge announced that Figgins would no longer 
be an everyday player. He ended the 2012 season batting .181 with 166 at 
bats in 66 games and was designated for assignment by the Mariners on November 
20, 2012. On February 8, 2013 he signed a minor league contract with the 
Miami Marlins,[10] however was released on March 20. After sitting out 
for the 2013 season, Figgins signed a minor league contract with the Los 
Angeles Dodgers for 2014.[11] The Dodgers purchased his contract on March 
16 and added him to the Major League roster. In 38 games with the Dodgers, 
he appeared as a utility player/pinch hitter, and hit .217, though he had 
a .373 OBP due to drawing 14 walks in 76 plate appearances.[2] He was placed 
on the disabled list in mid-June with a hip injury and then spent an extended 
time with the AAA Albuquerque Isotopes on a rehab assignment. The Dodgers 
designated him for assignment on August 6, 2014.[12] The Dodgers asked 
for unconditional release waivers on August 13. Figgins was not signed 
by another team.[2] On March 20, 2016, Figgins announced his retirement. 
He will sign a one-day contract with the Angels in order to retire with
