As player As coach Turner Max Ward (born April 11, 1965), is a former professional 
baseball player who played outfielder in the Major Leagues from 1990–2001 
for the Cleveland Indians, Toronto Blue Jays, Milwaukee Brewers, Pittsburgh 
Pirates, Arizona Diamondbacks and Philadelphia Phillies. Along with Rick 
Crawford, John Mitchell, and Joe Whitt, Ward was inducted into the Mobile 
Sports Hall of Fame in 2007.[1] Ward was originally drafted by the New 
York Yankees in the 18th round of the 1986 MLB draft, however, on March 
19, 1989, the Yankees traded Ward and Joel Skinner to the Cleveland Indians 
for Mel Hall. Ward made his Major League Baseball debut with the Indians 
on September 10, 1990, as he went 0 for 4 while playing in right field 
in a 6–2 loss to the Chicago White Sox. On September 12, Ward earned his 
first career hit off of Steve Rosenberg of the White Sox. In his third 
career game on September 15, Ward went 3 for 5 with a triple, home run 
and six RBI in a 14–6 win over the Kansas City Royals. Ward hit his first 
career home run off of Andy McGaffigan. Ward finished the season with a 
.348 batting average with 1 HR and 10 RBI in 14 games with Cleveland. Ward 
began the 1991 season as the Indians starting right fielder, however, he 
got off to a slow start, batting .230 with 0 HR and 5 RBI in 40 games. 
On June 27, the Indians traded Ward and Tom Candiotti to the Toronto Blue 
Jays for Denis Boucher, Glenallen Hill, Mark Whiten, and cash. Ward spent 
most of his time with the Toronto Blue Jays AAA affiliate, the Syracuse 
Chiefs of the International League, however, he was a September call-up, 
and in eight games with Toronto, Ward hit .308 with 0 HR and 2 RBI in 13 
at-bats. Ward once again saw very limited action in 1992 with Toronto, 
playing in 18 games, where he hit .345 with 1 HR and 3 RBI. He did not 
play in any playoff games as Toronto won the 1992 World Series. In 1993, 
Ward got into 72 games with the Blue Jays, however, he struggled offensively, 
batting .192 with 4 HR and 28 RBI. He once again did not see any playing 
time in the post-season, as the Blue Jays repeated as champions by winning 
the 1993 World Series. On November 24, Ward was selected by the Milwaukee 
Brewers off of waivers. Ward became an everyday player with the Milwaukee 
Brewers during the 1994 season, splitting his time between all three outfield 
positions with the club. He played in 102 games, batting .232 with 9 HR 
and 45 RBI before the season was cut short due to the 1994 MLB strike. 
Ward saw his playing time decrease rapidly in 1995, as he played in only 
44 games, batting .264 with 4 HR and 16 RBI with the Brewers. In 1996, 
Ward played in 43 games, hitting only .179 with 2 HR and 10 RBI. On November 
1, the Brewers released Ward. Ward had a very productive 1997 season as 
the Pirates fourth outfielder, as he played in 71 games, batting .353 with 
7 HR and 33 RBI. In 1998, Ward broke through the right field wall at Three 
Rivers Stadium in Pittsburgh while chasing a fly ball. The spectacular 
catch that resulted was a staple of TV highlight shows for the rest of 
the year. Ward played in a career high 123 games during the season, batting 
.262 with 9 HR and 46 RBI. He began the 1999 season with Pittsburgh, however, 
Ward struggled to a .209 batting average with 0 HR and 8 RBI in 49 games 
with the Pirates. On August 11, the club released Ward. On August 18, 1999, 
Ward signed with the Arizona Diamondbacks, helping the club win the NL 
West with a .348 batting average with 2 HR and 7 RBi in 10 games. In the 
1999 NLDS against the New York Mets, Ward played in three games, getting 
two at-bats, where he had a home run and 3 RBI, however, the D-Backs lost 
the series. In 2000, Ward hit .173 with 0 HR and 4 RBI with Arizona in 
15 games. On October 5, he was released. On December 20, 2000, Ward signed 
with the Philadelphia Phillies, and in the 2001 season, Ward played in 
17 games with the club, batting .267 with 0 HR and 2 RBI. On October 8, 
he was granted free agency, then retired. Ward played in 12 seasons during 
his Major League Baseball career, appearing in 626 games, as he had a .251 
batting average with 39 HR and 219 RBI. Ward had 389 career hits, and stole 
33 bases. He was a member of the 1992 and 1993 World Series champions, 
the Toronto Blue Jays. Ward managed the State College Spikes of the New 
York–Penn League in 2007, leading the club to a 36–39 record, as the club 
finished in third place in the Pinckney Division. Ward became the manager 
of the Mobile BayBears, the Arizona Diamondbacks AA affiliate in the Southern 
League, in the 2011 season. Ward coached the BayBears for two seasons, 
2011 and 2012, leading the team to two consecutive Southern League championships.[2] 
He earned the 2011 Southern League Manager of the Year.[2] In 2013, Ward 
became an assistant hitting coach for the Arizona Diamondbacks.[2] Notably, 
he was thrown out the game during a massive brawl between the Diamondbacks 
and the Dodgers on June 11, 2013.[3] He became full-time hitting coach 
in 2014. Ward became the new hitting coach for the Los Angeles Dodgers
