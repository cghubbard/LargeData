Runs created (RC) is a baseball statistic invented by Bill James to estimate 
the number of runs a hitter contributes to his team. James explains in 
his book, The Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract, why he believes 
runs created is an essential thing to measure: With regard to an offensive 
player, the first key question is how many runs have resulted from what 
he has done with the bat and on the basepaths. Willie McCovey hit .270 
in his career, with 353 doubles, 46 triples, 521 home runs and 1,345 walks 
-- but his job was not to hit doubles, nor to hit singles, nor to hit triples, 
nor to draw walks or even hit home runs, but rather to put runs on the 
scoreboard. How many runs resulted from all of these things?[1] Runs created 
attempts to answer this bedrock question. The conceptual framework of the 
"runs created" stat is: R C = A × B C {\displaystyle RC={\frac {A\;\times 
\;B}{C}}} where In the most basic runs created formula: R C = ( H + B B 
) × T B A B + B B {\displaystyle RC={\frac {(H+BB)\times TB}{AB+BB}}} where 
H is hits, BB is base on balls, TB is total bases and AB is at-bats. This 
can also be expressed as where OBP is on-base percentage, SLG is slugging 
average, AB is at-bats and TB is total bases. This formula expands on the 
basic formula by accounting for a player's basestealing ability. R C = 
( H + B B − C S ) × ( T B + ( .55 × S B ) ) A B + B B {\displaystyle RC={\frac 
{(H+BB-CS)\times (TB+(.55\times SB))}{AB+BB}}} where H is hits, BB is base 
on balls, CS is caught stealing, TB is total bases, SB is stolen bases, 
and AB is at bats. This formula accounts for all basic, easily available 
offensive statistics. R C = ( H + B B − C S + H B P − G I D P ) × ( T B 
+ ( .26 × ( B B − I B B + H B P ) ) + ( .52 × ( S H + S F + S B ) ) ) A 
B + B B + H B P + S H + S F {\displaystyle RC={\frac {(H+BB-CS+HBP-GIDP)\times 
(TB+(.26\times (BB-IBB+HBP))+(.52\times (SH+SF+SB)))}{AB+BB+HBP+SH+SF}}} 
where H is hits, BB is base on balls, CS is caught stealing, HBP is hit 
by pitch, GIDP is grounded into double play, TB is total bases, IBB is 
intentional base on balls, SH is sacrifice hit, SF is sacrifice fly, SB 
is stolen base, and AB is at bats. Earlier versions of runs created overestimated 
the number of runs created by players with extremely high A and B factors 
(on-base and slugging), such as Babe Ruth, Ted Williams and Barry Bonds. 
This is because these formulas placed a player in an offensive context 
of players equal to himself; it is as if the player is assumed to be on 
base for himself when he hits home runs. Of course, this is impossible, 
and in reality, a great player is interacting with offensive players whose 
contributions are inferior to his. The 2002 version corrects this by placing 
the player in the context of his real-life team. This 2002 version also 
takes into account performance in "clutch" situations. where K is strikeout. 
The initial individual runs created estimate is then: R C = ( ( 2.4 C + 
A ) ( 3 C + B ) 9 C ) − .9 C {\displaystyle RC=\left({\frac {(2.4C+A)\;(3C+B)}{9C}}\right)-.9C} 
If situational hitting information is available, the following should be 
added to the above total: H R I S P − ( A B R I S P × B A ) + H R R O B 
− A B R O B × H R A B {\displaystyle H_{RISP}-(AB_{RISP}\times BA)+HR_{ROB}-{\frac 
{AB_{ROB}\times HR}{AB}}} where RISP is runners in scoring position, BA 
is batting average, HR is home run, and ROB is runners on base. The subscripts 
indicate the required condition for the formula. For example, H R I S P 
{\displaystyle H_{RISP}} means "hits while runners are in scoring position." 
This is then figured for every member of the team, and an estimate of total 
team runs scored is added up. The actual total of team runs scored is then 
divided by the estimated total team runs scored, yielding a ratio of real 
to estimated team runs scored. The above individual runs created estimate 
is then multiplied by this ratio, to yield a runs created estimate for 
the individual.[2] The same information provided by runs created can be 
expressed as a rate stat, rather than a raw number of runs contributed. 
This is usually expressed as runs created per some number of outs, e.g. 
R C 27 {\displaystyle {\frac {RC}{27}}} (27 of course being the number 
of outs per team in a standard 9-inning baseball game). Runs created is 
believed to be an accurate measure of an individual's offensive contribution 
because when used on whole teams, the formula normally closely approximates 
how many runs the team actually scores. Even the basic version of runs 
created usually predicts a team's run total within a 5% margin of error.[3]
