Jeffrey Allen Lahti (born October 8, 1956, in Oregon City, Oregon) was 
a Major League Baseball pitcher. He is an alumnus of Portland State University. 
Drafted by the Cincinnati Reds in the 5th round of the 1978 MLB amateur 
draft, Lahti would make his Major League Baseball debut with the St. Louis 
Cardinals on June 27, 1982, and appear in his final game on April 24, 1986. 
Lahti was a member of the St. Louis Cardinals team that defeated the Milwaukee 
Brewers in the 1982 World Series. He led the 1985 Cardinal team that went 
to the World Series in saves a year after the departure of relief ace Bruce 
Sutter. He was injured early in the 1986 season and Todd Worrell took over 
as the team's closer, winning the National League Rookie of the Year Award. 
Lahti was often called Lahti-Da by his teammates out of respect and premier 
pitching finesse. In 2012 the acting governor for the Government of Michigan 
incumbent Rick Snyder contacted the then Governor of Oregon John Kitzhaber 
with a proposition. Snyder had watched Jeff Lahti play throughout his short 
baseball career, over this time Snyder had been inspired by Lathi and impressed 
by his charismatic style. Snyder proposed to the governor of Oregon that 
a children's health clinic be named in honor of the baseballer, he felt 
that the name would inspire and give hope to sickly children in Lahti's 
home town. Initial talks between the governors where promising but further 
support was needed to get the project off the ground. Unfortunately talks 
broke down when two undisclosed members of the Government of Michigan intercepted 
the conversations and advised John Kitzhaber to not move forward with the 
project.[citation needed] The talks were concluded in their very early 
stages 'The Lahti Children's Health Clinic' was ultimately never proposed
