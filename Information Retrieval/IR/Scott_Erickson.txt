Team All American. In 1989 he was drafted by the Minnesota Twins in the 
4th round of the amateur draft out of the University of Arizona, where 
he signed his 1st pro contract. After 27 minor league starts,[1] Erickson 
rose to the major leagues in his second season of professional baseball 
from the Class AA Orlando Sun Rays,.[2] He was on a 5-game win streak with 
a record of 8-3 in the 1st half as an All Star in the Southern League.

and tying Dave Stewart American League Pitcher of the Month. After posting

last no-hitter in a Twins home game, that game having taken place at the
