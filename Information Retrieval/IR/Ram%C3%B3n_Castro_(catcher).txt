Ramón Abraham Castro (born March 1, 1976) is a former professional baseball 
catcher, who played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Florida Marlins, 
New York Mets and Chicago White Sox. On June 2 1994 Castro was selected 
by the Houston Astros in the first round (17th overall pick) of the Major 
League Baseball draft,[1] becoming the first Puerto Rican to ever be drafted 
in the first round. After this, seven more Puerto Ricans entered the first 
round's top ten, but most graduated from high school or colleges that offered 
them scholarships in the United States. He remained the highest-selected 
player drafted directly from a Puerto Rico high school until 2012, when 
Carlos Correa became the first overall pick. He was traded to the Florida 
Marlins in 1998 for relief pitcher Jay Powell. Castro made his major league 
debut on August 27, 1999 in a game against the Houston Astros. He spent 
1999 and 2000 competing with Mike Redmond for playing time and, when Charles 
Johnson arrived in Florida, Castro spent most of the 2001 season in the 
minor leagues. In 2002 he was back in the majors but as a third option 
and, in 2003, he played behind Iván Rodríguez as the Marlins won the 2003 
World Series. However, Castro did not appear in the series. In 2004 Rodríguez 
was gone, giving Castro his first opportunity as a starter but a .135 batting 
average and an early-June season-ending injury finished his time in Florida. 
Paul Lo Duca finished out the Marlins' catching duties for 2004. The Marlins 
released Castro in October 2004. Castro is known as a good defensive catcher, 
but, despite showing occasional home run power has never displayed sufficient 
hitting skills to win a job as a starter, along with struggling with injuries 
throughout his career. While never hitting for a superior average, however, 
his hits are often well-timed. In December 2004, Castro signed with the 
New York Mets. In 2005 he was backup catcher to Mike Piazza, with 41 RBIs 
in 209 at-bats, a career-best .244 batting average, and playing solid defense. 
When Piazza became a free agent after the season, it looked like Castro 
might again get a chance to be a starter, but the Mets traded for Paul 
Lo Duca who previously had replaced Castro in Florida. Injuries further 
reduced his role in 2006, limiting him to 126 at-bats. When Lo Duca left 
after the 2007 season, many fans called for Castro to start, but the job 
instead went to newcomer Brian Schneider. It was most likely due to his 
injury-riddled career, which became evident once more when he strained 
his hamstring late in spring training that year, missing the beginning 
of the season. On May 29, 2009, Ramon was traded to the Chicago White Sox 
for pitcher Lance Broadway after Omir Santos won the backup job with the 
return of Brian Schneider from the DL. On July 23, 2009, Castro became 
the 17th backstop in Major League Baseball history to catch a perfect game, 
receiving Mark Buehrle's second no-hitter. It was his first time catching 
for Buehrle,[2] who stated afterwards that he did not shake off Castro 
at any time during the game.[3] On January 12, 2010, Castro re-signed with 
the Chicago White Sox on a 1-year $800,000 contract with a club option 
for 2011.[4] He played in 37 games in 2010 and 23 games in 2011. After 
not playing in 2012 Castro signed a minor league contract with the Los 
Angeles Dodgers in January 2013. He was released on March 18, 2013. Castro 
signed with the Long Island Ducks of the Atlantic League of Professional 
Baseball. Castro signed a contract to play with Telemarket Rimini of Italian 
Baseball League during the 2013 season. Ramon Castro was raised in Sabana 
Puerto Rico. Since he was little he loved playing baseball. In high school 
he was the first Puerto Rican to be drafted by the Houston Astros. Recently 
he married Brenda Castro. They have two daughters: Mairym (born December 
21, 1995), and Nathalie (born July 15, 1999). They are currently living 
in Miramar, Florida. Castro was arrested in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania 
on August 29, 2003, on charges of rape, involuntary deviate sexual intercourse, 
indecent assault, sexual assault and unlawful restraint, after a 28-year-old 
woman accused him of assaulting her in his hotel room at the Westin Convention 
Center Hotel the prior evening.[5] The woman claimed that she had met Castro 
at a bar the prior evening, that she and another couple went to Castro's 
room for drinks, and that after the other couple left, Castro held her 
down on the bed, forcibly removed her clothes, and continued to pursue 
sexual activity after she told him to stop.[5] She went to the hospital 
on the morning of the 29th, and was treated for scratches to her neck and 
chest.[6] Castro was released on $25,000 bond,[5] and on August 30 he issued 
a statement in which he claimed to be innocent.[7] On November 29, 2004, 
Castro entered a no-contest plea to one charge of indecent assault, a second-degree 
misdemeanor, as part of a plea bargain which involved all other charges 
being dropped.[8] Castro issued an apology to his wife, his family, and
