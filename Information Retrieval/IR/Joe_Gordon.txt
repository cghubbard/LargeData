As player As manager Joseph Lowell Gordon (February 18, 1915 – April 14, 
1978), nicknamed "Flash" in reference to the comic-book character Flash 
Gordon, was an American second baseman, coach and manager in Major League 
Baseball who played for the New York Yankees and Cleveland Indians from 
1938 to 1950. He was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 2009. Gordon 
was the outstanding player at his position during the 1940s, winning the 
1942 American League MVP Award and being named to The Sporting News Major 
League All-Star Team in nine of his eleven seasons. Known for his acrobatic 
defense, he led the AL in assists four times and in double plays three 
times. He was the first AL second baseman to hit 20 home runs in a season, 
doing so seven times, holds the league mark for career HRs at second base 
(246), and he held the single-season record until 2001. He played a major 
role on the 1948 champion Indians, leading the team in homers and runs 
batted in. He ranked sixth in major league history in double plays (1,160) 
upon retiring, and was sixth in AL history in games (1,519), putouts (3,600), 
assists (4,706) and total chances (8,566) and seventh in fielding percentage 
(.970). Joe Gordon was born in Los Angeles, on February 18, 1915 to Benjamin 
Lowell Gordon (1875–1946) and Lulu Pearl Evans (1893–1984).[1] The family 
moved to Oregon, where he attended Jefferson High School.[2] After graduation, 
Gordon attended the University of Oregon,[1] where he also competed as 
a halfback on the football team as well as in gymnastics, soccer and the 
long jump. Not limiting himself to sports, he also played the violin in 
the college orchestra.[3] Playing on the Ducks baseball team during the 
1934 and 1935 seasons, Gordon helped lead the team to a combined record 
of 30-14 – winning the Pacific Coast Conference's Northern Division both 
years.[2] Gordon hit .358 while at Oregon which ranks him tied for fourth 
in team history.[2] While in college, Gordon was a member of the Sigma 
Chi Fraternity.[4] After batting .418 in his sophomore year, he signed 
with the Yankees in 1936, with scout Bill Essick reporting: "(Gordon was) 
at his best when it meant the most and the going was toughest." After being 
assigned to the Yankees AA-level club, the Oakland Oaks, in the Pacific 
Coast League, Gordon proceeded to put up solid numbers in his first season 
in professional baseball, hitting .300 while spending the majority of time 
in the field at shortstop.[5] In 1937, Gordon was moved to the Newark Bears, 
another AA team in the International League and continued to excel, hitting 
.280 with 26 home runs. His 1937 Bears' team is often regarded as the best 
minor league team in history with future all-stars George McQuinn, Charlie 
Keller, Tommy Henrich, Babe Dahlgren, and Spud Chandler joining Gordon 
to lead the team to an incredible 110 wins in 158 games.[6] Gordon's success 
led to the release of 33-year-old Tony Lazzeri following the 1937 season,[7] 
and he made his debut with the Yankees in April 1938. His 25 home runs 
as a rookie set an American League record for second basemen, surpassing 
Detroit Tiger Charlie Gehringer's previous record of 19. Gordon would hold 
the AL record for home runs by a second baseman 64 years before being surpassed 
by Bret Boone's 36 home runs in 2001.[5] Along with Jeff Heath of the Indians, 
who had batted .343, Gordon was one of the AL's top rookies, hitting .255 
with 97 RBI and placing second to Gehringer in the AL with 450 assists 
as the Yankees won their third straight pennant. In the 1938 World Series 
sweep of the Chicago Cubs, he hit .400 and slugged .733. He had an RBI 
single, doubled, and recorded the final out in a 3-1 victory in Game 1. 
Gordon doubled in the first two runs in Game 2's 6-3 win. In Game 3, a 
5-2 win, he had a solo home run to tie the game 1-1 in the fifth inning, 
and singled home two more runs in the sixth. He scored twice in an 8-3 
win in the final Game 4 as New York took their third consecutive title. 
1939 saw Gordon improve his batting average to .284 and top his own home 
run mark with 28. He led the AL in putouts, assists and double plays, and 
was second on the team to Joe DiMaggio and fifth in the league in both 
homers and RBI (111). On June 28 he hit three home runs; he made his first 
of nine All-Star teams, and finished ninth in the MVP vote. In the World 
Series against the Cincinnati Reds he hit only .143, but scored the first 
run in a 2-1 Game 1 victory. In Game 4, he drove in the tying run with 
one out in the ninth inning, and the Yankees scored three in the tenth 
to win 7-4 and complete another sweep for their fourth straight championship. 
In 1940 Gordon again increased his home run total to 30 and was second 
on the team to DiMaggio in homers and RBI (103), leading the AL in assists 
and posting career highs in runs (112), triples (10), slugging average 
(.511), total bases (315) and stolen bases (18) while hitting .281. On 
September 8, he hit for the cycle. But the Yankees finished two games behind 
Detroit, in the only year between 1936 and 1943 that they lost the pennant. 
In 1941 he batted .276 with 24 HRs and 87 RBI, scoring 104 runs and teaming 
with rookie shortstop Phil Rizzuto to lead the AL in double plays; Gordon 
placed seventh in the MVP vote as New York returned to the top of the standings. 
In the 1941 World Series against the Brooklyn Dodgers he played phenomenally, 
hitting .500 with stellar defense. In Game 1 he started the scoring with 
a solo home run in the second inning, had an RBI single and was walked 
twice (once intentionally), and turned a double play with the tying run 
on first base to end a 3-2 win. In Game 2, he was walked three times, once 
intentionally, and had three double plays in a 3-2 loss. In Game 3 he tripled, 
walked and had four assists, one of them to end the 2-1 win. He doubled 
in two runs in the ninth inning of Game 4 to give the Yankees their final 
7-4 lead, four batters after Dodger catcher Mickey Owen famously dropped 
a third strike which would have ended the game. And he drove in another 
run in the final 3-1 victory in Game 5. His five double plays (three of 
them in Game 2) remain a record for a five-game Series. After the Series, 
Yankees manager Joe McCarthy said, "The greatest all-around ballplayer 
I ever saw, and I don't bar any of them, is Joe Gordon." Gordon led the 
Yankees to another pennant in his 1942 MVP season, edging Triple Crown 
winner Ted Williams of the Boston Red Sox for the award. He batted .322, 
fourth in the AL, with 18 homers and 103 RBI, and finished sixth in the 
league in total bases (264) and slugging (.491) while he and Rizzuto again 
led the league in double plays. He had another poor World Series, however, 
batting just .095 in the five-game loss to the St. Louis Cardinals – his 
only Series loss in six trips; he was picked off at second base in the 
bottom of the ninth in the last game. By his own lofty standards he had 
a subpar yet productive season in 1943, batting .249 with 17 HRs (5th in 
the AL), 69 RBI and 82 runs, and leading the AL in assists; despite his 
low batting mark, he was still among the league's top ten players in both 
slugging (.413) and on-base percentage (.365), thanks to a career-best 
98 walks (second in the AL). In the World Series rematch with the Cardinals, 
he gave New York a 2-1 lead in the fourth inning of Game 1 – a 4-2 win 
– with a solo homer, and scored the first run in a 2-1 win in Game 4. He 
threw out the final batter of the Series with the tying runs on base in 
the 2-0 Game 5 victory, with the Yankees taking home another title. He 
again fielded brilliantly, setting still-standing records for a five-game 
Series of 20 putouts, 23 assists, 43 total chances, and a 1.000 fielding 
average; his 8 assists in Game 1 and 3 assists in the eighth inning of 
Game 5 are also records. Afterwards, he served in the U.S. Army in 1944–45 
during World War II, missing those seasons. He returned to the Yankees 
in 1946, which turned out to be his most challenging year in major league 
baseball. Gordon was spiked in an exhibition game and severed a tendon 
in his hand, which required surgery, and he suffered a chipped bone in 
his finger. As the rest of the Yankees headed to The Bronx to begin the 
1946 regular season, Gordon stayed behind in Florida for a month to recover. 
As Gordon told Oregonian sports editor L. H. Gregory, just two weeks after 
returning to the Yankees lineup, Gordon tore a leg muscle. He taped the 
leg and resumed playing, only to tear a muscle in his other leg. Following 
a brief break, Gordon retore a leg muscle and then fractured his thumb. 
Gordon played in just 112 games that year and stepped up to the plate just 
376 times, nearly 170 fewer at bats than his pre-war 1943 season. As a 
result, he batted .210 with 11 HRs and 47RBI, much to the displeasure of 
new Yankees president/general manager Larry MacPhail. With Gordon-ally 
Joe McCarthy resigning from the Yankees club in May 1946 and following 
his worst season in baseball, Gordon was in trouble. Trade rumors were 
rampant and MacPhail even consulted Gordon teammate DiMaggio about "Flash's" 
eventual trade for one of Cleveland's pitchers. Taking DiMaggio's advice, 
on October 11 MacPhail settled on Indians pitcher Allie Reynolds in exchange 
for Gordon: a move that benefited both ball clubs. Gordon departed New 
York after precisely 1,000 games and 1,000 hits: the only player in baseball 
history with those statistics. While Reynolds would go on to win 131 games 
in eight seasons for the Yankees, Gordon proved resilient and kept his 
new team from regretting the deal. In 1947 he returned to his old levels 
of production, batting .272 and leading the club with 93 RBIs, and again 
pacing the AL in assists. His 29 homers and 279 total bases were second 
in the league to Williams, and his .496 slugging average trailed only Williams 
and DiMaggio; Gordon again finished seventh in the MVP balloting. Additionally, 
he played a major role in befriending teammate Larry Doby,[8] the AL's 
first black player, who had been a second baseman in the Negro Leagues 
but became a center fielder with Cleveland. Over Doby's first two seasons, 
Gordon became close to the player who was theoretically there to replace 
him, and Doby would later refer to him as his first friend in white baseball; 
however, reports that Gordon deliberately struck out in Doby's first game 
to keep him from looking bad are erroneous.[9] 1948 was even better, as 
Cleveland won their first AL title since 1920. Batting .280, he was second 
in the league to DiMaggio with 32 home runs, which remained the AL's single-season 
mark for a second baseman until Bret Boone hit 36 in 2001. He again led 
the team with a personal high of 124 RBIs, and was sixth in the league 
in slugging (.507). Gordon placed sixth in the MVP vote, won by teammate 
and manager Lou Boudreau. In the 1948 World Series against the Boston Braves, 
batting cleanup, he had a RBI single and later scored to give Cleveland 
a 2-1 lead in Game 2; they went on to win 4-1. In the final Game 6, he 
homered to give the Indians a 2-1 lead in the sixth inning, and they went 
on to win 4-3 to capture the championship. His seven double plays in the 
Series are still the record for a six-game Series. In 1949 he slipped to 
a .251 average, though his 20 HRs and 84 RBIs were still second on the 
team to Doby. His major league career ended in 1950 as he hit .236 with 
19 HRs and 57 RBIs. Gordon was a career .268 hitter with 253 home runs, 
975 RBIs, 914 runs, 1,530 hits, 264 doubles and 89 stolen bases in 1,566 
games. His .466 slugging average then placed him fifth among second basemen, 
behind Hornsby (.577), Gehringer (.480), Lazzeri (.467) and Nap Lajoie 
(.466), and only Hornsby had more homers among second basemen. Gordon might 
have had even higher batting totals had he played in other stadiums. His 
first several seasons were spent in Yankee Stadium, with its immense "Death 
Valley" in left field that frustrated right-handed power hitters; during 
his New York years, he hit 69 HRs at home and 84 on the road. Municipal 
Stadium in Cleveland was also an unhelpful venue, being hostile to power 
hitters on both sides of the plate. Over his career, he batted 23 points 
higher on the road (.279) than he did at home (.256). He was selected for 
the All-Star team nine times, in all but his first and last seasons. He 
was also selected to The Sporting News Major League All-Star Team in 1939–42 
and 1947–48, and was runnerup to Gehringer in 1938 and to Billy Herman 
in 1943. In 2001 he was selected as one of the Indians' 100 greatest players.[10] 
Gordon next became a player-manager with the Pacific Coast League's (PCL) 
Sacramento Solons in 1951–52. Showing he still had something in the tank, 
Gordon hit .299 with 43 home runs and 136 RBIs in 148 games in 1951, but 
tailed off badly in 1952, hitting only .246 with just 16 home runs – his 
fewest since his World War II-shortened 1946 season.[5] His teams also 
performed poorly under his direction, winning just over 40% of their games 
in those two years.[5] Gordon then worked as a scout with the Tigers from 
1953 to 1956. After returning to the PCL to manage the 1956 San Francisco 
Seals, winning a pennant in 1957, he would go on to manage for four different 
major league teams. Gordon began his major league managing career with 
the Indians in 1958, but had difficult relations with general manager Frank 
Lane, who publicly questioned his decisions.[citation needed] After Gordon 
announced late in 1959, with Cleveland in second place, that he would not 
return the next season, Lane fired him four days later. However Lane recanted 
and apologized after negotiations with Leo Durocher broke down and Gordon 
was rehired.[citation needed] But in the middle of the 1960 season, he 
was involved in a rare trade between managers, when the Indians traded 
him to the Tigers for their skipper Jimmy Dykes. After the season, Gordon 
was hired by the Kansas City Athletics for 1961. However, owner Charlie 
Finley fired him mid-year,[5] and Gordon became a scout and minor league 
instructor for the Los Angeles and California Angels from 1961 to 1968. 
In 1969, he had the distinction of managing his second team in Kansas City, 
this time with the expansion Royals, but lasted only one season with the 
club before resigning at the end of his one-year contract. Gordon later 
went into real estate and died of a heart attack at age 63 in Sacramento, 
California. On August 16, 2008, Gordon was inducted into the Cleveland 
Indians Hall of Fame. Two of Gordon's grandchildren were present for his 
induction ceremony. On December 7, 2008, Gordon was elected to the Baseball 
Hall of Fame by the Veterans Committee with 10 out of 12 possible votes, 
83.3%,[11] and was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame on July 26, 
2009; of the 20 candidates on two ballots, he was the only player to be 
selected. His only daughter, Judy Gordon of Idaho Falls, Idaho, gave his 
induction speech in Cooperstown in front of 21,000 people in attendance. 
"He (Joe) insisted against having a funeral", Judy said in the closing 
remarks of her speech. "And as such, we consider Cooperstown and the National 
Baseball Hall of Fame as his final resting place to be honored forever." 
Wall Street Journal sports writer Russell Adams wrote a piece entitled 
"Who Is the Greatest Yankee?" Adams ranked Gordon as the 9th-greatest Yankees' 
position player in franchise history. "Gordon's great strength was defense
