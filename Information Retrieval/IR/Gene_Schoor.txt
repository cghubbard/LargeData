Eugene R. (Gene) Schoor (July 26, 1914 – December 13, 2000)[1] was a New 
York-based author, journalist, ghost-writer,[2] college boxing instructor 
(New York University, the University of Minnesota, and City College of 
New York),[3] Florida state amateur boxing title holder,[4] Navy Public 
Information Officer,[5] public relations man, sports agent, boxing promoter, 
and restaurateur.[6] He is best known as the author of "juvenile"[7] sports 
biographies. Schoor attended the University of Miami in Coral Gables, Florida. 
He began boxing no later than April 1933, when he won a bout as a welterweight.[8] 
While in college, he won the Florida state lightweight amateur boxing title 
(under the name "Eugene Schoor").[4] He also fought as a middleweight.[9] 
After serving in the Navy in World War Two, Schoor began a PR business 
in New York. His clients included Jayne Mansfield, Cindy Adams and Bess 
Myerson. He expanded into radio, producing "Champ of the Week," "Sports 
Club of the Air," and "Hour of Champions," and using radio to promote client-athletes 
including Joe DiMaggio, Jack Dempsey, Tommy Henrich and Phil Rizzuto.[5] 
A prolific author of more than fifty books during five decades, Gene Schoor 
specialized in "juvenile" sports biographies but also wrote a variety of 
other work, including a successful pre-assassination biography of John 
F. Kennedy. A representative list of Schoor's "juvenile" non-fiction, once 
found on the shelves of elementary school libraries across the United States, 
would include The Story of Ty Cobb: Baseball's Greatest Player (1952), 
The Ted Williams Story, Christy Mathewson: Baseball's Greatest Pitcher, 
Roy Campanella: Man of Courage, The Story of Yogi Berra, Mickey Mantle 
of the Yankees, Willie Mays: Modest Champion, Bob Feller: Hall of Fame 
Strikeout Star, and The Stan Musial Story. Gene Schoor also wrote the best-seller[10] 
Young John Kennedy (June 1963), a book for adults which drew on extensive 
interviews with Kennedy intimates and letters from Kennedy[11] to his family. 
(Schoor may have come to the attention of the Kennedys after sending Robert 
F. Kennedy a number of his sports biographies; Kennedy thanked Schoor in 
a letter of March 1961, commenting on "our mutual interest" in sports.)[12] 
After describing his childhood enthusiasm for Schoor's work—typical of 
his generation of school children—best-selling sports author and sports-PR 
executive Marty Appel wrote, "Give [Schoor] the player’s year by year stats, 
throw in some good newspaper clips with some quotes about how the scout 
discovered him, create some locker room conversation between the star and 
his manager, sprinkle in some self-doubt after that .222 average in the 
first month of the rookie season, and bang, you had a 190-page book at 
$4.95 with a handful of some of the team’s best free publicity photos tucked 
in."[5] Journalist Jeff Kallman adds: "If you are my age, and you became 
a baseball fan early enough in childhood, you probably know the name Gene 
Schoor. He wrote a library's worth of sports biographies for children in 
the 1950s and early 1960s.... Schoor's technique ... involved mulcting 
as many newspaper and/or magazine articles as he could find about his subject, 
using the creamier quotes, making sure they included tales of how his subject 
was scouted, a quote or three in which our hero had his doubts, and as 
much rah-rah in the triumph as could be tolerated short of a need for Tums.... 
[T]he books were hits and they did give a lot of kids an entree into reading 
by way of their game."[13] According to Appel, one-time sports biographer 
Milton Shapiro wrote Appel and claimed to have been a ghost-writer for 
Schoor: "Shapiro says he was actually the writer of the biographies of 
Leo Durocher, Joe DiMaggio and Pee Wee Reese. And when he asked Schoor 
for more money and a co-author credit on [the biography of] Bob Feller, 
he was turned down and 'quit.'"[14] In 1959, Schoor and three others (former 
boxers Bill Nicholson, Sy Krieg, and Phil Krupin, whom Schoor met in Paris 
after they all served in World War Two) financed the New York City Second 
Avenue restaurant Johnny Johnston's Steakhouse.[15] Later, while interviewing 
President Kennedy, Schoor lamented the lack of opportunity given to American 
youth; Schoor claimed that the President replied, "We['ve] got millions 
of opportunities for kids. But they['ve] got to be shown, they['ve] got 
to be guided, they['ve] got to be helped. If you get the kids when they're 
young, why, hell, the kid walking down the street could be ... the next 
heavyweight champion of the world."[6] Inspired, Schoor's restaurant group 
formed Kid Galahad Boxers to invest in and nurture the careers of young, 
unknown boxers. To attract talent, in January 1962 they bought an ad in 
the New York Times which began: "$10,000 A YEAR WHILE YOU LEARN. A newly 
formed syndicate of sportsmen and businessmen is anxious to sponsor the 
next heavyweight champion. This group of sportsmen will underwrite all 
expenses of the chosen candidates and will pay a salary of $10,000 a year 
for the full training period. If you are between 19 and 25 years of age—if 
you weigh upwards of 186 pounds—if you are at least 6 feet tall—then you 
qualify for an interview."[6] Intrigued by the ad, the Times phoned Schoor. 
"I started to ad-lib right there," Schoor recalled; at the time (as Sports 
Illustrated later put it), his group "had little more than an idea, a restaurant 
and a shoeshine." Greatly exaggerating, Schoor told the Times he had "a 
syndicate and we've got $100,000." The Times ran a long Sunday article 
about the subject, and "[t]he phones never stopped ringing for a week.... 
There were letters, phone calls, wires from all over the country, from 
Australia, Germany, every place. We were struggling to run a new restaurant, 
and we didn't know where the hell we'd get any kind of money. My partners 
said, 'Hey, what ... are we gonna do about all this?'"[6] Without money, 
they did nothing. Three months later, however, "a wealthy New York construction 
man" offered to sponsor construction jobs at $158 a week (more than $1000 
in 2011 dollars), which Schoor's group advertised as financial assistance 
to any suitable prospect "while he learns to be the next world champion." 
Six men were hired for such jobs, while more than forty others were trained 
and promoted in professional bouts. The group's first major prospect (but 
at least fiftieth client) was James J. Beattie; at 6 feet 8 3/4 inches 
and 240 pounds, he was said at the time to be "the biggest boxer to ever 
enter the ring." Beattie won his professional debut with a knockout only 
24 seconds into the first round,[16] and went on to win 41 fights.[17] 
(He also appeared (billed as "Jim Beattie") in the Hollywood film The Great 
White Hope as the eponymous boxer.[18]) In 1960, Schoor sued former heavyweight 
boxing champion Rocky Marciano, claiming that Marciano had punched him 
during a dispute over Schoor's work as Marciano's ghost-writer. "I passed 
out," Schoor alleged in his court complaint; "Bells have been ringing in 
my head ever since and I had a fuzzy feeling for weeks." Although Marciano 
denied the claim, in April 1963 a New York court awarded Schoor $5000 damages 
(more than $30,000 in 2011 dollars).[2] In 1975 Schoor was engaged in a 
dispute over the sale of letters from a young John Kennedy to his parents, 
which Schoor had used extensively in his work.[19] In 1994, Schoor sued 
Kennedy biographer Nigel Hamilton and publisher Random House for $20 million, 
claiming that material in the defendants' best-selling book JFK: Reckless 
Youth had been appropriated, without payment or proper acknowledgment, 
from Schoor's research files (including extensive interview notes). Schoor 
was represented by "heavyweight lawyer" (the New York Times' phrase) Barry 
Slotnick.[20] According to Appel, "The last two years of his life were 
spent at a home for the aged in Manhattan. His wife had died, he had no 
other family [note: Appel adds a postscript suggesting Schoor had an illegitimate 
son], and the nursing home costs depleted all of his remaining money. Kind 
people at the home tried to sell his remaining author copies of his own 
books to get him some spending cash, but he was suffering from mild dementia
