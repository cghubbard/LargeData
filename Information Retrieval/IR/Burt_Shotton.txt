As player As manager Burton Edwin Shotton (October 18, 1884 – July 29, 
1962) was an American player, manager, coach and scout in Major League 
Baseball. As manager of the Brooklyn Dodgers (1947; 1948–50), he won two 
National League pennants and served as Jackie Robinson's first permanent 
Major League manager. Shotton was born in Brownhelm, a township in Lorain 
County, Ohio. In his playing days, he was a speedy outfielder — he was 
nicknamed "Barney" after race car driver Barney Oldfield — who batted left-handed 
and threw right-handed. The 5 ft 11 in (1.80 m), 175 lb (79 kg) Shotton 
compiled a .271 batting average with 1,338 hits in 1,387 Major League games 
played for the St. Louis Browns, Washington Senators and St. Louis Cardinals 
(1909; 1911–23). Although he stole over 40 bases in four consecutive seasons 
(1913–16), he was also caught stealing over 26 times in each of those seasons. 
In an American League dominated by speedsters such as Ty Cobb and Clyde 
Milan, Shotton was never among the top five base stealers in the league, 
and he had a high rate of being caught stealing, but he pilfered 294 bases 
during his MLB career. His real talent, however, may be shown in his on-base 
percentage, in which he finished in the top ten in the league four times 
in his career. He twice (in 1913 and 1916) led AL batters in walks,[1] 
and finished in the top ten six seasons.[2] In the early 1920s, as a player 
and coach, he was the Cardinals' "Sunday manager", relieving skipper Branch 
Rickey, who always observed the Christian Sabbath. Rickey and Shotton had 
formed a longstanding friendship and professional relationship dating back 
to their years together (1913–15) with the Browns, when Rickey was his 
manager. After Shotton retired as a player, he was on the Cardinals' coaching 
staff from 1923–25[3] until he took over as manager of their top farm club, 
the Syracuse Stars of the International League, in 1926–27.[4] Shotton's 
first formal Major League managing opportunity came with the NL's then-habitual 
tailending team, the Philadelphia Phillies. He lasted six seasons (1928–33) 
with the Phils, who twice lost more than 100 games during his tenure. The 
Shotton-era Phillies included two notable teams. The 1930 edition compiled 
a team batting average of .315 (paced by Chuck Klein's .386 and Lefty O'Doul's 
.380) and scored 944 runs; but the Phillie pitching staff allowed 1,199 
runs and posted a horrendous 6.71 earned run average as the team finished 
last, at 52–102.[5] Then, only two years later, the 1932 club compiled 
a 78–76 record, good enough for fourth place in the National League. It 
would be the Phillies' only winning season and first-division finish between 
1917 and 1949. Altogether, Shotton's win-loss mark in Philadelphia was 
370–549 (.403). After coaching for the Cincinnati Reds (in 1934, including 
a 1–1 record as interim manager) and Cleveland Indians (1942–45), and, 
in between, returning to the Cardinals for a seven-year stint (1935–41) 
managing their top-level Rochester Red Wings and Columbus Red Birds farm 
clubs, Shotton hung up his uniform in 1946 and settled into a scouting 
role for the Brooklyn Dodgers, for whom Rickey was now part-owner, president 
and general manager. On the eve of the 1947 season, Shotton received a 
telegram from Rickey. "Be in Brooklyn in the morning. Call nobody, see 
no one", it admonished.[4] Flying immediately from his Florida home to 
New York, not knowing what to expect, Shotton was ushered into Rickey's 
presence. Leo Durocher, the Dodgers' iconic manager since 1939, had been 
suspended for the entire 1947 campaign by Baseball Commissioner Happy Chandler 
for "conduct detrimental to baseball."[6] In his search for a temporary 
replacement, Rickey had been rebuffed by former New York Yankees manager 
Joe McCarthy (then in retirement) and two of Durocher's coaches, Clyde 
Sukeforth (who managed the first two games of the season on an emergency 
basis) and Ray Blades. Rickey pleaded with Shotton to take over the Dodgers 
for the season. Then 62, and convinced that his on-field career was over, 
Shotton reluctantly took the reins on April 18, still in street clothes. 
(Shotton was one of the last baseball managers to wear everyday apparel 
rather than the club uniform. Unlike Connie Mack, however, he did usually 
add his team's cap and jacket.) He inherited what historian Jules Tygiel 
called Baseball's Great Experiment — the Dodgers' breaking of the infamous 
color line by bringing up Jackie Robinson from their Triple-A Montreal 
Royals farm club at the start of the 1947 season to end over sixty years 
of racial segregation in baseball. The rookie was facing withering insults 
from opposing players, and a petition by Dodger players protesting Robinson's 
presence had only recently been quashed by Durocher. Shotton's calm demeanor, 
however, provided the quiet leadership the Dodgers needed. They won the 
National League pennant by five games, and took the New York Yankees to 
seven games in the 1947 World Series. In Game 4 of the Fall Classic, Shotton 
helped to thwart Bill Bevens' no-hit bid in the ninth inning — sending 
into the game two pinch hitters and two pinch runners in an attempt to 
overcome a 2–1 deficit. The gambit worked, as Dodger pinch hitter Cookie 
Lavagetto drove home both pinch runners, Al Gionfriddo and Eddie Miksis, 
with his opposite-field double — Brooklyn's only hit — for a 3–2 victory.[7] 
With Durocher's suspension over, Shotton retired again, this time to a 
front office post as "managerial consultant" in the Dodgers' vast farm 
system. But the 1948 Dodgers did not respond to Durocher's return; they 
even (briefly, on May 24) fell into the NL cellar. Durocher was still under 
siege by the Catholic Youth Organization because of his extramarital relationship 
with, and then quick marriage to, actress Laraine Day. With the New York 
Giants also floundering, owner Horace Stoneham decided to replace his manager, 
Mel Ott, with Shotton. He called Rickey to ask permission to speak with 
Shotton about the Giants' job, and was stunned when Rickey offered him 
the opportunity to hire Durocher instead.[8] On July 16, 1948, Durocher 
moved from Brooklyn to Upper Manhattan to take over the Giants. The following 
day, Shotton was back in the Dodger dugout — still in street clothes. On 
that day, Brooklyn was 37–37 and in fourth place, 8 1⁄2 games behind the 
Boston Braves. After his return, the Dodgers rallied to take the lead in 
the 1948 NL standings by the end of August, before they faltered in September 
to finish third, 7 1⁄2 games behind Boston. Then, in 1949, Shotton won 
his second pennant, with Brooklyn capturing 97 regular-season victories 
to finish a game ahead of the Cardinals. Robinson won the National League's 
Most Valuable Player award and batting championship. But Brooklyn again 
bowed to the Yankees in the World Series, this time in only five games. 
Despite Shotton's two pennants in three seasons, however, he continually 
faced criticism from Durocher loyalists on the Dodgers, who claimed that 
Shotton was a poor game strategist and lacked Durocher's competitive intensity. 
Because he eschewed wearing a uniform, Shotton was prohibited from stepping 
onto the field of play during games and remained in the dugout during arguments 
with umpires and pitching changes while one of his uniformed coaches assumed 
those tasks.[9] Shotton also had severe critics within the press, notably 
New York Daily News baseball writer Dick Young, who came to refer to him 
in print only by the acronym KOBS, short for "Kindly Old Burt Shotton." 
Shotton's poor relationship with the New York media partly was self-inflicted: 
according to author Roger Kahn, he alienated and infuriated the New York 
Herald-Tribune's Harold Rosenthal by repeatedly addressing him as "Rosenberg" 
and "Rosenbloom."[6][10] In 1950, despite chronic pitching woes, Shotton 
guided the Dodgers to within a game of first place on the final day of 
the season. When Dick Sisler's tenth-inning home run off Don Newcombe won 
the pennant for the Phillies' "Whiz Kids", the Dodger season was over. 
So was Shotton's managerial career. Rickey was forced from the Brooklyn 
front office by new majority owner Walter O'Malley at the end of the 1950 
season. Back home in Winter Haven, Florida, Shotton ignored O'Malley's 
repeated suggestions that he fly to Brooklyn to "discuss [his] future", 
declaring, "I don't intend to go all the way up there just to be fired." 
Indeed, O'Malley had already decided on Chuck Dressen as his new manager; 
his hiring was formally announced November 28. In contrast to Shotton, 
the fiery Dressen would be conspicuous on the field wearing uniform No. 
7 and doubling as Brooklyn's 1951 third-base coach.[11] Shotton's last 
connection with baseball was as a consultant for Rickey's Continental League, 
the planned "third major league" that ultimately forced expansion of MLB 
in 1961–62. In 1960, Rickey, the CL president, engaged him to assist and 
supervise the managers in the Western Carolinas League, a Class D minor 
league originally set up to groom talent for the CL.[12] Shotton died in 
Lake Wales, Florida, from a heart attack at age 77 during the second All-Star 
break in 1962. Although his career win-loss record as a big league manager 
was 697–764 (.477), his mark with the Dodgers was 326–215 (.603). According 
to an informal study by researchers at the National Baseball Hall of Fame, 
the last manager to wear street clothes is believed to be Burt Shotton 
of the Brooklyn Dodgers, who last managed a game on October 1, 1950.[13] 
(Connie Mack, who famously wore a full suit during his 50 years as manager 
of the Philadelphia Athletics, also retired on October 1, 1950, but his 
game that day ended earlier.)[14] In the 2013 film 42, Shotton is played
