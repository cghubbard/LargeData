Inherited runners or inherited baserunners are the runners on base when 
a relief pitcher enters the game. Since a previous pitcher has allowed 
these runners to reach base (or was simply pitching when the runners reached 
base, such as in the case of a fielding error), any inherited runners who 
score when the relief pitcher is pitching are charged to the previous pitcher's 
runs allowed and/or earned runs allowed total, depending on how each runner 
reached base. Modern box scores list how many runners each relief pitcher 
inherits (if any), and how many of those inherited runners the relief pitcher 
allows to score, called inherited runs allowed. "The success of most pitchers 
is based on statistics such as won-loss record, ERA or saves, but the unsung 
"innings eater" is judged by how many innings he pitches and the impact 
his work has on the rest of the staff. "'I don't have a whole lot of goals 
going into the season. I don't shoot for a certain ERA or a certain strikeout 
number or certain number of wins', says Blanton, entering his second full 
season. 'I try to go out and get a quality start every time, six innings 
or more, and not miss any starts. I feel if I can do that, I'll get my 
200 innings in a year and everything else falls into place with that' ".[1]
