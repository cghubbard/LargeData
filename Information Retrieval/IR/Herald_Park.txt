Herald Park (also known as Houston Base Ball Park, Fair Ground Park,[5] 
and League Park[3]) was a baseball park located in Houston, Texas and was 
the home of the Houston Buffaloes from 1888 until 1904. It also served 
as the spring training facility for the Louisville Colonels and the St. 
Louis Cardinals in the National League of Major League Baseball in 1895 
and 1904 respectively. The ballpark existed near the Houston fairgrounds 
at the intersection of Travis Street and McGowen Street on the eastern 
edge of Fourth Ward. Today, Houston's Reef restaurant sits on the location 
of Herald Park. In 2016, the Texas Historical Commission commemorated the 
ballpark by placing a historical marker on the location. On July 2, 1884, 
a meeting was held in the office J. W. Mitchell that decided to issue 120 
shares of stock at $10 each for the purpose of preparing a baseball park.[6] 
Mitchell, along with W. H. Coyle and Colonel Will Childress headed a committee 
to sell such shares. Built in a largely unpopulated area of prairie land, 
on the grounds of the State Fair of Texas, fences and a grandstand were 
erected on the site by 1885.[3] The ballpark became the home of the semi-professional 
Houston Heralds club in 1887, and the site became known as "Herald Park".[7] 
The Heralds were named as such because their owner, William H. Bailey, 
also owned the local newspaper called the Houston Herald. Although the 
Heralds team ceased after that season, many continued to refer to the ballpark 
by this name well into the 20th century. Two big-league ball clubs barnstormed 
through Houston in 1887, the New York Giants and the St. Louis Browns, 
and played at Herald Park. When the Browns played, they faced a team composed 
of five from the Chicago White Stockings, two from the Pittsburg Alleghenys, 
and two from Cincinnati Red Stockings.[8] The Red Stockings as a whole 
returned to Houston the following season, but this time as the opponent 
of Houston's first fully professional ball club in their first ever game.[9] 
Herald Park was the site of the first modern Texas League game between 
Houston and Galveston on April 1, 1888. Houston won the game 4-1. On April 
28, 1889, a mysterious fire burned down the grandstand, the ladies stand, 
reporters' stand, and soda stand.[10] Rebuilt soon thereafter, none of 
the property was insured, and an estimated total cost of damage was $1,200 
(equivalent to $31,658 in 2015). The first night game was held at Herald 
Park on July 22, 1892 when Houston manager John McCloskey ordered arc lights 
to be placed on the field in a game against Galveston.[3][11] The Louisville 
Colonels of the National League became the first big league ball club to 
come to Houston for spring training in 1895 as Herald Park was their home, 
while the Chicago White Stockings (now known as the Chicago Cubs) made 
their home in nearby Galveston.[12] The two teams played each other frequently 
with the use of the interurban.[13] In 1898, the ballpark received renovations 
when the left field fence was moved one hundred feet and the diamond moved 
fifty feet out toward Main Street.[4] A plank for fans to walk from the 
streetcar landing to the gate was also added. The ballpark served as the 
spring training facility for the St. Louis Cardinals, also of the National 
League, in 1904.[14] It was the beginning of a long history of that club 
with Houston, as they returned for spring training in 1906 through 1908 
at West End Park, and then purchased an eighteen percent share of the Houston 
Buffaloes before making them the first minor league farm team in 1921. 
The ballpark's demise was foreshadowed by a 1903 meeting of the Fourth 
Ward Civic Club, where they advocated removal of the park.[15] Although 
owned by the Houston Electric Company throughout the majority of its existence, 
the ball park was sold to a real estate development company before the 
beginning of the 1904 season.[7] However, on April 5, 1904, it was announced 
that Houston would continue to use the ballpark at least until August because 
the developers were not yet ready to build on the site.[16] Throughout 
the season, development did eventually begin before August, and the size 
of the field was necessarily modified. Game rules became inventive to accommodate 
the shrunken size.[7] Houston's professional baseball team played its last 
game at the park against the Beaumont Millionaires on July 1, 1904.[17] 
West End Park, the permanent successor to Herald Park, was constructed 
and opened in April 1905. Houston center fielder Ollie Pickering set a 
Texas League record for singles in the season opener game and Pickering's 
Texas League debut against the Fort Worth Panthers on May 21, 1892 at Herald 
Park.[18] According to the April 21, 1906 edition of Sporting Life, this 
game was the origin of the "Texas Leaguer" term used to describe a single 
that falls just outside the infield because Pickering's first seven at 
bats were consecutively successful in this manner.[19] This Texas League 
record still stands today.[20] Herald Park also occasionally served as 
a venue for American football games. Galveston's Ball High School played 
a game against a team from Houston known as the "Olympics" on November 
26, 1896.[21] The same Houston team would then play against TCU in that 
university's second ever game on December 19, 1896.[22] The next month, 
the Olympics played Houston High School.[23] Herald Park also served as 
a neutral football site on several occasions. Texas A&M was defeated by 
Sewanee there,[24] but would return for their next game against Tulane 
to be victorious.[25] Herald Park was served by the Houston Electric Company's 
South End line, which provided street car access during its time.[26] With 
transfers from Houston's Grand Central Station, this allowed for direct 
public transportation using interurban lines such as the Galvestonâ€“Houston
