The 1973 Minnesota Twins finished 81-81, third in the American League West. 
With the American League's new designated hitter rule taking effect, on 
April 6 in Oakland, California, Tony Oliva became the first DH to hit a 
home run. On July 3, Tony Oliva hit three home runs against the Kansas 
City Royals. The Twins-record feat was accomplished twice before, by both 
Bob Allison and Harmon Killebrew in 1963. Two Twins made the All-Star Game: 
second baseman Rod Carew and pitcher Bert Blyleven. 907,499 fans attended 
Twins games, the third lowest total in the American League. On September 
27, California Angels pitcher Nolan Ryan struck out sixteen Twins and set 
a major league season mark of 383 strikeouts. Minnesota's Rich Reese was 
Ryan's 383rd victim. Pitcher Bert Blyleven finished with a 20-17 record 
and set several team records: total innings pitched (325.0), complete games 
(25), shutouts (9), strikeouts (258). Rod Carew won his third AL batting 
title with a .350 average. Bobby Darwin continued to show potential as 
a hitter with 18 home runs and 90 RBI. Tony Oliva limped through the season, 
hitting 16 HR and collecting 92 RBI. Bert Blyleven won 20 games for the 
first time, and three other pitchers had double digit wins: Jim Kaat (11-12), 
Dick Woodson (10-8), and Joe Decker (10-10). Kaat also won his 12th Gold 
Glove Award. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] Infielders
