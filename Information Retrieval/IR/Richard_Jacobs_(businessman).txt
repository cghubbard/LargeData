businessman and real estate developer who co-founded the Richard E. Jacobs 
Group.[1] Jacobs was born in 1925 in Akron, Ohio[2] In 1943, he served 
in the Army during World War II.[2] In 1949, he graduated from Indiana 
University with a degree in business administration and accepted a job 
with a development company in Akron.[2] In 1955, he and his brother, David 
H. Jacobs, started a general contracting company that concentrated on the 
building of small strip malls. The company grew rapidly and by 1992, the 
Jacobs Group ranked fourth in the nation in the development and management 
of enclosed malls owning 40 malls in 16 states outright; they also owned 
31 Wendy’s fast-food restaurants and several Marriott hotels.[2] The Jacobs

formerly Jacobs Field, in Cleveland bore his family name from its opening 
in 1994 until early 2008. Jacob's tenure as Indians owner marked one of 
the team's most successful periods, having reached the World Series on 
two occasions (1995, and 1997), and winning divisional championships in 
five consecutive seasons (1995-1999). Jacobs also owned the Pier House
