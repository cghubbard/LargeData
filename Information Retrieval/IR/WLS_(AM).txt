WLS (890 kHz, "89 WLS") is a commercial AM radio station licensed to Chicago, 
Illinois. Owned by Cumulus Media, WLS has its studios in The Loop section 
of Chicago, and its non-directional broadcast tower is located on the southern 
edge of Tinley Park, Illinois.[3][4] WLS is a Class A station broadcasting 
on the clear-channel frequency of 890 kHz with 50,000 watts of power using 
C-QUAM AM Stereo.[5] The station's daytime groundwave service contour covers 
portions of five states[6] while at night its signal routinely reaches 
38 states[7] via skywave. The station's programming is also available to 
listeners in the Chicago metropolitan area with an HD Radio receiver via 
a simulcast on the HD2 subchannel of sister station WLS-FM. Despite different 
owners, WLS and ABC owned-and-operated WLS-TV (Channel 7) maintain a strong 
partnership. WLS has a talk radio format, with its weekday programming 
consisting of local hosts and nationally syndicated shows such as Rush 
Limbaugh, Michael Savage, Mark Levin, "Red Eye Radio" and "First Light." 
Limbaugh is syndicated by Premiere Networks and the rest are from Westwood 
One, a subsidiary of Cumulus Media. Local hosts include "Big" John Howell, 
long-time Chicago radio host Jonathan Brandmeier (Brandmeier's program 
is based at WLS, but is syndicated nationally), and veteran Chicago radio 
personality Steve Dahl. hosts afternoons. Weekends feature programs on 
money, real estate, auto repair and brokered programming. Syndicated weekend 
shows include Kim Komando, Bob Brinker, John Batchelor, Ric Edelman and 
Larry Kudlow. WLS carries Notre Dame Fighting Irish football and basketball 
games[8][9] and has done so since the 2006 season.[8][9] Starting with 
the 2016 season, WLS is the flagship station of the Chicago White Sox baseball 
team. In the 2016-17 season, WLS will be the flagship for the Chicago Bulls 
basketball team.[10] In the 1920s, Sears, Roebuck and Company was a major 
retail and mail order company. To get farmers and people in rural communities 
to buy radio sets from its catalogs, Sears bought time on radio stations, 
and then decided to form its own station.[11] Just before the permanent 
station was ready, Sears began broadcasts on March 21, 1924 as WBBX with 
noon programs using the WMAQ studios.[1] WLS was one of the original 50,000-watt 
Class I-A clear-channel stations which did not share its (original) frequency 
of 870 AM with any other station during nighttime (sunset to sunrise) hours, 
when AM radio signals can travel long distances via skywave. Sears broadcast 
test transmissions from its own permanent studios on April 9, 10 and 11, 
1924, using the call sign WES (for "World's Economy Store"). On April 12, 
1924, the station commenced officially, using the call letters WLS (for 
"World's Largest Store"); and on April 19, aired its first National Barn 
Dance.[1] Sears originally operated its station at its Chicago headquarters 
on Chicago's West Side where the company's mail order business was located. 
Sears then moved the WLS studios into the Sherman House hotel in downtown 
Chicago.[12] Sears opened the station in 1924 as a service to farmers and 
subsequently sold it to the Prairie Farmer magazine in 1928.[13] The station 
moved to the Prairie Farmer Building on West Washington in Chicago, where 
it remained for 32 years.[14] For a few months after ABC's 1960 purchase 
of it and the format change, the "bright new sound" that began in May 1960 
was broadcast from the Prairie Farmer Building. WLS didn't make the move 
to downtown Michigan Avenue's Stone Container Building, located at 360 
North Michigan Avenue, until October of that year.[15] Thirty years later, 
it would move once more, to its present location at 190 North State in 
downtown Chicago.[16][17] It was the scene of the National Barn Dance, 
which featured Gene Autry, Pat Buttram, and George Gobel, and which was 
second only to the Grand Ole Opry (itself a local National Barn Dance spinoff) 
in presenting country music and humor.[18][19] The station also experimented 
successfully in many forms of news broadcasting, including weather and 
crop reports. Its most famous news broadcast was the eyewitness report 
of the Hindenburg disaster by Herbert Morrison.[20] Morrison and engineer 
Charles Nehlsen had been sent to New Jersey by WLS to cover the arrival 
of the Hindenburg for delayed broadcast. Their recordings aired the next 
day on May 7, 1937,[21] the first time that recordings of a news event 
were ever broadcast. Starting in the 1930s, WLS was an affiliate of the 
Blue Network of the National Broadcasting Company (NBC), and as such aired 
the popular Fibber McGee and Molly and Lum and Abner comedy programs (both 
produced at the studios of Chicago's NBC-owned stations, WENR and WMAQ) 
during their early years. When the Federal Communications Commission forced 
NBC to sell the Blue Network, WLS maintained its affiliation with the network 
under its new identity, the American Broadcasting Company (ABC). Under 
this affiliation, some programs from the network that were not commercially 
sponsored or which were scheduled to cross the time that WLS and WENR shifted 
its use of the same frequency (such as baseball or football games) were 
transferred to air on a third Blue Network/ABC affiliate in Chicago, WCFL. 
Blue/ABC network broadcasts of addresses by labor leaders were also shifted 
away from WLS and WENR to WCFL, which was owned at the time by the Chicago 
Federation of Labor. WENR became active in late 1924 and early 1925, the 
creation of E. N. Rauland, whose company manufactured the All-American 
brand of radios. Rauland started with 10 watts on 1030 kHz in 1924; on 
March 19, 1925, he received his license for WENR at 100 watts. By late 
1925 WENR was using a 1,000-watt transmitter designed by Rauland himself.[22] 
The station quickly entered into a time-sharing agreement with WBCN, owned 
at that time by the Chicago Southtown newspaper. The two stations changed 
frequencies to 1040 kHz a year later.[23] By 1927, Chicago investor Samuel 
Insull had taken serious interest in both stations. A founding partner 
of KYW, he sold his interest in it and had started Great Lakes Broadcasting. 
Insull purchased both stations, paying $1 million for WENR alone.[23][24] 
Under Insull's management, the two stations once more changed frequencies, 
this time to 870 kHz, when the combined stations became the first Chicago 
radio station operating under 50,000 watts of power from a new transmitter 
in Downers Grove, Illinois in 1929. Insull's Great Lakes Broadcasting holdings 
also included a mechanical television station, W9XR, which went on the 
air after the Downers Grove transmitter was installed.[24][25][26] Insull 
moved his stations first into Chicago's Strauss Building, and then to his 
own Civic Opera House.[23][24][27] The investor's fortune began dwindling 
by 1931; Insull then sold the licenses of both stations to National Broadcasting 
Company. By early 1933, WBCN's call letters had left the airwaves and the 
frequency was occupied by WENR, which became part of NBC's Blue Network, 
and by WLS. NBC shut down W9XR by 1933, just as it had done with WX9AP, 
which it acquired in its purchase of radio station WMAQ.[12][23][24][28][29] 
Changes were made regarding AM frequencies in 1941 as a result of the North 
American Regional Broadcasting Agreement; this moved WENR and WLS from 
870 to 890 kHz.[24] In August 1943, NBC was ordered to divest itself of 
the Blue Network and its stations; WENR and Blue were sold to Edward J. 
Noble. In 1945 the Blue Network would be renamed as the American Broadcasting 
Company.[30] The 1931 sale of the station to NBC moved WENR from the Civic 
Opera House to the Merchandise Mart, NBC's Chicago headquarters. The station 
continued on at the Mart until 1952 by becoming NBC's tenant, moving back 
to the Civic Opera House in that year.[31] Paul Harvey's Chicago broadcasting 
career began at WENR.[32] WENR and WLS used the same frequencies in a time-sharing 
arrangement until 1954, when ABC (then known as American Broadcasting-Paramount 
Theatres) bought a 50 percent interest in WLS and combined the stations.[1][33] 
In November 1959, ABC announced its purchase of the Prairie Farmer and 
its half of WLS, giving ABC full ownership of the station.[34] On May 2, 
1960, at 6 a.m., WLS went full-time Rock and Roll/Top 40. Mort Crowley[35] 
was the first on-air voice of the new WLS; the first song played was "Alley-Oop" 
by the Hollywood Argyles,[36] four full weeks before it debuted on the 
Hot 100. The first DJs were Sam Holman and Ralph Beaudin. WLS then quickly 
hired Bob Hale, Gene Taylor, Mort Crowley, Jim Dunbar and star disc jockey 
Dick Biondi (a 1998 inductee of the National Radio Hall of Fame)[37] from 
WEBR in Buffalo, New York.[38][39][40] Other notable disc jockeys who worked 
at WLS in the 1960s include Clark Weber, Art Roberts,[41][42][43] Ron "Ringo" 
Riley,.[44] Late in the 1960s, then into the 1970s and beyond came Larry 
Lujack,[45] Dex Card,[46] Clark Weber, Chuck Buell, Kris Erik Stevens, 
Joel Sebastian, Gary Gears, Jerry Kay, Bob Sirott, John Records Landecker, 
Yvonne Daniels,[47] Steve Dahl, Garry Meier, Brant Miller, Tom Kent, Steve 
King, Jeff Davis, and Tommy Edwards.[15] Some of the production directors 
responsible for the sound of WLS were Ray Van Steen, Hal Widsten, Jim Hampton, 
Bill Price and Tommy Edwards. In the 1960s, WLS was a major force in introducing 
new music and recording artists. The first US airplay of a record by The 
Beatles ("Please Please Me") was on Dick Biondi's show on February 8, 1963.[48][49][50] 
WLS was voted by broadcasters nationally as "The Station of the Year" in 
1967, 1968 and 1969. John Rook was named "Program Director of the Year" 
in 1968 and 1969 as WLS was estimated attracting 4.2 million listeners 
weekly by Pulse research.[51] Dr. Cody Sweet became the voice of "WLS Super 
Summer Radio" in 1967.[citation needed] The WLS News Department included 
Lyle Dean,[52] Jeff Hendrix, Catherine Johns, Dick Harley, Harley Carnes, 
Linda Marshall, Karen Hand, Jim Johnson, Jerry Golden, Jim Wynne, Stan 
Dale, Bill Guthrie and Les Grobstein was the Stations Sports Director. 
Currently Harley Carnes broadcasts news during the day on weekdays at the 
top of the hour on CBS affiliates.[53] WLS also produced the weekly Silver 
Dollar Survey[54][55] from October 14, 1960, to December 22, 1967, broken 
by the Silver Beatle Survey on February 21, 1964 (see picture to the right) 
and the Super Summer Survey from May 5, 1967, to August 25, 1967. The survey 
nominally contained 40 current listings, except for occasional weeks when 
it contained less current listings, usually 20, plus a special listing 
of greatest oldies. From 18 September 1964 through 25 December 1964, the 
survey consisted of the top 30 pop hits, followed by the top 10 R&B hits. 
Thereafter, the survey changed its name numerous times (89 WLS Hit Parade, 
89 WLS Chicagoland Hit Parade, WLS Musicradio 89, etc.).[56] Starting with 
the July 20, 1970 survey, the number of listings dropped from 40 to 30, 
then varying from 25 to 40 starting June 26, 1972, then dropping to 15 
by March 9, 1974, then increasing to a high of 45 by the end of 1975. No 
"take home" surveys were printed from March 13, 1972, through July 16, 
1973 (these were limited to one poster-size weekly survey displayed at 
record shops).[57] The year-end listing was the 20 greatest hits of the 
year for each year from 1963 through 1966, increased to 89 from 1967 onward.[58] 
By the mid-1970s, WLS became conservative about introducing new songs, 
and many record promoters referred to the station as the "World's Last 
Station" to add new releases for airplay, usually only after the songs 
had reached the top 10 on Billboard's Hot 100. (However, in 1974, the station 
started playing the track "Lady" by the Chicago band Styx from an older 
album of theirs,[59] resulting in other stations around the country adding 
the song and making the track Styx' first national Top 40 hit.) During 
the 1970s WLS ran a Sunday night music interview program called "Music 
People." Well into the 1980s, WLS continued as a mainstream Top 40 formatted 
station. By 1985, the station evolved into more of a Hot AC format. In 
1986, WLS began airing evening talk programming as its ratings were on 
a steady decline. Like many AM radio stations of the seventies, WLS edited 
many of the songs they played into a more "radio-friendly" or "radio edit" 
(a term still used today) format, usually 3–4 minutes in length. Even songs 
that were only 4 minutes in length as a single were sometimes edited. Of 
course even longer songs, such as Elton John's "Philadelphia Freedom" and 
"Someone Saved My Life Tonight", were heavily edited for time. Other special 
editions of some Top 40 songs exclusively made for their broadcasting were 
done by the musicians themselves or sometimes by the WLS audio engineers. 
Among these were: By 1987, WLS was an adult contemporary station during 
the day and talk at night. Their approach was no longer music intensive. 
By 1988, the station evolved into a soft AC format with very little (if 
any) current product, and liberally laced with oldies. By this time, the 
station focused more on personality and less on music, including a Sunday 
night late night talk show called "Sex Talk" and a daily late night sports 
related talk show.[60] In June 1989, WLS announced it was going all-talk 
by the end of the summer.[61] Rumors were that the change was to happen 
September 1. Air personalities were becoming more talk intensive anyway 
and midday talk was added as well. But quietly, with no warning, on August 
23, 1989, at 7 P.M., WLS stopped playing music altogether. Phil Duncan 
was the last DJ to play music on WLS, and as Duncan finished up his show, 
a voice in the back of the studio (that of then-WYTZ worker Steven Craig) 
was heard saying "Goodnight!" (Craig unknowingly (and unofficially) became 
the last live voice on Musicradio WLS.) Appropriately, the last song was 
"Just You 'n' Me" by Chicago. WLS then became a talk station, with Sally 
Jesse Raphael as its first host. In the beginning of the talk format, WLS 
featured high-rated talk talents from around the country, such as Bob Lassiter 
from Tampa Bay, Stacy Taylor from San Diego and the station's biggest hit, 
Rush Limbaugh out of New York.[62] After a few years, however, Lassiter, 
Taylor and some of their other national hosts were dropped in favor of 
more local hosts. Jay Marvin also had several stints on WLS, where he was 
one of the few liberal voices on its political talk shows, which had mostly 
conservative viewpoints. The station iserved as the "flagship" broadcast 
outlet for the Sunday night, national political talk show, Beyond the Beltway 
with Bruce DuMont.[63] By 1992, WLS had such low ratings that ABC's national 
management was planning on flipping the station to a satellite-fed country 
format (management went so far as to distribute an all-staff memo and hosts 
being told they were about to be let go). However, in what was described 
as an "eleventh hour decision", ABC cancelled the planned format change 
due to convincing from local management. Throughout the 1990s, ratings 
began to grow, with the station occasionally ranked in the Top 10.[64] 
On Memorial Day, 2007, WLS took a cue from sister station WABC and ran 
a special day of musical programming, "The Big 89 Rewind," featuring live 
visits from Larry Lujack, Tommy Edwards,[65] Fred Winston, Chris Shebel, 
Jeff Davis, John Records Landecker, Tom Kent, and other D.J.s, sounders, 
and airchecks from the Musicradio era.[66] The broadcasts re-aired on Independence 
Day 2007, and there was a new Rewind in 2008.[67] ABC-owned radio stations 
which were not affiliated with ESPN Radio or Radio Disney, including WLS, 
were sold to Citadel Broadcasting on June 12, 2007, with Citadel licensing 
the name ABC Radio for 2 years after the sale.[68][69][70] Citadel was 
bought by Cumulus Media on September 16, 2011.[71] Cumulus Media terminated 
its affiliation with overnight radio program Coast to Coast AM on many 
of its stations, including WLS, in the spring of 2012, substituting its 
own Red Eye Radio. Longtime morning show hosts Don and Roma Wade retired 
in December 2012. They had been off the air since October due to Don Wade's 
cancer treatments. On September 6, 2013, Don Wade died of a brain tumor. 
His wife and on air co-host Roma posted his death on the WLS web page, 
and the news spread through the news and on Facebook.[72] Cumulus radio 
stations made their final break with ABC at the end of 2014, when they 
no longer carried ABC Radio News. WLS and most Cumulus news/talk stations 
began running Westwood One News on January 1, 2015. (Westwood One is a 
Cumulus subsidiary.) On June 23, 2015, WLS announced that they had picked 
up broadcasting rights for Chicago White Sox baseball starting with the 
2016 season. In addition, WLS had also picked up broadcasting rights for
