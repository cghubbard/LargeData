John Calvin Klippstein (October 17, 1927 – October 10, 2003) was an American 
pitcher in Major League Baseball (mostly as a reliever) for a number of 
teams throughout his career. The most prominent portion of his career was 
spent early on with the Chicago Cubs (1950–1954). In 18 years, he finished 
with a 101–118 record and a 4.24 ERA in 711 games (161 starts). He had 
1158 strikeouts in 1,967 2/3 innings pitched. Klippstein was often known 
for his control problems. He won a World Series with the Los Angeles Dodgers 
in 1959, but played a much more significant role in the Minnesota Twins 
pennant run in 1965. He was the son-in-law of former pitcher Dutch Leonard. 
Klippstein was tied (with Mike Fornieles) for the league lead in saves 
in 1960 when he had 14. Klippstein died while listening to a radio broadcast 
of the Cubs versus Florida Marlins game of the National League Championship
