Hugo Francis Bezdek (April 1, 1884 – September 19, 1952) was a Czech American 
sports figure who played American football and was a coach of football, 
basketball, and baseball. He was the head football coach at the University 
of Oregon (1906, 1913–1917), the University of Arkansas (1908–1912), Pennsylvania 
State University (1918–1929), and Delaware Valley College (1949). Bezdek 
also coached the Mare Island Marines in the 1918 Rose Bowl and the Cleveland 
Rams of the National Football League (NFL) in 1937 and part of the 1938 
season. In addition, Bezdek coached basketball at Oregon (1906–1907, 1913–1917) 
and Penn State (1919), coached baseball at Arkansas (1909–1913), Oregon 
(1914–1917) and Penn State (1920–1930), and served as the manager of Major 
League Baseball's Pittsburgh Pirates (1917–1919). He was inducted into 
the College Football Hall of Fame as a coach in 1954. After playing as 
a fullback at the University of Chicago, Bezdek began his football coaching 
career at the University of Oregon in 1906, but left after a year to become 
head coach at the University of Arkansas. Arkansas athletic teams carried 
the name of Cardinals until the close of 1909 season. Coach Bezdek referred 
to his team as "a wild band of Razorbacks" at a post-season rally following 
an unbeaten season. This nickname has been applied to Arkansas teams since 
that time. After five years at Arkansas, he returned to Oregon for six 
seasons. While coaching in Oregon, Bezdek also served as a scout for Major 
League Baseball's Pittsburgh Pirates, who hired him as their manager in 
the middle of the 1917 season. He managed the Pirates through 1919, compiling 
a 166–187 record. While managing the Pirates, Bezdek continued his football 
coaching career, moving from Oregon to Penn State in 1919. He was head 
coach there until 1929, amassing a 65–30–11 record that included two undefeated 
seasons and an appearance in the 1923 Rose Bowl. Bezdek was noted for changing 
the Nittany Lions' style of play.[1] Bezdek also served as Penn State's 
athletic director from 1918 to 1936, was interim basketball coach in 1919, 
garnering an 11–2 record, and director of the School of Physical Education 
and Athletics from 1930 to 1937. In 1937, Bezdek was hired by the Cleveland 
Rams as their first head coach after the team joined the National Football 
League (NFL). His career with the Rams was brief, ending three games into 
the 1938 season with an abysmal 1–13 record. Nevertheless, Bezdek holds 
the distinction of being the only person to have served as both manager 
of a Major League Baseball team and head coach in the NFL. As a college 
football coach, Bezdek tallied a career record of 127–58–16. He was elected 
to the College Football Hall of Fame in 1954. Pound sign (#) denotes interim
