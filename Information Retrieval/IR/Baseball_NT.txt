Baseball NT is the governing body of baseball within the Northern Territory, 
Australia.[1] Baseball NT was formed in 1968 under its original name, the 
Northern Territory Baseball League.[2] Baseball NT is governed nationally 
by the Australian Baseball Federation.[3] Historically, baseball in Australia 
and the Northern Territory has been an amateur sport.[4][5] Organised baseball 
is played in Darwin, Alice Springs and Katherine. Darwin has four clubs; 
Nightcliff Tigers, Palmerston Reds, Pints and Tracy Village Rebels.[6] 
The East Darwin Beasts disbanded in 1987 and the South Darwin Rabbitohs 
disbanded in 2004. In Darwin, baseball is a dry-season sport, played between 
April and September each year. Baseball in Darwin is controlled by the 
Darwin Baseball Association. The Katherine Baseball Association has four 
teams; Dodgers, Cubs, Angels and Braves. The sport is usually played between 
the months of February through to September, during the dry season. Predominantly, 
only under seventeen competitions are played due to a lack of interested 
players. Although a high percentage of participating players are successful 
in making local squads and Territory/ state teams. Alice Springs has six 
teams; Bulls, Cubs, Demons, Panthers, Redbacks and Venom.[7] In Alice Springs, 
baseball is a summer sport, usually played between October and March. Baseball 
in Alice Springs is controlled by the Alice Springs Baseball Association. 
The Northern Territory competed in the national Claxton Shield competition 
between 1981 and 1989.[2] During its nine-year admittance, the Northern 
Territory won only one game, in 1988, against South Australia with a score 
of 20-11.[8] Bill Hutcheson, a Catcher, from originally Tennant Creek and 
later Darwin, was the only player to play in all nine Claxton Shields. 
He was also the first Territorian to hit a home run in 1984, against Victoria.[9] 
In 1991, the Territory joined the national Australian Provincial Championship 
(also known as the Commonwealth Cup) competition for regional Australian 
baseball.[2] Bill Fryar became the first Territorian to hit a home run 
in 1992, against Queensland. In 1999, the Northern Territory won the Cup 
for the first time under the leadership of Captain/Coach, Andrew Kendray.[10] 
Success for the Northern Territory is difficult as promising juniors are 
attracted away from the Territory to pursue careers in the southern leagues 
where their development and opportunities are greater.[2] Several Territorian 
home-grown players have gone onto successful baseball careers and these 
most notably include Max Hardy, Jon Mellor,[11][12] Lachlan Burrows, Darren 
Welch,[13] Wilson Lee,[14] Sam Tibbits,[15] Dushan Ruzic[16] and Adrian 
Burnside.[2][11][17] Rarely do these players return to the Northern Territory. 
This has created a catch 22 situation for Baseball NT whereby it understands 
that by developing home-grown talent, there is a good possibility these 
players will be lost to southern leagues, unlikely to return to the Northern 
Territory.[2] In November 1983 however, five Territory players were selected 
to play for Australia against the touring Japanese Industrial League champions, 
Toshiba, and included, Bill Fryar, Laurie Moore, Dwayne McInnes from Darwin; 
John Baldock from Tennant Creek and Darren Welch from Alice Springs.[18] 
Since the late 1990s, the popularity and standard of baseball in the Northern 
Territory has steadily declined as it struggles to compete against Australian 
icon sports such as cricket, as well as attract juniors away from the information 
technology revolution such as computer games and the "hip-hop" culture.[19]
