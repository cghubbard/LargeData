The 1964 Cincinnati Reds season consisted of the Reds finishing in a tie 
for second place in the National League with the Philadelphia Phillies. 
Both teams finished at 92–70, one game behind the NL and World Series Champion 
St. Louis Cardinals. The Reds' home games were played at Crosley Field. 
The Reds began the season with Fred Hutchinson as manager, but he had to 
give way to acting manager Dick Sisler in August due to health issues with 
a record of 60–49. Sisler finished the season, guiding the team to a record 
of 32–21. Hutchinson, after formally resigning as manager in October, died 
on November 12, 1964, at the age of 45. Infielders Other batters Coaches
