As player As manager Robert Earl Brenly (born February 25, 1954) is an 
American baseball sportscaster and a former professional baseball player, 
coach and manager.[1] He played the majority of his Major League Baseball 
career as a catcher with the San Francisco Giants.[1] After retiring as 
a player, he worked as a broadcaster with the Chicago Cubs, then as a coach 
with the Giants, then as a broadcaster for Fox. He was hired to manage 
the Arizona Diamondbacks for the 2001 season, and won the franchise's only 
championship his first year. In 2004, he was released by the Diamondbacks 
and again became a broadcaster with the Cubs until 2012. He now serves 
as a color commentator for Diamondbacks broadcasts. Brenly attended Ohio 
University in Athens, Ohio and was a member of the Bobcat baseball team. 
By the time Brenly graduated in 1976, he had earned All-America honors 
and matched Hall of Famer Mike Schmidt's school-record 10 home runs in 
a single season.[citation needed] Bob Brenly's only curtain call in baseball 
occurred during a minor league game (teams and date unknown).[citation 
needed] Brenly's team was on the road, and the home team's fans designated 
him as the game's "Beer Batter," where if the player struck out, beer in 
the stadium would be sold at half price for the rest of the inning. Brenly 
struck out three times that game, and the fans stood on their feet and 
cheered for him after the third time as he came back out from the dugout 
and acknowledged the crowd.[citation needed] Brenly was drafted as an amateur 
free agent by the San Francisco Giants in 1976.[1] He made his major league 
debut in 1981 at the age of 27.[1] He replaced Milt May as the Giants starting 
catcher in 1983 and posted a .224 batting average along with 7 home runs 
and 34 runs batted in.[1] Brenly had his best season offensively in 1984 
when, he was hitting for a .318 batting average at mid-season to earn a 
spot as a reserve player for the National League in the 1984 All-Star game.[2][3] 
He finished the season with a career-high .291 batting average with 20 
home runs and 80 runs batted in.[1] Brenly won the 1984 Willie Mac Award 
for his spirit and leadership.[4] In 1986, Brenly led National League catchers 
with a .995 fielding percentage, committing only 3 errors as a catcher 
in 101 games as the Giants improved from last place the previous season 
to finish third in the National League Western Division.[5][6] Also in 
1986, Brenly broke up a perfect game attempt by pitcher Don Carman on August 
20 by leading off the ninth inning with a double.[7] Although Brenly was 
a good defensive catcher, he also has the dubious distinction of committing 
4 errors in one inning while playing as a third baseman during a game on 
September 14, 1986, against the Atlanta Braves.[8] Three of the errors 
were on ground balls and one on a throw, with the throwing error coming 
on the same play as one of the ground ball errors.[8] Brenly atoned for 
his mistakes by hitting a fifth-inning home run.[8] He then hit a two-out, 
two-run single in the seventh inning to tie the game and finally hit a 
walk-off home run in the bottom of the ninth inning to win the game.[8][9] 
Brenly also was playing first base during a Giants-Mets game on September 
3, 1986 when Keith Hernandez hit a sharp grounder to pitcher Terry Mulholland. 
The ball got stuck in Mulholland's glove so Mulholland tossed the glove 
with the baseball to Brenly for the out. Brenly led National League catchers 
in 1987 with 83 assists and posted a .267 batting average with 18 home 
runs and 51 runs batted in as, the Giants won the National League Western 
Division title.[1][10][11] In the only post-season appearance of his career 
in the 1987 National League Championship Series, Brenly hit .235 with 1 
home run and 2 runs batted in as the Giants were defeated by the St. Louis 
Cardinals in a seven-game series.[12] During the 1988 season, Brenly caught 
only 69 games and would be released at the end of the season.[1] In 1989, 
Brenly became a free agent and signed a contract to play for the Toronto 
Blue Jays.[1] After half a season with the Blue Jays, he was released on 
July 18 and, re-signed to play for the Giants.[1] After 12 games with the 
Giants, he retired at the end of the 1989 season at the age of 35.[1] In 
a 9-year career, Brenly played in 871 games, accumulating 647 hits in 2615 
at bats for a .247 career batting average along with 91 home runs and 333 
runs batted in.[1] He ended his career with a .984 fielding percentage 
as a catcher.[1] Brenly served as a coach for the Giants under manager 
Roger Craig and then stayed on when Dusty Baker replaced Craig as manager. 
He replaced Buck Showalter as manager of the Arizona Diamondbacks after 
the 2000 season, and led the Diamondbacks to the 2001 World Series title 
in his first season as a manager.[13] Although the team repeated as Western 
Division champions in 2002, a slide which left the team in last place in 
mid-2004 led to Brenly's dismissal.[13] He later returned to being a baseball 
analyst for Fox (where Brenly had worked from 1996 to 2000). He was then 
hired in November 2004 to replace Steve Stone as a color analyst for televised 
Chicago Cubs games. Brenly teamed with play-by-play announcer Len Kasper. 
He had previously teamed with Harry Caray, Thom Brennaman, and Ron Santo 
during the 1990 and 1991 seasons on radio. He often jokes about his mediocre 
playing career. Brenly is often referred to by his nickname, "BB" and was 
rumored to be in the running for several managerial positions for the 2008 
season, though nothing materialized. Brenly was in the running for the 
2009 Milwaukee Brewers managerial position and was said to be the favorite, 
but the job went to Ken Macha instead.[14][15] In 2007, Brenly served as 
a game analyst during postseason broadcasts on the TBS cable television 
network. He covered the Yankees–Indians series in the ALDS and the Rockies–Diamondbacks 
series in the NLCS. On September 13, 2008, Brenly signed a four-year extension 
worth 3.5 million dollars to continue his role as color analyst for Cubs 
games.[16] Brenly again worked Division Series post-season coverage for 
TBS in 2009-2012 with Dick Stockton as his play-by-play partner each year.[17] 
He opted out of an extension to his contract with the Cubs and WGN television 
on October 17, 2012. On October 18, 2012, he signed a five-year deal as 
the TV color commentator for the Arizona Diamondbacks.[18] Bob Brenly is 
married to Joan Brenly. Their son Michael Brenly was drafted by the Cubs 
in 2004 (out of high school) and 2008 (out of UNLV) as a catcher. He played 
in the Chicago Cubs and Boston Red Sox Minor League systems in all or parts 
of eight seasons spanning 2008–2015. After retiring from the Portland Sea 
Dogs in May 2015, the younger Brenly took a position as the assistant bullpen
