Frank Julián Arellanes [ah-ray-yah'-ness] (January 28, 1882 – December 
13, 1918) was a professional baseball starting pitcher. He played three 
seasons in Major League Baseball for the Boston Red Sox from 1908 through 
1910. Listed at 6 ft 0 in (1.83 m), 180 lb, he batted and threw right-handed.[1] 
Born in Santa Cruz, California, Arellanes attended Santa Clara University 
before joining the Boston Red Sox during the 1908 midseason. He posted 
a 4–3 record and a 1.82 ERA in eight starts, including a one-hit victory 
against the Philadelphia Athletics. His most productive season came in 
1909, when he recorded 16 wins with a 2.18 ERA as the replacement of Cy 
Young in the pitching rotation, leading the American League in games finished 
(15) and saves (eight). His 1910 season was interrupted by illness and 
he finished at 4–7, 2.88 in 18 games. He ended the year with the Sacramento 
Solons of the Pacific Coast League, where he pitched a nine-inning no-hitter, 
losing a 2–0 game.[2][3] In a three-season career, Arellanes posted a 24–22 
record with 148 strikeouts and a 2.28 ERA in 409⅔ innings of work. A strong 
control pitcher, he allowed 85 walks for a 1.86 BB/9IP. Arellanes died 
in San Jose, California at age 36, a victim of the Spanish flu pandemic.[4] 
Arellanes is commonly believed to be the first Mexican-American to play 
baseball in the major leagues. However, Sandy Nava was the first known 
Mexican-American to play in the majors, when he joined the 1882 Providence
