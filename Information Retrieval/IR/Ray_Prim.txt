Raymond Lee "Ray" Prim (December 30, 1906 – April 29, 1995), nicknamed 
"Pop", was an American pitcher who played Major League Baseball during 
the 1930s and 1940s. During his professional career, he also pitched for 
the Los Angeles Angels of the AAA-Class Pacific Coast League (PCL). In 
2005, the PCL Hall of Fame elected Prim as a member. Between 1933 and 1946 
he appeared in at least one Major League game in six of those years. He 
played for the Washington Senators, for the Philadelphia Phillies, and 
for the Chicago Cubs while at the Major League level. While with the Cubs, 
Prim won the 1945 National League ERA title. Prim started one game in the 
1945 World Series, appeared in another, and lost his only decision. In 
116 Major League games, he won 22 games and lost 21 games and recorded 
161 strikeouts. As a minor league player, Prim won 150 games and posted 
a career ERA of 3.00 in over 2,000 games.[1] Prim was born in Salitpa, 
Alabama, to Scots-Irish parents. As a youth, he burned his right hand. 
As result, though naturally right-handed, he threw with his left-hand, 
though he batted from the right side of the home plate.[2] He was educated 
in Jackson, Alabama, and attended college at Alabama Polytechnic Institute, 
where he lettered in baseball and football.[2] In 1928 Prim made his professional 
baseball debut. That year, he pitched with Alexandria of the Cotton States 
League; however, Alexandria cut Prim later that season. He did not play 
professional baseball again until 1930. In 1931 Prim played with the Greensboro 
Patriots and the Durham Bulls of the C-Class Piedmont League. He won a 
combined 33 games that year and lost just 14. Prim began the 1933 season 
with the Albany Senators of the International League where he went 14-10 
with a 3.42 ERA. Shortly thereafter, the Chicago Cubs and Boston Braves 
entered into a dispute over his rights. Kenesaw Mountain Landis, the Commissioner 
of Baseball, ruled that Albany had the right to sell them to the franchise 
of their choice.[2] Although the dispute started with the Braves and the 
Cubs, it was the Washington Senators who won his rights. Prim made his 
major league debut on September 24, 1933, against the Philadelphia Athletics. 
Prim faced Mickey Cochrane and Jimmie Foxx to start his major league career. 
He promptly struck out the two future Baseball Hall of Fame members. After 
two games, Prim underwent surgery on his foot and missed the rest of the 
year.[2] Over the next few years, Prim spent time with Albany, the Philadelphia 
Phillies and the Minneapolis Millers. In 1936, the Millers sold Prim to 
the Los Angeles Angels of the PCL. Prim pitched just one inning for the 
Millers. Prim spent the next six years with the Angels. In 1936 he won 
16 games and lost just nine. Because he was 30 years old at the time, Prim 
received the nickname 'Pop' from his teammates.[2] By 1943 the United States 
was deeply involved in World War II and many major league players were 
drafted in the United States Army. As a result, Prim had the opportunity 
to play at the major league level for a second time. After 1943 he returned 
to the Angels for the 1944 season. A year later, he returned to the Cubs. 
Prim helped the Cubs to make the 1945 World Series with a 13–8 record, 
an ERA of 2.40 and two shutouts. His earned run average was the lowest 
in the National League that year. Prim is the last Cub to lead the league 
in ERA as of 2014. During the World Series versus the Detroit Tigers, Prim 
pitched in two games. He lost his only decision. Prim pitched for the Cubs 
in 1946, it was his last season in the majors. Prim's last year in professional 
baseball was 1947. At the age of 41, he helped the Angels win another. 
Because of his outstanding performance while with the Angels, Prim joined
