WPIX The 1973 New York Yankees season was the 71st season for the team 
in New York, and its 73rd season overall. The Yankees finished with a record 
of 80-82, finishing 17 games behind the Baltimore Orioles. The Yankees 
were managed by Ralph Houk. The Yankees played at old Yankee Stadium, on 
the south side of 161st Street. This would be the last year in the "old" 
Yankee Stadium, which was targeted for major reconstruction in 1974â€“1975. 
During this period, the Yankees would share a home field with a National 
League team for the third time in their history, moving into Shea Stadium 
for two years. The Yankees had been struggling during their years under 
CBS ownership, which had acquired the team in 1965. In 1972, CBS Chairman 
William S. Paley told team president E. Michael Burke the media company 
intended to sell the club. As Burke later told writer Roger Kahn, Paley 
offered to sell the franchise to Burke if he could find financial backing. 
Burke ran across Steinbrenner's name, and veteran baseball executive Gabe 
Paul, a Cleveland-area acquaintance of Steinbrenner, helped bring the two 
men together. On January 3, 1973, a group of investors led by George Steinbrenner 
and minority partner Burke bought the Yankees from CBS for $10 million. 
The announced intention was that Burke would continue to run the team as 
club president. But Burke later became angry when he found out that Paul 
had been brought in as a senior Yankee executive, crowding his authority, 
and quit the team presidency on April 29, 1973. (Burke remained a minority 
owner of the club into the following decade.) He handed in his resignation 
to the New York Yankees, so that he could become president of Madison Square 
Garden.[1] It would be the first of many high-profile departures by employees 
who crossed paths with "The Boss." At the conclusion of the 1973 season, 
two more prominent names departed: manager Ralph Houk, who resigned and 
then signed to manage the Detroit Tigers; and general manager Lee MacPhail, 
who became president of the American League. After the last game of the 
1973 season, fans ripped out parts of the stadium, including the seats, 
to take as souvenirs. The stadium would be remodeled, and reopen in 1976.[5]
