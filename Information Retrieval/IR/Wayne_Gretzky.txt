Wayne Douglas Gretzky CC (/ˈɡrɛtski/; born January 26, 1961) is a Canadian 
former professional ice hockey player and former head coach. He played 
20 seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL) for four teams from 1979 
to 1999. Nicknamed "The Great One",[1] he has been called "the greatest 
hockey player ever"[2] by many sportswriters, players, and the NHL itself. 
He is the leading scorer in NHL history, with more goals and assists than 
any other player. He scored more assists than any other player scored total 
points, and is the only NHL player to total over 200 points in one season 
– a feat he accomplished four times. In addition, he tallied over 100 points 
in 16 professional seasons, 14 of them consecutive. At the time of his 
retirement in 1999, he held 61 NHL records: 40 regular-season records, 
15 playoff records, and six All-Star records.[2] As of 2014, he still holds 
60 NHL records.[3] Born and raised in Brantford, Ontario, Canada, Gretzky 
honed his skills at a backyard rink and regularly played minor hockey at 
a level far above his peers.[4] Despite his unimpressive stature, strength 
and speed, Gretzky's intelligence and reading of the game were unrivaled. 
He was adept at dodging checks from opposing players, and consistently 
anticipated where the puck was going to be and executed the right move 
at the right time. Gretzky became known for setting up behind his opponent's 
net, an area that was nicknamed "Gretzky's office".[5] In 1978, Gretzky 
signed with the Indianapolis Racers of the World Hockey Association (WHA), 
where he briefly played before being traded to the Edmonton Oilers. When 
the WHA folded, the Oilers joined the NHL, where he established many scoring 
records and led his team to four Stanley Cup championships. His trade to 
the Los Angeles Kings on August 9, 1988, had an immediate impact on the 
team's performance, eventually leading them to the 1993 Stanley Cup Finals, 
and he is credited with popularizing hockey in California.[6] Gretzky played 
briefly for the St. Louis Blues before finishing his career with the New 
York Rangers. Gretzky captured nine Hart Trophies as the most valuable 
player, ten Art Ross Trophies for most points in a season, two Conn Smythe 
Trophies as playoff MVP, and five Lester B. Pearson Awards (now called 
the Ted Lindsay Award) for most outstanding player as judged by other players. 
He won the Lady Byng Trophy for sportsmanship and performance five times,[7] 
and often spoke out against fighting in hockey.[8] After his retirement 
in 1999, Gretzky was immediately inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame, 
making him the most recent player to have the waiting period waived. The 
NHL retired his jersey number 99 league-wide, making him the only player 
to receive this honour. He was one of six players voted to the International 
Ice Hockey Federation's (IIHF) Centennial All-Star Team. Gretzky became 
executive director for the Canadian national men's hockey team during the 
2002 Winter Olympics, in which the team won a gold medal. In 2000, he became 
part owner of the Phoenix Coyotes, and following the 2004–05 NHL lockout 
he became the team's head coach. In 2004, he was inducted into the Ontario 
Sports Hall of Fame.[9] In September 2009, following the franchise's bankruptcy, 
Gretzky resigned as coach and relinquished his ownership share. In October 
2016, he became partner and vice-chairman of Oilers Entertainment Group. 
Wayne Gretzky was born on January 26, 1961 in Brantford, Ontario, the son 
of Phyllis Leone (Hockin) and Walter Gretzky.[4][10] The couple had married 
in 1960, and lived in an apartment in Brantford, where Walter worked for 
Bell Telephone Canada.[11] The family moved into a house on Varadi Avenue 
in Brantford seven months after Wayne was born, chosen partly because its 
yard was flat enough to make an ice rink on every winter.[12] Wayne was 
joined by a sister, Kim (b. 1963), and brothers Keith, Glen and Brent. 
The family would regularly visit the farm of Wayne's grandparents, Tony 
and Mary, and watch Hockey Night in Canada together. By age two, Wayne 
was trying to score goals against Mary using a souvenir stick.[13] The 
farm was where Wayne skated on ice for the first time, aged two years, 
10 months.[13] Walter taught Wayne, Keith, Brent, Glen and their friends 
hockey on a rink he made in the back yard of the family home, nicknamed 
the "Wally Coliseum".[14] Drills included skating around Javex bleach bottles 
and tin cans, and flipping pucks over scattered hockey sticks to be able 
to pick up the puck again in full flight.[15] Additionally, Walter gave 
the advice to "skate where the puck's going, not where it's been".[15] 
Wayne was a classic prodigy whose extraordinary skills made him the target 
of jealous parents.[16] The team that Gretzky played on at age six was 
otherwise composed of ten-year-olds.[4] His first coach, Dick Martin, remarked 
that he handled the puck better than the ten-year-olds.[17] According to 
Martin, "Wayne was so good that you could have a boy of your own who was 
a tremendous hockey player, and he'd get overlooked because of what the 
Gretzky kid was doing."[18] The sweaters for ten-year-olds were far too 
large for Gretzky, who coped by tucking the sweater into his pants on the 
right side. Gretzky continued doing this throughout his NHL career.[19] 
By the age of ten, Gretzky had scored an astonishing 378 goals and 139 assists 
in just one season with the Brantford Nadrofsky Steelers.[20] His play 
now attracted media attention beyond his hometown of Brantford, including 
a profile by John Iaboni in the Toronto Telegram in October 1971.[21] By 
age 13, he had scored over 1,000 goals.[22] His play attracted considerable 
negative attention from other players' parents, including those of his 
teammates, and he was often booed.[23] According to Walter, the "capper" 
was being booed on "Brantford Day" at Toronto's Maple Leaf Gardens in February 
1975.[22] When Gretzky was 14, his family arranged for him to move to and 
play hockey in Toronto, partly to further his career, and partly to remove 
him from the uncomfortable pressure he faced in his hometown. The Gretzkys 
had to legally challenge the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association to win 
Wayne the right to play elsewhere, which was disallowed at the time.[24] 
The Gretzkys won, and Wayne played Junior B hockey with the Toronto Nationals. 
He earned Rookie of the Year honours in the Metro Junior B Hockey League 
in 1975–76, with 60 points in 28 games. The following year, as a 15-year-old, 
he had 72 points in 32 games with the same team, then known as the Seneca 
Nationals.[25] Despite his offensive statistics, two teams bypassed him 
in the 1977 OMJHL Midget Draft of 16-year-olds. The Oshawa Generals picked 
Tom McCarthy, and the Niagara Falls Flyers picked Steve Peters second overall. 
With the third pick, the Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds selected Gretzky, 
even though Walter Gretzky had told the team that Wayne would not move 
to Sault Ste. Marie, a northern Ontario city that inflicts a heavy traveling 
schedule on its junior team. The Gretzkys made an arrangement with a local 
family they knew and Wayne played a season in the Ontario Hockey League 
at the age of 16 with the Greyhounds.[26] It was with the Greyhounds that 
Wayne first wore the number 99 on his jersey. He originally wanted to wear 
number 9—for his hockey hero Gordie Howe—but it was already being worn 
by teammate Brian Gualazzi. At coach Muzz MacPherson's suggestion, Gretzky 
settled on 99.[27] In 1978, the World Hockey Association (WHA) league was 
in competition with the established NHL. The NHL did not allow the signing 
of players under the age of 20, but the WHA had no rules regarding such 
signings. Several WHA teams courted Gretzky, notably the Indianapolis Racers 
and the Birmingham Bulls. Birmingham Bulls owner John F. Bassett wanted 
to confront the NHL by signing as many young and promising superstars as 
possible and saw Gretzky as the most promising young prospect.[28] However, 
it was Racers owner Nelson Skalbania who, on June 12, 1978, signed 17-year-old 
Gretzky to a seven-year personal services contract worth $1.75 million 
US.[29][30] Gretzky scored his first professional goal against Dave Dryden 
of the Edmonton Oilers[31] in his fifth game, and his second goal four 
seconds later.[32] Skalbania opted to have Gretzky sign a personal-services 
contract rather than a standard player contract in part because he knew 
a deal to take some WHA teams into the NHL was in the works. He also knew 
that the Racers could not hope to be included among those teams, and hoped 
to keep the Racers alive long enough to collect compensation from the surviving 
teams when the WHA dissolved, as well as any funds earned from selling 
the young star.[33] Gretzky only played eight games for Indianapolis. The 
Racers were losing $40,000 per game. Skalbania told Gretzky he would be 
moved, offering him a choice between the Edmonton Oilers and the Winnipeg 
Jets. On the advice of his agent, Gretzky picked the Oilers, but the move 
was not that simple. On November 2, Gretzky, goaltender Eddie Mio and forward 
Peter Driscoll were put on a private plane, not knowing where they would 
land and what team they would be joining.[29] While in the air, Skalbania 
worked on the deal. Skalbania offered to play a game of backgammon with 
Winnipeg owner Michael Gobuty, the stakes being if Gobuty won, he would 
get Gretzky and if he lost, he had to give Skalbania a share of the Jets. 
Gobuty turned down the proposal and the players landed in Edmonton.[34] 
Mio paid the $4,000 bill for the flight with his credit card.[35] Skalbania 
sold Gretzky, Mio and Driscoll to his former partner, and then-owner of 
the Edmonton Oilers, Peter Pocklington. Although the announced price was 
$850,000, Pocklington actually paid $700,000.[31] The money was not enough 
to keep the Racers alive; they folded that December.[33] One of the highlights 
of Gretzky's season was his appearance in the 1979 WHA All-Star Game. The 
format was a three-game series between the WHA All-Stars and Dynamo Moscow 
played at Edmonton's Northlands Coliseum.[36] The WHA All-Stars were coached 
by Jacques Demers, who put Gretzky on a line with his boyhood idol Gordie 
Howe and Howe's son, Mark.[37] In game one, the line scored seven points, 
and the WHA All-Stars won by a score of 4–2.[37] In game two, Gretzky and 
Mark Howe each scored a goal and Gordie Howe picked up an assist as the 
WHA won 4–2.[37] The line did not score in the final game, but the WHA 
won by a score of 4–3.[38] On Gretzky's 18th birthday, January 26, 1979, 
Pocklington signed him to a ten-year personal services contract (the longest 
in hockey history at the time) worth C$3 million, with options for 10 more 
years.[39] Gretzky finished third in the league in scoring at 110 points, 
behind Robbie Ftorek and Réal Cloutier.[40] Gretzky captured the Lou Kaplan 
Trophy as rookie of the year,[31] and helped the Oilers to first overall 
in the league.[41] The Oilers reached the Avco World Trophy finals, where 
they lost to the Winnipeg Jets in six games.[42] It was Gretzky's only 
year in the WHA, as the league folded following the season.[43] After the 
World Hockey Association folded in 1979, the Edmonton Oilers and three 
other teams joined the NHL.[44] Under the merger agreement the Oilers, 
like the other surviving WHA teams, were to be allowed to protect two goaltenders 
and two skaters from being reclaimed by the established NHL teams. Gretzky's 
success in the WHA carried over into the NHL, despite some critics suggesting 
he would struggle in what was considered the bigger, tougher, and more 
talented league.[45] In his first NHL season, 1979–80, Gretzky was awarded 
the Hart Memorial Trophy as the League's Most Valuable Player (the first 
of eight in a row) and tied for the scoring lead with Marcel Dionne with 
137 points.[46][47] Although Gretzky played 79 games to Dionne's 80, Dionne 
was awarded the Art Ross Trophy since he scored more goals (53 vs. 51).[48] 
The season still stands as the highest point total by a first year player 
in NHL history. Gretzky became the youngest player to score 50 goals but 
was not eligible for the Calder Memorial Trophy, given to the top NHL rookie, 
because of his previous year of WHA experience.[49] The Calder was awarded 
to Boston Bruins defenceman Ray Bourque.[50] In his second season, Gretzky 
won the Art Ross (the first of seven consecutive) with a then-record 164 points, 
breaking both Bobby Orr's record for assists in a season (102) and Phil 
Esposito's record for points in a season (152).[27] He won his second straight 
Hart Trophy.[46] In the first game of the 1981 playoffs versus the Montreal 
Canadiens, Gretzky had five assists. This was a single game playoff record.[51] 
During the 1981–82 season, he surpassed a record that had stood for 35 years: 
50 goals in 50 games. Set by Maurice "Rocket" Richard during the 1944–45 
NHL season and tied by Mike Bossy during the 1980–81 NHL season, Gretzky 
accomplished the feat in only 39 games. His 50th goal of the season came 
on December 30, 1981 in the final seconds of a 7–5 win against the Philadelphia 
Flyers and was his fifth of the game.[52] Later that season, Gretzky broke 
Esposito's record for most goals in a season (76) on February 24, 1982, 
scoring three goals to help beat the Buffalo Sabres 6–3.[53] He ended the 
1981–82 season with records of 92 goals, 120 assists, and 212 points in 
80 games, becoming the only player in NHL history to break the two hundred-point 
mark.[54] That year, Gretzky became the first hockey player and first Canadian 
to be named Associated Press Male Athlete of the Year.[55] He was also 
named 1982 "Sportsman of the Year" by Sports Illustrated.[56] The Canadian 
Press also named Gretzky Newsmaker of the Year in 1982. The following seasons 
saw Gretzky break his own assists record three more times (125 in 1982–83, 
135 in 1984–85, and 163 in 1985–86); he also bettered that mark (120 assists) 
in 1986–87 with 121 and 1990–91 with 122, and his point record one more 
time (215, in 1985–86).[57][58] By the time he finished playing in Edmonton, 
he held or shared 49 NHL records, which in itself was a record. The Edmonton 
Oilers finished first overall in their last WHA regular season. The same 
success was not immediate when they joined the NHL, but within four seasons, 
the Oilers were competing for the Stanley Cup.[59] The Oilers were a young, 
strong team featuring, in addition to Gretzky, future Hall of Famers including 
forwards Mark Messier, Glenn Anderson and Jari Kurri, defenceman Paul Coffey, 
and goaltender Grant Fuhr. Gretzky was its captain from 1983–88. In 1983, 
they made it to the Stanley Cup Final, only to be swept by the three-time 
defending champion New York Islanders.[60] The following season, the Oilers 
met the Islanders in the Final again, this time winning the Stanley Cup, 
their first of five in seven years.[61] Gretzky was named an officer of 
the Order of Canada on June 25, 1984, for outstanding contribution to the 
sport of hockey. Since the Order ceremonies are always held during the 
hockey season, it took 13 years and 7 months—and two Governors General—before 
he could accept the honour.[62] He was promoted to Companion of the Order 
of Canada in 2009 "for his continued contributions to the world of hockey, 
notably as one of the best players of all time, as well as for his social 
engagement as a philanthropist, volunteer and role model for countless 
young people".[63] The Oilers also won the Cup with Gretzky in 1985, 1987 
and 1988.[64] When the Oilers joined the NHL, Gretzky continued to play 
under his personal services contract with Oilers owner Peter Pocklington. 
This arrangement came under increased scrutiny by the mid-1980s, especially 
following reports that Pocklington had used the contract as collateral 
to help secure a $31 million loan with the Alberta government-owned Alberta 
Treasury Branches.[65] Amid growing concern around the league that a financial 
institution might be able to lay claim to Gretzky's rights in the event 
the heavily leveraged Pocklington were to declare bankruptcy, as well as 
growing dissatisfaction on the part of Gretzky and his advisers, in 1987 
Gretzky and Pocklington agreed to replace the personal services contract 
with a standard NHL contract.[66] In June 1985, as part of a package of 
five rule changes to be implemented for the 1985–86 season, the NHL Board 
of Governors made a decision to introduce offsetting penalties, where neither 
team lost a man when coincidental penalties were called. The effect of 
calling offsetting penalties was felt immediately in the NHL, because during 
the early 1980s, when the Gretzky-era Oilers entered a four-on-four or 
three-on-three situation with an opponent, they frequently used the space 
on the ice to score one or more goals.[67][68] Gretzky held a press conference 
one day after being awarded the Hart Memorial Trophy, criticizing the NHL 
for punishing teams and players who previously benefited. The rule change 
became known as the Gretzky rule.[67][69] The rule was reversed for the 
1992–93 season.[70] Gretzky had a major influence on the style of play 
of the Edmonton Oilers and in the NHL as a whole, helping to inspire a 
more team-based strategy. Using this approach, the Oilers, led by Gretzky, 
became the highest scoring team in league history.[71] "He was, I think, 
the first Canadian forward to play a true team game", said hockey writer 
and former NHL goalie Ken Dryden. The focus of the game prior to Gretzky's 
arrival, he said, especially among the Canadian teams, was on the player 
with the puck—in getting the puck to a star player who would make the big 
play. "Gretzky reversed that. He knew he wasn't big enough, strong enough, 
or even fast enough to do what he wanted to do if others focused on him. 
Like a magician, he had to direct attention elsewhere, to his four teammates 
on the ice with him, to create the momentary distraction in order to move 
unnoticed into the open ice where size and strength didn't matter. . . 
. Gretzky made his opponents compete with five players, not one, and he 
made his teammates full partners to the game. He made them skate to his 
level and pass and finish up to his level or they would be embarrassed."[72] 
Between 1982 and 1985, the Edmonton Oilers averaged 423 goals a season, 
when no previous team had scored 400, and Gretzky on his own had averaged 
207 points, when no player before had scored more than 152 in one year. 
"In the past, defenders and teams had learned to devise strategies to stop 
opponents with the puck. Without the puck, that was interference. But now, 
if players without the puck skated just as hard, but faster, dodged and 
darted to open ice just as determinedly, but more effectively, as those 
with the puck, how do you shut them down?"[71] In this, Gretzky added his 
considerable influence as the preeminent NHL star of his day to that of 
the Soviets, who had also developed a more team-style of play, and had 
successfully used it against the best NHL teams, beginning in the 1972 
Summit Series. "The Soviets and Gretzky changed the NHL game", says Dryden. 
"Gretzky, the kid from Brantford with the Belarusian name, was the acceptable 
face of Soviet hockey. No Canadian kid wanted to play like Makarov or Larionov. 
They all wanted to play like Gretzky."[73] At the same time, Gretzky recognizes 
the contributions of their coach in the success of the Oilers: "Under the 
guidance of Glen Sather, our Oiler teams became adept at generating speed, 
developing finesse, and learning a transition game with strong European 
influences."[74] Gretzky explains his style of play further: People think 
that to be a good player you have to pick the puck up, deke around ninety-three 
guys and take this ungodly slap shot. No. Let the puck do all the moving 
and you get yourself in the right place. I don't care if you're Carl Lewis, 
you can't outskate that little black thing. Just move the puck: give it 
up, get it back, give it up. It's like Larry Bird. The hardest work he 
does is getting open. The jumpshot is cake. That's all hockey is: open 
ice. That's my whole strategy: Find Open Ice. Chicago coach Mike Keenan 
said it best: "There's a spot on the ice that's no-man's land, and all 
the good goal scorers find it." It's a piece of frozen real estate that's 
just in between the defense and the forward.[75] Two hours after the Oilers 
won the Stanley Cup in 1988, Gretzky learned from his father that the Oilers 
were planning to deal him to another team.[76] Walter Gretzky had known 
for months after having been tipped off by Skalbania, but kept the news 
from Wayne so as not to upset him. According to Walter, Wayne was being 
"shopped" to Los Angeles, Detroit, and Vancouver, and Pocklington needed 
money as his other business ventures were not doing well.[77] At first, 
Wayne did not want to leave Edmonton, but he later received a call while 
on his honeymoon from Los Angeles Kings owner Bruce McNall asking permission 
to meet and discuss the deal. Gretzky informed McNall that his prerequisites 
for a deal to take place were that Marty McSorley and Mike Krushelnyski 
join him as teammates in Los Angeles. Both McNall and Pocklington quickly 
agreed. After the details of the trade were finalized by the two owners, 
one final condition had to be met: Gretzky had to call Pocklington and 
request a trade.[78] When Pocklington told Oilers general manager and head 
coach Glen Sather about his plans to trade Gretzky to L.A., Sather tried 
to stop the deal, but when he found out that Gretzky had been involved 
in the negotiations, he changed his attitude and requested Luc Robitaille 
in exchange. The Kings refused, instead offering Jimmy Carson.[79] On August 
9, 1988, in a move that heralded significant change in the NHL, the Oilers 
traded Gretzky, along with McSorley and Krushelnyski, to the Kings for 
Carson, Martin Gelinas, $15 million in cash, and the Kings' first-round 
draft picks in 1989 (later traded to the New Jersey Devils – New Jersey 
selected Jason Miller), 1991 (Martin Rucinsky), and 1993 (Nick Stajduhar).[58] 
"The Trade", as it came to be known,[80] upset Canadians to the extent 
that New Democratic Party House Leader Nelson Riis demanded that the government 
block it,[81] and Pocklington was burned in effigy outside Northlands Coliseum.[16] 
Gretzky himself was considered a "traitor" by some Canadians for turning 
his back on his adopted hometown, and his home country; his motivation 
was widely rumoured to be the furtherance of his wife's acting career.[82] 
In Gretzky's first appearance in Edmonton after the trade—a game that was 
nationally televised in Canada—he received a four-minute standing ovation.[83] 
The arena was sold out, and the attendance of 17,503 was the Oilers' biggest 
crowd ever to that date.[83] Large cheers erupted for his first shift, 
his first touch of the puck, his two assists, and for Mark Messier's body 
check of Gretzky into the boards.[83] After the game, Gretzky took the 
opportunity to confirm his patriotism: "I'm still proud to be a Canadian. 
I didn't desert my country. I moved because I was traded and that's where 
my job is. But I'm Canadian to the core. I hope Canadians understand that."[83] 
After the 1988–89 season, a life-sized bronze statue of Gretzky was erected 
outside Northlands Coliseum, holding the Stanley Cup over his head.[84] 
The Kings named Gretzky their alternate captain. He made an immediate impact 
on the ice, scoring on his first shot on goal in the first regular-season 
game.[85] The Kings got off to their best start ever, winning four straight 
on their way to qualifying for the playoffs. Despite being underdogs against 
the defending Stanley Cup Champion Edmonton Oilers in the Smythe Division 
semifinals, Gretzky led the Kings to a shocking upset of his old squad, 
spearheading the Kings' return from a 3–1 series deficit to win the series 
4–3. He was nervous that Edmonton would greet him with boos, but they were 
eagerly waiting for him.[86] For only the second time in his NHL career, 
Gretzky finished second in scoring, but narrowly beat out Pittsburgh's 
Mario Lemieux (who scored 199 points) for the Hart Trophy as MVP.[87] In 
1990, the Associated Press named him Male Athlete of the Decade.[88] Gretzky's 
first season in Los Angeles saw a marked increase in attendance and fan 
interest in a city not previously known for following hockey. The Kings 
now boasted of numerous sellouts.[89] Many credit Gretzky's arrival with 
putting non-traditional U.S. hockey markets on "the NHL map"; not only 
did California receive two more NHL franchises (the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim 
and San Jose Sharks) during Gretzky's tenure in L.A., but his popularity 
in Southern California proved to be an impetus in the league establishing 
teams in other parts of the U.S. Sun Belt.[90] Gretzky was sidelined for 
much of the 1992–93 regular season with a back injury, and his 65-point 
output ended a record 13-year streak in which he recorded at least 100 
points each season.[91] However, he performed very well in the playoffs, 
notably when he scored a hat trick in game seven of the Campbell Conference 
Finals against the Toronto Maple Leafs.[27] This victory propelled the 
Kings into the Stanley Cup Finals for the first time in franchise history, 
where they faced the Montreal Canadiens. After winning the first game of 
the series by a score of 4–1, the team lost the next three games in overtime, 
and then fell 4–1 in the deciding fifth game where Gretzky failed to get 
a shot on net.[92] The next season, Gretzky broke Gordie Howe's career 
goal-scoring record and won the scoring title,[27] but the team began a 
long slide, and despite numerous player and coaching moves, they failed 
to qualify for the playoffs again until 1998.[93] After the financially 
troubled McNall was forced to sell the Kings in 1994, Gretzky's relationship 
with the Kings' new owners grew strained. Finally, in early 1996, Gretzky 
requested a trade.[94] During the 1994–95 NHL lockout, Gretzky and some 
friends (including Mark Messier, Marty McSorley, Brett Hull, and Steve 
Yzerman) formed the Ninety Nine All Stars Tour and played eight exhibition 
games in various countries.[95] On February 27, 1996, Gretzky joined the 
St. Louis Blues in a trade for Patrice Tardif, Roman Vopat, Craig Johnson, 
and two draft picks (Peter Hogan and Matt Zultek).[58] He partially orchestrated 
the trade after reports surfaced that he was unhappy in Los Angeles.[96] 
At the time of the trade, the Blues and New York Rangers emerged as front-runners, 
but the Blues met his salary demands.[97] Gretzky was immediately named 
the team's captain. He scored 37 points in 31 games for the team in the 
regular season and the playoffs,[57] and the Blues came within one game 
of the Conference Finals.[98] However, the chemistry that everyone expected 
with winger Brett Hull never developed, and coach Mike Keenan publicly 
criticized him.[99] Gretzky rejected a three-year deal worth $15 million 
with the Blues, and on July 21, he signed with the New York Rangers as 
a free agent, rejoining longtime Oilers teammate Mark Messier for a two-year 
$8 million (plus incentives) contract.[100] Gretzky ended his professional 
playing career with the New York Rangers, where he played his final three 
seasons and helped the team reach the Eastern Conference Finals in 1997.[101] 
The Rangers were defeated in the Conference Finals in five games by the 
Philadelphia Flyers, despite Gretzky leading the Rangers in the playoffs 
with 10 goals and 10 assists.[57] For the first time in his NHL career, 
Gretzky was not named captain,[102] although he briefly wore the captain's 
'C' in 1998 when captain Brian Leetch was injured and out of the lineup.[103] 
After the 1996–97 season, Mark Messier signed a free agent contract with 
the Vancouver Canucks, ending the brief reunion of Messier and Gretzky 
after just one season.[104] The Rangers did not return to the playoffs 
until 2006, well after Gretzky retired.[105] In 1997, prior to his retirement, 
The Hockey News named a committee of 50 hockey experts (former NHL players, 
past and present writers, broadcasters, coaches and hockey executives) 
to select and rank the 50 greatest players in NHL history. The experts 
voted Gretzky number one.[20] Gretzky said that he would have voted Bobby 
Orr or Gordie Howe as the best of all time.[106] The 1998–99 season was 
his last as a professional player. He reached one milestone in this last 
season, breaking the professional total (regular season and playoffs) goal-scoring 
record of 1,071, which had been held by Gordie Howe. Gretzky was having 
difficulty scoring this season and finished with only nine goals, contributing 
to this being the only season in which he failed to average at least a 
point per game, but his last goal brought his scoring total for his combined 
NHL/WHA career to 1,072, one more than Howe.[107] As the season wound down, 
there was media speculation that Gretzky would retire, but he refused to 
announce his retirement. His last NHL game in Canada was on April 15, 1999, 
a 2–2 tie with the Ottawa Senators and the Rangers' second-to-last game 
of the season.[108] Following the contest, in a departure from the usual 
three stars announcement, Gretzky was awarded all three stars.[109] Upon 
returning to New York, Gretzky announced he would retire after the Rangers' 
last game of the season.[110] The final game of Gretzky's career was a 
2–1 overtime loss to the Pittsburgh Penguins on April 18, 1999, in Madison 
Square Garden. Although the game involved two American teams, both national 
anthems were played, with the lyrics slightly adjusted to accommodate Gretzky's 
departure. In place of the lyrics "O Canada, we stand on guard for thee", 
Bryan Adams ad-libbed, "We're going to miss you, Wayne Gretzky".[111] "The 
Star-Spangled Banner", as sung by John Amirante, was altered to include 
the words "in the land of Wayne Gretzky".[112] Gretzky ended his career 
with a final point, assisting on the lone New York goal scored by Brian 
Leetch.[111] At the time of his retirement, Gretzky was the second-to-last 
WHA player still active in professional hockey. Mark Messier, who attended 
the game along with other representatives of the Edmonton Oilers' dynasty, 
was the last.[113] Gretzky told journalist Scott Morrison that the final 
game of his career was his greatest day.[114] He recounted: My last game 
in New York was my greatest day in hockey...Everything you enjoy about 
the sport of hockey as a kid, driving to practice with mom [Phyllis] and 
dad [Walter], driving to the game with mom and dad, looking in the stands 
and seeing your mom and dad and your friends, that all came together in 
that last game in New York.[114] Gretzky made his first international appearance 
as a member of the Canadian national junior team at the 1978 World Junior 
Championships in Montreal, Quebec. He was the youngest player to compete 
in the tournament at the age of 16. He went on to lead the tournament in 
scoring with 17 points to earn All-Star Team and Best Forward honours.[115] 
His 17 points remain the most scored by a 16-year-old in the World Junior 
Championships.[116] Canada finished with the bronze medal.[115][117] Gretzky 
debuted with the Team Canada's men's team at the 1981 Canada Cup. He led 
the tournament in scoring with 12 points en route to a second-place finish 
to the Soviet Union,[115] losing 8–1 in the final. Seven months later, 
Gretzky joined Team Canada for the 1982 World Championships in Finland. 
He notched 14 points in 10 games, including a two-goal, two-assist effort 
in Canada's final game against Sweden to earn the bronze.[115] Gretzky 
did not win his first international competition until the 1984 Canada Cup, 
when Canada defeated Sweden in a best-of-three finals. He led the tournament 
in scoring for the second consecutive time and was named to the All-Star 
Team.[115] Gretzky's international career highlight arguably came three 
years later at the 1987 Canada Cup. Gretzky has called the tournament the 
best hockey he had played in his life.[118] Playing on a line with Pittsburgh 
Penguins' superstar Mario Lemieux, he recorded a tournament-best 21 points 
in nine games. After losing the first game of a best-of-three final series 
against the Soviets, Gretzky propelled Canada with a five-assist performance 
in the second game, including the game-winning pass to Lemieux in overtime, 
to extend the tournament.[118] In the deciding game three, Gretzky and 
Lemieux once again combined for the game-winner. With the score tied 5–5 
and 1:26 minutes to go in regulation, Lemieux one-timed a pass from Gretzky 
on a 3–on–1 with defenceman Larry Murphy. Lemieux scored to win the tournament 
for Canada; the play is widely regarded as one of the most memorable plays 
in Canadian international competition.[119] The 1991 Canada Cup marked 
the last time the tournament was played under the "Canada Cup" moniker. 
Gretzky led the tournament for the fourth and final time with 12 points 
in seven games. He did not, however, compete in the final against the United 
States due to a back injury.[115] Canada nevertheless won in two games 
by scores of 4–1 and 4–2. Five years later, the tournament was revived 
and renamed the World Cup in 1996. It marked the first time Gretzky did 
not finish as the tournament's leading scorer with seven points in eight 
games for fourth overall.[115] Leading up to the 1998 Winter Olympics in 
Nagano, Japan, it was announced that NHL players would be eligible to play 
for the first time. Gretzky was named to the club on November 29, 1997.[115] 
However, Gretzky, was passed over for the captaincy, along with several 
other Canadian veterans including Steve Yzerman and Ray Bourque in favour 
of the younger Eric Lindros.[120] Expectations were high for the Canadian 
team, but the team lost to the Czech Republic in the semi-finals.[121] 
The game went to a shootout with a 1–1 tie after overtime, but Gretzky 
was controversially not selected by coach Marc Crawford as one of the five 
shooters, all of whom failed to score.[122][123] Team Canada then lost 
the bronze medal game 3–2 to Finland to finish without a medal.[124] The 
Olympics marked Gretzky's eighth and final international appearance, finishing 
with four assists in six games. He retired from international play holding 
the records for most goals (20), most assists (28), and most overall points 
(48) in best-on-best hockey.[125] Gretzky's size and strength were unimpressive—in 
fact, far below average for the NHL—but he is widely considered the smartest 
player in the history of the game.[126][127][128] His reading of the game 
and his ability to improvise on the fly were unrivaled, and he could consistently 
anticipate where the puck was going to be and execute the right move at 
the right time.[26] His coach at the Edmonton Oilers, Glen Sather, said, 
"He was so much more intelligent. While they were using all this energy 
trying to rattle his teeth, he was just skating away, circling, analyzing 
things."[129] He was also considered one of the most creative players in 
hockey. "You never knew what he was going to do", said hockey Hall of Famer 
Igor Larionov. "He was improvising all the time. Every time he took the 
ice, there was some spontaneous decision he would make. That's what made 
him such a phenomenal player."[130] Gretzky's ability to improvise came 
into the spotlight at the 1998 Olympics in Japan. Then an older player 
in the sunset of his career, he had been passed over for the captaincy 
of the team. But as the series continued, his unique skills made him a 
team leader. The Canadians had trouble with the big ice. They had trouble 
with the European patterns and the lateral play and the endless, inventive 
cycling. … Slowly, as game after game went by and the concern continued 
to rise, Wayne Gretzky began climbing through the lineup. He, almost alone 
among the Canadians, seemed to take to the larger ice surface as if it 
offered more opportunity instead of obligation…. His playing time soared, 
as he was being sent on not just for power plays but double shifts and 
even penalty kills. By the final round … it was Wayne Gretzky who assumed 
the leadership both on and off the ice.[131] He passed and shot with prodigious 
skill. Hall of Fame defenceman Bobby Orr said of Gretzky, "He passes better 
than anybody I've ever seen."[132] In his first two seasons in the NHL, 
his deft passing skills helped earn him a reputation as an ace playmaker, 
and so opposing defensemen focused their efforts on foiling his attempts 
to pass the puck to other scorers. In response, Gretzky started shooting 
on goal himself—and with exceptional effectiveness.[133] He had a fast 
and accurate shot. "Wayne Gretzky was one of the most accurate scorers 
in NHL history", said one biography.[134] Statistics support the contention: 
Whereas Phil Esposito, who had set the previous goal-scoring record, needed 
550 shots to score 76 goals, Gretzky netted his 76th after only 287 shots—about 
half as many. He scored his all-time record of 92 goals with just 369 shots.[133] 
Because he was so light compared to other players, goalies were often surprised 
by how hard Gretzky's shot was. Goalies called his shots "sneaky fast." 
He also had a way of never hitting the puck with the same rhythm twice, 
making his shots harder to time and block.[135] When he entered the league 
in 1979, critics opined that Gretzky was "too small, too wiry, and too 
slow to be a force in the NHL".[136] His weight was 160 pounds (73 kg), 
compared to the NHL average of 189 pounds (86 kg) at that time.[137] But 
that year, Gretzky tied for first place in scoring, and won the Hart trophy 
for the league's most valuable player.[138] In his second year in the league, 
weighing just 165 pounds, he broke the previous single-season scoring record, 
racking up 164 points.[139] The next year (1981–82), at 170 pounds—still 
"a wisp compared to the average NHL player"—he set the all-time goal-scoring 
record, putting 92 pucks in the net.[140] He weighed "about 170 pounds" 
for the better part of his career.[141] He consistently scored last in 
strength tests among the Edmonton Oilers, bench pressing only 140 pounds 
(64 kg).[142] However, he had remarkable physical stamina. Like his hero, 
Gordie Howe, Gretzky possessed "an exceptional capacity to renew his energy 
resources quickly." In 1980, when an exercise physiologist tested the recuperative 
abilities of all of the Edmonton Oilers, Gretzky scored so high the tester 
said that he "thought the machine had broken."[143] His stamina is also 
indicated by the fact that Gretzky often scored late in the game. In the 
year he scored his record 92 goals, 22 of them went in the net during the 
first period, 30 in the second—and 40 in the third.[133] He also had strong 
general athletic skills. Growing up, he was a competitive runner and also 
batted .492 for the Junior Intercounty Baseball League's Brantford CKCP 
Braves in the summer of 1980. As a result, he was offered a contract by 
the Toronto Blue Jays.[143] (History repeated itself in June 2011, when 
Gretzky's 17-year-old son, Trevor, was drafted by the Chicago Cubs. Trevor 
signed with the Cubs the next month.[144] ) Gretzky also excelled at box 
lacrosse, which he played during the summer. At age ten, after scoring 
196 goals in his hockey league, he scored 158 goals in lacrosse.[145] According 
to him, lacrosse was where he learned to protect himself from hard checks: 
"In those days you could be hit from behind in lacrosse, as well as cross-checked, 
so you had to learn how to roll body checks for self-protection."[146] 
Gretzky adroitly applied this technique as a professional player, avoiding 
checks with such skill that a rumour circulated that there was an unwritten 
rule not to hit him.[147] Defensemen found Gretzky a most elusive target. 
Fellow Hockey Hall of Famer Denis Potvin compared attempting to hit Gretzky 
to "wrapping your arms around fog. You saw him but when you reached out 
to grab him your hands felt nothing, maybe just a chill." The 205-pound 
(93 kg) Potvin, a three-time winner of the Norris Trophy for best defenceman, 
added that part of the problem in hitting Gretzky hard was that he was 
"a tough guy to dislike... what was there to hate about Gretzky? It was 
like running Gandhi into a corner."[148] He received a good deal of cover 
from burly Oiler defensemen Dave Semenko and Marty McSorley. The latter 
followed Gretzky to the Los Angeles Kings in 1989, where he played the 
same policeman role for several more years.[149][150] But Gretzky discouraged 
unfair hits in another way. "If a guy ran him, Wayne would embarrass that 
guy", said former Oiler Lee Fogolin. "He'd score six or seven points on 
him. I saw him do it night after night."[150] Commentators have noted Gretzky's 
uncanny ability to judge the position of the other players on the ice—so 
much so that many suspected he enjoyed some kind of extrasensory perception. 
Sports commentators said that he played like he had "eyes in the back of 
his head."[151] Gretzky said he sensed other players more than he actually 
saw them. "I get a feeling about where a teammate is going to be", he said. 
"A lot of times, I can turn and pass without even looking."[4] Veteran 
Canadian journalist Peter Gzowski says that Gretzky seemed to be able to, 
in effect, slow down time. [152] "There is an unhurried grace to everything 
Gretzky does on the ice. Winding up for the slapshot, he will stop for 
an almost imperceptible moment at the top of his arc, like a golfer with 
a rhythmic swing." "Gretzky uses this room to insert an extra beat into 
his actions. In front of the net, eyeball to eyeball with the goaltender 
… he will … hold the puck one … extra instant, upsetting the anticipated 
rhythm of the game, extending the moment. … He distorts time, and not only 
by slowing it down. Sometimes he will release the puck before he appears 
to be ready, threading the pass through a maze of players precisely to 
the blade of a teammate's stick, or finding a chink in a goaltender's armour 
and slipping the puck into it … before the goaltender is ready to react."[153] 
However, Gretzky denied that he had any exotic innate abilities. He said 
that many of his advantages were a result of his father's brilliant coaching. 
Some say I have a "sixth sense" … Baloney. I've just learned to guess what's 
going to happen next. It's anticipation. It's not God-given, it's Wally-given. 
He used to stand on the blue line and say to me, "Watch, this is how everybody 
else does it." Then he'd shoot a puck along the boards and into the corner 
and then go chasing after it. Then he'd come back and say, "Now, this is 
how the smart player does it." He'd shoot it into the corner again, only 
this time he cut across to the other side and picked it up over there. 
Who says anticipation can't be taught?[142] Gretzky learned much about 
hockey from his father on a backyard rink at his home. Walter Gretzky had 
been an outstanding Junior B hockey player.[154] He cultivated a love of 
hockey in his sons and provided them with a backyard rink and drills to 
enhance their skills.[15] On the backyard rink, nicknamed the "Wally Coliseum", 
winter was total hockey immersion with Walter as mentor-teacher as well 
as teammate. Walter's drills were his own invention, but were ahead of 
their time in Canada. Gretzky would later remark that the Soviet National 
Team's practice drills, which impressed Canada in 1972, had nothing to 
offer him: "I'd been doing these drills since I was three. My Dad was very 
smart."[155] In his autobiography, Gretzky describes how at practices his 
dad would drill him on the fundamentals of smart hockey: Him: "Where's 
the last place a guy looks before he passes it?" Me: "The guy he's passing 
to." Him: "Which means..." Me: "Get over there and intercept it." Him: 
"Where do you skate?" Me: "To where the puck is going, not where it's been." 
Him: "If you get cut off, what are you gonna do?" Me: "Peel." Him: "Which 
way?" Me: "Away from the guy, not towards him."[156] Wayne also salutes 
his coach at the Edmonton Oilers, Glen ("Slats") Sather, as an important 
influence in his development as a hockey player. Gretzky played for 10 
years with the Oilers, with Sather as coach. "It's as if my father raised 
me until age 17, then turned me over to Slats and said, 'You take him from 
here.'"[74] Where Gretzky differed from others in his development was in 
the extraordinary commitment of time on the ice. "From the age of three 
to the age of 12, I could easily be out there for eight to 10 hours a day", 
Gretzky has said.[157] In his autobiography, he wrote: All I wanted to 
do in the winters was be on the ice. I'd get up in the morning, skate from 
7:00 to 8:30, go to school, come home at 3:30, stay on the ice until my 
mom insisted I come in for dinner, eat in my skates, then go back out until 
9:00. [158] When asked how he managed, at age ten, to score 378 goals in 
a single season, Gretzky explained, See, kids usually don't start playing 
hockey until they're six or seven. Ice isn't grass. It's a whole new surface 
and everybody starts from ground zero. … By the time I was ten, I had eight 
years on skates instead of four, and a few seasons' worth of ice time against 
ten-year-olds. So I had a long head start on everyone else.[159] Much has 
been written about Gretzky's highly developed hockey instincts, but he 
once explained that what appeared to be instinct was, in large part, the 
effect of his relentless study and practice of the game, in cooperation 
with his coaches. As a result, he developed a deep understanding of its 
shifting patterns and dynamics. Peter Gzowski says that the best of the 
best athletes in all sports understand the game so well, and in such detail, 
that they can instantly recognize and capitalize upon emerging patterns 
of play. Analyzing Gretzky's hockey skills, he says, "What we take to be 
creative genius is in fact a reaction to a situation that he has stored 
in his brain as deeply and firmly as his own phone number." Gzowski presented 
this theory to Gretzky, and he fully agreed. "Absolutely", Gretzky said. 
"That's a hundred percent right. It's all practice. I got it from my Dad. 
Nine out of ten people think it's instinct, and it isn't. Nobody would 
ever say a doctor had learned his profession by instinct; yet in my own 
way I've put in almost as much time studying hockey as a medical student 
puts in studying medicine."[160] Gretzky was inducted into the Hockey Hall 
of Fame on November 22, 1999, becoming the tenth player to bypass the three-year 
waiting period.[161] The Hall of Fame then announced that he would be the 
last player to do so.[162] He was inducted into the IIHF Hall of Fame in 
2000.[163] In addition, Gretzky's jersey number 99 was retired league-wide 
at the 2000 NHL All-Star Game. The jersey retirement was similar to Major 
League Baseball's retirement of the number 42 worn by Jackie Robinson.[164] 
In October 1999, Edmonton honoured Gretzky by renaming one of Edmonton's 
busiest freeways, Capilano Drive – which passes by Northlands Coliseum 
– to Wayne Gretzky Drive.[165] Also in Edmonton, the local transit authority 
assigned a rush-hour bus route numbered No. 99 which also runs on Wayne 
Gretzky Drive for its commute.[166] In 2002, the Kings held a jersey retirement 
ceremony and erected a life-sized statue of Gretzky outside the Staples 
Center; the ceremony was delayed until then so that Bruce McNall, who had 
recently finished a prison sentence, could attend.[167] His hometown of 
Brantford, Ontario, renamed Park Road North to "Wayne Gretzky Parkway" 
as well as renaming the North Park Recreation Centre to The Wayne Gretzky 
Sports Centre. Brantford further inducted Gretzky into its "Walk of Fame" 
in 2004.[168] On May 10, 2010, he was awarded The Ambassador Award of Excellence 
by the LA Sports & Entertainment Commission.[169] Almost immediately after 
retirement, several NHL teams approached him about an ownership role.[170] 
In May 2000, he agreed to buy a 10% stake in the Phoenix Coyotes in a partnership 
with majority owner Steve Ellman, taking on the roles of alternate governor, 
managing partner and head of hockey operations.[171] The Coyotes were in 
the process of being sold and Ellman convinced Gretzky to come on board, 
averting a potential move to Portland, Oregon.[171] The sale was not completed 
until the following year, on February 15, 2001, after two missed deadlines 
while securing financing and partners before Ellman and Gretzky could take 
over. The sale completed with the addition to the partnership of Jerry 
Moyes.[172] Gretzky convinced his long-time agent Michael Barnett to join 
the team as its General Manager.[173] In 2005, rumors began regarding Gretzky 
becoming the head coach of the team, but were denied by Gretzky and the 
Coyotes.[174] He agreed to become head coach on August 8, 2005.[175] Gretzky 
made his coaching debut on October 5,[176] and won his first game on October 
8 against the Minnesota Wild.[177] He took an indefinite leave of absence 
on December 17 to be with his ill mother. Phyllis Gretzky died of lung 
cancer on December 19.[178] Gretzky resumed his head-coaching duties on 
December 28.[179] The Coyotes' record at the end of the 2005–06 season 
was 38–39–5, a 16-win improvement over 2004–05; they were 36–36–5 in games 
Gretzky coached.[180] In 2006, Moyes became majority owner of the team.[181] 
There was uncertainty about Gretzky's role[182] until it was announced 
on May 31, 2006 that he had agreed to a five-year contract to remain head 
coach.[183] The Coyotes' performance declined in 2006–07, as the team ended 
the season 15th in their conference. During Gretzky's coaching tenure, 
the Coyotes did not reach the postseason, and their best finish in the 
Western Conference standings was 12th.[180] On May 5, 2009, the Coyotes' 
holding company, Dewey Ranch Hockey LLC, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. 
An ownership dispute involving Research in Motion's Jim Balsillie (with 
the intention of relocating the team) and the NHL itself arose, which eventually 
ended up in Court. Gretzky did not attend the Coyotes' training camp, leaving 
associate head coach Ulf Samuelsson in charge, due to an uncertain contractual 
status with the club, whose bankruptcy hearings were continuing. Bidders 
for the club had indicated that Gretzky would no longer be associated with 
the team after it emerged from bankruptcy, and on September 24, 2009, Gretzky 
stepped down as head coach and head of hockey operations of the Coyotes. 
Gretzky's final head coaching record was 143–161–24.[180] Gretzky was Executive 
Director of the Canadian men's hockey team at the 2002 Winter Olympics 
in Salt Lake City, Utah. On February 18, he lashed out at the media at 
a press conference, frustrated with media and fan comments regarding his 
team's uninspiring 1–1–1 start.[184] His temper boiled over after Canada's 
3–3 draw versus the Czech Republic, as he launched a tirade against the 
perceived negative reputation of Team Canada amongst other national squads, 
and called rumours of dissent in the dressing room the result of "American 
propaganda". "They're loving us not doing well", he said, referring to 
American hockey fans.[184] American fans online began calling Gretzky a 
"crybaby"; defenders said he was merely borrowing a page from former coach 
Glen Sather to take the pressure off his players. Gretzky addressed those 
comments by saying he spoke out to protect the Canadian players, and the 
tirade was not "staged".[185] The Canadian team won the gold medal, its 
first in 50 years.[186] Gretzky again acted as Executive Director of Canada's 
men's hockey team at the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy, though not 
with the success of 2002; the team was eliminated in the quarterfinals 
and failed to win a medal.[187] He was asked to manage Canada's team at 
the 2005 Ice Hockey World Championships, but declined due to his mother's 
poor health.[188] Gretzky also served as an ambassador and contributor 
in Vancouver winning the bidding process to host the 2010 Winter Olympics. 
He went to Prague, Czech Republic and was part of the presentation team.[189] 
Gretzky was the final Olympic torchbearer at the 2010 Winter Olympics. 
He was one of four who lit the cauldron at BC Place Stadium during the 
opening ceremony (although one did not due to technical difficulties with 
one of the cauldron's "arms" which failed to raise) and then jogged out 
of the stadium, where he was then driven by police escorts through the 
streets of downtown Vancouver to light a second, outdoor cauldron near 
the Vancouver Convention Centre located in the city's downtown waterfront 
district.[190] Under IOC rules, the lighting of the Olympic cauldron must 
be witnessed by those attending the opening ceremony, implying that it 
must be lit at the location where the ceremony is taking place. Although 
another IOC rule states that the cauldron should be witnessed outside by 
the entire residents of the entire host city, this was not possible since 
the ceremony took place indoors. However, VANOC secretly built a second 
outdoor cauldron next to the West Building of the Vancouver Convention 
Centre, and Gretzky was secretly chosen to light this permanent cauldron.[191] 
Quickly word spread through the downtown Vancouver area that Gretzky was 
indeed the final torchbearer, and very soon a crush of people came running 
after the police escort to cheer Gretzky on and hopefully catch a glimpse 
of him carrying the torch to the outdoor cauldron.[192] For the 2010 Winter 
Olympics, he was named Special Advisor to the Canada men's national ice 
hockey team.[193] Although Gretzky had previously stated he would not participate 
in any "old-timers exhibition games",[194] on November 22, 2003, he took 
to the ice one last time to help celebrate the Edmonton Oilers' 25th anniversary 
as an NHL team. The Heritage Classic, held at Commonwealth Stadium in Edmonton, 
was the first regular season NHL game to be played outdoors.[195] It was 
preceded by the Mega Stars game, which featured Gretzky and many of his 
Oiler Dynasty teammates against a group of retired Montreal Canadiens players 
(whose likes included Claude Lemieux, Guy Lafleur and others). Despite 
frigid temperatures, the crowd numbered 57,167, with an additional several 
million watching the game on television.[196] The Edmonton alumni won the 
Megastars game 2–0,[197] while Montreal went on to win the regular season 
game held later that day, 4–3.[195] In October 2016, Gretzky became partner 
and vice-chairman of Oilers Entertainment Group.[198] Gretzky has made 
several TV appearances, including as a Dance Fever celebrity judge, and 
an 'unforgettable appearance', acting in a dramatic role alongside Victor 
Newman in The Young and the Restless in 1981.[199] In 1984, he travelled 
to the Soviet Union to film a television program on Russian goaltender 
Vladislav Tretiak.[200] Gretzky hosted the Saturday Night Live comedy program 
in 1989.[201] A fictional crime-fighting version of him served as one of 
the main characters in the cartoon ProStars in 1991.[202][203] Gretzky 
has made over 60 movie, network television and video appearances as himself, 
according to IMDB, as of February 2012.[204] He is a naturalized American 
citizen.[205][206] While serving as a judge on Dance Fever, Gretzky met 
actress Janet Jones.[207] According to Wayne, Janet does not recall him 
being on the show.[207] They met regularly after that, but did not become 
a couple until 1987 when they ran into each other at a Los Angeles Lakers 
game that Wayne and Alan Thicke were attending.[208] Wayne proposed in 
January 1988,[209] and they were married on July 16, 1988 in a lavish ceremony 
the Canadian press dubbed "The Royal Wedding".[210] Broadcast live throughout 
Canada from Edmonton's St. Joseph's Basilica, members of the Fire Department 
acted as ceremonial guards. The event reportedly cost Gretzky over US$1 
million.[211] Gretzky obtained US citizenship after he was traded to the 
Kings, but retains his Canadian citizenship.[212] He and Jones have five 
children: Paulina, Ty, Trevor, Tristan, and Emma. Paulina and golfer Dustin 
Johnson announced their engagement on August 18, 2013.[213] Ty played hockey 
at Shattuck-Saint Mary's,[214] but quit the sport, and now attends Arizona 
State University. Trevor signed a letter of intent in 2010 to play baseball 
for San Diego State University,[215] but decided to turn pro after he was 
drafted by the Chicago Cubs in the 2011 MLB draft;[216] his $375,000 signing 
bonus was negotiated by then-Cubs GM Jim Hendry and Wayne himself.[217] 
He was traded to the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim on March 20, 2014 for 
Matt Scioscia, son of Angels' manager Mike Scioscia.[218] In June, he was 
named by manager Dave Stapleton to the roster of the Orem Owlz.[219] Wayne 
Gretzky's uncle, Al Gretzky, ran as a Conservative candidate in London 
West in the 2006 federal election and for the libertarian Freedom Party 
of Ontario in the 2013 provincial by-election for the Legislative Assembly 
of Ontario. He was unsuccessful both times.[220][221] Gretzky has owned 
or partnered in the ownership of two sports teams before becoming a partner 
in the Phoenix Coyotes. In 1985, Gretzky bought the Hull Olympiques of 
the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League for $175,000 CA.[222] During his 
ownership, the team's colours were changed to silver and black, presaging 
the change in team jersey colours when he played for the Los Angeles Kings. 
For the first season that Gretzky played in Los Angeles, the Kings had 
their training camp at the Olympiques' arena.[223] Gretzky eventually sold 
the team in 1992 for $550,000 CA.[224] In 1991, Gretzky purchased the Toronto 
Argonauts of the Canadian Football League (CFL) with Bruce McNall and John 
Candy. The club won the Grey Cup championship in the first year of the 
partnership but struggled in the two following seasons, and the partnership 
sold the team before the 1994 season. Only McNall's name was engraved on 
the Grey Cup as team owner, but in November 2007, the CFL corrected the 
oversight, adding Gretzky's and Candy's names.[225] In 1992, Gretzky and 
McNall partnered in an investment to buy a rare Honus Wagner T206 cigarette 
card for $451,000 US, later selling the card. It most recently sold for 
$2.8 million US.[226] Gretzky was a board member and executive officer 
of the Hespeler Hockey Company.[227] As of May 2008, Gretzky's current 
business ventures include the "Wayne Gretzky's" restaurant in Toronto near 
the Rogers Centre in downtown Toronto, opened in partnership with Tom Bitove 
in 1993.[228] Gretzky is also a partner in First Team Sports, a maker of 
sports equipment and Worldwide Roller Hockey, Inc., an operator of roller 
hockey rinks.[229][230] Gretzky's appeal as a product endorser far surpassed 
that of other hockey players of his era. By 1995, he was among the five 
highest-paid athlete endorsers in North America, with deals from The Coca-Cola 
Company, Domino's Pizza, Sharp Corporation, and Upper Deck Company among 
others.[231] He has endorsed and launched a wide variety of products, from 
pillow cases to insurance.[232][233] The video game brand EA Sports included 
Gretzky in its 2010 title NHL Slapshot,[234] and he had previously been 
an endorser for the 989 Sports games Gretzky NHL 2005 and Gretzky NHL 2006.[235][236] 
Gretzky also made an appearance on the music video for Nickelback's "Rockstar".[237] 
Forbes estimates that Gretzky made US$93.8 million from 1990–98.[238] During 
the 2015 Canadian federal election campaign, Gretzky endorsed the Conservative 
Party and Prime Minister Stephen Harper, and was featured at a campaign 
rally praising Harper by calling him "wonderful to the country."[239] As 
a non-resident, Gretzky came under some criticism for this endorsement.[240][241][242][243][244] 
In 2014, Gretzky praised Harper at a United for Ukraine Gala event in Toronto 
calling him "one of the greatest prime ministers ever".[239] Earlier in 
2015, Gretzky endorsed Patrick Brown during his successful campaign for 
the leadership of the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario.[239] While 
Gretzky is a dual Canadian-American citizen, he is currently unable to 
vote in Canadian elections as he has not lived in the country since 1988.[239] 
In 2003, Gretzky praised President of the United States George W. Bush 
and his 2003 invasion of Iraq saying: "The president of the United States 
is a great leader, I happen to think he's a wonderful man and if he believes 
what he's doing in Iraq is right, I back him 100 per cent."[245] A number 
of awards and trophies have been created under his name. The Wayne Gretzky 
99 Award is awarded annually to the Most Valuable Player in the Ontario 
Hockey League playoffs;[246] the Wayne Gretzky Trophy is awarded annually 
to the playoff champion of the OHL's Western Conference;[247] and the Wayne 
Gretzky Award is awarded annually to youth hockey players.[248] Figures
