Anthony John "Tony" Randazzo (born January 11, 1965) is an umpire in Major 
League Baseball. After working in the National League in 1999, he has umpired 
in both Major Leagues since 2000.[1] He is a graduate of Lake Park High 
School, and was a junior college catcher at Iowa Western Community College 
before injuries ended his playing career. Randazzo left college and attended 
the Harry Wendelstedt Umpire School shortly thereafter.[2][3] Randazzo 
has umpired in six Division Series (2004, 2006, 2009, 2011, 2012, 2013), 
two League Championship Series (2010, 2015), and the 2016 World Series. 
He has also officiated in two All-Star Games (2001, 2012).[1] On July 30, 
2012, Randazzo was hit in the hip after a line drive by Jesus Montero. 
Randazzo was not seriously injured and stayed in the game. In the 2014 
season, Randazzo was involved in an incident with Seattle Mariners manager 
Lloyd McClendon. On August 16, 2014, Randazzo ejected McClendon for arguing 
balls and strikes on behalf of starting pitcher Felix Hernandez. The argument 
followed a moment in which Randazzo granted Detroit Tigers first baseman 
Miguel Cabrera a timeout late into Hernandez' windup, which had already 
caused McClendon to argue that Randazzo should not have granted a timeout 
to begin with. Following the game, the pitch McClendon had argued was a 
strike was clearly displayed as a strike according to PitchF/X. McClendon 
also said that Randazzo's reasoning for ejecting him was because, "well, 
I've seen your act before."[4] In the following day's game in which Randazzo 
was the third base umpire, he again ejected McClendon for allegedly throwing 
his arms up after disagreeing with a check swing call. The ejection drew 
criticism from broadcasters of the Mariners, Tigers, and the national broadcast 
on TBS. Randazzo is married and has three children.[3] Randazzo's father 
George is founder and chairman of the National Italian American Sports 
Hall of Fame. His brother Marc is a Florida restaurant owner and former
