The QVC Marine Field (QVCマリンフィールド, QVC Marin Fiirudo?) is a stadium in 
Chiba City, Japan. It opened in 1990 and holds approximately 30,000 people. 
The official opening of the stadium was held on April 13, 14, 15 1990, 
when popstar Madonna opened her Blond Ambition Tour at the venue. The show 
was blighted by heavy rain and high winds, which led to the concert being 
dramatically scaled-back, as documented in her documentary Truth or Dare. 
Lady Gaga performed 2 sold out shows at the venue on August 13, & 14 2014 
for her ArtRave: The Artpop Ball [2] in front of 50,453 people.[3] The 
Summer Sonic Festival is held in the stadium and the neighbouring Makuhari 
Messe every summer. It is primarily used for baseball and is the home field 
of the Chiba Lotte Marines, secondarily used for Rugby union. Front of
