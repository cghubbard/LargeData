Gino Nicholas Cimoli (December 18, 1929 – February 12, 2011) was an American 
professional baseball outfielder. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) 
for the Brooklyn / Los Angeles Dodgers, St. Louis Cardinals, Pittsburgh 
Pirates, Milwaukee Braves, Kansas City Athletics, Baltimore Orioles, and 
California Angels from 1956 through 1965. He was an MLB All-Star in 1957, 
and a member of the 1960 World Series champions. A high school all-star 
at Galileo High School in San Francisco, Cimoli signed as an amateur free 
agent with the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1949. He would make his Major League 
Baseball debut with the Dodgers on April 19, 1956. On April 15, 1958, Cimoli 
became the first Major League batter to step into the batter's box on the 
West Coast when the Los Angeles Dodgers and the San Francisco Giants played 
their first game of the season at Seals Stadium in San Francisco.[citation

for Wally Moon and Phil Paine. After the 1959 season, the Cardinals traded 
Cimoli to the Pittsburgh Pirates with Tom Cheney in exchange for Ron Kline.[citation

which defeated the New York Yankees in seven games. He was primarily the 
Pirates' fourth outfielder in 1960 and often platooned with center fielder 
Bill Virdon. After left fielder Bob Skinner injured his thumb in the first 
game of the World Series, Cimoli started games two through six in left 
field. Cimoli returned to the bench in game seven when Skinner returned. 
In the eighth inning of game seven, with the Pirates trailing 7-4, Cimoli, 
pinch-hitting for pitcher Roy Face, led off with a single off Bobby Shantz, 
advanced to second on Virdon's bad-hop ground ball, which struck Yankee 
shortstop Tony Kubek in the throat, then scored on Dick Groat's single, 
the first run in a five-run inning to give the Pirates a 9-7 lead. The 
Pirates gave the lead away in the ninth before finally winning the game 
in the bottom half on Bill Mazeroski's leadoff home run. On June 15, 1961, 
the Pirates traded Cimoli to the Milwaukee Braves for Johnny Logan. The 
Kansas City Athletics selected Cimoli from the Braves in the Rule 5 draft 
after the season. The Athletics released Cimoli on May 29, 1964, and he 
signed with the Baltimore Orioles that day. Released by the Orioles before 
the 1965 season, Cimoli signed with the California Angels on April 10, 
1965. He appeared in his final major league game on May 7, and was released 
on May 14. Cimoli's baseball card in 1958 (No. 286, Topps) in which the 
background was painted out, shows him swinging a bat, without the bat-which 
was also painted out! (Source: Baseball Hall of Shame 4, Nash & Zullo) 
After retiring from baseball, Cimoli worked as a delivery driver for United 
Parcel Service where, in 1990, the company honored Cimoli for completing 
21 years of service without a traffic accident. Cimoli, then 60 years old 
and still working for the company, was now referred to as "The Lou Gehrig
