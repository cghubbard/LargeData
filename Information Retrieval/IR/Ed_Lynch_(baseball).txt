Edward Francis Lynch (born February 25, 1956 in Brooklyn, New York) is 
a former Major League Baseball pitcher. He attented Christopher Columbus 
High School in Miami, Florida. During his career, he pitched and batted 
right-handed, and his pitch selection included a fastball, slider, changeup 
and slurve.[1] Lynch was drafted by the Texas Rangers in the 22nd round 
of the 1977 Major League Baseball Draft. After three years in their farm 
system, in which he compiled a 22–27 record and 3.89 earned run average, 
the Rangers sent him to the New York Mets on September 18, 1979 as part 
of an earlier deal in which the Mets sent Willie Montañez to the Rangers 
for two players to be named later. The other player the Rangers sent the 
Mets was first baseman Mike Jorgensen. Lynch debuted with the Mets on August 
31, 1980 against the San Francisco Giants, and gave up four earned runs 
in just 1.1 inning out of the bullpen.[2] He won his first major league 
start on September 13 against the Chicago Cubs, snapping a thirteen-game 
losing streak for his club.[3] For the season, Lynch was 1–1 with a 5.12 
ERA in four starts. The Mets and Cubs were perennially the bottom two teams 
in the National League East for the early part of Lynch's career, however, 
they'd evolved into division rivals at the top of the N.L. East by the 
time Lynch took the mound in the second game of a double header on August 
7, 1984. The first game was won by the Cubs, 8–6, on the strength of a 
six run fifth inning, which included a three run home run by Keith Moreland.[4] 
During a five run fourth inning in the second game, Lynch hit Moreland 
with a pitch, inciting a bench clearing brawl. The Cubs won the second 
game, 8–4.[5] Lynch enjoyed a career year in 1985, when he went 10–8 with 
a 3.44 ERA in a career high 191 innings pitched. Lynch made only one appearance 
for the Mets in 1986, pitching 1.2 innings in relief in the third game 
of the season, when he went on the disabled list with torn cartilage in 
his left knee. By the time he was ready to return, he'd lost his spot in 
the starting rotation to the young pitchers on the 1986 World Champion 
squad. The Mets traded him to the Cubs for Dave Liddell and Dave Lenderman. 
He remained with the Cubs through 1987 before retiring. After his career 
ended, he attended the University of Miami School of Law, and graduated 
in 1991. Using his law degree and prior baseball experience he was able 
to land management positions with the San Diego Padres and Cubs, where 
he eventually became General Manager. Lynch was a popular person at UM, 
and was known to let other students try on his 1986 World Series ring, 
which he proudly wore every day. Ed currently resides in Phoenix, Arizona. 
At one point he worked as a scout for the Cubs. As of 2010, Lynch is serving
