The Washington Nationals' 2012 season was the eighth season for the baseball 
franchise of Major League Baseball in the District of Columbia, the fifth 
season at Nationals Park, and the 44th since the original team was started 
in Montreal, Quebec. After finishing the previous season in third place 
with an 80–81 record, out of last place in the NL East for the second time 
since moving to Washington, the Nationals made several moves to pursue 
playoff contention in 2012 and beyond. Despite being plagued with injuries, 
the Nationals had an impressive start to the season, never dropping below 
the .500 mark and consistently holding first or second place in their division. 
On September 3, the Nationals won their 82nd game of the season, making 
this season their first winning season since moving to Washington, D.C. 
in 2005 and the first for the franchise since 2003. On September 20, the 
Nationals beat the Los Angeles Dodgers to clinch the franchise's first 
postseason berth since 1981, and the first for a Washington-based team 
since the Washington Senators won the American League pennant in 1933. 
On October 1, the Nationals clinched the National League East division.[1] 
On October 3, they went on to clinch the best record in Major League Baseball 
at 98-64.[2] They finished the season with a 98-64 record and played the 
St. Louis Cardinals in the Divisional Series. On October 12, in Game 5 
of the NLDS, they lost to the Cardinals 9-7 and were eliminated.[3] On 
October 30, 2011, following the World Series, the Nationals granted Todd 
Coffey, Alex Cora, Jonny Gomes, Liván Hernández, Laynce Nix, and Iván Rodríguez 
free agency. On November 2, they also granted Luis Atilano, J.D. Martin, 
Shairon Martis, Garrett Mock, Óliver Pérez, Miguel Perez, Michael Aubrey, 
Matt Antonelli, Gregor Blanco, Buck Coats, and Jeff Frazier free agency. 
On November 3, Brian Bixler was selected off waivers by the Houston Astros, 
and on December 8, Erik Komatsu was selected by the St. Louis Cardinals 
in the Rule 5 draft (he was returned, via the Minnesota Twins, on May 29). 
On December 9, the Nationals traded Collin Balester to the Detroit Tigers 
for Ryan Perry. On December 12, Doug Slaten was granted free agency.[4] 
Additionally, on October 31, the Nationals moved interim bench coach Pat 
Corrales back into a position in player development for the team. Corrales 
had assumed that role in June after the resignations of manager Jim Riggleman 
and interim manager John McLaren — McLaren had held the bench coach position 
under Riggleman.[5] On December 23, the Nationals traded Brad Peacock and 
Tommy Milone, along with minor-league prospects Derek Norris and A.J. Cole, 
to the Oakland Athletics for left-handed starting pitcher Gio Gonzalez 
and Oakland minor-league prospect Robert Gilliam.[4] On February 19, 2012, 
Mike Cameron (signed on December 19) retired after seventeen years in the 
major leagues, with one All-Star appearance and three Gold Glove awards.[4] 
On March 30, the Nationals granted Andrés Blanco (signed on December 16) 
free agency, and on April 2, the Nationals granted Chad Durbin (signed 
on February 1) free agency.[4] On December 5, 2011, the Nationals signed 
Brett Carroll as a free agent. On December 11, they signed Jason Michaels; 
they released him on March 29, 2012 and re-signed him to a new contract 
on April 2. On December 14 they signed Jarrett Hoffpauir and Waldis Joaquin, 
on December 15 they signed Jeff Fulchino, on December 20 they signed Xavier 
Paul and Chad Tracy, and on December 22 they signed Mark DeRosa.[4] On 
December 16 they signed Andrés Blanco, who they later released on March 
30. On December 19, they signed Mike Cameron, who retired on February 19. 
On February 1, they signed Chad Durbin, who they later released on April 
2.[4] On December 23, the Nationals traded Brad Peacock and Tommy Milone, 
along with minor-league prospects Derek Norris and A.J. Cole, to the Oakland 
Athletics for left-handed starting pitcher Gio Gonzalez and Oakland minor-league 
prospect Robert Gilliam.[4] On January 4, 2012, the Nationals signed Dan 
Cortes, on January 26 they signed Brad Lidge, on February 2 they signed 
Edwin Jackson, on February 3 they signed Mitch Atkins, on February 6 they 
signed Mark Teahen, on February 28 they signed Mike Schultz, on March 18 
they signed Xavier Nady, and on March 29 they signed Zach Duke.[4] The 
Nationals held their 2012 spring training in Viera, Florida, with home 
games played at Space Coast Stadium. On April 3, 2012, the Nationals placed 
Drew Storen and Michael Morse on the disabled list to start the season, 
and John Lannan was optioned to Triple-A Syracuse. The Nationals also started 
a "Take Back Our Park" campaign vs. Philadelphia so Nationals fans in Maryland, 
Virginia, and Washington, D.C. could receive tickets for the series on 
May 4–6 in an advanced pre-sale. On April 28, 2012, top prospect Bryce 
Harper made his Major League debut vs. Los Angeles in Los Angeles, finishing 
with a double and a go-ahead sacrifice fly. The Nationals, however, would 
lose the game on a Matt Kemp walk-off home run in the bottom of the 10th 
inning.[citation needed] At the All-Star break, which began on July 9, 
2012, the Nationals were in first place in the NL East with a 49–34 record, 
four games ahead of the second-place Atlanta Braves.[6] On July 30, 2012, 
despite having an off day, the Nationals obtained the best record in baseball 
due to a loss by the Cincinnati Reds. This was the first time that a Washington 
baseball team held sole position of first place in MLB since 1933.[7] On 
September 20, 2012, the Nats clinched their first Playoff berth since moving 
to Washington, with a 4-1 win over the L.A. Dodgers. On October 1, 2012, 
the Nats clinched the NL East when the Braves lost 2-1 to the Pirates. 
The Nats finished the season on October 3, 2012, defeating the Phillies 
5-1. They finished with a 98-64 record, the best record in Major League 
baseball that year. Nationals starting pitchers Stephen Strasburg and Gio 
Gonzalez, and shortstop Ian Desmond, were chosen to represent the Nationals 
in the 2012 All-Star Game. Desmond decided not to participate in order 
to rest a sore oblique muscle; Michael Bourn of the Atlanta Braves was 
chosen to go in his place. Giancarlo Stanton of the Miami Marlins declined 
to participate because of a serious knee injury which required surgery,[8] 
so the Nationals' Bryce Harper was chosen to play in his place. This made 
the 19-year-old Harper the youngest position player and the third youngest 
player to be named an All-Star.[9] The Nationals therefore had four All-Stars, 
the most since they moved to Washington, D.C.[10] The game was played on 
Tuesday, July 10, in Kansas City, and the National League won, 8-0. Gonzalez 
and Strasburg each pitched one scoreless inning; Gonzalez struck out one 
batter, and Strasburg allowed a hit and a walk. Harper entered the game 
in the fifth inning as a pinch hitter and played the remainder of the game 
in left field; at the plate, he went 0–1 with a walk.[11] Infielders Outfielders 
Coaches The Nationals drew 2,370,794 fans at Nationals Park during the 
regular season in 2012. It was the first time since 2006 that they had 
drawn more than 2,000,000 fans, and only the 2,731,993 they drew in their 
first season in Washington in 2005 exceeded it. It placed them ninth in 
attendance for the season among the 16 National League teams, also their 
best showing since 2005.[12][13][14] The Nationals played the St. Louis
