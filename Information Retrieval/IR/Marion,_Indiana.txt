Marion is a town in Grant County, Indiana, United States. The population 
was 29,948 as of the 2010 census. The city is the county seat of Grant 
County.[6] It is named for Francis Marion, a Brigadier General from South 
Carolina in the American Revolutionary War. The city is the home of Indiana 
Wesleyan University, the largest evangelical Christian university in the 
Midwest and largest private university in Indiana- if including online 
and regional campuses in Indiana, Kentucky, Ohio, and Illinois. The traditional 
campus enrolls approximately 2800 students. Since 2016, Jess Alumbaugh 
has been Marion's mayor. Marion is also noted for being the birthplace 
of actor James Dean, and cartoonist Jim Davis, though James Dean and Jim 
Davis were raised in nearby Fairmount. It was also the location of the 
wedding of actress Julia Roberts and singer Lyle Lovett in 1993.[7] The 
city is also the site of the infamous lynching of Thomas Shipp and Abram 
Smith. Marion is located along the Mississinewa River. According to the

was fought in December 1812, just north of the current city of Marion, 
as an expeditionary force sent by William Henry Harrison against the Miami 
villages. Today, the battle is reenacted every fall by residents of Grant 
County and many reenactors and enthusiasts from throughout the United States 
and Canada during the annual "Mississinewa 1812" festival, the largest 
War of 1812 reenactment in the United States.[9] The Grant County Jail 
and Sheriff's Residence, Abijah C. Jay House, Marion Branch, National Home 
for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers Historic District, Marion Downtown Commercial 
Historic District, Aaron Swayzee House, George, Jr. and Marie Daugherty 
Webster House, and J. Woodrow Wilson House are listed on the National Register 
of Historic Places.[10] When Martin Boots and David Branson each donated 
30 acres (120,000 m2) of land in 1831 for the site of Marion, they chose 
a location on the left bank of the swift, scenic river which the Miami 
Indians had named "Mississinewa," meaning "Falling water." So rapid had 
been the tide of settlement that it followed by only 19 years the Battle 
of Mississinewa, 7 miles (11 km) downstream, where U.S. troops and Indians 
had fought a bloody, pre-dawn encounter in 1812. With the formation of 
Grant County in 1831, Marion was established as the county seat and its 
future was assured. The river provided water supply, power, and drainage 
and it bequeathed a natural beauty as it flowed at the base of hills that 
marched away on either side. Along with at least 36 other communities in 
the U.S., Marion was named for the Revolutionary War General Francis Marion, 
the "Swamp Fox" of South Carolina. Marion grew slowly for more than 50 
years as an agricultural trading center supported by a sprinkling of small 
farm- and forest-related industries. Native Americans were a common sight 
as they wandered in from Indiana's last reservation, with its Indian school, 
Baptist Church, and cemetery, 8 miles (13 km) away. In the 1880s, fields 
of natural gas were discovered across much of east-central Indiana, and 
Grant County began to grow at a dizzying pace. Gas City and Matthews were 
carved out of raw farmland and launched as speculative boom towns, each 
absorbing existing tiny villages. They attracted several thousand residents 
before the gas failed and most industries left. As late as the 1940s, Matthews 
resembled a Western ghost town, before it attracted eleven glass factories 
and seduced the professional baseball team away from Indianapolis. Grant 
County's only covered bridge remains there as a link to the past. However, 
the gas boom left its legacy. A few industries remained, particularly glass 
manufacturers. On July 23, 1888, with increasing membership amongst the 
six National Homes for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers (NHDVS) National Home 
for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers, Congress established the seventh of ten 
National Homes in Grant County, Indiana to be known as the Marion Branch 
. Congress allotted an appropriation of $200,000, while Grant County residents 
provided a natural gas supply for the heating and lighting of this new 
facility. Marion was selected as a site for the new branch due to the availability 
of natural gas and the political activities of Colonel George W. Steele, 
Sr, the 11th Congressional Representative from 1880 to 1890. The Marion 
Branch Historic District is located at the intersection of 38th Street 
and Lincoln Boulevard, approximately 2½ miles southeast of the city center 
of Marion. The boundaries are 38th Street on the north, the railroad right 
of way on the east, the Mississinewa River on the southeast, Chambers Park 
on the south and southeast, and Lincoln Boulevard to the west. The 212-acre 
(0.86 km2) site is roughly square in form with diagonal boundary lines 
on the southeast and the southwest eliminating those corners of the square. 
Originally, farming operations on the Home grounds included the area that 
is now Chambers Park. In 1981, a Determination of Eligibility for the National 
Register of Historic Places for Federal Properties was made under Criteria 
A and C. As a result, since 1981, various projects have been reviewed by 
the Indiana State Preservation Office for compliance under Section 106 
of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended. In 1992, 
the historic district was surveyed by the Indiana Department of Natural 
Resources as a component of the Grant County inventory of historic sites 
and structures. This facility is now a part of VA Northern Indiana Health 
Care System, a dual campus facility associated with the former VA Medical 
Center Fort Wayne. Unfortunately, the original treatment hospital built 
in 1889, the greenhouse and cadet quarters are scheduled for demolition. 
There has been a lack of public interest in restoring these building to 
their original splendor and as they are currently a hazard for Veterans, 
the Department has no choice but to destroy these buildings. A lynching 
occurred in Marion on August 7, 1930. A large mob estimated at 2,000 gathered 
at the county jail where three young black men were held on charges of 
killing a white man and raping his girlfriend. Before they could be tried, 
the three, Thomas Shipp, Abram Smith, and James Cameron, were dragged from 
the jail and severely beaten. Shipp and Smith were hanged, but Cameron 
was released when an unidentified man claimed that he had nothing to do 
with the crimes. In 1931 he was convicted as an accessory to murder and 
served four years before being paroled. James Cameron went on to serve 
as the Indiana State Director of Civil Liberties from 1942 to 1950 and 
founded three local chapters of the NAACP. He served as the first president 
of the Madison County, Indiana chapter. In 1988 he founded America’s Black 
Holocaust Museum in Milwaukee to preserve the history of African Americans 
who had faced the terror and violence of lynching. In 1993, James Cameron 
received an official apology and a full pardon from the state of Indiana.[11] 
Cameron later said, "Since the state of Indiana forgave me, I forgive the 
state of Indiana." In 2005, the U.S. Senate also officially apologized 
to Cameron and others. The event in Marion was notable as the last confirmed 
lynching of blacks in the Northern United States.[12] Marion's prosperity 
plateaued between the end of the gas boom, just prior to World War I, when 
the gas boom ended, and 1955, when General Motors located a stamping and 
tool plant there. A new era launched overnight, raising the sights of local 
residents who migrated to the city in unprecedented numbers with thoughts 
of a vastly expanded community potential. Except for bedroom communities 
near metropolitan centers, Marion's growth during the 1950s exceeded all 
but one Indiana city with populations of 10,000-100,000. One of Marion's 
more notable architectural landmarks is the extensive Marion High School 
campus, which includes an impressive 1,468 seat community auditorium. This 
is where the Marion Philharmonic Orchestra, the Community School for the 
Arts, and the Mississinewa Valley Community Band provide musical and dramatic 
entertainment for Marion's numerous arts patrons. The eight-time state 
basketball champions, Marion Giants, play in the 7,500 seat Bill Green 
Athletic Arena. The city operates a 2.75-mile (4.43 km) Riverwalk from 
downtown to Matter Park, and there is a newly renovated $9,000,000 YMCA 
Memorial Coliseum to honor war veterans. This was the previous home of 
the Giants, which was built after their first State Basketball Title in 
1926. A publicly owned mansion, the Hostess House, is used for social functions, 
and Marion General Hospital has been nationally accredited for approximately 
a half-century. Marion General was recently named a Magnet hospital. Fewer 
than 5% of all hospitals earn this honor. With more than 15,000 students, 
Indiana Wesleyan University is the fastest-growing university in Indiana 
and currently the largest private university in the state. The university's 
main campus in Marion is home to more than 3,200 undergraduates and nearly 
1,000 postgraduates. IWU has one of the largest adult education programs 
in the Midwest, and dozens of adult learning campuses are located throughout 
Indiana, Ohio, and Kentucky. Indiana Wesleyan University's 345-acre (1.40 km2) 
Marion campus has won numerous architectural awards, and the university 
has spent nearly $250 million in the past 20 years on campus facilities. 
The university's award-winning, 1,200 seat, Phillippe Performing Arts Center 
is used for numerous community events throughout the year, such as Marion 
Philharmonic Orchestra concerts and the Grant County Spelling Bee. Indiana 
Wesleyan's $22 million Chapel, which opened in January 2010, seats 3,800 
and is one of the largest auditoriums in the Midwest. As one of the largest 
facilities of its kind in the nation, it was designed to attract major 
events to Marion, such as famous musical artists, renowned speakers, and 
national conventions. A few months after opening, the IWU Chapel was the 
site of a concert by the internationally recognized band, Switchfoot. The 
university is currently the largest single employer in the city of Marion 
and contributes over $1 million annually towards the local economy. Marion's 
manufacturing sector produces automotive components, paper products, foundry 
products, machinery, wire, and cable. The paper plate industry was born 
in Marion; in its infancy, five of the nation's nine plants were located 
in the city. The area surrounding Marion is part of the Corn Belt; as such, 
agriculture remains a significant component of the region's economy. Corn, 
soybean, and hog production are supplemented by specialty crops such as 
tomatoes. Thomson SA's Marion facility was shuttered in 2004, leaving the 
city in an economic slump. On June 13, 2007, the Thomson building's northern 
portion was destroyed by a fire.[13] Other Marion plant closures in the 
past few decades include those of Ball-Foster, SCM (later Ampad) Paper 
Company, and the Malleable Iron Works (both on the far west side along 
Miller Avenue). The city has made inroads in attracting new businesses 
in the mid to late 2000s, however. Marion has been the only Midwest community 
selected as one of the Top 100 Micro-Enterprises for Economic Development 
by Site Selection Magazine for the years 2007 and 2008. TriEnda Plastics 
LLC selection of Marion in 2008 was one of the top 5 Manufacturing Projects 
in Indiana and received the coveted Silver Shovel award from Area Development 
Magazine. By spring 2011, TriEnda has ceased production. In the last ten 
years over $1,113,000 has been invested by private sector employers in 
Marion (source local newspaper).[14] Christmas City U.S.A. is a local non-profit 
organization promoting the Christmas season in Marion and Grant County. 
They proudly organize and sponsor the Annual Christmas Parade each year 
the Saturday before Thanksgiving to kick off the Holiday season. It all 
began in 1965 when the organization had a vision to expand the holiday 
season beyond the traditional cards and private parties. Directors wanted 
to foster human relations among residents of all ages and public relations 
toward nonresidents. In 1970, Christmas City and the Chamber of Commerce 
joined forces to promote a new look for the city. Postcards, bumper stickers, 
billboards were designed to establish the city as Christmas City U.S.A. 
The name was even trademarked to preserve the city's identity.[15] In 1991, 
Mayor Ron Mowery, Mark Erlewine, and a group of interested citizens decided 
to make Marion live up to its name. By combining the Mississinewa Riverwalk—the 
2.25 mile walkway which is used year around for jogging, walking and more—and 
holiday lights and lighted displays, the Christmas City Walkway of Lights 
was established in 1992. The first year, the walkway was home to nearly 
56,000 lights and lighted displays; the walkway has grown to include more 
than 2,000,000 lights and is nearly 4 miles long.[16] The Marion Municipal 
Airport is located three nautical miles (4 mi, 6 km) southwest of Marion's
