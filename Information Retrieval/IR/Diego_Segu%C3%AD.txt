Diego Pablo Seguí González [say-gee] (born August 17, 1937) is a Cuban 
former Major League Baseball pitcher. Listed at 6' 0" (1.83 m), 190 lb. 
(86 k), Seguí batted and threw right handed. He was born in Holguín, Cuba. 
His son, David Seguí, is a former major league first baseman. A forkball 
specialist,[1] Seguí pitched for the Kansas City Athletics, Washington 
Senators, Oakland Athletics, Seattle Pilots, St. Louis Cardinals, Boston 
Red Sox and Seattle Mariners in all or part of 16 seasons spanning 1962–1977. 
In 1970 with Oakland, Seguí won 10 games as a reliever and starter, while 
leading the American League pitchers with a 2.56 ERA. On June 7, 1972, 
he was sent by St. Louis along with Reggie Cleveland and Terry Hughes to 
the Red Sox, in the same trade that brought John Curtis, Lynn McGlothen 
and Mike Garman to the Cardinals. Seguí holds the unique distinction of 
having pitched for both of Seattle's major league baseball teams, the Pilots 
and the Mariners, in the first game ever played by each franchise. In these 
contests, he earned a save for the Pilots in 1969, and absorbed the opening-day 
loss for the Mariners in 1977. His most productive season came in 1969 
for the Pilots, when he posted career-highs in wins (12) and saves (6), 
against only six losses. At the end of the season, his teammates voted 
him the Pilots' Most Valuable Player. After he started the Mariners' inaugural 
game in 1977, he was dubbed "the Ancient Mariner." And, although he set 
a Mariner single-game record with 10 strikeouts early in the season on 
May 5, he failed to get a win the rest of the way. After compiling a 0–7 
record with a 5.69 ERA, he was released at the end of the season. Then, 
he continued pitching in the Mexican League for another 10 years, tossing 
a no-hitter for the Cafeteros de Córdoba in the 1978 season. During his 
Mexico stint, he amassed a 96–61 record with a 2.91 ERA and 1025 strikeouts 
in 193 pitching appearances.[2] In between, Seguí pitched for four different 
teams in the Venezuelan Winter League during 15 seasons between 1962 and 
1983. He posted a 95–58 record and a 2.76 ERA in 213 games, setting a league's 
all-time record with 941 strikeouts, to surpass Aurelio Monteagudo (897) 
and José Bracho (748). This record is still unbeaten. Besides, he also 
ranks second in wins behind Bracho (109), third in complete games (68), 
and is fourth both in ERA and innings pitched (1249⅔).[3] Seguí was inducted 
into the Venezuelan Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in 2003. He also gained 
induction into the Hispanic Heritage Museum Hall of Fame on August 19,
