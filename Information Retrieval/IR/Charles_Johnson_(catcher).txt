Charles Edward Johnson, Jr. (born July 20, 1971) is an American former 
professional baseball player.[1] He played as a catcher in Major League 
Baseball with the Florida Marlins (1994–1998, 2001–2002), the Los Angeles 
Dodgers (1998), the Baltimore Orioles (1999–2000), the Chicago White Sox 
(2000), the Colorado Rockies (2003–2004), and the Tampa Bay Devil Rays 
(2005). Johnson was considered as one of the best defensive catchers of 
his era, winning four consecutive Gold Glove Awards between 1995 and 1998.[1][2] 
He is one of only three catchers in Major League history to catch at least 
100 games in a single season without committing an error.[3] Johnson was 
born in Fort Pierce, Florida where he graduated from Fort Pierce Westwood 
High School in Fort Pierce, Florida. He was drafted by the Montreal Expos 
in the first round of the 1989 Major League Baseball Draft. He did not 
sign, and decided to enrolled at the University of Miami, where he played 
for the Miami Hurricanes baseball team. He was drafted by the Florida Marlins 
in the first round of the 1992 Major League Baseball Draft.[4] He played 
with the A-level Kane County Cougars in 1993 and the AA Portland Sea Dogs. 
In 1995, Johnson's reputation as a skilled defensive player was solidified 
when he became the fourth catcher in Major League history to win a Gold 
Glove Award in his rookie season, joining Johnny Bench, Carlton Fisk and 
Sandy Alomar, Jr.[5] Although his offensive statistics weren't impressive, 
he made up for those shortcomings by helping his team with his superior 
defensive skills.[6] In 1996, Johnson was the Marlins catcher when Al Leiter 
threw a no-hitter against the Colorado Rockies.[7] Johnson set a Major 
League record in 1997 by playing in 123 games without committing a single 
error, earning him his first All-Star selection, and helping the Marlins 
win the 1997 World Series against the Cleveland Indians.[8][9][10][11] 
Johnson led the Marlins in the Series with 10 hits, batting .357 including 
one home run.[12] Along with winning his third consecutive Gold Glove Award 
in 1997, he also caught his second no hitter when Kevin Brown no hit the 
Giants on June 10.[13] In 1998, the Marlins traded Johnson along with Bobby 
Bonilla, Jim Eisenreich, Gary Sheffield and Manuel Barriosto to the Los 
Angeles Dodgers in exchange for Mike Piazza and Todd Zeile.[14] After finishing 
the season with the Dodgers, he played for two years in the American League 
with the Baltimore Orioles and the Chicago White Sox.[14] He had his best 
year offensively in 2000, when he had a .304 batting average along with 
31 home runs and 91 RBIs, during a season in which he played 84 games for 
the Orioles and 44 games for the White Sox.[1] In 2001 he was traded back 
to the Marlins, where he hit .285 with 16 home runs by mid-season to earn 
his second All-Star berth.[15][16] He would also catch his third no hitter 
when AJ Burnett no hit the San Diego Padres on May 12.[17] The only Marlins 
no-hitter Johnson did not catch for Florida was in 2006, when Aníbal Sánchez 
threw a no-hitter in Dolphin Stadium against the Arizona Diamondbacks. 
After the 2002 season, the Marlins traded Johnson to the Colorado Rockies 
where he played for two seasons. On April 27, 2004, he, rookie Matt Holliday, 
and Jeromy Burnitz combined to slug back-to-back-to-back home runs against 
the Marlins, the sixth such occasion in franchise history.[18] After playing 
for Colorado, he ended his career with the Tampa Bay Devil Rays in 2005.[14] 
In a twelve-season major league career covering 1,188 games, Johnson had 
a .245 batting average along with 167 home runs, 570 runs batted in and 
a .993 fielding percentage.[1] His .993 fielding percentage ranks 16th 
all-time among major league catchers.[19] Along with his four Gold Glove 
Awards, Johnson twice led National League catchers in fielding percentage, 
and once each in baserunners caught stealing and assists.[1] During his 
playing career, he ranked second only to Iván Rodríguez in throwing out 
baserunners, with a 39% average.[20] He earned two All-Star berths as well 
as winning a World Series during his career. His three no hitters caught 
ties him with several other players for second place on the all-time list 
behind the four no hitters caught by Jason Varitek.[21] Johnson played 
more games as a catcher than any other player in Marlins history (582).[22] 
He now lives in Miami with his wife, Rhonda, and their two sons, Brandon 
and Beau. Johnson is a cousin of former Major Leaguer Fred McGriff.[23]
