Joseph Thomas Borowski (born May 4, 1971) is a sports broadcaster for the 
Arizona Diamondbacks, as well as a former professional baseball right-handed 
relief pitcher. He played in Major League Baseball for the Baltimore Orioles, 
Atlanta Braves, New York Yankees, Chicago Cubs, Tampa Bay Devil Rays, Florida 
Marlins, and Cleveland Indians. Borowski grew up in Bayonne, attended Marist 
High School and was an All-America selection in both football and baseball 
and a two-time All-State selection in both sports.[1] He attended Rutgers 
University in New Jersey. Borowski was a 32nd round draft pick of the Chicago 
White Sox in 1989. In 2000, Borowski pitched in the Mexican League and 
in the Northern League. Before his second year with the Chicago Cubs in 
2002, Borowski had never appeared in more than 25 games, but when given 
a chance to appear frequently he did very well. Between his stints with 
the Yankees and Cubs, he worked as a fireman. In 2002, he went 4-4 with 
a 2.73 ERA in 73 games of relief. The next year, he was converted to the 
closer role for the Cubs and was exceptional, going 2-2 with a 2.63 ERA 
and recording 33 saves in 37 opportunities, helping the Cubs win their 
division and reach the NLCS before being eliminated by the eventual World 
Series champion Florida Marlins. In 2004, Borowski suffered from a partial 
tear in his right rotator cuff which limited him to just 22 games, in which 
he struggled, going 2-4 with an 8.02 ERA and recording 9 saves in 11 opportunities. 
In 2005, Borowski broke his hand on a come-backer that went directly at 
him. He returned to the Cubs on May 20. He did not have his old closer 
job back, though, as Ryan Dempster had emerged as the club's new closer. 
On June 29, 2005, Borowski was released by the Cubs. Borowski was later 
in 2005 acquired by the Devil Rays, who use him as a set-up man to closer 
Danys BÃ¡ez. While with the Devil Rays, Borowski got very hot, pitching 
a franchise record 21 scoreless innings, and is seen by many as the catalyst 
for the Devil Rays 2nd half turnaround, as his inspired performance helped 
stabilize the Rays' otherwise shaky bullpen. However, in his last 14 appearances 
he gave up 15 runs, and was designated for assignment by the Devil Rays 
in early December, and then released. During the 2006 season, Borowski 
pitched for the Florida Marlins and converted 36 out of 43 save opportunities. 
On December 6, 2006, Borowski signed a $4.25 million, one-year contract 
to pitch for the Cleveland Indians that included a club option for 2008. 
The signing of Borowski filled the vacant closer role for Cleveland. During 
the 2007 season, Borowski got off to a slow start as closer for the Indians, 
posting an earned run average of 13.50 in his first seven outings. His 
struggles were capped off after surrendering six runs to the New York Yankees 
on April 19, 2007, in the ninth inning after coming into the game with 
a 4-run lead. Borowski was not charged with a blown save in this outing, 
since a 3-run lead or smaller is required for a pitcher to earn the save. 
He led the American League with 45 saves and had a pitiful 5.07 ERA,[2] 
as his 2007 season was the worst season ever for a closer with 40 or more 
saves. On November 6, 2007, the Indians exercised his $4 million club option, 
opting to bring him back in 2008.[3] Had the team declined Borowski's option, 
he would have been paid a $250,000 buyout. In 2008, Borowski got off to 
a bad start to the season. Putting up an 18.00 ERA with two blown saves 
through 5 appearances, he averaged a walk, 2 hits, and 2 runs per appearance.[4] 
Following another dreadful appearance in which he gave up 3 runs in 2/3 
inning on April 14 the Indians put him on the 15-day DL with a strained 
triceps. Borowski was designated for assignment by the Indians on July 
4, and released on July 10, 2008.[5] On February 24, 2009 Borowski retired.[6] 
Borowski currently resides in Scottsdale, Arizona, with his wife Tatum 
and two sons Blaze and Ty. [1] He accepted an award in 2004 from the Polish
