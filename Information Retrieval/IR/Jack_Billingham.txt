John Eugene (Jack) Billingham (born February 21, 1943) is a former starting 
pitcher in Major League Baseball who played for the Los Angeles Dodgers 
(1968), Houston Astros (1969–1971), Cincinnati Reds (1972–1977), Detroit 
Tigers (1978–1980) and Boston Red Sox (1980).[1] The 6-foot-4 hurler won 
at least 10 games for 10 consecutive seasons, and he helped lead Cincinnati's 
legendary "Big Red Machine" to back-to-back World Series titles in 1975 
and 1976. He batted and threw right-handed. Billingham is the cousin of 
Christy Mathewson. Billingham proved to be one of baseball's greatest World 
Series pitchers.[citation needed] In seven games (including three starts) 
for Cincinnati, he went 2–0 with a 0.36 earned run average (ERA), allowing 
just one earned run in 25 1⁄3 innings pitched. Billingham came to the Reds 
in one of baseball's biggest trades. The Reds sent Lee May, Tommy Helms 
and Jimmy Stewart to the Astros for Billingham, Joe Morgan, Denis Menke, 
César Gerónimo, and (then minor leaguer) Ed Armbrister prior to the 1972 
season. Originally signed as a free agent by the Dodgers in 1961, Billingham 
was groomed as a relief pitcher in the Los Angeles farm system, reaching 
the major leagues in 1968. Despite a good season (50 games, 3–0 record, 
eight saves, 2.14 ERA), the Dodgers left Billingham unprotected in the 
expansion draft and he was selected by the Montreal Expos, though he would 
never pitch for them. In January 1969, the Expos traded Donn Clendenon 
to the Houston Astros for Rusty Staub. Clendenon refused to report, and 
Billingham was later sent to Houston to complete the trade. In 1969, Billingham 
was again used as a reliever (52 games, 6–7 record, 4.25 ERA). In 1970 
he was moved into the starting rotation (46 games, 24 starts), before becoming 
exclusively a starting pitcher in 1971. 1973 was Billingham's best season, 
going 19-10 with a career-best 3.04 ERA. He led the National League with 
40 starts and seven shutouts and earned a berth on the National League 
All-Star team. He followed that with a 19-11 season in 1974. On April 4, 
1974, Billingham gave up Hank Aaron's 714th career home run, which tied 
Aaron with Babe Ruth for No. 1 on the all-time home run list at the time.[2] 
For his career, Billingham went 145–113 with a 3.83 ERA and 1,141 strikeouts
