Kevin S. Towers (born November 11, 1961 in Medford, Oregon) is an American 
executive in Major League Baseball. He served as the General Manager of 
the San Diego Padres from 1995 to 2009 and for the Arizona Diamondbacks 
from 2010 to 2014. Towers attended Brigham Young University (BYU), where 
he played college baseball for the BYU Cougars baseball team in the Western 
Athletic Conference (WAC). As a pitcher, Towers was selected to the All-WAC 
team. He was drafted by the Padres in the first round of the secondary 
phase of the 1982 Major League Baseball Draft, and was named a Texas League 
all-star in 1984.[citation needed] Towers pitched seven seasons in San 
Diego’s farm system before a series of arm operations ended his career 
at the AAA level.[citation needed] Overall, he went 29-40 with a 4.64 ERA 
in 619 innings, including 82 starts.[1] Continuing his career in baseball, 
Towers became a pitching coach for minor league Single-A Spokane Indians 
in 1989 and 1990. He served as a Padres scout from 1989 through 1991. After 
scouting for the Pittsburgh Pirates from 1991–93, Towers rejoined the Padres 
as scouting director from 1993 to 1995. Towers became the Padres' seventh 
general manager in 1995, succeeding Randy Smith. As GM, Towers led the 
Padres to four division championships and an appearance in the 1998 World 
Series. The Padres also finished last in their division five times. Towers 
was known for his ability to find talented pitchers that many other teams 
had released.[2] On October 3rd, 2009, the Padres fired Towers after two 
disappointing seasons.[3] Towers joined the New York Yankees as a special 
assignment scout for the 2010 season.[4] On September 22, 2010 he was hired 
to be the general manager of the Arizona Diamondbacks.[5] In his first 
season at the helm of the Diamondbacks' baseball operations, the team won 
94 games and the National League West Division title just one season after 
finishing in last place with 97 losses. As a result of the 29-game turnaround, 
Towers finished third in The Sporting News Major League Baseball Executive 
of the Year voting.[citation needed] Towers entered 2012 with 15 years 
of experience as a Major League general manager to join the Oakland Athletics’ 
Billy Beane and the San Francisco Giants’ Brian Sabean as the fourth longest-tenured 
active GM in Major League Baseball. Only the New York Yankees’ Brian Cashman 
(16 years), Detroit Tigers’ Dave Dombrowski (23 years), Cincinnati Reds’ 
Walt Jocketty (17 years) and Milwaukee Brewers’ Doug Melvin (16 years) 
had more experience among MLB’s general managers. With 1,207 wins as a 
General Manager entering 2012, Towers was one of the eight GMs to post 
at least 1,200 victories during their career.[citation needed] Following 
the 2013 season, Towers fired his pitching coach, Charles Nagy, for allegedly 
refusing to instruct pitchers to hit players on opposing teams, saying 
that while in the old days this was known, now you have to teach it.[6] 
It was duly noted by journalists that the Diamondbacks pitchers actually 
hit 60 batters last season, while their batters were only hit 43 times.[7] 
On May 17, 2014, the Diamondbacks hired Tony LaRussa to oversee Towers 
and all baseball operations. The Diamondbacks dismissed Towers from the 
general manager position on September 5, while offering him another position 
in the organization, which he declined.[8][9] In 2015, he joined the Cincinnati 
Reds as a scout and special assistant to the general manager, Walt Jocketty.[10]
