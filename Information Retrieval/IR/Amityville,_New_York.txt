Amityville is a village in the town of Babylon in Suffolk County, New York, 
in the United States. The population was 9,523 at the 2010 census. Huntington 
settlers first visited the Amityville area in 1653 as a source of salt 
hay. Chief Wyandanch granted the first deed to land in Amityville in 1658.[1] 
The area was originally called Huntington West Neck South (it is on the 
Great South Bay and Suffolk County, New York border in the southwest corner 
of what once called Huntington South but is now the Town of Babylon. According 
to village lore, the name was changed in 1846 when residents were working 
to establish its new post office. The meeting turned into bedlam and one 
participant was to exclaim, "What this meeting needs is some amity". Another 
version says the name was first suggested by mill owner Samuel Ireland 
to name the town for his boat, the Amity.[2] The place name is strictly 
speaking an incidental name, marking an amicable agreement on the choice 
of a place name.[3] The village was formally incorporated on March 3, 1894. 
In the early 1900s Amityville was a popular tourist destination with large 
hotels on the bay and large homes. Annie Oakley was said to be a frequent 
guest of vaudevillian Fred Stone. Will Rogers had a home across Clocks 
Boulevard from Stone. Gangster Al Capone also had a house in the community. 
Amityville has been twinning with Le Bourget, France since 1979.[1] Amityville 
is the setting of the book The Amityville Horror by Jay Anson, which was 
published in 1977 and had been adapted into a series of films made between 
1979 and 2015. The story of The Amityville Horror can be traced back to 
a real life murder case in Amityville in November 1974, when Ronald DeFeo, 
Jr. shot all six members of his family at 112 Ocean Avenue. In December 
1975 George and Kathy Lutz and Kathy's three children moved into the house, 
but left after twenty-eight days, claiming to have been terrorized by paranormal 
phenomena produced by the house. Jay Anson's novel is said to be based 
on these events but has been the subject of much controversy. The house 
featured in the novel and its film versions still exists, but has been 
renovated and the address changed in order to discourage tourists from 
visiting it. The Dutch Colonial Revival architecture house built in 1927 
was put on the market in May 2010 for $1.15 million and sold in September 
for $950,000.[4] According to the United States Census Bureau, the village
