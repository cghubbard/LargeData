"Workaholic" is a song recorded by Dutch Eurodance band 2 Unlimited.[1] 
Workaholic was released in April 1992 as the third single from 2 Unlimited's 
debut album Get Ready!. The album version was an instrumental track but 
the released version featured a chorus from Anita Doth and, outside the 
UK, verses from Ray Slijngaard. The release scored chart success in many 
European countries, with its highest peaks coming in the Republic of Ireland 
and the UK. It was also a Top 30 U.S. Dance hit on the U.S. Hot Dance Club 
Play chart. The opening segment of the song features bells ringing in descending 
followed by ascending order (replicating the Westminster chime effect). 
It is the same segment that is played at Yankee Stadium in New York City 
whenever baseball's New York Yankees score a run and at multiple NHL arenas, 
such as the Staples Center's Los Angeles Kings, when a penalty is called 
against the visiting team. It is also used when the Los Angeles Lakers 
score a 3 Point Basket. Controversially, on the Hardcore Remix of the song, 
there was a quote: "Who the fuck are you?" at the beginning of the track. 
The opening phrase in the song, "Ok, let's go to work" comes from the 1987
