Clarence Edward "Butch" Metzger (born May 23, 1952) is a former Major League 
Baseball player. Metzger was a relief pitcher, specifically a closer. Metzger 
played for four different teams during his five years in the majors; the 
San Francisco Giants in 1974, the San Diego Padres from 1975 to 1977, the 
St. Louis Cardinals in 1977, and the New York Mets in 1978. After playing 
high school baseball at John F. Kennedy high school in Sacramento, California, 
Metzger was drafted in the 2nd round of the 1970 amateur draft by the San 
Francisco Giants. Metzger made his major league debut on September 8, 1974 
with the San Francisco Giants. Metzger played limitedly, pitching 12.7 
innings and posting a 3.55 ERA In 1975, Metzger was with a different team, 
the San Diego Padres, after being traded from the Giants with Tito Fuentes 
in exchange for utilityman Derrel Thomas. Metzger pitched limitedly again, 
due to control issues (he had walked 16 men in his 17.3 innings of career 
pitching). In 1976, Metzger was able to successfully control his pitches, 
and had a great year for a rookie. He posted a 2.92 ERA, along with an 
11-4 record, 89 strikeouts, 52 walks and 16 saves in 123.3 innings of work. 
He was co-voted National League Rookie of the Year for 1976 with Pat Zachry. 
Metzger did not start the 1977 season well, walking 12 in 22.7 innings 
while only getting 6 strikeouts. On May 17, 1977, he was traded to the 
St. Louis Cardinals for pitcher John D'Acquisto and infielder Pat Scanlon. 
Metzger posted better numbers with the Cardinals, collecting 7 saves while 
posting a 3.11 ERA and a record of 4 wins and 2 losses. However, Metzger 
was placed on waivers by the Cardinals and picked up by the New York Mets 
on April 5, 1978. Metzger had a disappointing season, giving concern to 
the Mets about his control issues. His contract was subsequently purchased 
by the Philadelphia Phillies on July 4, 1978 and he was sent back to the 
minors. Metzger never made it back to the major league level and was released 
by the Phillies on March 19, 1979. He works today as a scout. In his five 
seasons of baseball, Metzger had an 18-9 record with a 3.74 ERA, 23 saves, 
pitched 293.1 innings, gave up 289 hits, walked 140 and struck out 175
