Charles Henry "Chick" Shorten (April 19, 1892 – October 23, 1965) was an 
American baseball player. He played professional baseball as an outfielder 
for 18 years from 1911 to 1928, including eight seasons in Major League 
Baseball with the Boston Red Sox (1915–1917), Detroit Tigers (1919–1921), 
St. Louis Browns (1922), and Cincinnati Reds (1924). He was a member of 
the 1916 Red Sox team that won the World Series, and Shorten compiled a 
.571 batting average in the 1916 World Series. In eight major league seasons, 
Shorten appeared in 527 games, including 352 as an outfielder, and compiled 
a .275 career batting average. Shorten was born in Scranton, Pennsylvania, 
in 1892.[1] The son of Irish immigrants, his father and two uncles ran 
a grocery business in Scranton.[2] Shorten played two seasons of semi-pro 
baseball with the Minooka Blues.[2] Shorten began playing professional 
baseball in August 1911 with his hometown Scranton baseball team in the 
New York State League.[3][4] He next played for the Worcester Busters in 
the New England League from 1912 to 1914, compiling batting averages of 
.335 in 1913 and .345 in 1914. He spent most of the 1915 season with the 
Providence Grays of the International League. He compiled a .322 batting 
average in a career-high 615 at bats with Providence.[3] On September 22, 
1915, Shorten made his major league debut with the Boston Red Sox. He appeared 
in six games with the 1915 Red Sox, compiling a .214 batting average in 
14 at bats.[1] In 1916, Shorten appeared in 53 games for the Red Sox, 13 
as a starter in center field, eight as a starter in right field, and one 
start in left field. He compiled a .295 batting average and .352 on-base 
percentage in 124 plate appearances.[1] The 1916 Red Sox won the American 
League pennant with a 91-63 record and defeated the Brooklyn Robins in 
the 1916 World Series.[5] Shorten appeared two games in the 1916 World 
Series for the Red Sox, and collected four hits and two RBIs in seven at-bats 
for a .571 batting average. He was also caught stealing twice in the series.[1] 
Fifty years later, Shorten's Associated Press obituary described him as 
the "batting hero of the 1916 World Series."[6] In 1917, Shorten appeared 
in 69 games for the Red Sox, 22 as the team's starting center fielder, 
nine in left field, and four in right field. His batting average dropped 
precipitously by 116 points from .295 to .179.[1] After the 1917 season, 
Shorten was inducted into the United States Navy. He served at the Boston 
Navy Yard and underwent training at Wakefield, Massachusetts.[7] On January 
17, 1919, Shorten was traded by the Red Sox with Eddie Ainsmith and Slim 
Love to the Detroit Tigers in exchange for Ossie Vitt.[8] Shorten was one 
of four Detroit outfielders to bat above .300 in 1919 – Shorten at .315 
in 95 games, Ty Cobb at .384 in 124 games, Bobby Veach at .355 in 139 games, 
and Ira Flagstead at .331 in 97 games.[9] Shorten remained with the Tigers 
for two more years, compiling batting averages of .288 in 1920 and .272 
in 1921.[1] In 1923, Shorten played for the St. Louis Browns. He appeared 
in 55 games, 13 as the starting center fielder and nine starts in right 
field and five in left field.[1] In 1923, Shorten was assigned to play 
in Nashville, refused to report, was suspended, and announced his retirement 
from the game. He was reinstated after one year and signed with the Cincinnati 
Reds.[10] He appeared in 41 games for the 1924 Reds, mostly as a pinch 
hitter, and compiled a .275 batting average.[1] In eight major league seasons, 
Shorten appeared in 527 games, including 352 as an outfielder and the rest 
as a pinch hitter. He compiled a career batting average of .275 with 370 
hits, 51 doubles, 20 triples, three home runs, and 134 RBIs.[1] In 352 
games in the outfield, Shorten had a .985 fielding percentage, 23 points 
higher than the average outfielder of that time.[1] Although Shorten's 
major league career ended in 1924, he continued to play in the minor leagues 
for another four years - as the player-manager of the Reading Keystones 
in the International League in 1925, for the Newark Bears in 1926, and 
for the Scranton Miners in 1926 and 1927. He compiled a .354 batting average 
in 119 games in 1927 at age 35.[3] After retiring from baseball, Shorten 
worked in his family's grocery store in Scranton. He also worked as a scout 
for the Cleveland Indians in the 1950s.[2] Shorten died in 1965 at age
