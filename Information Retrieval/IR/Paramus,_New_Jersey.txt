Paramus (/pəˈræməs/ pə-RAM-əs, with the accent on the second syllable[20]) 
is a borough in Bergen County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 
2010 United States Census, the borough's population was 26,342,[9][10][11] 
reflecting an increase of 605 (+2.4%) from the 25,737 counted in the 2000 
Census, which had in turn increased by 670 (+2.7%) from the 25,067 counted 
in the 1990 Census.[21] A suburb of New York City, Paramus is located 15 
to 20 miles (24 to 32 km) northwest of Midtown Manhattan and approximately 
8 miles (13 km) west of Upper Manhattan. In 2013, it was named as a "New 
Jersey Healthy Town" under the state's Mayor's Wellness Campaign.[22] Paramus 
was incorporated as a borough by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on 
March 2, 1922, and ratified by a referendum held on April 4, 1922, that 
passed by a vote of 238 to 10.[23][24] Paramus was created from portions 
of Midland Township, which now exists as Rochelle Park.[23][25] The name 
is usually said to be of Native American origin, derived from words meaning 
"land of the turkey"[20] or meaning "pleasant stream."[26] The borough 
is one of the largest shopping destinations in the country, generating 
over $5 billion in annual retail sales,[27][28] more than any other ZIP 
code in the United States.[29][30] Paramus has some of the most restrictive 
blue laws in the nation, banning nearly all white-collar and retail businesses 
from opening on Sundays except for gas stations, restaurants and grocery 
stores, and a limited number of other businesses.[31] More than 63% of 
Bergen County voters rejected a referendum on the ballot in 1993 that would 
have repealed the county's blue laws, though the Paramus restrictions would 
have remained in place.[32] New Jersey Monthly magazine ranked Paramus 
as its 21st best place to live in its 2013 rankings of the "Best Places 
To Live" in New Jersey.[33] According to a recent NerdWallet survey, the 
sixth-best place to start a business in New Jersey is Paramus[34] as well 
as being the ninth-best place for home ownership in the state.[35] Fundera's 
2016 study ranked Paramus the fouth-best city in New Jersey for entrepreneurs.[36] 
Paramus ranked in the top 20 places with populations over 25,000 in the 
U.S. by median household income as reported by CNNMoney.[37] According 
to the United States Census Bureau, the borough had a total area of 10.520 
square miles (27.246 km2), including 10.470 square miles (27.117 km2) of 
land and 0.050 square miles (0.129 km2) of water (0.47%).[1][2] The borough 
borders the Bergen County municipalities of Emerson, Fair Lawn, Glen Rock, 
Hackensack, Maywood, Oradell, Ridgewood, River Edge, Rochelle Park, Saddle 
Brook and Washington Township.[38] Unincorporated communities, localities 
and place names located partially or completely within the borough include 
Arcola, Bergen Place and Spring Valley.[39] The area that became northern 
New Jersey was occupied for thousands of years by prehistoric indigenous 
peoples. At the time of European encounter, it was settled by the historic 
Lenape people. The Lenape language word for the area, Peremessing, which 
meant that it had an abundant population of wild turkey, was anglicized 
to become the word "Paramus".[40][41] A large metal statue of a wild turkey 
in the Paramus Park mall commemorates this history.[41] Another variation 
is that the word means "pleasant stream".[42] Albert Saboroweski (Albrycht 
Zaborowski), whose descendants became known by the family name "Zabriskie",[43] 
immigrated from Poland via the Dutch ship The Fox[44] in 1662. He settled 
in the Dutch West Indies Company town of Ackensack, today's Hackensack. 
A son, Jacob, was captured by the Lenape and held for 15 years. When he 
was returned to his family, the Lenape explained to Saboroweski that they 
had taken the child in order to teach him their language so that he could 
serve as a translator. They granted Saboroweski approximately 2,000 acres 
(8.1 km2) of land which became known as the "Paramus Patent".[45] During 
the American Revolutionary War, the county included both Tories and Patriots, 
with Patriots "greatly outnumbering" Tories.[46] Although no major battles 
were fought in Bergen County, Paramus was part of the military activity, 
as colonial troops were stationed in Ramapo under the command of Aaron 
Burr.[47] In 1777, the British raided the Hackensack area and Burr marched 
troops to Paramus, where he attacked the British, forcing them to withdraw.[48] 
General George Washington was in Paramus several times during the War: 
December 1778; July 1780; and, December 1780.[49] Following the Battle 
of Monmouth, Washington established his headquarters in Paramus in July 
1778.[50] Over the advice of his staff, Washington moved his headquarters 
to Westchester County, New York.[51] A section of Paramus known as Dunkerhook 
(meaning dark corner in Dutch) was a free African-American community dating 
to the early 18th century. Although historical markers on the current site 
and local oral tradition maintain that this was a slave community, contemporary 
records document that it was a community of free blacks, not slaves.[52] 
A group of houses built on Dunkerhook Road by the Zabriskies in the late 
18th to early 19th centuries was the center of a community of black farmers, 
who had been slaves held by the Zabriskie family.[53] Farview Avenue, located 
at the highest peak in Paramus, has a clear view of the New York City skyline.[54] 
Paramus became one of the "truck farming" areas that helped New Jersey 
earn its nickname as the "Garden State".[55] By 1940, Paramus' population 
was just 4,000, with no town center and 94 retail establishments.[56] Although 
the opening of the George Washington Bridge in 1931 and the widening of 
New Jersey Route 17 and New Jersey Route 4 (which intersect in southern 
Paramus), made the area accessible to millions, "it was not until the 1950's 
that massive development hit this section of northern New Jersey".[57] 
During the 1950s and 1960s, Paramus, lacking any master plan until 1969, 
was redeveloped into two shopping corridors when its farmers and outside 
developers saw that shopping malls were more lucrative than produce farming.[57] 
"It was a developer's dream: flat cleared land adjacent to major arterials 
and accessible to a growing suburban population and the country's largest 
city – with no planning restrictions".[57] New York had a state sales tax, 
but New Jersey had none, so with the opening of Manhattan department stores 
in the Bergen Mall (1957), the Garden State Plaza (1957) and Alexander's 
(1961), Paramus became the "first stop outside New York City for shopping".[57] 
From 1948–58, the population of Paramus increased from 6,000 to 23,000, 
the number of retail establishments tripled from 111 to 319, and annual 
retail sales increased from $5.5 million to $112 million.[57] By the 1980s, 
when the population had increased slightly over 1960s levels, retail sales 
had climbed to $1 billion.[57] At the 2010 United States Census, there 
were 26,342 people, 8,630 households, and 6,939 families residing in the 
borough. The population density was 2,516.0 per square mile (971.4/km2). 
There were 8,915 housing units at an average density of 851.5 per square 
mile (328.8/km2). The racial makeup of the borough was 72.29% (19,042) 
White, 1.42% (374) Black or African American, 0.11% (28) Native American, 
22.28% (5,869) Asian, 0.05% (13) Pacific Islander, 1.39% (366) from other 
races, and 2.47% (650) from two or more races. Hispanics or Latinos of 
any race were 7.26% (1,913) of the population.[9] 6.9% of residents self-identified 
as being Korean-American, which makes it the largest ethnic minority group 
in the borough.[9] There were 8,630 households, of which 33.8% had children 
under the age of 18 living with them, 68.4% were married couples living 
together, 9.1% had a female householder with no husband present, and 19.6% 
were non-families. 17.8% of all households were made up of individuals, 
and 13.3% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The 
average household size was 2.92 and the average family size was 3.32.[9] 
In the borough, 21.5% of the population were under the age of 18, 7.1% 
from 18 to 24, 19.2% from 25 to 44, 30.2% from 45 to 64, and 21.9% who 
were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 46.3 years. For every 
100 females there were 94.9 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, 
there were 91.7 males.[9] The Census Bureau's 2006–2010 American Community 
Survey showed that (in 2010 inflation-adjusted dollars) median household 
income was $104,986 (with a margin of error of +/- $9,111) and the median 
family income was $123,848 (+/- $7,952). Males had a median income of $77,325 
(+/- $5,222) versus $52,702 (+/- $4,983) for females. The per capita income 
for the borough was $40,024. About 1.6% of families and 2.8% of the population 
were below the poverty line, including 3.0% of those under age 18 and 4.1% 
of those age 65 or over.[65] Same-sex couples headed 35 households in 2010, 
more than double the 17 counted in the 2000 census.[66] As of the 2000 
United States Census[17] there were 25,737 people, 8,082 households, and 
6,780 families residing in the borough. The population density was 2,457.7 
people per square mile (949.1/km2). There were 8,209 housing units at an 
average density of 783.9 per square mile (302.7/km2). The racial makeup 
of the borough was 79.19% White, 1.13% African American, 0.05% Native American, 
17.23% Asian, 0.01% Pacific Islander, 0.89% from other races, and 1.51% 
from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 4.87% of the 
population.[63][64] There were 8,082 households out of which 37.0% had 
children under the age of 18 living with them, 73.3% were married couples 
living together, 8.0% had a female householder with no husband present, 
and 16.1% were non-families. 14.4% of all households were made up of individuals 
and 9.4% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The

had a median income of $56,635 versus $37,450 for females. The per capita 
income for the borough was $29,295. About 1.4% of families and 3.3% of 
the population were below the poverty line, including 3.4% of those under 
age 18 and 5.0% of those age 65 or over.[63][64] Paramus is home to the 
America regional headquarters of Hanjin Shipping, located on the eastbound 
side of Route 4.[67] Hudson City Bancorp has headquarters located at West 
80 Century Road.[68] Movado Group Inc. is a watchmaker with its headquarters 
on From Road.[69] Suez North America, originally founded as Hackensack 
Water Company in 1869 and later named United Water, is an American water 
service company headquartered in Paramus.[70] Coach USA is a large tour 
operator with its headquarters in Paramus.[71] Paramus was the former headquarters 
location for Toys "R" Us before moving to Wayne, New Jersey in 2002.[72] 
Paramus was also the headquarters of Magic Solutions, a defunct computer 
software company that specialized in help desk automation and asset management 
software.[73] Paramus is known for its multitude of stores and malls. It 
has five major indoor shopping centers, serving residents in the areas 
of Bergen County and Passaic County in New Jersey and Rockland County in 
New York. New Jersey does not levy a sales tax on clothes and shoes, which 
makes it an attractive shopping destination for people even further away 
in New York City, who pay sales tax on clothing items above $110 in price, 
in addition to the lower standard rate of 7% in New Jersey, compared to 
8.875% in New York City.[74][75] The spending levels generated by the malls 
have made Paramus one of the top retail ZIP codes in the country.[76] At 
the intersection of Routes 4 and 17 is Westfield Garden State Plaza, the 
largest and best-known mall in the borough. Westfield Garden State Plaza 
is the largest mall in the Westfield Group's global portfolio and the largest 
in New Jersey, with a gross leasable area of 2,128,402 square feet (200,000 m2).[77] 
On Route 4, are The Outlets at Bergen Town Center (known as the Bergen 
Mall until 2006), Paramus Place and The Shoppes on IV. On Route 17, are 
Paramus Park, Paramus Towne Square, Paramus Design Center, and the Fashion 
Center. Many national chain stores boast Paramus as their most prominent 
locations. Nordstrom's Paramus location, which was its first New York area 
store when it opened in September 1990 with strong sales volume,[78] is 
their best-performing.[citation needed] There are 25 retailers that occupy 
multiple stores in Paramus, including Macy's which had outlets in three 
malls for a period of time. Some retail analysts view Paramus as being 
two markets, centered on the two major highways. Lord & Taylor has locations 
at both Westfield Garden State Plaza and Fashion Center, giving Paramus 
the distinction of the only town with more than one Lord & Taylor location. 
Toys "R" Us has three locations: Fashion Center, a location on the eastbound 
side of Route 4, and a Babies "R" Us on the northbound side of Route 17. 
In 1983, Paramus was one of the first locations opening a Kids "R" Us store.[79] 
H&M has three locations in Paramus: Paramus Park, Westfield Garden State 
Plaza, and The Outlets at Bergen Town Center. Paramus, along with the rest 
of Bergen County, has strict blue laws preventing stores selling non-food 
items from opening on Sundays. Although it started as a religious observance, 
it is kept on the books due to a desire of the residents of Paramus to 
have one day a week when traffic is tolerable in the town. This law was 
called into question when a BJ's Wholesale Club opened at the Routes 4/17 
junction. BJ's was allowed to open on Sundays, but is only allowed to sell 
food and basic necessities. The store has been structured to restrict access 
to items that cannot be purchased on Sunday. Paramus has its own blue laws 
that are significantly more restrictive than those in effect in other communities 
in Bergen County. It is one of the last places in the United States to 
have such an extensive blue law. Local blue laws in Paramus were first 
proposed in 1957, while the Bergen Mall and Garden State Plaza were under 
construction. The legislation was motivated by fears that the two new malls 
would aggravate the already-severe highway congestion caused by local retail 
businesses along the borough's highways.[31] The Paramus Borough Code forbids 
the performance of any "worldly employment" on Sunday, with exceptions 
for charity, and the sale of newspapers, medicinal drugs, meals, prepared 
food and cigarettes, among a limited number of exceptions. Even work performed 
inside one's own home is prohibited, unless one can "prove to the satisfaction 
of the Judge that he uniformly keeps the seventh day of the week commonly 
known as the 'Sabbath'".[80] In spite of its six-day shopping week, Paramus 
consistently has the most retail sales of any ZIP Code in the United States.[81] 
An unsuccessful 2010 proposal by Governor of New Jersey Chris Christie 
would have ended the state's blue laws (now only enforced in Bergen County), 
with the governor citing industry estimates that the $1.1 billion in added 
retail revenue on Sundays would generate an additional $65 million in sales 
taxes for the state.[82] In November 2012, Governor Chris Christie issued 
an executive order temporarily suspending the blue laws in both Bergen 
County and Paramus due to the effects of Hurricane Sandy, a decision that 
was upheld despite a court challenge by the Borough of Paramus.[83] The 
blue law suspension was in effect on Sunday, November 11, but was back 
in effect the following Sunday.[84] Due to the stricter version of the 
blue laws in Paramus, malls (and almost all retail establishments) in the 
borough are closed on Sunday except for restaurants and other exempted 
establishments. Stores may not open before 7:00 AM or remain open after 
11:00 PM.[94] One of the earliest drive-in theaters opened in Paramus, 
featuring what was said to be the world's largest and brightest screen, 
located behind what is now Westfield Garden State Plaza. The Paramus Drive-In 
closed in 1987 after the last movie presentation, a double-feature of "Crocodile" 
Dundee and The Untouchables.[95] Currently, Paramus' lone movie theater 
complex is a 16-screen AMC Theatres located in an area of new construction 
at Westfield Garden State Plaza. Prior to the opening of the AMC complex, 
a number of theatres were closed in the borough, including the Route 4 
Tenplex and the Cineplex Odeon Route 17 Triplex, once located next to Westfield 
Garden State Plaza on Route 17. The Triplex theatre was opened in 1965 
by Century Theatres and was closed on January 19, 2006, by Loews Cineplex 
Entertainment. The Tenplex on Route 4 was closed on May 24, 2007, the day 
before the new AMC Theatres opened at Westfield Garden State Plaza.[96] 
The Paramus Picture Show, known as Cinema 35 until 1997,[97] closed in 
December 2004 in the wake of declining attendance.[98] The borough will 
regain a second theater in 2017, when a 13-screen Regal Cinemas will be 
opening at Paramus Park.[99][100][101] The Bergen Town Center formerly 
had a performing arts theater called "Playhouse on the Mall". It had a 
seating capacity of 635 seats and was opened in 1960. From 1960 to 1970, 
author Robert Ludlum was the manager of the theater. The theater closed 
in 1982 due to rising costs and low attendance and was converted into retail 
space in 1986.[102] In 2016, the Garden State Plaza added a Bergen Performing 
Arts Center performance area for shows and performances located near Macy's, 
which took up the former space of the Venetian carousel. There is also 
a Bergen PAC ticket center located near the performance area.[103] Paramus 
Little League were the 2011 New Jersey State Little League Champions.[104] 
The borough has four golf courses. Two are open to the public, with the 
Paramus Golf Course operated by the borough[105] and Orchard Hills County 
Golf Course operated by the county.[106] The two private golf course located 
in Paramus are the Ridgewood Country Club and Arcola Country Club. Ridgewood 
Country Club was ranked as the #6 Center Ranked Among Top 500 Holes in 
the World Golf Magazine – 2000 and Ranked # 84 on the list of Most Prestigious 
Clubs in America Golf Connoisseur – 2006. Paramus is the home to two county 
parks. On the eastern side of the borough is Van Saun County Park, a 146 
acres (59 ha) park that features Bergen County's only zoo, home to a wide 
variety of wild and domestic animals living in recreated habitats natural 
to each species.[107] Van Saun Park also has a playground, train ride, 
carousel, athletic fields, and pony rides. On the western side of the borough 
is Saddle River County Park which features a 6-mile (9.7 km) bike path 
reaching from Ridgewood to Rochelle Park.[108] The Washington Spring site 
in the park takes its name from reports that General Washington drank water 
from the spring here while his troops were encamped nearby, west of the 
Hackensack River.[109] The Continental Army is reported to have utilized 
the old spring at the base of these slopes during the September encampment 
west of the Hackensack River. Other parks in Paramus include:[110] In 2008, 
the Paramus Golf Course opened a miniature golf course that is themed after 
the borough of Paramus as well as the state of New Jersey. Turkey statues 
are scattered around the course to celebrate Paramus as the "land of the 
wild turkeys."[111] Paramus has an outdoor municipal swimming pool complex 
on Van Binsberger Boulevard. It has three pools: a main pool, a pool for 
younger swimmers, and a baby pool.[112] There is an annual Terri Roemer 
Paramus Run featuring a 5K, 10K running race, one–mile "Fun Run", & 5 km 
Health Walk for runners and walkers of all ages.[113] Arcola Park was an 
outdoor amusement park built in 1926. It had a huge swimming pool, a convention 
hall, a dance pavilion, an auditorium, and rides. A fire in 1929 destroyed 
the entire park, with the exception of the pool. The pool was destroyed 
by a fire in 1970 and closed down for good.[114] The park site was replaced 
by a Ramada Inn, the hotel extending into a small portion of Rochelle Park.[115] 
During the week of the 4th of July, Paramus holds its own Independence 
Day celebration. First, there is the performance of the Paramus Community 
Orchestra at the Paramus Bandshell which takes place on July 2. Next, on 
the 3rd, there is a softball game between the Paramus Fire Department and 
the Paramus Police Department, held annually since 2011. On the 4th, there 
is a parade. The parade route starts at the intersection of Century Road 
and Farview Avenue and ends at Memorial Elementary School. On the 5th, 
there is a fireworks display at the Cliff Gennarelli Paramus Sportsplex.[116] 
Paramus also holds its own Memorial Day parade every year.[117] Paramus 
hosts an annual National Night Out. The event typically includes games 
and activities as well as a concert. The borough's fire, rescue, police, 
and ambulance vehicles are also displayed.[118] The Paramus Rescue Squad 
and Fire Department Companies 2 & 3 host a Halloween party every October 
called, "Safe Halloween" to ensure every child has a safe and fun Halloween.[119] 
Paramus is governed under the Borough form of New Jersey municipal government. 
The governing body consists of a Mayor and a Borough Council comprising 
six council members, with all positions elected at-large on a partisan 
basis as part of the November general election. A Mayor is elected directly 
by the voters to a four-year term of office. The Borough Council consists 
of six members elected to serve three-year terms on a staggered basis, 
with two seats coming up for election each year in a three-year cycle.[7] 
The Borough form of government used by Paramus, the most common system 
used in the state, is a "weak mayor / strong council" government in which 
council members act as the legislative body with the mayor presiding at 
meetings and voting only in the event of a tie. The mayor can veto ordinances 
subject to an override by a two-thirds majority vote of the council. The 
mayor makes committee and liaison assignments for council members, and 
most appointments are made by the mayor with the advice and consent of 
the council.[120][121] As of 2016[update], the Mayor is Democrat Richard 
LaBarbiera, whose term of office ends December 31, 2018. Borough Council 
Members are Council President Maria Elena Bellinger (D, 2017), Joseph Garcia 
(D, 2017), Stephen Sullivan (R, 2016), Holly Tedesco-Santos (D, 2018), 
Patsy L. Verile (D, 2018) and Jeanne Weber (R, 2016).[3][122][123][124][125][126] 
In October 2015, Moody's Investors Service upgraded general obligation 
debt of the Borough of Paramus from Aa1 to Aaa, in light of the low levels 
of debt and the strength of the borough's financial operations, reserve 
levels, tax base, management practices and levels of wealth.[127] Paramus 
is located in the 5th Congressional District[128] and is part of New Jersey's 
38th state legislative district.[10][129][130] New Jersey's Fifth Congressional 
District is represented by Scott Garrett (R, Wantage Township).[131] New 
Jersey is represented in the United States Senate by Cory Booker (D, Newark, 
term ends 2021)[132] and Bob Menendez (D, Paramus, 2019).[133][134] For 
the 2016–2017 session (Senate, General Assembly), the 38th Legislative 
District of the New Jersey Legislature is represented in the State Senate 
by Robert M. Gordon (D, Fair Lawn) and in the General Assembly by Tim Eustace 
(D, Maywood) and Joseph Lagana (D, Paramus).[135] The Governor of New Jersey 
is Chris Christie (R, Mendham Township).[136] The Lieutenant Governor of 
New Jersey is Kim Guadagno (R, Monmouth Beach).[137] Bergen County is governed 
by a directly elected County Executive, with legislative functions performed 
by a seven-member Board of Chosen Freeholders.[138] As of 2015[update], 
the County Executive is James J. Tedesco III (D, Paramus; term ends December 
31, 2018).[139] The seven freeholders are elected at-large in partisan 
elections on a staggered basis, with two or three seats coming up for election 
each year, with a Chairman, Vice Chairman and Chairman Pro Tempore selected 
from among its members at a reorganization meeting held each January.[140] 
Bergen County's Freeholders are Freeholder Chairwoman Joan Voss (D, 2017; 
Fort Lee),[141] Vice Chairman Steve Tanelli (D, 2015; North Arlington)[142] 
Chairman Pro Tempore John A. Felice (R, 2016; River Edge),[143] David L. 
Ganz (D, 2017; Fair Lawn),[144] Maura R. DeNicola (R, 2016; Franklin Lakes)[145] 
Thomas J. Sullivan Jr., (D, Montvale, 2015; serving the unexpired term 
of office that had been occupied by James Tedesco before he was sworn in 
as County Executive)[146][147] and Tracy Silna Zur (D, 2015; Franklin Lakes).[148][149] 
Countywide constitutional officials are County Clerk John S. Hogan (D, 
Northvale),[150] Sheriff Michael Saudino (R)[151] and Surrogate Michael 
R. Dressler (D, Cresskill).[152][153][138] As of March 23, 2011, there
