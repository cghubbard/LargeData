Howard J. Lamade Stadium (pronounced LAM-a-DEE, LAM-a-DAY, or LAH-mAHd) 
is a baseball stadium in South Williamsport, Pennsylvania. Each year, it 
hosts the Little League World Series, along with Little League Volunteer 
Stadium. Lamade Stadium was built in 1959 and holds 40,000 people, most 
of whom sit on the outfield berms. It is the largest non-Major League Baseball 
stadium. The field is 2/3 the size of a professional field, with 60 ft 
(18 m) basepaths, a 46 ft (14 m) mound, and after the change in 2006, 225 ft 
(69 m) fences. The stadium was changed in 1992 when lights were added so 
that night games could be played as part of expansion of the series to 
round robin play. In 2006, the fences were moved back 20 ft (6.1 m) to 
225 ft (69 m) to all fields; the wall forms one-fourth of a true circle. 
This was done because home runs were becoming too common. Other renovations 
included the extension of the stadium roofs to the end of the grandstands 
and additional seating with backing were added in place of bleacher seating. 
In August 2011, Lamade Stadium set an attendance record for the game between 
La Grange, Kentucky and Clinton County, Pennsylvania, with 41,848 people 
in the stands and on the hill. It was later broken on August 29, 2015 when 
Lewisberry, Pennsylvania defeated Pearland, Texas with 45,716 in attendance.
