As player As coach Michael Ausley Maddux (born August 27, 1961) is an American 
pitching coach and former professional baseball pitcher who played for 
nine teams over 15 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB). He played in 
MLB from 1986 through 2000 for the Philadelphia Phillies, Los Angeles Dodgers, 
San Diego Padres, New York Mets, Pittsburgh Pirates, Boston Red Sox, Seattle 
Mariners, Montreal Expos, and Houston Astros. Except for the Phillies, 
for whom he played during the first four seasons of his career, Maddux 
never played more than two seasons for any team. Maddux currently serves 
as pitching coach of the Washington Nationals. He previously served in 
that capacity for the Milwaukee Brewers and Texas Rangers. The teams for 
which Maddux has coached have allowed significantly fewer runs to score 
than before his hire. While coaching for the Rangers, the pitching staff 
posted season earned run averages (ERA) lower than 4.00 for the first time 
since 1990, doing so for four consecutive seasons. The Nationals hired 
him after the 2015 season. Beginning at the age of ten, Maddux received 
instruction in pitching from former Major League Baseball scout Ralph Meder.[1] 
Maddux attended Rancho High School in Las Vegas, Nevada.[2] The Cincinnati 
Reds selected him in the 36th round of the 1979 Major League Baseball draft, 
but he did not sign with the Reds, and enrolled at the University of Texas 
at El Paso (UTEP), where he played college baseball for the UTEP Miners.[3] 
The Philadelphia Phillies selected him in the fifth round of the 1982 MLB 
Draft. He made his MLB debut in 1986.[4] On September 29, he started a 
game against his brother, Greg and the Chicago Cubs, who was also a rookie. 
The Cubs defeated the Phillies.[5] After the 1989 season, the Phillies 
released Maddux, and he signed with the Los Angeles Dodgers. Granted free 
agency after the 1990 season, he contacted each team in seeking a tryout, 
which resulted in the San Diego Padres signing him. Maddux won a spot with 
the Padres as a relief pitcher.[6][7] After the 1992 season, the Padres 
traded Maddux to the New York Mets for Roger Mason and Mike Freitas.[8] 
He signed a two-year contract with the Mets, worth $2.375 million.[9] Granted 
free agency after the 1994 season, Maddux signed with the Pittsburgh Pirates.[10] 
The Pirates released him on May 16. He signed with the Boston Red Sox on 
May 30,[11] and then re-signed with the Red Sox as a free agent that offseason. 
The Red Sox released Maddux before the 1997 season, and he signed with 
the Seattle Mariners, who released him on July 23. The Padres signed him 
on August 19, but he did not pitch in the majors for the Padres that year. 
A free agent again, Maddux signed with the Montreal Expos, who released 
him on April 15, 1999. On April 24, he signed with the Dodgers. He signed 
with the Houston Astros for the 2000 season,[12] but was released on July 
5. During a 15-year baseball career, Maddux compiled 39 wins, 564 strikeouts, 
and a 4.05 earned run average. After his retirement as a player, Maddux 
started his coaching career as a pitching coach in Minor League Baseball 
for the Houston Astros, first with the Round Rock Express. Beginning in 
2003, Maddux spent six seasons as the pitching coach for the Milwaukee 
Brewers' major league club. During this time, the Brewers yielded an average 
of 77 fewer runs per season than they had in the previous seven. Pitcher 
C. C. Sabathia, one whom the Brewers acquired as part of a mid-season trade, 
had never had an ERA below 3.00 in any season in his except the one where 
he played a half-season in Milwaukee.[13] The Texas Rangers hired Maddux 
as their pitching coach prior to the 2009 season. Maddux later recounted 
one of his first conversations with then-president and former Rangers pitcher 
Nolan Ryan. Ryan commented that he wanted to change the culture and perception 
that pitching for the Rangers was extremely difficult. "Do it, or else" 
was the challenge he gave Maddux.[14] In 2008, the Rangers' pitching staff 
produced a 5.37 ERA, the worst in the American League (AL), and from 2000–08, 
also produced an AL-worst 5.14 ERA. The Rangers had not completed a season 
with a team ERA below 4.00 since 1990, and in 15 seasons playing at Globe 
Life Park in Arlington, their ERA was 5.04.[15] In the previous 11 seasons 
before his arrival, they had given up 888 runs a season.[13] After his 
first season as pitching coach with Texas, the club's ERA dropped nearly 
one full run (0.99).[16] In 2011, when the Rangers went to the World Series 
for the second consecutive season, they lacked star pitching. The rotation 
was composed primarily of C. J. Wilson, with a 6.02 ERA when Maddux arrived; 
Colby Lewis, who had just pitched in Nippon Professional Baseball in Japan; 
Scott Feldman, and Tommy Hunter.[13] During Maddux' time with the Rangers, 
club won 612 games, third-most in the AL, and achieved a collective ERA 
of 4.04, including four consecutive seasons below 4.00. From 2010–13, their 
ERA was 3.83, third-lowest in the AL.[15] They trimmed the average number 
of runs allowed in his six years to 707.[13] Five pitchers became All-Stars 
in Maddux' tenure: Yu Darvish, Neftalí Feliz, Matt Harrison, Alexi Ogando, 
and Wilson. The Rangers reached the postseason four times and won two AL 
pennants.[15] During the 2011 offseason, he was a manager candidate for 
the Cubs after they had fired Mike Quade. He was a candidate to manage 
the Astros after they fired Bo Porter. He was also considered for the Red 
Sox managerial position, but he withdrew himself from consideration.[17] 
When Jeff Banister became the Rangers' manager during the 2014–15 offseason, 
Maddux agreed to stay with the Rangers for one more season.[18] His contract 
with the Rangers expired after the 2015 season, and they discussed a new 
contract. Maddux explored options with other teams while the Rangers considered 
hiring a successor. The Rangers decided to hire a candidate from their 
interviews rather than making Maddux a formal offer.[19] The Washington 
Nationals signed Maddux with a two-year contract to become their pitching 
coach on November 4, 2015.[20] Maddux was born in Dayton, Ohio, in 1961 
to Dave and Linda Maddux. Dave served in the United States Air Force, and 
was stationed in Taiwan when Mike was a toddler. Mike's younger brother, 
Greg, was born in San Angelo, Texas, in 1966. The Madduxes then moved to 
North Dakota, California, Madrid, and lived in Indiana during the Vietnam 
War, before settling in Las Vegas.[3] Maddux and his wife have two daughters.
