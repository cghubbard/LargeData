Dannon Ross Atkins (born August 7, 1973) is an American baseball executive. 
On December 3, 2015, he was named the general manager of the Toronto Blue 
Jays, after having worked for the Cleveland Indians for 15 years. Atkins 
was a pitcher at Wake Forest University, and was drafted by the Florida 
Marlins in the 69th round of the 1994 Major League Baseball draft, but 
did not sign. In the 1995 Major League Baseball draft, the Cleveland Indians 
selected him in the 38th round, and he signed with the team.[1] He played 
5 seasons in Cleveland's minor league organization before retiring, compiling 
a career 37–32 win–loss record, 4.13 earned run average (ERA), and 340 
strikeouts in 512 innings pitched.[1] The Indians hired Atkins in 2001 
as assistant director of player development, and was promoted to director 
of Latin American operations in 2003. In 2006, they promoted him to director 
of player development.[2] The Indians promoted Atkins to vice president 
of player personnel after the 2014 season.[3] Mark Shapiro, who was hired 
as the Blue Jays' team president and CEO on October 31, 2015, hired Atkins 
as general manager on December 3.[4] He replaced Tony LaCava, who served 
as interim GM in November. During the offseason leading into the 2016 season, 
Atkins made several moves, including selecting Joe Biagini in the Rule 
5 draft, trading Ben Revere to the Washington Nationals for Drew Storen, 
and signing several players to minor league contracts with invitations 
to spring training.[5][6] In his first draft as GM, Atkins selected T. 
J. Zeuch in the first round.[7] Atkins made several additions to the Blue 
Jays roster prior to the trade deadline, acquiring Melvin Upton Jr., Joaquín 
Benoit, Scott Feldman, Francisco Liriano, and others, which aided the Blue 
Jays in making the postseason for the second consecutive season.[8][9]
