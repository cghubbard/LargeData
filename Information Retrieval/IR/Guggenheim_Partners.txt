which is owned by Time Warner, did an investigation into the Guggenheim 
Partners. They noted that when Magic Johnson bought the Los Angeles Dodgers 
he was joined by a team which turned out to be the Guggenheim Partners 
and it was "the main force in the deal, and the eye-popping Dodgers acquisition 
has been only one of a handful drawing ever more attention to the firm". 
The article continued that "the New York- and Chicago-based operation has 
been turning up everywhere in Los Angeles. In September, a Guggenheim group 
spent a reported $370 million for Dick Clark Productions, the company that 
produces the Golden Globes telecast and So You Think You Can Dance. A few 
years before, Guggenheim teamed up with other investors to buy seven trade 
publications, including the Hollywood Reporter".[30] Despite this, the 
partners according to the magazine "avoided the cataclysm of the financial 
crisis", pouncing when "disaster struck".[31] Later in the article they 
said that since the Guggenheim Partners managed so many billions in assets 
that they were almost like a private equity firm. Also, they noted that 
the group is very secretive in its dealings and likes to work behind the 
scenes with its members consisting of former employees of Bear Stearns, 
Yahoo and Apollo Global Management. At the end of the article they noted 
that the partners might buy a sports TV channel owned by Time Warner and
