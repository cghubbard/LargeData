William Jared Hughes (born July 4, 1985) is an American professional baseball 
pitcher for the Pittsburgh Pirates of Major League Baseball. He made his 
MLB debut for the Pirates in 2011. Hughes was born in Stamford, Connecticut 
but was raised in San Marino, California.[1] Hughes attended Santa Margarita 
Catholic High School. He was drafted by the Tampa Bay Devil Rays in the 
16th Round of the 2003 Major League Baseball Draft, but chose to attend 
Santa Clara University. Hughes transferred to Long Beach State University 
after the 2004 season.[2] He pitched for LBSU for two seasons in 2005 and 
2006, pitching out of the rotation and posting a 16-7 career record with 
a 3.29 ERA, throwing 197 innings with 164 strikeouts.[3] Hughes was drafted 
by the Pittsburgh Pirates in the fourth round of the 2006 Major League 
Baseball Draft out of Long Beach State University.[4] Hughes started his 
pro career in 2006 with the Williamsport Crosscutters and the Hickory Crawdads. 
He spent the 2007 season with Hickory. He spent the 2008 season with the 
Lynchburg Hillcats and the Altoona Curve. In 2009, Hughes pitched for the 
Gulf Coast League Pirates and Altoona. In 2010, Hughes pitched for Altoona. 
Hughes started the 2011 season in the Altoona rotation, but was promoted 
and moved to the bullpen with the Triple-A Indianapolis Indians. When Hughes 
was promoted to the majors in September 2011, he became the 41st major 
leaguer in Long Beach State history.[3] He appeared in 12 games, going

coming off the Disabled list. He was recalled again on August 14. Hughes 
finished the season with 66 appearances, going 2-2 with a 2.85 ERA. The 
2013 season was a setback for Hughes, as he battled injuries and inconsistency
