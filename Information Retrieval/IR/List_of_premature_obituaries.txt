A premature obituary is an obituary published whose subject is not actually 
deceased at the time of publication. Examples of premature obituaries include 
that of arms manufacturer Alfred Nobel, whose premature obituary condemning 
him as a "merchant of death" may have caused him to create the Nobel Prize;[1] 
black nationalist Marcus Garvey, whose actual death was apparently caused 
by reading his own obituary;[2] and actor Abe Vigoda, who was the subject 
of so many premature obituaries that a website was created to state whether 
he was alive or dead. This article lists the recipients of incorrect death

official bodies, and widely used information sources such as the Internet

which feature automated death hoax stories designed to draw in page clicks 
from specific web searches. People who were presumed (though not categorically 
declared) to be dead, and joke death reports that were widely believed, 
are also included. Each premature obituary listed below has one of the

accessible for some time before).[325] The pages included tributes to Fidel 
Castro, Dick Cheney, Nelson Mandela, Bob Hope, Gerald Ford, Pope John Paul 
II, and Ronald Reagan (all of which claim they died in 2001). Some of these 
obituaries contained fragments taken from others, particularly from Queen 
Elizabeth the Queen Mother's obituary, which had apparently been used as 
a template. Dick Cheney for example was described as the 'UK's favorite 
grandmother', the site noted the Pope's 'love of racing', and described 
Castro as 'lifeguard, athlete, movie star' (a reference to Ronald Reagan). 
Though the Queen Mother was already dead, in an unrelated incident she
