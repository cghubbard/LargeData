In baseball, a hitting streak refers to the number of consecutive official 
games in which a player appears and gets at least one base hit. According 
to the Official Baseball Rules, such a streak is ended when a player has 
at least 1 plate appearance and no hits. A streak shall not be terminated 
if all official plate appearances result in a base on balls, hit by pitch, 
defensive interference or a sacrifice bunt. The streak shall terminate 
if the player has a sacrifice fly and no hit.[1] Joe DiMaggio holds the 
Major League Baseball record with a streak of 56 consecutive games in 1941 
which began on May 15 and ended July 17. DiMaggio hit .408 during his streak 
(91-for-223), with 15 home runs and 55 runs batted in.[2] There have been 
55 occurrences in Major League Baseball where a player had a hitting streak 
of at least 30 games.[3] Multiple streaks in the same season have occurred 
in 1922 (George Sisler and Rogers Hornsby), 1987 (Paul Molitor and Benito 
Santiago), 1997 (Nomar Garciaparra and Sandy Alomar, Jr.), 1999 (Vladimir 
Guerrero and Luis Gonzalez), 2006 (Chase Utley and Willy Taveras), and 
2011 (Andre Ethier and Dan Uggla). In addition, 1924 included one whole 
streak (Sam Rice) and the beginning of another (George Sisler). A similar 
event occurred in 2006 with two whole streaks (Utley and Taveras) and the 
end of another (Jimmy Rollins). Keeler's streak started in his final game 
of the 1896 season, and continued through the first 44 games of the 1897 
season. Rollins ended the 2005 season with a 36-game streak and extended 
it through the first two games of the 2006 season. Sisler had a hit in 
the last game of 1924 and the first 34 games of 1925. Major League Baseball 
recognizes two hitting streak records: Longest hitting streak in one season, 
and longest hitting streak over multiple seasons (e.g. Rollins 2005â€“2006).[4] 
Keeler's, Sisler's, and Rollins' streaks are listed as 44, 34, and 36 games 
when discussing single-season streaks, and 45, 35, and 38 games when discussing 
multiple-season streaks. This list omits Denny Lyons of the 1887 American 
Association Philadelphia Athletics, who had a 52-game hitting streak.[5] 
In 1887, the major leagues adopted a new rule which counted walks as hits, 
a rule which was dropped after that season. Lyons hit in 52 consecutive 
games that season, but his streak included two games (#22 and #44) in which 
his only "hits" were walks. In 1968, MLB ruled that walks in 1887 would 
not be counted as hits, so Lyons' streak was no longer recognized, though 
it still appears on some lists. In 2000 Major League Baseball reversed 
its 1968 decision, ruling that the statistics which were recognized in 
each year's official records should stand, even in cases where they were 
later proven incorrect. Paradoxically, the ruling affects only hit totals 
for the year; the batting champion for the year is not recognized as the 
all-time leader despite having the highest single-season average under 
the ruling, and Lyons' hitting streak is not recognized. Ty Cobb, Sam Rice, 
and George Sisler are the only players with multiple streaks of 30 games 
or longer. There have been 129 single-season streaks of 25 games or more. 
The lowest batting average ever recorded during a hitting streak of 25 
games or more was .304 by Bruce Campbell in 1938. The highest was .486 
during Chuck Klein's streak in 1930. Joe DiMaggio hit .408 during his record-holding 
56 game streak.[6] Only currently extant franchises are included on this 
list. Where a player had a significant streak while the team was in other 
than its current city, the records in these other cities are displayed. 
As above, for a multi-year streak, the single-season streak is shown in 
parentheses.[7] The longest streaks in the history of Minor League Baseball 
and other professional baseball leagues:[8] DiMaggio set the Minor League 
record as a member of the San Francisco Seals. Unrecognized by Minor League 
Baseball is the 69 game hitting streak by Joe Wilhoit in 1919. Wilhoit 
was in the independent Western League at the time and his record is considered
