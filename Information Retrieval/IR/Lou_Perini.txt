Louis Robert Perini (November 29, 1903 in Ashland, Massachusetts – April 
16, 1972 in West Palm Beach, Florida)[1] was the principal owner of the 
Boston Braves/Milwaukee Braves of the National League from 1945 through 
1961.[2] In 1945, he purchased the club from Bob Quinn for $500,000 then 
moved the club to Milwaukee, Wisconsin for the 1953 season after complaining 
of poor attendance and revenue in Boston. At the completion of the 1961 
season he sold the franchise for $5.5 million to Chicago insurance executive 
William Bartholomay who later moved the franchise to Atlanta for the 1966 
season, while retaining a 10% interest in the club and sat on the Board 
of Directors for a number of years. Prior to owning the Braves, Perini 
gained his fortune in his family's construction business, Perini Corp, 
having started out his working life as a water boy in his father's small 
construction firm, ending up running the major worldwide Perini Corporation.
