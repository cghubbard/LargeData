The Chicago Federal Building in Chicago, Illinois was constructed between 
1898 and 1905 for the purpose of housing the midwest's federal courts, 
main post office, and other government bureaus. It stood in The Loop neighborhood 
on a block bounded by Dearborn, Adams and Clark Streets and Jackson Boulevard. 
The site held an 1880 post office, courthouse and customhouse which was 
cleared to make way for the new building.[1] The 1905 building was itself 
demolished in 1965 and replaced with the Kluczynski Federal Building. The 
push for a new building was spearheaded by postmaster Washington Hesing 
with backing by civic leaders and the Illinois' members of Congress. The 
explosion of Chicago's population, especially after the World's Columbian 
Exposition of 1893, strained the earlier facility beyond capacity. When 
the Exposition began, the Post Office Department in Chicago employed 998 
clerks and 935 carriers. By the time Congress approved funding for a new 
building, the post office had expanded to 1,319 clerks and 1,096 carriers.[2] 
Other agencies housed in the building complained of poor planning and shoddy 
construction which resulted in crumbling plaster, broken plumbing and flooding.[3] 
The new building was designed in the Beaux-Arts[1] style by architect Henry 
Ives Cobb. The floorplan was a six-story Greek cross atop a two-story base 
with a raised basement.[2][4] The building was capped by a dome at the 
crossing that held an additional eight floors of office space in its drum 
for a total of 16 floors.[5] The gilt dome extended 100 ft (30 m) above 
the drum. Congress passed a bill in late 1894 that President Grover Cleveland 
signed on February 13, 1895, appropriating $4 million to demolish the existing 
structure on the site and erect a new one. The 1880 building was considered 
dangerous and it was inadequate to house all the federal agencies in the 
city whose offices consequently were spread among several buildings.[2] 
On January 20, 1896, Congress approved an additional $25,000 to employ 
a special architect. The Chicago Federal Building was the first government 
structure constructed with the purpose of housing the post office.[2] Demolition 
began on the old building in June 1896 after the post office relocated 
to a temporary building on the site now occupied by the 333 North Michigan 
Avenue Building. Foundation work began in August 1897 and was completed 
in September 1898 at a cost of $208,000.[2] The foundation was supported 
by wooden piles driven 72 feet (22 m) below street level.[6] The basement 
and first two floors covered the entire site and measured 321 ft (98 m) 
by 361 ft (110 m). On April 30, 1898, work for the superstructure was awarded 
to John Pierce, a New York contractor, who submitted a bid of $1,897,000. 
The building took seven years to construct because government policy at 
the time was to appropriate only enough funds for each contract as it was 
awarded. There was no general contractor and over 100 separate contracts 
were awarded during construction. The completed building reached a height 
of 297 ft (91 m) and was dedicated by President William McKinley October 
9, 1899, the twenty-eighth anniversary of the Great Chicago Fire. The areas 
for the post office were completed in 1904 and other agencies occupied 
their spaces in 1905.[2] The Federal Building was constructed over a steel 
frame with exterior walls of brick sheathed with 500,000 sq ft (46,000 m2) 
of gray granite from Mount Waldo, Maine. The roofs were covered vitrified 
tile over book tile while the dome was covered with gilt glass tiles. The 
plan called for the post office to occupy the basement and two lower floors. 
The sixth, seventh and eighth floors of one wing held the courts, judges, 
clerks and US Marshal. The floors in the dome were reserved for the Civil 
Service Commission, Railway Mail Service and weather bureau with other 
agencies occupying the remaining space.[2] The base consisted of a central 
entry on each facade flanked by eight bays of windows. The bays were separated 
by Corinthian pilasters with arches over the windows of the second floor. 
A cornice and balustrade topped the base on all four facades. Four Corinthian 
columns extending from the third to sixth floor supported a pediment at 
on the face of each arm of the cross. The wings on the north-south axis 
held seven bays long while the wings on the east-west axis held five bays 
as the building was situated on a rectangular lot. The bays each held two 
windows grouped vertically and were separated by Corinthian pilasters. 
The eighth floor was housed in a shed dormers extending from the gabled 
roof. The dome was octagonal with a buttress at each corner of the drum. 
The buttresses were topped by corbels supporting a large double cornice 
encircling the sixteenth floor with a large eagle perched atop the corbels. 
The windows of the ninth through twelfth floors were set into three arches 
supported by more Corinthian columns. Between the eagles, were three circular 
windows with elaborately carved frames and above, another circular window 
pierced the midpoint of each face of the dome. After construction was complete, 
more than $2,000,000 remained for interior decoration of the Chicago Federal 
Building.[4] The four wings met under the dome to form an octagonal rotunda, 
inspired by Imperial Roman architecture, that was open to the ninth floor.[6] 
The rotunda's 100 ft (30 m) diameter made it larger than that of the United 
States Capitol in Washington, D.C.[4] The federal building was also the 
tallest capitol-style building constructed in Chicago, with the exception 
of the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition buildings, all of which were demolished. 
Under the dome was a large public space surrounded by the floors containing 
office space.[7] The interior details were accented with terra cotta and 
scagliola. Doors were oak with brass hardware and "US" molded into doorknobs. 
Mahogany was used in courtrooms and other offices. Marble from Tennessee, 
Vermont, Maine and Italy was used in corridor floors, wainscoting and stairways. 
Floors in the rotunda were marble accented with mosaic tile while railings 
and elevator grilles throughout the building were wrought iron. Ceilings 
were framed by egg-and-dart mouldings. The four courtrooms on the sixth 
floor contained a series of murals depicting historical moments in the 
development of law.[2] The Building housed the US District Court for the 
Northern District of Illinois until 1964 and the US Court of Appeals-Seventh 
Circuit until 1938.[3] The Federal Weather Bureau maintained offices in 
the dome and took official measurements from July 1, 1905 until December 
31, 1925, when the official weather station moved to the University of 
Chicago campus. The Federal Building site maintained supplemental observation 
equipment until 1970.[8] In 1907, Judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis presided 
over an antitrust case against Standard Oil in which the company was fined 
$29 million for accepting freight rebates from the railroads. The verdict 
was later set aside but in 1920, Landis went on to become the first Commissioner 
of Baseball. A powerful bomb exploded on the building's north side September 
4, 1918, killing four people and injured 75 others, destroying the entrance 
doors and damaging windows of buildings across Adams Street. Two mail clerks 
and two patrons were killed in the explosion, which was immediately blamed 
upon the radical Industrial Workers of the World, which had recently been 
involved in a mass trial at the location.[9] On September 7, 1918 police 
arrested a suspect with close ties to the IWW organization.[10] Walt Disney 
worked at the post office in the building from July until September 1918.[11] 
Authorities discovered another bomb October 31, 1921, before the device 
exploded. There was no damage to the building or its inhabitants.[2] In 
1931, the courtroom of Judge James Herbert Wilkerson was the location for 
the trial of gangster Al Capone. On October 24, 1931, Wilkerson sentenced 
Capone to a 10-year in prison sentence and fine of $50,000 for tax evasion. 
His conviction was upheld by the appellate court December 20, 1937.[12] 
The District and Circuit courts and several agencies relocated to the new 
Dirksen Federal Building across Dearborn Street and the building was demolished 
in 1965. The 45-floor Kluczynski Federal Building and Loop Postal Station, 
designed by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, were built in its place. The plaza 
between the three structures is the setting for Alexander Calder's sculpture 
Flamingo. The building also appeared on a postage stamp printed for the 
Century of Progress World's Fair that was held in Chicago in 1933. Its 
view on a 3-cent stamp is different, because large columns appear around 
it, symbolizing the branches of government. The stamp also appeared on 
a souvenir sheet issued at the same time. Both the stamp and sheet were 
reprinted when Postmaster General James A. Farley gave imperforated examples 
of these, and other, stamps to his friends. Because of the ensuing public 
outcry, millions of copies of "Farley's Follies" were printed and sold.[13]
