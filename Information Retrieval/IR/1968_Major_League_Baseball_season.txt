The 1968 Major League Baseball season was the last season of the traditional 
two-league system before each of the leagues were split into divisions 
for the following season. It featured the most dominant pitching year of 
the modern era, and the first season of the Oakland Athletics (having moved 
from Kansas City after the 1967 season). The 1968 season was the last year 
of baseball's pre-playoffs era, in which the team that finished in first 
place in each league went directly to the World Series to face each other 
for the "World Championship." The addition of expansion teams in 1961, 
1962, and 1969 finally led to the advent of a playoff system in baseball 
the following season. In Major League Baseball, the trend throughout the 
1960s was of increased pitching dominance, caused by enforcing a larger 
strike zone (top of armpit to bottom of knee) beginning in 1963. The delicate 
balance of power between offense and defense reached its greatest tilt 
in favor of the pitcher by 1968. During what later became known as "the 
year of the pitcher",[1] Bob Gibson set a modern earned run average record 
of 1.12 and a World Series record of 17 strikeouts in Game 1, while Series 
opponent Denny McLain of the Detroit Tigers won 31 regular season games, 
the only player to reach the 30 win milestone since Dizzy Dean in 1934. 
Don Drysdale of the L.A. Dodgers pitched 6 consecutive shutout games in 
May and June, ending with 58 2/3 scoreless innings. Mickey Lolich won three 
complete games in the World Series, the last player as of today to do so. 
Luis Tiant of the Cleveland Indians had the American League's lowest ERA 
at 1.60 and allowed a batting average of only .168, a major league record. 
Both MVPs for that year were pitchers. In the American League and National 
League combined, 339 shutouts were recorded in 1,619 regular-season games.[2][3] 
The St. Louis Cardinals alone pitched 30 shutouts, the most in the Majors. 
The 472 runs allowed by the Cardinals led the MLB that year and remains 
the lowest total ever recorded by any Major League team in a 162-game season. 
Hitting was anemic. Carl Yastrzemski of the Boston Red Sox had the lowest 
batting average of any league champion when his .301 was good enough for 
the American League batting title. The AL's collective slugging average 
of .340 remains the lowest since 1915 (when the game was still in the so-called 
dead-ball era), while the collective batting average of .231 is the all-time 
lowest.[4] The Chicago White Sox scored only 463 runs during the regular 
season and were shut out a league-high 23 times. Both those totals are 
still all-time records in the era of the 162-game season. After the season, 
the Rules Committee, seeking to restore balance, restored the pre-1963 
strike zone and lowered the height of the pitching mound from 15 to 10Â inches. 
Four expansion teams joined the majors. 1969 batting averages zoomed back 
to their historical averages and never again would pitching have as large
