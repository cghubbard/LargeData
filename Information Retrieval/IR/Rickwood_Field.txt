in Birmingham, Alabama, is the oldest professional baseball park in the 
United States. It was built for the Birmingham Barons in 1910 by industrialist 
and team-owner Rick Woodward and has served as the home park for the Birmingham 
Barons and the Birmingham Black Barons of the Negro Leagues. Though the 
Barons moved their home games to the Hoover Met in the suburbs, and most 
recently to Regions Field in Birmingham, Rickwood Field has been preserved 
and is undergoing gradual restoration as a "working museum" where baseball's 
history can be experienced, the Barons also play one regular season game 
a year at Rickwood Field. Rickwood Field is listed on the National Register 
of Historic Places.[1] The Birmingham Coal Barons baseball team began playing 
professionally in 1887, with their home games at an informal park called 
"Slag Pile Field" in West End. In 1901 they joined the Southern Association. 
Allen Harvey "Rick" Woodward, chairman of Woodward Iron Company and grandson 
of pioneer Birmingham industrialist Stimpson Harvey Woodward, purchased 
a majority share of the Birmingham Coal Barons baseball team from J. William 
McQueen in 1909 while he was still in his 20s. Immediately he began planning 
a grand showplace for his new team. He contacted Connie Mack for advice 
on the details, including the field dimensions. He settled on Shibe Park 
in Philadelphia (which was controlled by Mack's team and later renamed 
Connie Mack Stadium) and Forbes Field in Pittsburgh as the models for the 
new park. He purchased land in the West End neighborhood of Birmingham 
from the Alabama Central Railroad. The $75,000 structure was designed by 
Southeastern Engineering Company of Birmingham (a short-lived subsidiary 
of Pittsburgh's General Fireproofing Company) and completed during the 
summer of 1910. The 12.7 acre (51,000 m²) park was flanked along the basepaths 
by concrete and steel stands. A tile-roofed cupola on the roof behind home 
plate provided space for the announcer and the press. Woodward named the 
field after himself, using his nickname and the first part of his last 
name. It was the first concrete-and-steel stadium in the minors. Woodward 
invited Alabama Governor Braxton Bragg Comer, Birmingham Mayor Culpepper 
Exum, civic leader, George B. Ward and Victor H. Hanson, publisher of The 
Birmingham News, for opening day on August 18, 1910. The day was celebrated 
by businesses closing all over town to allow fans to fill the park for 
the first pitch at 3:30 P.M. Over 10,000 people attended that first game 
in which the Barons defeated the visiting Montgomery Climbers 3-2. Throughout 
the first half of the 20th century Rickwood Field hosted sellout crowds 
for both the Barons and the Black Barons, who played on alternate weekends. 
In 1912 a spring tornado tore through the field, pulling up the outfield 
fence. Two years later Woodward felt the need to have electric fans installed 
in the grandstands for the comfort of the crowd. The Pittsburgh Pirates 
also made Rickwood Field their spring training home in 1919. Rickwood Field 
also hosted college football games. From 1912 to 1927 the Alabama Crimson 
Tide played its Birmingham home dates in Rickwood. In 1921 the outfield 
fence was damaged in a tornado and quickly rebuilt. In 1924–1927 the infield 
bleachers were covered with a steel-framed roof designed by Denham, VanKeuren 
& Denham, Architects of Birmingham. Shortly after, In 1928 a new Mission 
style entry structure with offices was built to the designs of Paul Wright 
& Co., Engineers of Birmingham. A new concrete outfield wall replaced the 
original fence. In 1931 in the first game of the Dixie Series championship, 
Birmingham's 43-year-old Ray Caldwell outpitched 22-year-old Dizzy Dean, 
who had guaranteed a win. The Barons won the series 4 games to 3. In 1936 
four monumental steel-frame light towers designed and fabricated by the 
Truscon Steel Company of Youngstown, Ohio were erected, allowing for night 
games. In 1938, Woodward sold the park to Ed Norton, a local businessman. 
In 1940 Norton sold it to the Cincinnati Reds. At that time new outfield 
fences were built inside the original walls to reduce the field dimensions. 
G. J. Jebeles of Birmingham purchased the park in 1944. A ladies' rest 
room was added and the outfield fence reduced again in 1948. In 1949 ownership 
changed hands again, going to a partnership of Al DeMent, Al Belcher, and 
Rufus Lackey. They added a small restaurant in the entrance building in 
1950 and installed additional box seats, necessitating the relocations 
of the dugouts farther down the baselines. In 1958 Belcher gained a majority 
share and control of the park. In 1964 General Manager Glynn West purchased 
1000 wooden seats from New York City's Polo Grounds and installed them 
at the park. Belcher sold Rickwood Field in 1966 to the City of Birmingham, 
but retained a lease for the remainder of that year. In 1966 the lease 
was transferred to Charlie Finley, who brought the Kansas City Athletics' 
AA farm team to Birmingham for the 1967 season. That year is remembered 
for the day that 14,000 disappointed fans were sent home early when the 
Atlanta Braves vs. Southern League All-Stars exhibition game was called 
"on account of tornado." During this period, following a trend which swept 
minor league baseball (and which has since been largely reversed), the 
team took the name of the parent major league club and was known as the 
"Birmingham A's". Between 1979 and 1980 the wooden seats were replaced 
with plastic seats in the box areas and metal bleachers under the grandstands.[2] 
In 1981 Art Clarkson brought minor league baseball back to Rickwood with 
the Detroit Tigers AA club, which resumed the Barons name. He had a new 
electronic scoreboard installed at the park. In 1986, the Barons became 
the Chicago White Sox AA club, an affiliation that continues today. In 
1987 the Barons moved to a new facility, Hoover Metropolitan Stadium, in 
the suburb of Hoover. They returned to Birmingham in 2013 with the opening 
of Regions Field, just south of downtown Birmingham. Since 1992 the ballpark 
has been under the care of the Friends of Rickwood who are restoring the 
facility to its former glory. They also host frequent amateur, police and 
semi-pro games and open the gates to visitors who can walk in and explore 
the grandstands or run the bases. Since 1996, Rickwood Field has hosted 
the Barons for a throwback game in which both teams wear period uniforms. 
Each game honors a different era in Birmingham baseball history. Ballpark 
enthusiasts from across North America migrate to Rickwood to attend this 
AA regulation game, named the "Rickwood Classic", every season. Many consider 
this game the best opportunity to experience a regulation ballgame in an 
historic ballpark that remains true to its original and traditional appearance. 
Those involved – the Barons franchise, Friends of Rickwood, and fans – 
fully believe that this experience in the sacred baseball cathedral is 
among the most underrated baseball events. Scenes from the movies Cobb 
(1994) and Soul of the Game (1995) were filmed at Rickwood. Those productions 
contributed to the recreation of the scoreboard and press-box and the addition 
of 1940s period style advertisements on the outfield fence. Some of these 
retro-style ads have been sponsored by real Birmingham businesses, including 
a section sponsored by the descendants of Rick Woodward that advertises 
long-gone Woodward Iron Co. The outfield signs were designed by Ted Haigh, 
a Los Angeles-based graphic designer and executed by Skidmore Sign Company 
of Birmingham. In May 2012, scenes from the movie 42 were also filmed at 
Rickwood Field. As of 2005, the Friends of Rickwood have spent around $2 million 
refurbishing the grandstands, press-box, locker rooms, roof and main entrance 
to the park. Future plans include establishing a Museum of Southern Baseball. 
Since 2011 Play at the Plate Baseball has held an annual 3 day adult baseball 
tournament with 4 teams from various regions of the country participating. 
The event is usually held in June. ESPN Classic broadcast a re-enactment 
of a Negro League game played at Rickwood on February 26, 2006. It featured 
teams wearing the uniforms of the fictitious "Bristol Barnstormers" (named 
for ESPN's hometown of Bristol, Connecticut) and the Birmingham Black Barons.
