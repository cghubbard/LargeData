Rinku Singh (born August 8, 1988 in Lucknow, India) is a left-handed baseball 
pitcher with the Pittsburgh Pirates organization. Singh was signed by the 
Pittsburgh Pirates organization after he won a pitching contest on a 2008 
reality television show, The Million Dollar Arm. He was the first Indian 
to play professional baseball and has spent several seasons in the minor 
leagues, reaching as high as the AA level.[1] He is the subject of the 
movie Million Dollar Arm. Singh grew up in poverty, the son of a truck 
driver, in a rural village in Bhadohi.[2] Singh was one of nine siblings 
who all lived in the family's one-room house. The home had electricity 
but relied on well water. Singh threw javelin and played cricket as a child.[3] 
He was a junior national javelin medalist.[4] In early 2008, Singh entered 
an Indian reality television show, The Million Dollar Arm. The contest 
was created by American sports agent J. B. Bernstein and his partners Ash 
Vasudevan and Will Chang to find the individual in the country who could 
throw the fastest and most accurate baseball. Having never heard of baseball 
before, Singh won the contest out of over 37,000 participants after throwing 
87 miles per hour. The grand prize for the contest was $100,000.[5][6] 
After winning the contest, Singh and runner-up Dinesh Patel travelled to 
Los Angeles where they trained with University of Southern California pitching 
coach Tom House, who trained pitchers such as Nolan Ryan and Randy Johnson.[7][8] 
Singh said that most of his family did not agree with his decision to go 
to the United States.[4] On their first day in the United States the two 
attended their first baseball game at Southern California. They continued 
to learn the game from House and Bernstein, as well as learning English.[9] 
Singh, along with Patel, tried out in front of scouts from 20 Major League 
Baseball teams in November 2008, and Singh's pitches reached 92 miles per 
hour (148 km/h).[9] Reports from Pittsburgh Pirates scouts Joe Ferrone 
and Sean Campbell led to general manager Neal Huntington signing both to 
contracts with the organization. With the deal, the pair became the first 
Indians to sign American major league baseball contracts.[7][8] The total 
signing bonus for the two was $8,000.[10] After training, the two returned 
to visit their families in India before entering Pirates training camp 
in Bradenton, Florida.[9] Singh and Patel began the 2009 baseball season 
with the Pirates' Gulf Coast League affiliate.[11] On July 4, 2009, Singh 
became the first Indian citizen to appear in a professional baseball game 
in the US. He pitched the seventh inning, while Dinesh Patel pitched the 
eighth inning.[12] On July 13, 2009, Singh won his first professional baseball 
game in America, striking out the only batter he faced.[13] He finished 
the season with a 1–2 record and a 5.84 ERA in 11 games, allowing just 
one run on three hits in his final six appearances. Singh went 2–0 with 
a 2.61 ERA over 13 games with the Pirates GCL affiliate in 2010.[14] At 
the end of August, Singh was promoted to the Pirates Class A Short-Season 
affiliate, the State College Spikes.[15] He met with US President Barack 
Obama at a White House's Heritage Month event on May 24, 2010.[16] Singh 
played for the Canberra Cavalry of the Australian Baseball League for the 
competition's inaugural 2010–11 season, going 1–0 with a 3.94 ERA in 16 
innings pitched.[17] Singh opened the 2011 season in the Dominican Summer 
League. Singh pitched well in eight games spread over the DSL, Gulf Coast 
League and New York–Penn League, then joined the West Virginia Power of 
the South Atlantic League in July 2011. Singh returned to the Australian 
Baseball League for the 2011–12 season with the Adelaide Bite. He made 
the World All-Star team for the 2011 Australian Baseball League All-Star 
Game. In 2012, he pitched in a career-high 39 games for the Power, throwing 
72 innings, earning a 3–1 win–loss record and striking out 65 batters.[18] 
Singh has struggled with injuries and missed the entire 2013 season, but 
he was invited to 2014 spring training by the Pirates.[19] Singh also missed 
the entire 2014 season due to Tommy John surgery.[20] Singh also missed 
all of the 2015 season due to a broken elbow.[21][22] The Pirates re-signed 
Rinku Singh on November 9, 2015.[23] Patel and Singh's story is the basis 
for the Walt Disney Pictures sports film, Million Dollar Arm, where Singh 
was portrayed by Suraj Sharma.[24][25] In 2009, Columbia Pictures purchased 
the screen rights to the story of Singh and Patel.[26] The project stalled 
and eventually producers Joe Roth and Mark Ciardi set the film up at Walt 
Disney Pictures. Upon acquiring Million Dollar Arm, Disney hired Tom McCarthy 
to write the film.[27] Jon Hamm played J.B. Bernstein.[28][29] In 2012, 
Singh became a vegetarian after he witnessed several men in Bhadohi chasing 
a chicken in order to kill it. That year, he said that he recites the devotional 
Hanuman Chalisa and listens to Eminem's "Not Afraid" before he pitches.[4]
