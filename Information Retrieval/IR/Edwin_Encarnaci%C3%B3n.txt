Edwin Elpidio Encarnación (born January 7, 1983) is a Dominican professional 
baseball first baseman and designated hitter[1] who is a free agent. He 
has played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Cincinnati Reds (where 
he was primarily a third baseman) and the Toronto Blue Jays. Encarnación 
was born in the Dominican Republic to Elpidio Encarnación, a track and 
field coach, and Mireya Rivera. He is the third of three sons, including 
Richard and Julio, and four children, including younger sister, Evelin. 
Encarnación also had twelve half-siblings via his father. Encarnación split 
time as a high school student between his native country and Puerto Rico 
after his father took a job coaching at a Puerto Rican college. His Puerto 
Rican residence made him eligible for the Major League Baseball draft.[2] 
Encarnación was drafted by the Texas Rangers in the ninth round of the 
2000 amateur draft and signed with them. On June 15, 2001, he was traded, 
along with Rubén Mateo, to the Cincinnati Reds in exchange for pitcher 
Rob Bell. He made his big league debut on June 24, 2005 and played in 69 
games. He finished with a .232 batting average, 9 home runs, and 31 RBI.[3] 
In the 2006 season, Encarnación played 117 games for the Reds, and batted 
.276 with 15 home runs and 72 RBI.[3] Encarnación won the National League 
Player of the Week award for the week of August 7–13. During the week, 
he led the league with 4 home runs and 24 total bases, batting .440 with 
8 RBI.[4] In 2007 Encarnación started the year slowly, struggling to bat 
over .200. He was frequently benched in favor of Ryan Freel, which gave 
Josh Hamilton, who was attempting to resurrect his career after it was 
derailed by addiction to drugs and alcohol, more starts in center field. 
Encarnación was benched again at one point by then manager Jerry Narron 
for not running out a fly ball.[5] On May 10, 2007, Encarnación was demoted 
to the Reds' Triple-A affiliate in Louisville, Kentucky, the Bats. He was 
recalled to the Major Leagues on May 22, 2007. For the 2007 season, Encarnación 
batted .289 with 16 home runs and 76 RBI.[3] In 2008, Encarnación set career 
highs in games played and home runs. He batted .251 in 146 games with 26 
home runs and 68 RBI, and also struck out 102 times, the first time he 
had struck out more than 100 times in his career.[3] For the 2009 season, 
Encarnación stated that he wanted to be more consistent as a hitter who 
did not try to hit home runs in every at bat: "I want to try to stay more 
to the middle. Last year, I tried to pull too many balls and hit more homers. 
That's why my average went down. I will be more consistent as a hitter. 
I know I can do it. I've done it before. I know I can hit better than that 
and I just have to keep working".[6] Encarnación played in 43 games with 
the Reds in the 2009 season, batting just .209 with 5 home runs and 16 
RBI before being traded to Toronto.[3] Encarnación, along with right-handed 
pitchers Josh Roenicke and Zach Stewart, was traded to the Toronto Blue 
Jays for Scott Rolen on July 31, 2009. It was reported that then Blue Jays 
General Manager J. P. Ricciardi was only interested in acquiring Roenicke 
and Stewart, but Cincinnati would not accept the trade unless the Blue 
Jays also took on Encarnación. The trade was later named the number 4 best 
in season trade in Blue Jays franchise history by Gregor Chisholm.[7] Encarnación 
would play in 42 games for the Blue Jays during the 2009 season, and bat 
.240 with 8 home runs and 23 RBI.[3] During the offseason, Encarnación 
suffered first and second-degree burns to the forehead and the right side 
of his face when a rocket firecracker hit him in the jaw and exploded near 
his mouth. After initially being treated near his Dominican Republic home, 
Encarnacion was transferred to a Miami hospital. He was discharged less 
than two days after the incident.[8] Encarnación missed 30 games through 
April and May 2010 with a right arm injury, before returning on May 18, 
2010. He hit a home run in his first at bat since the injury against the 
Minnesota Twins. On May 21, he had three home runs against the Arizona 
Diamondbacks, homering in three straight at-bats.[9] On June 20, after 
a loss to the Giants, Encarnacion was optioned to Triple-A Las Vegas.[10] 
However, in a surprise move, he was designated for assignment the next 
day by the Blue Jays.[11] Encarnación was eventually assigned to Triple-A 
Las Vegas on June 23, 2010, but was later called up to the Blue Jays again 
on July 2, 2010 after a struggling performance by Encarnacion's replacement, 
Jarrett Hoffpauir.[12] He hit his 100th career home run against the Minnesota 
Twins on the last day of the season, and also became the Jays' 7th player 
of the 2010 season with 20 or more home runs. Encarnación finished the 
2010 season with a batting average of .244, 21 home runs and 51 RBI.[3] 
On November 12, 2010, Encarnacion was claimed off waivers by the Oakland 
Athletics. On December 2, he was non-tendered by the Athletics, making 
him a free agent.[13] On December 16, 2010, he signed a one-year deal with 
the Blue Jays worth $2.5 million, with a club option worth $3.5 million 
in 2012. He began 2011 season playing third base for the Blue Jays and 
struggled offensively. His numbers improved significantly after he was 
moved to the designated hitter position. In a game against the Boston Red 
Sox on September 7, 2011, Encarnacion set a new career record for doubles 
in a single season with 34. On September 22, Encarnacion hit a walk-off 
home run off the Rogers Sportsnet One sign in the 12th inning against Angels 
rookie Garrett Richards. In 2011, Encarnación batted .272 with 17 home 
runs and 55 RBI.[3] On October 31, 2011, the Jays picked up the $3.5 million 
club option for the 2012 season.[14] In a game against the Seattle Mariners 
on April 28, 2012, Encarnación hit his fourth career grand slam in the 
8th inning leading the Blue Jays to a 7-0 win.[15] His grand slam marked 
the first time that Encarnación held his arm out in his trademark "chicken-wing" 
fashion while rounding the bases.[16] On April 30, 2012, in a home game 
against the Texas Rangers, Encarnación hit the first home run off of starter 
Yu Darvish.[17] In an inter-league game against the Milwaukee Brewers on 
June 19, Encarnación hit the last of three straight solo home runs by the 
Blue Jays, following Colby Rasmus and José Bautista, the first time in 
the 2012 season that the Jays went back-to-back-to-back with home runs, 
and only the sixth time in franchise history.[18] On July 12, Encarnación 
signed a 3-year, $27 million contract extension with Toronto.[19] The deal 
includes a $10 million club option for the 2016 season.[20] On September 
13, 2012, in a home game against the Seattle Mariners, Encarnación hit 
his 40th home run of the season (off starter Félix Hernández), and recorded 
his 100th RBI of the season, marking the first time in his career that 
he had surpassed 40 home runs and 100 RBI.[21] Encarnación was unanimously 
named by the Baseball Writers' Association of America (BBWAA) as the Blue 
Jays Player of the Year on November 28, 2012. He also received the Most 
Improved Player award for the Jays.[22] On May 23, 2013, Encarnación hit 
his fifth career grand slam to give the Blue Jays an 8–3 lead over the 
Baltimore Orioles. The Jays would win the game 12–6.[23] On July 6, 2013, 
Encarnación was named to his first all-star game as a reserve designated 
hitter for the American League. Encarnación was one of four Blue Jays to 
be named, the others being José Bautista, Brett Cecil, and Steve Delabar. 
Up to the All-Star break, Encarnación posted a triple-slash of .264/.353/.532 
with 25 home runs and 72 RBI. In the All-Star Game, Encarnación entered 
as a pinch-hitter for David Ortiz in the seventh inning, and finished the 
game 0–2. In a game against the Houston Astros on July 26, 2013, Encarnación 
became only the second Blue Jay in franchise history to hit two home runs 
in one inning, joining Joe Carter who did so on October 3, 1993 – tying 
the Major League record for most home runs in an inning.[24][25] Leading 
off the 7th inning behind at 6–4, Encarnación hit a solo home run and would 
later hit his sixth career grand slam, receiving a curtain call afterwards 
as the Blue Jays would score 8 runs in the inning and lead 12–6.[26] He 
was named the American League Player of the Week on July 29, after batting 
.520 with 3 doubles, 2 home runs, and 8 RBI over the prior week.[27] Encarnación 
hit his 30th home run of the season on August 7, 2013, against the Seattle 
Mariners. In doing so, he recorded back-to-back 30 home run seasons for 
the first time in his career. Playing against the Kansas City Royals on 
August 31, 2013, Encarnación recorded his 1,000th career hit, a single 
off Kansas City starter Jeremy Guthrie. On September 2, he reached 100 
RBI for the second consecutive season on a two-run home run against Brandon 
McCarthy of the Arizona Diamondbacks. He spent time on the bench in mid 
September with a wrist injury, but made a brief comeback before being placed 
on the disabled list on September 17.[28] He underwent successful surgery 
on September 19.[29] Encarnación finished the 2013 season with a .272 average, 
36 home runs, and 104 RBI. He finished with more walks than strikeouts 
for the first time in his career, with 82 and 62 respectively.[3] Encarnación 
hit his 200th career home run on May 8, 2014, against A. J. Burnett of 
the Philadelphia Phillies.[30] On May 12, he was named the American League 
Player of the Week for May 5–11, when he recorded a league-leading 4 home 
runs and 10 RBI, and batted .321.[31] Encarnación continued his hot hitting 
in May by becoming the first player in Blue Jays franchise history to have 
4 multi home run games in a month, and the first player in the Majors to 
do so since Troy Tulowitzki in September 2010.[32] On May 26 he established 
a new club record for home runs in May by hitting his 13th off of Álex 
Colomé of the Tampa Bay Rays.[33] The following day, Encarnación tied the 
team record for home runs in any month of the season, when he hit his 14th 
to help the Blue Jays extend their winning streak to 8 games.[34] On May 
29, in a home game against the Kansas City Royals, Encarnación hit 2 more 
home runs for a total of 18 on the season and 16 in the month of May, giving 
him the Blue Jays franchise record for home runs in any month of the regular 
season. He also tied Mickey Mantle for the American League record for home 
runs in May.[35] Though he would not break his tie with Mantle in the final 
two games of May, he was unanimously selected as the Blue Jays Player of 
the Month by the Toronto chapter of the BBWAA on June 2.[36] A day later 
he was named the AL Player of the Month of May by MLB.[37] Encarnación 
hit two 3-run home runs in a win over the Cincinnati Reds on June 20, to 
take the overall lead in the Majors with 23. His 6 RBIs were a key contribution 
in helping the Blue Jays to their second-largest comeback victory in franchise 
history, being down 8–0 after the second inning and going on to win 14–9.[38] 
In total for 2014, Encarnación batted .268 with 34 home runs and 98 RBI.[39] 
On June 30, 2015, Encarnación earned 10-and-5 rights by having at least 
10 years of service time in the big-leagues, with the last 5 being on the 
same team. These rights give Encarnación the ability to veto any trade 
he would be involved in.[40] He joined fellow Blue Jay José Bautista on 
the list of active players to hold this distinction.[41] Encarnación hit 
his 250th career home run on August 6, in a 9–3 win over the Minnesota 
Twins.[42] In an 8–5 win over the Philadelphia Phillies on August 18, Encarnación 
surpassed Jesse Barfield on the Blue Jays' all-time home run list, hitting 
his 180th home run with the franchise. He also extended his hitting streak 
to a career-high 15 games.[43] Encarnación extended his hitting streak 
to 24 games on August 29, hitting 3 home runs against the Detroit Tigers, 
including his third grand slam of the season, and tied Roy Howell's franchise 
record with 9 RBI in a single game.[44][45] The following day, Encarnación 
broke the franchise record for RBI in a single month, when he hit a solo 
home run to give him 35 RBI in August.[46][47] He was named the American 
League Player of the Week on August 31, after batting .391 with 6 home 
runs and 17 RBI.[48] On September 2, Encarnación won the American League 
Player of the Month award for the second time in his career, after batting 
.407 with 11 home runs and 35 RBI in August.[49] He finished the 2015 regular 
season with a .277 batting average, 39 home runs, and 111 RBI.[3] Encarnación 
played in all 5 games of the 2015 American League Division Series, and 
batted .333 with 1 home run and 3 RBI. In the American League Championship 
Series, he hit .227 with 2 RBI in 6 games.[3] On October 27, Encarnación 
underwent successful sports hernia surgery.[50] Encarnación's $10 million 
option for 2016 was exercised by the Blue Jays on November 3.[51] Prior 
to 2016 spring training, Encarnación set an Opening Day deadline to negotiate 
a contract extension with the Blue Jays. He suffered an oblique injury 
early in the spring, and as a result did not participate in any Major League 
games. In addition, contract extension negotiations ended early, when both 
sides could not agree on the term of the contract.[52] On April 26, Encarnación 
hit his 200th home run as a member of the Blue Jays.[53] Encarnación hit 
his fourth walk-off home run as a Blue Jay on June 10, defeating the Baltimore 
Orioles 4–3 in the tenth inning. In doing so, he became the Blue Jays all-time 
leader in walk-off home runs as well as the eighth player in franchise 
history to reach 600 RBI.[54] In the first inning of a game on July 1, 
Encarnación was ejected by home plate umpire Vic Carapazza for arguing 
balls and strikes. He made contact with Carapazza after being ejected, 
and on July 3, was given a one-game suspension. He appealed the suspension, 
and dropped the appeal before the All-Star break.[55][56] On August 12, 
Encarnación hit the 300th home run of his career, joining Joe Carter, Carlos 
Delgado, and teammate José Bautista as the only players to hit their 300th 
home run with the Blue Jays franchise.[57] Encarnación recorded his 100th 
RBI of the season a 12–6 win over the New York Yankees on August 16, becoming 
the first player to reach the milestone in 2016.[58] On September 16, he 
hit his 40th home run of the season, and joined José Bautista and Carlos 
Delgado as the only Blue Jays with multiple 40-homer seasons.[59] In the 
eleventh inning of the 2016 Wild Card game, Encarnación hit a walk-off, 
three-run home run to give the Blue Jays a 5–2 victory and send them to 
the American League Division Series to face the Texas Rangers.[60] On November 
7, the Blue Jays extended a $17.2 million qualifying offer to Encarnación.[61]
