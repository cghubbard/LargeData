The Tip O'Neill Award is given annually to a Canadian baseball player who 
is "judged to have excelled in individual achievement and team contribution 
while adhering to the highest ideals of the game of baseball."[1] The award 
was created by the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame and first presented in 
1984.[1][2] It is named after James "Tip" O'Neill, one of the earliest 
Canadian stars in Major League Baseball (MLB).[1][3] Larry Walker, Jason 
Bay, Joey Votto, and Justin Morneau are the only players to win the Tip 
O'Neill Award at least three times.[4] Walker has won the award nine times,[5] 
and Votto has won it five times.[6] Three winners—Walker, Terry Puhl, and 
Rob Ducey—are members of the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame.[7] The award 
has been presented to one amateur player, Daniel Brabant.[8] Walker, Votto, 
and Justin Morneau won the MLB Most Valuable Player (MVP) Award alongside 
the Tip O'Neill Award;[9] the trio are the only Canadians to win the MLB 
MVP Award.[10] Éric Gagné, the 2002 and 2003 recipient, compiled a major 
league record of 84 consecutive save opportunities converted from 2002 
to 2004 and won the Cy Young Award in 2003.[11][12] He and John Axford 
went on to win the Rolaids Relief Man Award in the same year as the Tip 
O'Neill Award.[13] Bay became the first Canadian to win the Rookie of the 
Year Award, which he won the same year he won his first Tip O'Neill Award.[14] 
Votto is the only award winner to also win the Hank Aaron Award.[15] Initially, 
the award was presented annually at either Rogers Centre in Toronto or 
Olympic Stadium in Montreal, depending on which venue the award winner's 
team was scheduled to play at during the MLB season. However, as the Montreal 
Expos moved to Washington, D.C., and the Toronto Blue Jays do not host 
all the National League teams on an annual basis, the award has also been 
presented at the home park of the winning player.[16] Votto of the Cincinnati
