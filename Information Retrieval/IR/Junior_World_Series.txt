The Junior World Series was a postseason championship series between champions 
of two of the three highest minor league baseball leagues modeled on the 
World Series of Major League Baseball. It was called the Little World Series 
(no relation to the Little League World Series) until 1932, and also acquired 
other official names at different times. The various iterations of the 
Junior World Series were played for most of the years of the 20th century, 
off and on depending on the fortunes of the various leagues involved. Most 
often it was held between the champions of the International League (IL) 
and the American Association (AA). This left the third, and sometimes stronger, 
minor circuit called the Pacific Coast League (PCL) out of this minor league 
championship series. From 1998 to 2000, the Triple-A World Series pitted 
the IL and PCL champs (as the AA had folded in 1997). The Triple-A Baseball 
National Championship Game was established in 2006. In Game 2 of the 1956 
Junior World Series, Roger Maris set a record by getting seven runs batted 
in.[1] aThe 1919 championship series was referred to as the Junior World
