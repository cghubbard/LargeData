History People Overview Grounds Teams The St. Louis Cardinals, a professional 
baseball franchise based in St. Louis, Missouri, compete in the National 
League (NL) of Major League Baseball (MLB). After decades of early futility 
in the National League, St. Louis baseball encountered a renaissance with 
eleven World Series titles and eighteen National League pennants since 
1926.[1] Sam Breadon's purchase of the majority stake in the club in 1920 
spurred this revival; he then assumed the role as team president and assigned 
the young, enterprising Branch Rickey as his business manager, functioning 
as a prototype of today's general manager. In his tenure as owner until 
1947, Breadon's Cardinals won nine NL pennants and six World Series titles. 
During this era in Cardinals franchise history, they also totaled 2,898 
wins and 2,171 losses in the regular season for a .572 winning percentage.[2] 
After Breadon named Rickey the Cardinals' business manager, he also served 
as the in-game manager for six uneventful seasons. In 1926, Breadon replaced 
Rickey with Rogers Hornsby as the field manager to allow him to concentrate 
fully on the front office. Nicknamed The Mahatma, Rickey began to accumulate 
knowledge and master the use of scouting and player development and forged 
connections with D-League and AA teams, known as the "minor leagues." At 
this time, the minor leagues ran autonomous of the major leagues.[3] To 
acquire minor league talent, the custom for a major league team was to 
purchase the player from the minor league team either outright or bid through 
an auction. As part of a National Agreement in 1921 between the major leagues 
and minor leagues when federal judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis was hired 
as the first Commissioner of Baseball in 1920, a ban forbidding major league 
clubs from owning minor league clubs was lifted. To prevent players from 
stagnating in the minor leagues and ensure they had the opportunity to 
advance to major league clubs, Landis implemented a policy that allowed 
major league clubs to draft players who spent two consecutive seasons on 
one minor league team.[4] In 1919, Rickey purchased an eighteen percent 
stake in the Texas League club Houston Buffaloes, then acquired interests 
in players in two minor leagues and a number of other teams. From these 
connections, Rickey blueprinted and revolutionized a farm system –– an 
assembly line of young talent in the minor leagues which allowed the Cardinals 
to develop without risk of interference or losing them to other major league 
clubs.[5] His approach to "farming prospects" supplanted the practice of 
bidding to acquire top minor league players from independent teams and 
allowed control of minor leaguers and their development at little cost. 
To fund the further establishment of the Cardinals farm system, Rickey 
sold the Cardinals' ballpark, Robison Field –– which had become riddled 
with defects over the years –– and moved the club across town to Sportsman's 
Park to become tenants of their American League rivals, the Browns.[6] 
The Cardinals farm system proved so successful that it led to the franchise's 
second golden era that persisted throughout Breadon's tenure, including 
nine World Series appearances between 1926 and 1946. All other 15 major 
league clubs followed suit, and it is a practice still employed by all 
Major League teams today and other major professional sports. For this, 
Rickey is credited with expanding many of the operational and player development 
techniques that overlap what is common to today's general manager. Rickey's 
development of the Cardinals minor league system invariably did not elude 
its share of obstacles. Landis disliked the farm system model as he felt 
that it damaged the fabric of baseball by mitigating competitive gamesmanship 
for pennant races and lionizing season-long exhibition play. Soon after 
his appointment as commissioner, Landis caught owners off guard by implementing 
a policy requiring major league clubs to disclose their minor league interests. 
The primary goal of this policy was to discourage "covering up", or the 
act of major league teams switching players between two minor league clubs 
without the intention of actually promoting them in order to make them 
ineligible for the draft. Landis also censured major league clubs from 
controlling two affiliates within the same league. It was by reason of 
an arrangement in this fashion that Landis declared future Hall of Famer 
Chuck Klein a free agent upon discovering the Cardinals owned affiliates 
in Dayton and Fort Wayne that played in the same league.[3] One of Rickey's 
recruits for the Browns, George Sisler, became a major star in the early 
1920s. Outdrawing their tenants substantially, the Browns came within one 
game of the AL pennant in 1922. However, the tide was about to turn in 
the Cardinals' favor. After confidently predicting there would be a World 
Series in Sportsman's Park by 1926, Browns owner Phil Ball invested in 
extensive upgrades in its anticipation, including increasing the park's 
capacity from 18,000 to 30,000. Ball was correct––a World Series was about 
to be played in Sportsman's Park in 1926—but one of the participants did 
not include the Browns. Longtime starting pitcher Jesse Haines débuted 
with the Cardinals in 1920, registering just above 300 innings that year. 
He won 210 career games in his career and was instrumental in the Cardinals' 
World Series wins in 1926, 1931 and 1934.[7] Led by Hornsby on the field, 
winner of Triple Crowns in both 1922 and 1925, the Cardinals transformed 
into serious contenders. Nicknamed Rajah for his leadership as a player-manager, 
Hornsby took home the MVP honors in 1925, becoming the first in franchise 
history to do so. He also led the National League in batting average six 
straight seasons from 1920 to 1925, including .424 in 1924 – which has 
not been matched since – three times hit over .400, and is the only player 
to hit over 40 home runs with a .400 batting average in a season (1922).[8] 
Hornsby is generally considered the best-hitting second baseman of all 
time, and his .358 lifetime batting average is second only to Ty Cobb.[9] 
Concurrent with Hornsby's masterful hitting, St. Louis won their first 
National League pennant in 1926 and faced the powerful New York Yankees 
in a World Series that lasted seven games. Of the eight original National 
League teams, St. Louis was the last to win the league championship. Grover 
Cleveland Alexander, brought over from the Cubs in a trade earlier that 
season, won Games 2 and 6.[10] Game 7 climaxed into a scenario of near-legend 
as Hornsby summonsed him to relieve Haines with the bases loaded in the 
bottom of the seventh inning with a 3–2 lead. Likely still hung over from 
celebrating his own victory the day before, Alexander faced Tony Lazzeri, 
who scorched a long foul ball that had the distance to be a home run. However, 
Lazzeri struck out on a low-and-away curveball to end the threat.[11] It 
was also a fiercely-guarded secret that both men suffered from epilepsy.[12] 
With the Cardinals still clinging to a 3–2 lead in the bottom of the ninth, 
the Yankees again threatened. Babe Ruth drew a two-out walk but was thrown 
out attempting to steal second base to end the game, giving the Cardinals 
their first World Series win and first interleague championship in forty 
years. Due to constant conflicts, Breadon traded Hornsby to the New York 
Giants after the Cardinals' World Series win for fellow second baseman 
Frankie Frisch.[13] The 1926 NL MVP Bob O'Farrell – the first catcher to 
win an MVP – took over as player-manager, but the Cardinals fells short 
of the pennant in 1927.[14] Breadon again traded the manager after the 
season, complaining O'Farrell kept pitchers in games too long and that 
the Cardinals did not win the pennant.[15] The Cardinals claimed the next 
NL pennant in 1928, edging the powerful New York Giants by two games and 
the Chicago Cubs by four.[16] Ironically, the pitching staff completed 
83 games and Jim Bottomley won the MVP, pacing the National League with 
93 extra base hits,[10] including 31 home runs, 20 triples, and 136 RBIs.[17] 
With the Cardinals collecting momentum as a National League powerhouse, 
they created a stir in St. Louis not consistently seen since their four 
consecutive pennants in the American Association. However, the New York 
Giants and familiar rivals the Chicago Cubs showed themselves as co-adversaries 
in a newly emerging and tightly-contested NL regime. Between 1926 and 1946, 
the three teams combined for 17 of the 21 pennants.[18] The Cardinals kept 
winning in the next decade, claiming back-to-back pennants in 1930 and 
1931, with Frisch taking MVP honors in 1931. On the last day of the 1930 
season, Jay Hanna Dizzy Dean made his Major League debut, pitching a complete-game, 
three-hit shutout.[10] The 1930 Cardinals are the only team in history 
featuring all players who totaled at least 300 at-bats also batting at 
least .300, and are the last National League team to score 1,000 runs in 
a season with 1,004.[19][20] Matching up with the Philadelphia Athletics 
in both World Series, St. Louis lost in 1930 but won the 1931 series. In 
the 1931 series, Pepper Martin's 12 hits, four doubles and five stolen 
bases spurred an otherwise dismal offense.[21][22] Dean starred for the 
Cardinals as one of baseball's premier pitchers from 1932 to 1937, with 
four All-Star Games, leading the NL in wins and shutouts twice, strikeouts 
four times, complete games and innings pitched three times, while procuring 
an MVP award with two runner-up finishes.[23] He also carried a distinctive 
persona when off the mound. Dean was a robust, zany, quasi-Yogi Berra-prototype 
who uttered such memorable quotes as, "It ain't bragging if you can do 
it", "Son, what kind of pitch would you like to miss?", "He slud into third", 
"I ain't what I used to be, but who the hell is?", "The doctors x-rayed 
my head and found nothing", "The good Lord was good to me. He gave me a 
strong body, a good right arm, and a weak mind", and "It puzzles me how 
they know what corners are good for filling stations. Just how did they 
know gas and oil was under there?" His uninhibited nature and willingness 
to become a lightning rod for criticism garnered massive popularity with 
teammates, fans and media alike. After retiring as a player, Dean augmented 
even more popularity as a sportscaster and was elected to the Hall of Fame 
in 1953.[24] After a drop-off into mediocrity in 1932 and 1933, the Gashouse 
Gang took St. Louis back to the top in 1934. A collection of colorful characters 
that complemented Dean during the Great Depression, they captivated an 
audience that far surpassed St. Louis city limits "when people needed a 
diversion from hard times and economic gloom."[25] Due in part to a strong 
radio signal, St. Louis gained a status as a "regional team" with their 
locale as the southern- and western-most Major League city that lasted 
until 1955, when the Philadelphia Athletics moved to Kansas City. Coupled 
with the Cardinals' enormous success in the 1920s and 1930s in contrast 
with the Browns' dismal play, their popularity spiked. Nicknamed for their 
shabby appearances and rough tactics, the Gang featured a lineup with five 
regulars who batted over .300,[26] ushered by slugging first baseman Ripper 
Collins, who led the team in sixteen offensive categories[26] and the National 
League in home runs (35) and slugging percentage (.615).[27] He starred 
with the Cardinals from 1931 to 1936. The team was also as well known for 
its players' cartoon-character type nicknames, such as Dizzy and Daffy 
Dean, Ripper Collins, Joe Ducky Medwick, Frankie The Fordham Flash Frisch, 
Buster Mills, Pepper Martin, Kiddo Davis, Leo the Lip Durocher, and Wild 
Bill Hallahan.[28] Dean won 30 games that season, the last National Leaguer 
to reach that mark, and was awarded MVP. Combined with his brother, rookie 
Paul Dean, the Deans won 49 games (following Dizzy's spring training prediction 
of 45[29]), and pitched in 37 of the final 52 games that year.[30] The 
Cardinals won the 1934 pennant and then the World Series over the Detroit 
Tigers. Collins contributed four hits in Game 7,[31] and the Dean brothers 
again starred on the mound, combining for a 4–1 record with 28 strikeouts 
with a 1.43 ERA.[32] However, the series is also infamously known as the 
"Garbage Series", made so by Medwick's antics in the during the Cardinals 
11-0 Game 7 romp that spurred Tigers fans to throw trash and rotten fruit 
at him on the field. In the sixth inning, Medwick's hard slide into third 
baseman Marv Owen was followed by Owen stepping on his foot and a scuffle 
ensuing. When Medwick took the outfield during the bottom half of the sixth, 
the Detroit fans reacted by booing and pelting him with garbage for half 
an hour, thus prompting Commissioner Landis to order his benching for the 
rest of the game.[33] With generally competitive play and vigorous hitting 
from Medwick and first baseman Johnny Mize, the Cardinals finished as high 
as second place in 1935, 1936 and 1939, highlighted by a 96-win campaign 
in 1935.[1] The Dean brothers combined for 47 of those wins.[34] However, 
the Cubs reeled off 21 straight late-season wins –– the second-longest 
win-streak in Major League history –– to overtake the Cardinals and capture 
the NL pennant with 100 wins.[35] Medwick won the MVP and Triple Crown 
in 1937, the last National Leaguer to achieve the feat,[10] batting .374 
with 154 RBIs, 237 hits, and 56 doubles.[36] In the 1937 All-Star Game, 
Dizzy Dean broke his toe, forcing him to alter his pitching motion, which 
sapped the power on his fastball, thus precipitating the decline of his 
playing career.[37] As the Cardinals farm system continued to develop talent 
and fuel the success of the major league club, Landis remained disinclined 
to accept the procession of major league clubs developing their own minor 
league farm systems. Although his hope persisted that Rickey's plan would 
become financially burdensome or founder by some other means, Landis had 
little choice except to refrain from interference. Upon discovering that 
the Cardinals controlled multiple teams competing in the same league in 
1938, Landis released more than 70 players. As very few were likely be 
bound for the major leagues, Landis' act had little effect in slowing the 
march of Cardinals prospects to the major leagues who provided the core 
players for the Cardinals' three World Series titles the next decade.[38] 
One notable exception was Pete Reiser, whom Larry McPhail made a pact with 
Rickey to swap back. However, upon seeing Reiser's talent, McPhail reneged 
on his promise. Reiser went on to win the NL batting title with a .343 
batting average as a member the 1942 Brooklyn Dodgers. Despite Landis' 
zealous opposition toward the farm system model, his intentions –– although 
misplaced –– were in the benevolence of the game, according to Rob Neyer.[39] 
To bring the Cardinals back to the top, Breadon appointed fiery competitor 
and former outfielder Ray Blades as manager in 1939, and the team responded 
by staying in the pennant race. Emphasizing speed, the Cardinals led the 
National League in batting average (.294), runs, doubles and triples.[40] 
However, Blades' confrontational style and volatile temper proved unpopular 
with the players and press, and Breadon fired him after St. Louis lost 
24 of their first 38 games of the 1940 season.[41] By the end of the season, 
Breadon hired Billy Southworth to manage. Given a second chance with the 
Cardinals, the Cardinals responded with a third-place finish in winning 
69 of their final 109 games for a .633 winning percentage after his rehire. 
Mize broke Hornsby's club record of 42 home runs set in 1922 with 43, which 
stood until 1998 when Mark McGwire hit 70. Mize is still the Cardinals' 
single-season leader in home runs and RBIs (137 in 1940) for left-handers 
and three home run games (4).[42] At this point, Rickey's farm system burgeoned 
with another generation of mainstays who proved to be vital to an era of 
greater success that lay ahead for the Cardinals –– including Marty Marion, 
Enos Slaughter, Mort Cooper, Walker Cooper, Stan Musial, Max Lanier, Whitey 
Kurowski, Red Schoendienst and Johnny Beazley.[43] The Cardinals found 
their way back onto the World Series stage in the 1940s thanks in part 
to the promotion of their minor leaguers, including outfielder Stan Musial, 
who joined the Cardinals late in 1941. Perhaps the most accomplished player 
in franchise history, Stan The Man spent all his 22 seasons in a Cardinal 
uniform and won three NL MVP Awards, followed by a surfeit of team records, 
17 National League and 29 Major League hitting records.[44] However, his 
reputation as a fan favorite far surpassed his on-field performance many 
years after retiring: "Probably the most popular [Cardinals] player", he 
was remembered "as scandal-free", congenial in every instance, "eager to 
play", and "enjoyed doing magic tricks for kids and was fond of pulling 
a harmonica out to entertain crowds. ... Musial struck a chord with fans 
throughout America's heartland and beyond." [45] With Musial as one of 
the Cardinals' many young stars, the club embarked on one of the finest 
three-year stretches of all time, equalling or surpassing the 105-win mark 
each year from 1942 to 1944. The 1940s was one of the most successful decades 
in franchise history, as they finished with 960 wins 580 losses for a winning 
percentage higher than any other Major League team at .623. The New York 
Yankees were second at .604 and the Brooklyn Dodgers third at .581.[46] 
Except for their 1940 third-place finish, the Cardinals did not finish 
lower than second any season in the decade and claimed four NL pennants.[1] 
Southworth built on his instant success as manager, winning 97 games in 
1941 that was good for a second-place finish, due in part to revitalizing 
the platoon system.[47][48] Nicknamed the "St. Louis Swifties", the 1942 
club won a franchise-record 106 games, racing to the end by winning 43 
of their final 51 games.[1] Cooper won 22 games with a 1.78 ERA, and along 
with Beazley, headlined a pitching staff with an NL-leading 2.35 ERA and 
ERA+ rating of 135.[49] They did not let relent in the World Series, defeating 
the New York Yankees. The on-field success coincided with a disagreement 
off the field. Due to a rift with Breadon, he did not renew Rickey's contract. 
Rickey then took the general manager position of the Dodgers in 1942. Starting 
with the Cardinals when they were more than $175,000 in debt and virtual 
doormats in the National League, Rickey helped turn the team into a six-time 
pennant winner during his tenure.[5] The Cardinals followed up with 105 
wins in both 1943 and 1944. The Cardinals fell to the Yankees in the 1943 
World Series rematch. Not only did the Cardinals dominate the league and 
win the pennant in 1942, 1943 and 1944, but a different Cardinal also took 
home an MVP award each year: In 1942, it was Mort Cooper, in 1943 it was 
Musial and in 1944 Marty Marion. Despite still being tenants of the Browns, 
the Cardinals had long since become St. Louis' favorite team. They outdrew 
the Browns by such a wide margin that in some years, only the rent from 
the Cardinals kept the Browns above water. Nonetheless, Breadon chafed 
at this arrangement, and in the early 1940s made plans to build a park 
of his own. He set $5 million aside for the stadium, with a five-year deadline 
before he would be taxed on that fund.[50] The 1944 World Series saw the 
Cardinals meet their crosstown rivals, the St. Louis Browns, the "Streetcar 
Series" in the first – and so far only – all-St. Louis Word Series. The 
Cardinals prevailed for their fifth title in the first of two intrastate 
World Series in which the Cardinals have participated. In 1945, the year 
in which Musial engaged in World War II, the Cardinals produced 95 wins, 
just three games behind the NL champion Cubs. After his son was killed 
during a flight training exercise as a pilot in the USAAF in Flushing Bay, 
New York in 1945, Southworth took a then-lucrative $50,000 contract to 
manage the Boston Braves the next season, who dramatically improved.[51] 
Southworth has the highest winning percentage as a manager in modern Cardinals 
history (.642) and his career winning percentage (.597) is second in modern 
Major League history only to Joe McCarthy's .614.[52] For all-time career 
winning percentage, he is second overall to Charlie Comiskey in team history,[53] 
and fifth overall in Major League history.[54] "Every time Stan came up 
they chanted, 'Here comes the man!'" Musial's popularity proved to spread 
past St. Louis and the Midwest. It was the Brooklyn Dodgers fans during 
the June 23, 1946 game at Ebbets Field who began to call him "The Man."[55] 
St. Louis Post-Dispatch sportswriter Bob Broeg heard Dodger fans chanting 
whenever Musial came to bat, but was unable to interpret the words.[55][56] 
After the game over dinner, Broeg asked Cardinals traveling secretary Leo 
Ward if he had understood what the Dodger fans had been chanting. Ward 
responded, "Every time Stan came up they chanted, 'Here comes the man!'" 
"'That man,' you mean", Broeg countered. "No, the man", replied Ward. After 
Broeg disclosed this account in his column, Musial thereafter became known 
as Stan "The Man".[55] The Cardinals finished the 1946 season tied with 
the Dodgers, but claimed the pennant in a first-ever best-of-three playoff 
series format (2 games to 0), and first-ever playoff or tiebreaker for 
a pennant.[57] The Cardinals then claimed the World Series championship 
in seven games against the Boston Red Sox. In the bottom of the eighth 
inning of Game 7, with the score tied at 3–3, Enos Slaughter scored on 
his Mad Dash from first base on a double to shallow left-center field to 
win the game and the series.[10] After their 1946 Series win, the Cardinals 
slid back to the middle of the National League while the New York City 
clubs Brooklyn Dodgers and New York Giants loomed as National League powerhouses, 
stockpiling such stars as Jackie Robinson, Roy Campanella, Don Newcombe, 
Willie Mays and Monte Irvin. The Cardinals managed 13 winning seasons from 
1947–63, including a .612 winning percentage and 96 wins in 1949, but were 
unable to realize a first-place finish and did not make a World Series 
appearance again until 1964.[1] Spurred in part by Rickey's moves as president 
of the Dodgers, changes in racial segregation in baseball were afoot. Rickey 
promoted Robinson to become the first African-American player in the major 
leagues in six decades. Although many players—including Cardinals players—still 
taunted black players during this time, Musial and Schoendienst quietly 
gained notoriety for never doing so.[58] When several Cardinals players 
conspired a refusal to play against the Dodgers prior to Robinson's first 
game in St. Louis, Breadon, with support from National League President 
Ford Frick, threatened to suspend the malcontent players. The propositioned 
boycott desisted.[59] At the end of the 1947 season, Breadon decided to 
sell the team. He had still been unable to find land for his planned stadium, 
and was facing the prospect of having to pay taxes on his stadium fund. 
However, he would have likely had to sell the team in any event, as he 
had learned he had terminal prostate cancer. When local tax attorney and 
real estate investor Fred Saigh got word that the Cardinals were on the 
market, he met with Breadon and he made an unusual proposal: if Breadon 
sold him the team, he would not have to pay taxes on his stadium fund. 
To ease his initial reluctance to make the deal, Saigh brought in former 
Postmaster General of the United States Robert E. Hannegan as a partner. 
In late 1947, Breadon sold the club to Saigh and Hannigan for $4 million.[50][60][61] 
In addition to winning six World Series and nine NL pennants, Breadon also 
had the highest regular season winning percentage of any owner in franchise 
history at .570. His teams totaled 2,470 wins and 1,830 losses.[62] Stricken 
with heart disease in 1949, Hannegan was forced to sell his share to Saigh 
and died soon afterward, making Saigh the principal owner of the Cardinals. 
Meanwhile, Bill Veeck purchased the Browns in 1951 and implemented schemes 
aimed at driving the Cardinals out of St. Louis, despite the Cardinals 
outdrawing the Browns four-to-one.[63][64] Saigh's tenure as sole owner 
was short-lived. Several questionable tax practices—including the tax dodge 
he'd used to buy the Cardinals—came to light in April 1952, and he pleaded 
no contest to two lesser counts of tax evasion. Under pressure from Commissioner 
Frick, Saigh put the Cardinals up for sale rather than face certain expulsion 
from baseball.[50][65] For a time, no credible offers surfaced from St. 
Louis interests, and it looked like the Cardinals would indeed be forced 
to move out of town. The most promising offer came from a consortium of 
businessmen in Houston, Texas. The Cardinals owned the Houston Buffaloes 
of the Texas League; under major-league rules of the time, they also held 
the major-league rights to Houston. The only question was whether Buffalo 
Stadium could be upgraded to major-league standards.[66] However, at the 
eleventh hour, Saigh sold the Cardinals to St. Louis-based brewer Anheuser-Busch. 
Although Anheuser-Busch's price of $3.75 million was far less than what 
out-of-town suitors had put on the table, brewery president Gussie Busch 
convinced Saigh that civic pride was more important than money.[61] In 
Saigh's five seasons as owner, the Cardinals totaled 428 wins, 341 losses 
for a .557 winning percentage, the fifth-best overall regular season record 
in the Major Leagues.[67] For the next historic period, see: 1953–1989.
