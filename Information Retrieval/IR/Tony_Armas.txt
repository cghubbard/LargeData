Antonio Rafael Armas Machado (born July 2, 1953) is a Venezuelan former 
professional baseball outfielder who played in Major League Baseball. He 
is the father of pitcher Tony Armas, Jr. and the older brother of outfielder 
Marcos Armas. Armas Sr. was one of the top sluggers in the American League 
in the early 1980s. Twice he led the American League in home runs, and 
topped all of Major League Baseball in runs batted in during the 1984 season. 
He was, however, prone to injuries that affected his career. In his major 
league career, Armas went to the disabled list twelve times, missing 302 
games. Armas debuted with the Pittsburgh Pirates' Gulf Coast League affiliate 
in 1971 just shy of his eighteenth birthday. He spent six seasons in their 
farm system, batting .270 with 69 home runs when he received a September 
call-up in 1976. He appeared in four games for the Pirates, and collected 
two hits in six at-bats. During Spring training 1977, Armas, Doug Bair, 
Dave Giusti, Rick Langford, Doc Medich and Mitchell Page were dealt to 
the Oakland Athletics in exchange for Chris Batton, Phil Garner and Tommy 
Helms. Armas was the opening day right fielder for the A's in 1977, though 
by the end of the season, he was starting in center and saw most of his 
action there. Armas' inability to stay healthy limited him to just 91 games 
in 1978 and 80 in 1979. For 1980, Armas became a full-time right fielder, 
and finally played a full season, batting .279 with 35 home runs and 109 
runs batted in in 158 games. In the strike shortened 1981 season, Armas 
tied for the league lead in home runs (22) and games played (109) to be 
named the American League Player of the Year by The Sporting News. In 1982 
he set a pair of major league records with eleven putouts and twelve total 
chances in right field in a single game against the Toronto Blue Jays. 
Following the season he was traded, along with Jeff Newman, to the Boston 
Red Sox for Carney Lansford, Garry Hancock and minor leaguer Jerry King. 
In Boston, Armas became the center fielder, sharing the outfield with Jim 
Rice (LF) and Dwight Evans (RF). Although he was booed by fans for his 
low batting average (.218), he placed second in the AL with 36 home runs 
and seventh with 107 RBI. Armas had a monster 1984, batting .268 and leading 
the AL with 43 HR, 123 RBI, 77 extra-base hits, and 339 total bases. He 
was named to The Sporting News and UPI postseason AL All-Star teams, was 
Boston's co-MVP, and placed seventh in AL MVP balloting. From 1980 to 1985, 
Armas hit more homers (187) than any other AL player. His next two seasons 
were ruined by recurring leg injuries and Boston's acquisition of Dave 
Henderson. Armas was released after batting just once in the 1986 World 
Series. In the following years, he became a valuable role player for the 
Angels, and he retired after the 1989 season. Twice he finished in the 
top ten in AL Most Valuable Player award balloting (4th, 1981; 7th, 1984). 
His younger brother, outfielder Marcos Armas, had a brief stint with the 
Athletics in the 1993 season, while his son Tony Jr. pitched from 1999 
through 2008 for the Montreal Expos, Washington Nationals, Pittsburgh Pirates 
and New York Mets. Armas is the current Batting coach for the Leones del 
Caracas a team in the Venezuelan Professional Baseball League. His playing 
career in Venezuela was a stellar one. He started playing with the Leones 
and later joined the Caribes de Oriente. His 97 career home runs were the 
Venezuelan professional baseball record, before another center fielder—Robert 
Pérez "the black wall" of Cardenales de Lara—set a new mark in 2007. In 
addition, Armas is fourth in the all-time list of RBI leaders, with 412. 
In 2005, he gained induction into the Venezuelan Baseball Hall of Fame 
and Museum with 96% of the vote. He also was selected to the Caribbean
