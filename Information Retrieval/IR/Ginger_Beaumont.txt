Clarence Howeth "Ginger" Beaumont (July 23, 1876 – April 10, 1956) was 
an American center fielder in Major League Baseball who spent most of his 
career with the Pittsburgh Pirates (1899–1906) and Boston Braves (1907–09). 
He was born in Rochester, Wisconsin, and attended Beloit College. During 
the years 1900–1904 – with the Pirates winning pennants from 1901-03 – 
Beaumont led the National League in hits three times, scored 100 runs four 
times, leading the league once, and also captured the 1902 batting championship 
with a .357 mark. As the Pirates' regular leadoff hitter, he was the first 
player ever to bat in a World Series game.[1] Nicknamed "Ginger" for his 
thick red hair, he used his excellent speed to great advantage; on the 
day before his 23rd birthday in his rookie season, he had six infield singles 
and became the first player to score six runs in a game. He was also the 
first player in major league history to lead his league in hits three consecutive 
years, which has been accomplished by only five others; he led the NL in 
hits a fourth time with the 1907 Braves. Often bothered by leg injuries, 
he joined the Chicago Cubs for the 1910 season, and made pinch-hitting 
appearances in the first three games of the 1910 World Series before leaving 
the major leagues with a .311 career batting average and on base average 
of .362. He played one more season in the minor leagues before retiring 
to his Honey Creek, Wisconsin farm.[2] He was one of the first inductees 
to the Wisconsin Athletic Hall of Fame in 1951. Beaumont suffered two strokes 
in his seventies, and died at age 79 in Burlington, Wisconsin.[3] Beaumont 
has a baseball field named after him in his hometown of Burlington. His 
name also represents part of the Burlington Little League organization.
