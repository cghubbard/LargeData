Jonathan Tyler "Jon" Lester (born January 7, 1984) is an American professional 
baseball pitcher for the Chicago Cubs of Major League Baseball (MLB). He 
previously played in MLB for the Boston Red Sox from 2006 to 2014 and the 
Oakland Athletics in 2014. Less than two years after being diagnosed with 
lymphoma, Lester started and won the final game of the 2007 World Series 
for the Red Sox, and in May 2008, pitched a no-hitter against the Kansas 
City Royals. He won the 2016 World Series with the Chicago Cubs. Lester 
attended Bellarmine Preparatory School in Tacoma, Washington. Playing for 
the school's baseball team, Lester was a three-time MVP and three-time 
All-Area selection. In addition, he was named Gatorade State Player of 
the Year for Washington in 2000.[1] The Red Sox selected Lester in the 
second round, with the 57th overall selection, of the 2002 Major League 
Baseball draft and gave him the highest signing bonus of any second-rounder 
that year, $1 million.[citation needed] Lester quickly moved through the 
Red Sox organization, posting an 11–7 win–loss record, a league-leading 
2.61 earned run average (ERA) and a league-best 163 strikeouts for the 
Portland Sea Dogs of the Class AA Eastern League in 2005. He was named 
the Eastern League Pitcher of the Year and Red Sox Minor League Pitcher 
of the Year and was selected as the left-handed pitcher on the Eastern 
League's year-end All-Star team and on the year-end Topps Class AA All-Star 
squad. Lester was one of the Red Sox' top-rated prospects while in the 
minors, and other major league teams made efforts to acquire him. The Texas 
Rangers had demanded Lester be part of the proposed but ultimately rejected 
deal before the 2004 season for Alex Rodriguez.[2] The Florida Marlins 
insisted he be included in the trade for Josh Beckett before the 2006 season, 
but again, the Sox were able to keep Lester.[3] With a rash of injuries 
and general ineffectiveness of several Red Sox starters, the team recalled 
Lester on June 10 to make his major league debut against the Texas Rangers. 
He put up a 7-2 record and a 4.76 ERA in 81 1⁄3 innings pitched in his 
rookie year. On August 27, 2006, Lester was scratched from his scheduled 
start against the Oakland Athletics due to a sore back. The following day 
he was placed on the 15-day disabled list, and was sent back to Boston 
for testing. At the time, Lester's back problems were thought to be the 
result of a car crash he was involved in earlier in the month. On August 
31 it was reported that Lester had been diagnosed with enlarged lymph nodes 
and was being tested for a variety of ailments, including forms of cancer.[4] 
A few days later, doctors at Massachusetts General Hospital confirmed that 
Lester had a treatable form of anaplastic large cell lymphoma.[5] Lester 
underwent off-season chemotherapy treatments at Seattle's Fred Hutchinson 
Cancer Research Center. In December 2006, ESPN.com reported that Lester's 
latest CT Scan showed no signs of the disease, which appeared to be in 
remission. Following the successful treatment of his lymphoma, Lester was 
able to return to the Red Sox midway through the 2007 season. Lester attended 
spring training in 2007, and started the season for the class A Greenville 
Drive. Lester then started for Triple-A Pawtucket Red Sox in late April 
2007.[6] In June, Lester was removed from the disabled list, and sent to 
Pawtucket for further rehab outings.[7] Lester made his first 2007 start 
for the Boston Red Sox on July 23 against the Cleveland Indians at Jacobs 
Field in Cleveland, pitching 6 innings, allowing 2 runs on 5 hits and struck 
out 6, picking up the win. In the 2007 World Series against the Colorado 
Rockies, Lester won the series-clinching Game Four for the Red Sox, pitching 
5⅔ shutout innings, giving up three hits and three walks while collecting 
three strikeouts. Lester became the third pitcher in World Series history 
to win a series clinching game in his first post-season start. To honor 
Lester's comeback from lymphoma, the Boston Baseball Writers' Association 
of America voted him the 2007 Tony Conigliaro Award.[8] On May 19, 2008, 
Lester threw a no-hitter in a 7–0 win against the Kansas City Royals.[9] 
It was the 18th no-hitter in Red Sox history. Lester threw 130 pitches 
in the game, allowing only two walks and striking out nine batters, and 
was charged with a throwing error on a pickoff attempt in the second inning. 
It was the first no-hitter thrown by a Red Sox left-handed pitcher since 
Mel Parnell in 1956, the first in MLB since teammate Clay Buchholz in September 
2007, and the MLB-record fourth no-hitter caught by Jason Varitek. It was 
also only the second no-hitter ever pitched against the Royals; Nolan Ryan 
pitched the other in 1973.[10][11] In 2008, Lester went 16–6 with a 3.21 
ERA. Along with his no-hitter, he pitched a five-hit shutout in his first 
start at Yankee Stadium. He was named the AL Pitcher of the Month in July 
and September. Lester was also a key figure in the Red Sox' victory over 
the Angels in the American League Divisional Series, pitching 14 innings 
without allowing an earned run. Lester had the second highest winning percentage 
of all starting pitchers over the last three years (27–8, .771), and led 
the Red Sox in innings pitched in 2008 with 210.3.[12][13] Lester's losses 
in Games 3 and 7 of the 2008 ALCS were the first losses he had ever had 
in consecutive starts.[14] Lester also received the 2008 Hutch Award, given 
to the Major League player who "best exemplifies the fighting spirit and 
competitive desire" of Hutchinson.[15][16] On March 8, Lester agreed to 
a five-year , $30 million contract extension with a $14 million team option 
in 2014.[17] The season started poorly, with him allowing 11 runs and getting 
losses in his first two starts[18] This was the first time he lost in consecutive 
regular season starts. He began to pitch very well in late May, going 12-3 
with a 2.31 ERA in his final 22 starts. On June 6, Lester made his bid 
for a second no-hitter against the AL West-leading Texas Rangers at Fenway. 
He pitched 6 1⁄3 perfect innings, striking out 10 batters, on 61 pitches 
through the first six innings. Michael Young hit a one-out double to left 
center field in the seventh inning to break up the no-hitter, but Lester 
pitched a complete game, striking out a total of 11 batters, giving him 
23 Ks in two starts (he had a career-best 12 Ks his previous start). On 
August 14, Lester struck out ten batters for the sixth time in the 2009 
season, the most times ever by a Red Sox left-handed pitcher. He had never 
done it before that season. Lester started 32 games in 2009, going 15-8 
with a 3.41 ERA. Lester started Game One of the 2009 ALDS against the Los 
Angeles Angels of Anaheim, but the Red Sox lost the game 5–0 and would 
eventually be swept in the series.[19] In 2010 Lester won his final start 
in April, then won five of the six games he started in May. Lester went 
5–0 with a 1.84 ERA and 45 strikeouts and was named the American League 
Pitcher of the Month, winning the award for the third time. On June 16 
he got his 50th career win, against the Arizona Diamondbacks. Lester was 
selected to the American League All-Star team on July 1, this was his first 
selection. At the time of the break he was 11–3 with a 2.78 ERA and 124 
strikeouts. He pitched the sixth inning for the AL allowing no baserunners. 
On July 25 he took a perfect game into the sixth inning against the Seattle 
Mariners but lost it in that inning due to an error made by Eric Patterson. 
A home run by Michael Saunders broke up the no hit bid. The Red Sox eventually 
lost the game. The loss was the second of four losses in a row Lester took 
after the All-Star break. He would eventually turn it around throwing 6 
shutout innings against the Yankees and then 8 shutout innings, despite 
feeling sick, against the Rangers. Lester finished the season strong but 
fell just short of 20 wins. Lester finished the season T-4th in wins (19) 
and in 4th place in strikeouts (225) in the Majors (AL and NL combined) 
in 2010. He finished 25th in the Major Leagues with a 3.25 ERA in an above 
average year for pitchers. Lester finished fourth in voting for the 2010 
AL Cy Young Award as well. In 2011, Lester was the opening day starter 
for the Red Sox, on the road against Texas. He had a solid season, leading 
Boston's rotation in wins for the second year in a row and strikeouts for 
the third year in a row. He was named to the American League All-Star team, 
replacing Felix Hernandez, but did not pitch due to a lat injury. Lester 
struggled along with the rest of the team, losing his last three decisions, 
including giving up eight runs in a start against the New York Yankees. 
He pitched the season finale against the Baltimore Orioles, pitching six 
innings and giving up just two runs. The bullpen was unable to hold onto 
the lead, and the Red Sox were eliminated. Lester finished the season 15–9 
with a 3.41 ERA. He finished in the top 20 in strikeouts (11th), wins (10th) 
and ERA (17th). In the end of the 2011 season, Lester and two more starting 
pitchers were in a center of a controversy that told that the three (and 
sometimes more) drank alcohol during games. Many people hypothesized that 
this was part of the reason why the Red Sox went 7–20 in September and 
were eliminated on the last day of the season. Lester was the first to 
tell what really happened, and stressed that they would only drink when 
they weren't pitching for that day. Lester was the first of the three starting 
pitchers to admit to his drinking.[20] In 2012, Lester was again the opening 
day starter for the Red Sox. Lester's season was very disappointing, posting 
a 9-14 record, a sub-par 4.82 ERA, and a .273 batting average against. 
On May 10, 2013, Lester threw a complete game one-hitter, with 0 walks, 
against the Toronto Blue Jays, facing only 28 batters. Cy Young still remains 
as the last pitcher to throw a perfect game with the Red Sox, back in 1904. 
On October 3, 2013, Lester was named as the starting pitcher for the 2013 
ALDS against the Tampa Bay Rays in the Red Sox first return to the postseason 
since 2009. The following day, Game 1 of the ALDS took place at Fenway 
Park with Lester pitching 7 2⁄3 innings with three walks and striking out 
seven and the Red Sox winning 12-2 (and winning the series 3-1). Lester 
also tied Josh Beckett's Red Sox Postseason record of 4K's of the first 
four batters to begin the game. Lester started Game 1 of the 2013 ALCS 
against the Detroit Tigers on October 12, 2013. He pitched 6 1⁄3 innings 
with four strikeouts and allowed one run, but was outmatched by a one-hit 
game put together by the Tigers' pitching staff led by starter Anibal Sanchez. 
At Comerica Park on October 17, 2013, Lester again faced Sanchez in Game 
5. The Red Sox won 4-3 with Lester pitching 5 innings and showing spectacular 
defensive skills in the 5th inning throwing out former teammate Jose Iglesias 
with a glove flip to first base on a bunt attempt. After the Red Sox victory 
in the ALCS, Lester was selected to start Game 1 of the 2013 World Series 
against the St. Louis Cardinals. Lester pitched to an 8 to 1 victory over 
St. Louis starter Adam Wainwright. Lester then went on to a Game 5 win 
again over Wainwright giving the Red Sox a series lead of 3-2. The Red 
Sox won the series in six games. On May 3, 2014, Jon Lester pitched 8 one-hit 
innings against the Oakland Athletics, where he had a career-high 15 strikeouts. 
It was the most by a Red Sox pitcher since Josh Beckett in 2010. He was 
elected to his third all-star game in July 2014 after posting a 2.73 ERA 
over his first 18 starts of the season.[21] On July 31, 2014, Lester and 
Jonny Gomes were traded to the Oakland Athletics for Yoenis Cespedes and 
a competitive round 2015 draft pick. The move reunited Lester with former 
teammates Jed Lowrie, Coco Crisp, Brandon Moss and Josh Reddick.[22] He 
won his debut start against the Kansas City Royals on August 2.[23] He 
had a 6-4 record and a 2.35 ERA, while pitching for the A's. In July, Lester 
made a cameo in the Air Jordan Re2pect Commercial honoring Derek Jeter. 
Lester is shown tipping his hat to the Yankees' captain, the first to do 
so in the commercial. Lester had a 16-11 record with a 2.46 ERA and finished 
4th in the AL Cy Young voting. In December 2014, Lester agreed to a six-year, 
$155 million deal with the Chicago Cubs with a vesting option for a seventh 
year at $15 million.[24][25] Lester made his first start for the Cubs during 
opening night on April 5, 2015 against the St. Louis Cardinals. He pitched 
4.1 innings allowing 3 runs as the Cubs were shut out by the Cardinals 
3–0.[26] He finished the month of April with a record of 0–2 and an ERA 
of 6.23 in 21.2 innings pitched with 24 strikeouts and 5 base-on balls.[27] 
On May 27, 2015, matchup with the Washington Nationals, Lester hit a fly 
ball to deep center field that nearly eluded Denard Span. Span caught the 
fly ball to end the inning, bringing Lester to a record-setting 0-for-58 
to start his career.[28] On July 6, 2015, Lester recorded his first career 
major league hit against John Lackey of the St. Louis Cardinals after starting 
his career 0-for-66 as a hitter. Lester posted a 11-13 record, logging 
205 innings pitched with an ERA of 3.34 in his first year with the Chicago 
Cubs On Oct. 9, 2015 he was the losing pitcher in Game One of the NLDS 
vs. the Cardinals. On Oct. 17, 2015 he took another loss in Game One of 
the NLCS vs. the New York Mets. In 2016, Lester finished second in the 
NL with 19 wins, matching his career high. He was also second in ERA (2.44). 
Teammate Kyle Hendricks was the league leader at 2.13. Lester started Game 
1 of the 2016 NLDS against the San Francisco Giants. He earned the win 
after tossing eight scoreless innings, the Cubs would go on and win the 
series 3 games to 1. Lester also started Game 1 of the 2016 National League 
Championship Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers, he pitched six innings 
and allowed just one run and had a no-decision. He also started Game 5 
of the series and pitched 7 innings of one run ball, earning his third 
win of the postseason. The Cubs would go on and win the series 4 games 
to 2. Lester was named Co-MVP of the 2016 NLCS along with Javier Báez. 
Lester's performance helped propel the Cubs to the World Series for the 
first time since 1945. Lester was named the Game 1 starter of the 2016 
World Series against the Cleveland Indians, where he took the loss after 
throwing 5.2 innings and allowing 3 runs. Lester also started Game 5, allowing 
just 2 runs in 6 innings, leading to a 3-2 Cubs victory to extend the series. 
Lester pitched in relief in game 7, which the Cubs won to win their first 
championship in 108 years.[29] In 2015, Forbes estimated that Lester's 
annual income was $34 million.[30] Lester grew up in Puyallup, Washington 
and attended All Saints School. He later attended Bellarmine Preparatory 
School where he was a three-time MVP and three-time All-Area selection. 
On January 9, 2009, Lester married Farrah Stone Johnson,[31][32] whom he 
met in 2007, while making rehab starts in single-A Greenville.[33] They 
have two sons together. In March 2011, Lester partnered with Charity Wines 
to release his own wine label under the Longball Cellars brand. Proceeds 
from sales of his CabernAce cabernet support the Hutchinson Cancer Research 
Center, the place where Lester himself was treated, to aid the development 
of targeted immunotherapies. Funds raised from this initiative will help 
researchers maximize the body’s own ability to strike out and eliminate 
disease so lymphoma patients can extend their life. He is partnering with 
former teammate Clay Buchholz who is also releasing a Charity Wine, called 
ChardonClay, to raise money for the Jimmy Fund.[34] Lester and his wife 
Farrah established NVRQT, short for "Never Quit", in 2011 to support children 
with cancer and researchers working towards a cure.[35][36] Lester has 
written guest columns about his cause on Boston.com[37] and CNN.com.[38] 
In his free time, Lester is an avid hunter and a wine aficionado. During 
the 2015 offseason, in an attempt to woo him, the Chicago Cubs sent Lester
