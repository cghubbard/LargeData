Christopher Jon Widger (born May 21, 1971) is a former Major League Baseball 
(MLB) catcher. He played in MLB from 1995-2006 with the Seattle Mariners, 
Montreal Expos, New York Yankees, St. Louis Cardinals, Chicago White Sox 
and Baltimore Orioles. He is the current manager of the Camden Riversharks. 
A third round pick in the 1992 Major League Baseball Draft, Widger played 
for the Seattle Mariners (1995-1996, 2000), Montréal Expos (1997-2000), 
New York Yankees (2002), St. Louis Cardinals (2003), Chicago White Sox 
(2005-2006), and Baltimore Orioles (2006). On July 23, 2006, he was placed 
on waivers by the White Sox, who had acquired Sandy Alomar, Jr. to replace 
him as their backup catcher. On August 4, 2006, Widger was signed by the 
Orioles to a contract for the rest of the 2006 season. Widger played 9 
years in MLB. He established himself as an everyday player during his tenure 
with the Expos, who acquired him, along with Matt Wagner and Trey Moore 
in a trade that saw Jeff Fassero and Alex Pacheco go to the Seattle Mariners. 
After playing the 2004 season with the independent Camden Riversharks, 
Widger made it back to the MLB with the Chicago White Sox as a backup where 
he won a World Series in 2005. He played catcher, but also played at first 
base, third base, and once in the outfield. He is a graduate of George 
Mason University and Pennsville Memorial High School in Pennsville Township, 
New Jersey.[1] He served as the Camden Riversharks pitching coach from 
2012–2014, before being named the team's manager on December 5, 2014.[2]
