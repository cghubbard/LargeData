In Israel, baseball is a game that is not extremely popular, although there 
have been several attempts at changing this. There are approximately 2,000 
baseball players in Israel and Israel is ranked 42nd in the world in the 
sport.[1] Baseball was first played in the British Mandate of Palestine 
on July 4, 1927.[2] The first field in Israel was built in Kibbutz Gezer 
in 1979, and the country now has a baseball field at the Yarkon Sports 
Complex in Petach Tikva. Israel sends national teams of various age groups 
to international baseball tournaments each year. The best recent showing 
to date in International Play (Pool A) was a 1st place by the Israeli Juvenile 
(ages 10â€“12) in the 2009 European Championships (CEB). Between 500 and 
1,000 Israelis regularly play baseball in amateur league play. Baseball 
is growing at an accelerated pace, with much greater baseball identity 
associated with the country.[3] The Israel Association of Baseball (IAB), 
established in 1986, is a non-profit organization in Israel. Their goal 
is to promote and develop baseball in Israel. In order to accomplish this 
they teach baseball to youth, organize national tournaments as well as 
aid in assisting Israeli teams to compete internationally, and procuring 
the required equipment. Additionally they will help organize the league, 
ensure they have a proper field, train the coaches, umpires and player.[4] 
The IAB is a member of The Olympic Committee of Israel, The Confederation 
of European Baseball and The International Baseball Association. The above 
organization in addition to the Israel Sports Authority, recognizes the 
IAB as the sole governing body for baseball in Israel.[5] Notable players 
to play in the IAB include Alon Leichman and Dean Kremer. The following 
clubs are registered to participate in the IAB; these are mostly youth 
clubs (Senior teams have a star next to their name:) Under the authority 
of the IAB the Israel Baseball Academy launched in October 2014.[6] The 
first year's program started in mid-October at Yarkon Sports Complex in 
Petah Tikva.[6] Academy players will partake in weekly training. This will 
give them the opportunities to play in the Israel National Team Program, 
to be recognized as Elite Athletes in the IDF. The program is also recognized 
by Major League Baseball and will give them access to programs designed 
for the best young players in Europe.[7] The co-directors will be IAB National 
Director Nate Fish and National Team Coach David Schenker. Dan Rothem, 
a former college pitcher and Israel National Team player will be the pitching 
coach.[7] Each year the program plans to include 10 kids age 14-21.[7] 
In addition to the first year's participants there are 20 kids which are 
being scouted for year two.[7] Year two will start in October 2015 with 
approximately 15 kids. In 2007, the Israel Baseball League played its one 
and only season.[8] The six league teams were the Tel Aviv Lightning, Netanya 
Tigers, Bet Shemesh Blue Sox, Petach Tikva Pioneers, Modi'in Miracle, and 
Ra'anana Express.[9] All the leagues games were played at three ballparks. 
The Yarkon Sports Complex, Gezer Field, and Sportek Baseball Field.[10] 
In November 2007 it was announced that a new six-team league, the Israel 
Professional Baseball League, was taking shape, and would play its first 
season in 2008. Those behind the new league included billionaire Jeffrey 
Rosen, a major IBL investor who also owns the Maccabi Haifa basketball 
team, which he bought in the summer of 2007, and is the chairman of Triangle 
Financial Services of Aventura, Florida; Andrew Wilson, who was a facilitator 
on the ground for the IBL and now works for Rosen; Alan Gardner, a lawyer 
from New York, who was the centerfielder for the Bet Shemesh Blue Sox; 
and Michael Rollhaus, a businessman from Queens and major IBL investor.[11][12] 
Israel, was placed in the Qualifier 1 bracket with Spain, South Africa 
and France. Israel competed in their first qualifying match for the 2013 
tournament on 19 September 2012. In this game they defeated South Africa 
by a score of 7-3. Nate Freiman had two home runs in the victory.[13] Israel's 
second qualifying match was against Spain on 21 September 2012. Israel 
won the game by a score of 4-2. Nate Freiman once again homered twice for 
Israel in the victory.[14] Israel's third qualifying match was once again 
against Spain on 23 September 2012. Israel lost this game by a score of 
9-7 in 10 innings. With the victory Israel was eliminated from the tournament 
and Spain moved on to the next round.[15] Although Israel had won their 
first two games they were eliminated due to the tournaments modified double-elimination 
format. This meant that the final game was winner-take-all. In September 
2016, Israel competed in the 2017 Qualifier 4 round. Colorado Rockies coach 
Jerry Weinstein served as the manager.[16] Israel's roster included 20 
MLB-affiliated minor leaguers, making up 86% of the team, more than any 
other team in the qualifiers even before including recent Major Leaguers.[17] 
Israel won all three of their games in the qualifier, beating Great Britain 
twice[18][19] and Brazil once.[20] With the win, Israel will play in Pool 
B in South Korea in March 2017, against South Korea, Taiwan, and Netherlands.[21] 
In June 2015 Dean Kremer became the first Israeli to ever be selected in 
the Major League Baseball draft, when he was drafted by the San Diego Padres.[22] 
It was announced on July 22 that he would honor his commitment and play 
for the UNLV Rebels, which left three years on his eligibility at the time,[23] 
with the plan of playing professionally after college.[24] In the 2016 
Major League Baseball Draft, Kremer was picked in the 14th round by the 
Los Angeles Dodgers, 431 overall.[25] His signing was announced by the 
Dodgers on 16 June[26] and he made his professional debut on 3 July for 
the Ogden Raptors of the Pioneer Baseball League. Currently there are three 
main ballparks in Israel. The Yarkon Sports Complex, seating 15,000, in 
the Baptist Village in Petach Tikva, just outside Tel Aviv.[27] Gezer Field, 
about halfway between Jerusalem and Tel Aviv.[28] Sportek Baseball Field,
