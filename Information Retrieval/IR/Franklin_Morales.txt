Franklin Miguel Morales (born January 24, 1986) is a Venezuelan professional 
baseball pitcher who is a free agent. He has also played in MLB for the 
Colorado Rockies, Boston Red Sox, Kansas City Royals, and Toronto Blue 
Jays. A power-throwing left-hander, Morales made his Major League debut 
on August 18, 2007, against the Los Angeles Dodgers. He pitched 5 1⁄3 innings, 
gave up one run, but got a no-decision. In 2007, Morales was selected to 
the All-Star Futures Game at AT&T Park in San Francisco. Morales made 8 
starts in 2007 going 3-2 with a 3.43 ERA. He was also part of the Rockies' 
25-man active roster for the postseason where the team went to the World 
Series for the first time ever but lost to the Red Sox in a 4-game sweep. 
On April 29, 2008, Morales was optioned to the Colorado Rockies Triple-A 
affiliate, the Colorado Springs Sky Sox in response to a sub-par performance 
during the early 2008 Major League season. During the 2008 season, he made 
5 starts going 1-2 with a 6.39 ERA in the Majors. In spring training in 
2009, Morales led all pitchers in pickoffs, with 5, in 28 innings.[1]. 
He began the regular season in the starting rotation, but after struggling 
early he was optioned to the Triple-A Colorado Springs Sky Sox. He was 
called back up and has been pitching from the bullpen since July 7. In 
2009, Morales made 40 appearances (2 starts) going 3-2 with a 4.50 ERA. 
In 2010, Morales made 35 relief appearances going 0-4 with a 6.28 ERA. 
Morales started the 2011 season with 14 relief appearances going 0-1 with 
a 3.86 ERA. On May 19, 2011, Morales was acquired by the Boston Red Sox 
for a player to be named later or cash considerations.[1] On May 22, he 
made his debut appearance for the Red Sox in a game against the Chicago 
Cubs. Morales finished the 2011 season with Boston making 36 relief appearances 
going 1-1 with a 3.62 ERA. Overall in 2011 combined with two teams, Morales 
made a total of 50 appearances going 1-2 with a 3.69 ERA. Near the end 
of the 2012 season, Morales was injured. He was diagnosed with a shoulder 
injury. He had a starting job before September and stuck with it until 
his injury. On January 16, 2012, Morales signed a one-year deal worth $850K 
with the Red Sox, avoiding arbitration.[2] During the 2012 season, Morales 
made 37 appearances (9 starts) going 3-4 with a 3.77 ERA. In the off-season 
he trained to be a starter for 2013. In 2013, Morales made 20 appearances 
(1 start) going 2-2 with a 4.62 ERA. Morales made 3 appearances in the 
postseason. In his final appearance in a Red Sox uniform, he relieved Clay 
Buchholz in Game 6 of the ALCS. With the Red ahead 1-0 in the 6th inning 
and two inherited runners on base, Morales walked Prince Fielder on 4 pitches, 
then fell behind Victor Martinez before yielding a 2-run Wall Ball single. 
Morales was replaced by Brandon Workman who ended the inning without further 
damage. The Sox won the game when Shane Victorino hit a 7th inning grand 
slam. Morales did not pitch in the World Series as the Red Sox won the 
championship over the St. Louis Cardinals. He was traded by the Red Sox 
before the end of the year. On December 18, 2013, Morales was traded back 
to the Colorado Rockies along with minor league pitcher Chris Martin for 
utility man Jonathan Herrera.[3] After being primarily a relief pitcher 
for the Red Sox in his previous three years, Morales found his way back 
into a starting role to begin the 2014 season with the Rockies; he made 
his season debut on April 3 as the team's fourth starter, giving up 3 earned 
runs and 8 hits in 5 1⁄3 innings in a no decision against the Miami Marlins.[4][5] 
Morales signed a minor league deal with the Kansas City Royals on February 
19, 2015 and made the team out of spring training.[6] He got his first 
win with the team on April 19, throwing the final two pitches of an at 
bat to Brett Lawrie after Kelvin Herrera was ejected for throwing at Lawrie.[7] 
Morales finished the 2015 season with a 3.18 ERA and a 4-2 record in 67 
relief appearances. With the Royals finishing the season 95-67, the team 
clinched the AL Central and eventually won the 2015 World Series against 
the New York Mets, their first championship in 30 years. It was the second 
championship Morales won in his career. On March 4, 2016, Morales signed 
a minor league deal with the Milwaukee Brewers with an invitation to spring 
training. He was released on March 28.[8] On April 2, 2016, Morales signed 
a one-year, $2 million contract with the Toronto Blue Jays.[9] After making 
two appearances for the Blue Jays, Morales was placed on the 15-day disabled 
list with shoulder fatigue. He was later transferred to the 60-day disabled 
list. Morales began a rehab assignment in June, and on July 22, was activated 
by the Blue Jays.[10] On August 1, Morales was designated for assignment.
