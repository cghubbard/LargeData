As player As manager Clarence Edwin "Cito" Gaston (/ˈsiːtoʊ ˈɡæstən/; born 
March 17, 1944) is a former Major League Baseball outfielder and manager. 
His major league career as a player lasted from 1967 to 1978, most notably 
for the San Diego Padres and the Atlanta Braves. He spent his entire managerial 
career with the Toronto Blue Jays, becoming the first African-American 
manager in Major League history to win a World Series title. Cito Gaston 
managed the Toronto Blue Jays from 1989 to 1997, and again from 2008 to 
2010. During this time, he managed the Blue Jays to four American League 
East division titles (1989, 1991, 1992 and 1993), two American League pennants 
(1992 and 1993) and two World Series titles (1992 and 1993). Gaston grew 
up in San Antonio and Corpus Christi, Texas, where his father was a truck 
driver. His career ambitions were either to be a truck driver like his 
father, or make it into the Major Leagues. He adopted his nickname 'Cito' 
in preference to his given name 'Clarence'. Gaston later told Toronto Blue 
Jays broadcasters that the name was taken from a Mexican-American wrestler 
he watched as a young man in Texas. Other reports state that Gaston was 
given this nickname from a friend named Carlos Thompson who thought that 
Gaston resembled a Mexican wrestler named "Cito".[1][2] As a player with 
the Atlanta Braves, he was the roommate of Hank Aaron. Gaston credits Aaron 
with teaching him "how to be a man; how to stand on my own."[3] Gaston 
has been married three times. His first marriage ended in divorce with 
Gaston citing his baseball career as the reason.[1] His second marriage 
to a Canadian woman, Denise, lasted from the early 80s to the early 2000s.[1] 
Since 2003, Gaston has been married to Lynda,[4] both residing in Oldsmar, 
Florida.[1][5] When in Toronto, Gaston lives in a downtown condominium 
which he sublets to former Toronto Maple Leafs assistant coach Tim Hunter.[5] 
Primarily a center fielder, Gaston began his decade-long playing career 
in 1967 with the Atlanta Braves, appearing in nine games. The following 
year he was selected by the San Diego Padres in the expansion draft, first 
playing for them in 1969. He had his best individual season in 1970, when 
he batted .318 (the highest batting average by a Padre prior to Tony Gwynn's 
arrival[6]) with 29 home runs, 92 runs scored and 93 RBI, and was selected 
to the National League All-Star team. The rest of Gaston's career did not 
live up to his All-Star season success. Gaston never hit more than 17 home 
runs or knocked in more than 61 runs in any season with the Padres (until 
1974) or the Braves (from 1975 until 1978).[7] In the Venezuelan Professional 
Baseball League, Cito Gaston played with the Cardenales de Lara (1967–68), 
the Navegantes del Magallanes (1968–72, 1975–76) and the Tiburones de La 
Guaira (1976–77).[8] Gaston hit 31 home runs and drove in 207 runs in 310 
games (regular season).[8] Gaston became the hitting coach for the Toronto 
Blue Jays in 1982. Gaston remained the hitting instructor until 15 May 
1989, when he took over managerial duties from Jimy Williams, when the 
team was suffering through an unexpectedly bad start. Gaston originally 
declined the offer to be manager when Williams was fired. He told Ebony 
magazine: "When I was offered the job as manager, I didn't want it. I was 
happy working as the team's hitting instructor".[3] It was only when his 
players encouraged him to take the job did he reconsider the offer. Under 
Gaston's leadership, Toronto transformed from a sub-.500 team (12–24 under 
Jimy Williams) to the eventual division winners, going 89–73 (77–49 under 
Gaston). Toronto's success under Gaston was not short-lived, as they finished 
second in the division behind Boston the following year and won the division 
again in 1991, 1992 and 1993. As a coach and manager, Gaston was considered 
a player's manager. He was a soft-spoken and steady influence during years 
that saw a large group of talented, high salaried players grace the Blue 
Jays uniform. The franchise led the Major Leagues in attendance, riding 
high from a dedicated fan base and new stadium to play in when Gaston took 
the helm. The Jays opened the SkyDome a few weeks after Gaston became manager 
and the financial success translated into major free agent signings, including 
pitcher Jack Morris, and outfielders Dave Winfield and Paul Molitor. They 
also retained core All-Stars such as Joe Carter, Devon White, Roberto Alomar 
and John Olerud. The Jays franchise won their first division title in 1985 
and before Gaston was promoted, the franchise was known for failing to 
live up to expectations. Gaston was able to take superstars and mold them 
into a team. Outfielder and World Series hero Joe Carter credits Gaston 
for the team's championships: Cito knows how to work with each individual, 
treating everyone like a human being. He knows exactly what to say, when 
to say it, what to do and how to go about doing it. When you have a manager 
like that, it makes you want to play for the guy. We'd go to war for him. 
What Cito has done for the Blue Jays can't be taken lightly.[3] Gaston 
worked with players at an individual level as a hitting instructor and 
transferred this to the job of manager. He was known for his open communication 
with his players.[9] He was a successful game strategist, effectively handling 
National League rules during World Series games in Atlanta and Philadelphia. 
In the six games the Blue Jays played in those places during World Series 
play, the Jays went 4–2, including the title clincher in Game 6 of the 
1992 World Series in Atlanta. Though the World Series victory was widely 
recognized as the first ever for a non-American team, what wasn't as widely 
known was the fact that Gaston became the first ever African-American manager 
to win a World Series. The Blue Jays followed their 1992 success with a 
repeat victory in the 1993 World Series. Gaston was the manager for two 
American League All-Star teams since he was the manager of the championship 
American League franchise in 1992 and 1993. He was criticized for selecting 
six Blue Jays to the 1993 roster, but was unapologetic, stating all six 
were World Champions and two were future Hall of Famers. In the 1993 All-Star 
Game held at Oriole Park at Camden Yards, he was criticized for not getting 
Orioles pitcher Mike Mussina into the game. Mussina got up in the ninth 
inning to warm up in the bullpen.[10] Mussina later claimed that he was 
simply doing a between-start workout, but some interpreted it was an attempt 
to force Gaston to put him into the game. As angry fans jeered in dismay, 
incredulous that Gaston would not use the popular local player and believing 
Mussina had been sent to warm up for no reason, Gaston instead allowed 
Blue Jays pitcher Duane Ward to close out the victory for the American 
League. Baltimore fans did not like this perceived snub, and T-shirts were 
sold outside of Camden Yards that season bearing the phrase, "Will Rogers 
never met Cito Gaston", referencing the famous line by Will Rogers, "I 
never met a man yet that I didn't like." Gaston's success, like that of 
the Blue Jays franchise, faded after the championship years. The World 
Series winning clubs had dissipated because of aging players, increased 
post-Series salary demands, and the failure of new ownership to raise the 
budget substantially. After Major League Baseball solved its labor problems 
in 1994, Pat Gillick and eventually Paul Beeston left the organization 
and annual attendance began to drop considerably. Yet, the Blue Jays were 
still trying to compete in the American League East and in 1997 signed 
free agent Roger Clemens. When the team could barely break the .500 mark 
all season, Gaston was fired by GM Gord Ash. He had failed to lead the 
team to a winning record since 1993 and seemed uninterested in keeping 
his position.[11] Gaston forced Ash's hand by telling his boss that he 
was taking a vacation at season's end and would not be around for the usual 
post season evaluation process. He was replaced by then-pitching coach 
Mel Queen on an interim basis for the last week of the 1997 season. Joe 
Carter wore Gaston's No. 43 on his jersey for the remainder of the season 
in part to honor him and in part to express his displeasure at his firing.[12] 
He finished his first stint as manager with a 683–636 regular season record 
and 18–16 post–season record.[13] Gaston was a final candidate for the 
Detroit Tigers manager's job in the 1999–2000[14] season and was the runner-up 
in the Chicago White Sox manager position in the 2003–2004 off season. 
Sox GM Kenny Williams, a former Blue Jays player, had Gaston as one of 
two finalists for the job but decided to hire Ozzie Guillén.[15][16] Gaston 
had several offers to rejoin major league teams as a hitting instructor, 
namely the Kansas City Royals, but declined offers. After interviewing 
unsuccessfully for several other managerial jobs, Gaston said that he would 
only manage again if he were hired directly without an interview.[17][18] 
Gaston rejoined the team as a hitting coach after the 1999 season but was 
not retained after a disappointing 2001 campaign and the sale of the franchise 
to Rogers Communications. In 2002, he was hired by the Jays for a third 
time, as special assistant to president and chief executive officer Paul 
Godfrey.[19] On June 20, 2008, Gaston was rehired as the manager of the 
Blue Jays to replace the fired John Gibbons. It was his first managerial 
job at the major-league level since being fired by the Blue Jays 11 years 
earlier—unusual for a World Series-winning manager. In his second tenure 
as manager, he succeeded in improving the team's record to the point that 
it finished over .500 after a poor start to the season under his predecessor, 
John Gibbons, that had the team in last place at the time of his rehiring. 
When Gibbons was fired, the team's record was 35–39; after Gaston and his 
coaching staff took over, the team earned a record of 51–37 for the remainder 
of the season which included a late ten-game winning streak and the Blue 
Jays finishing fourth in the American League East. On September 25, 2008, 
it was announced that Gaston had signed a two-year extension that would 
keep him as manager until 2010. He announced on October 30, 2009 that he
