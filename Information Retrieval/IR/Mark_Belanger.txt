Mark Henry Belanger (June 8, 1944 – October 6, 1998), nicknamed "The Blade,"[1] 
was an American shortstop in Major League Baseball who played almost his 
entire career with the Baltimore Orioles. A defensive standout, he won 
eight Gold Glove Awards between 1969 and 1978, leading the American League 
in assists and fielding percentage three times each, and retired with the 
highest career fielding average by an AL shortstop (.977). He set franchise 
records for career games, assists and double plays as a shortstop, all 
of which were later broken by Cal Ripken, Jr. After his playing career, 
he became an official with the Major League Baseball Players Association. 
Belanger was born in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, where he attended Pittsfield 
High School, where he played baseball and basketball. On the basketball 
court, he became the school's first 1,000-point scorer. He was recruited 
by the Orioles as an amateur in 1962, and made his debut with the club 
on August 7, 1965. He took over as the Orioles' regular shortstop in late 
1967, and held the position for over a decade. Nicknamed "The Blade" because 
of his height of 6 ft 1 in (1.85 m) and weight of only 170 lb (77 kg), 
Belanger was known as a poor hitter. In 1970 he was a Triple Crown loser 
(finishing last in the TC categories). In his eighteen seasons in the major 
leagues, Belanger hit only 20 home runs, and had a lifetime batting average 
of .228, only topping the .230 mark over a full season three times; his 
.228 average is the third-lowest of any major league player with over 5000 
career at bats, ahead of only George McBride (.218) and Ed Brinkman (.224), 
and the seventh-lowest of any non-catcher with at least 2500 at bats since 
1920. His true contribution to the team was on defense, where he earned 
a reputation as one of the best fielding shortstops ever. Receiving the 
AL Gold Glove eight times (1969, 1971, 1973–78), he was also named to the 
All-Star team in 1976. Belanger joined a select group of shortstop-second 
baseman combinations who each won Gold Gloves in the same season while 
playing together: in 1969 and 1971 with Davey Johnson, and again with Bobby 
Grich each year between 1973 and 1976 inclusive. And with Brooks Robinson 
winning at third base every year through 1975, the left side of the Orioles' 
infield was seemingly impenetrable. Despite his famously poor hitting, 
Belanger had substantial success against some of the best pitchers of his 
era, including Bert Blyleven, Nolan Ryan and Tommy John. He hit a rare 
home run in the first American League Championship Series game ever played 
in 1969, and after uncharacteristically hitting .333 in the 1970 ALCS, 
his contributions led to the Orioles' 1970 World Series victory, the team's 
second title in five years; he caught a line drive to end a 4–3 victory 
in Game 1 with the tying run on first base, and had an assist to end Game 
3. Playing in six ALCS, he set league playoff records for career games, 
putouts, assists, total chances and double plays by a shortstop, all of 
which were broken between 1998 and 2002 by Omar Vizquel and Derek Jeter. 
He was granted free agency in 1981, perhaps in response to his public criticism 
of manager Earl Weaver, and signed with the Los Angeles Dodgers for the 
1982 season, after which he retired.[2] Following Belanger's departure 
from the Orioles, former teammate Rich Dauer said, "Anyone would miss Mark 
Belanger. You're talking about the greatest shortstop in the world. He 
never put you in a bad position with his double-play throws...He'd put 
you where you should be to make the play... I never had to think out there. 
If there was any question in my mind, I'd look at Blade, and he'd have 
a finger out, pointing which way I should move.[1] Belanger served as the 
Orioles' union representative for several years. He was one of the four 
players who led negotiations during the 1981 strike. After his retirement 
as an active player he was employed by the MLB Players Association as a 
liaison to its membership. He and his wife Daryl had two homes; in Timonium, 
Maryland and Key Biscayne, Florida and had two sons, Richard and Robert.[3] 
A long-time smoker, Belanger contracted lung cancer in the late 1990s and 
died in New York City at the age of 54. He is buried in St. Joseph Cemetery,
