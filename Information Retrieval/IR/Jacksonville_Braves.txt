in Jacksonville, Florida, U.S. The Class A affiliate of the Milwaukee Braves 
Major League Baseball team, they played in the South Atlantic League (the 
"Sally League") from 1953 to 1961. They played their home games at Durkee 
Field and then Wolfson Park. The Braves were established in 1953 by Samuel 
W. Wolfson, replacing the Jacksonville Tars baseball club. They were a 
far more successful team than the Tars had been, winning the league championship 
in 1956 and making four other playoff appearances under manager Ben Geraghty. 
One of the first integrated professional baseball teams in the league and 
in Florida, the Braves fielded standout players such as Hank Aaron and 
Félix Mantilla. In 1961 an ownership deal switched up the team's major 
league affiliation, and the Braves were replaced by the Jacksonville Jets 
for the 1961 season. Two teams named the Jacksonville Tars had played in 
Jacksonville since 1926, with the last incarnation playing in the Sally 
League from 1936. The Class A affiliate of the New York Giants, the Tars 
were described as an unprofessional outfit, and played mostly losing baseball 
during their run.[1] In 1953 Jacksonville businessman Samuel W. Wolfson 
bought the Tars franchise, and signed an affiliation agreement with the 
Boston Braves (who became the Milwaukee Braves very shortly after). The 
team was reorganized and renamed the Jacksonville Braves. Wolfson retained 
manager Ben Geraghty, but little else of the Tars survived the transition.[1] 
Among the major changes included integration. Wolfson brought in black 
players from the Braves' farm system, including Hank Aaron, Félix Mantilla, 
and Horace Garner, making Jacksonville one of the first two integrated 
teams to play in the South Atlantic League.[1] As such, they were also 
one of the first teams in Florida to field black players.[2] Aaron in particular 
was a standout, and was named league MVP in 1953;[3] both he and Mantilla 
were later called up to the major leagues after their success in Jacksonville.[1] 
The Braves drew strong crowds and performed well on the field, proving 
more successful than the Tars had ever been.[1][2] They went to the South 
Atlantic League playoffs five times in eight years, advancing to the finals 
in 1953, 1954, and 1958, and winning the championship in 1956.[3] They 
were the impetus for the construction of a new stadium, which opened in 
1955 and replaced the aging Durkee Field. The new park was later named 
Wolfson Park after Samuel W. Wolfson.[4] In 1957 Wolfson, suffering from 
ill health, sold the team to a group of businessmen including Bill Terry, 
who in turn sold it to Texas millionaire Craig F. Cullinan, Jr. When Cullinan 
won a Major League Baseball expansion franchise in 1960, league rules required 
the Milwaukee Braves to pull their affiliation with Jacksonville. The Jacksonville 
Braves came to an end, and were replaced with the short-lived Jacksonville 
Jets, affiliates of Cullinan's new team, the Houston Colt .45s (now the 
Houston Astros).[1] The Jets were not nearly as successful as the Braves 
had been.[1] They played in Jacksonville for only one year before Samuel
