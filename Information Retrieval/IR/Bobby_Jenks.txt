Robert Scott "Bobby" Jenks (born March 14, 1981) is an American former 
professional baseball pitcher in Major League Baseball (MLB). According 
to the Baseball Almanac, his fastest pitch was clocked at 102 mph on August 
27, 2005, at Safeco Field. He also has a slider, changeup, and a hard, 
sharp-breaking curveball. Jenks is third all-time in saves by a pitcher 
in a White Sox uniform. Jenks was not able to play with his teammates at 
Timberlake High School, in Spirit Lake, Idaho or Inglemoor High School 
in Kenmore, Washington, because of poor grades.[1] Jenks did play his sophomore 
year of high school for Lakeland High School before Timberlake High School 
was opened in 1998. Since Jenks was ineligible to play the remaining years 
of his high school career due to poor academic performance, he played in 
the Prairie Cardinals American Legion program where he dominated as both 
a pitcher and hitter. During his final season for the Prairie Cardinals, 
Jenks had 123 strikeouts in 92 innings pitched. Jenks was drafted by the 
Anaheim Angels in the fifth round of the 2000 Major League Baseball Draft. 
In one minor league game, the radar gun clocked his fastball at 100 mph.[1] 
During his time with the Angels organization, Jenks spent much of his time 
on the disabled list because of elbow trouble. Jenks' career with the Angels 
ended when he was designated for assignment by the team in December 2004.[citation 
needed] Jenks was claimed off waivers by the Chicago White Sox for $20,000, 
and was sent to the club's Double-A affiliate, the Birmingham Barons. Jenks 
was called up to the major leagues by the White Sox on July 5, 2005.[2] 
Jenks appeared in each game of the 2005 World Series, pitching a total 
of five innings, and making the series' final pitch. He recorded saves 
in Games 1 and 4, had a blown save in Game 2, and pitched scoreless 11th 
and 12th innings in the 14-inning Game 3. Jenks and Adam Wainwright of 
the 2006 St. Louis Cardinals are the only rookie closers to earn a save 
in the clinching game of a World Series. In 2006, Jenks was selected to 
the American League All-Star team, and for the season converted 41 out 
of 45 save opportunities. Jenks was again selected to the American League 
All-Star team in 2007. On September 25, 2007, Jenks was named as one of 
10 finalist for the "DHL Presents the Major League Baseball Delivery Man 
of the Year Award". Jenks remains the only White Sox closer to record a 
save at the All-Star Game, pitching the ninth inning of the 2006 game in 
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; he and his batterymate at the game, A.J. Pierzynski, 
were among the several White Sox players who participated in that game. 
In 2007, Jenks pursued a record streak of retiring consecutive batters. 
On August 10, 2007, Jenks retired his 38th consecutive hitter, Ichiro Suzuki 
of the Seattle Mariners, to tie the American League record for most consecutive 
batters retired in a row, set by David Wells between May 12, 1998, and 
May 23, 1998, then with the New York Yankees. On August 12, 2007, in a 
game against the Seattle Mariners, Jenks retired his 41st consecutive batter,[3] 
the Mariners' Yuniesky Betancourt,[4] tying the Major League record held 
by San Francisco Giants pitcher Jim Barr, set over two games on August 
23, 1972, and August 29, 1972. On August 20, 2007, Jenks allowed a base 
hit by Kansas City Royals outfielder Joey Gathright, ending his streak 
of 41 consecutive batters retired. However, Jenks was still able to get 
a save during the game.[5] Jenks' record is unique in that the previous 
record holders were starting pitchers. Wells' achievement bookended a perfect 
game that he pitched on May 17, 1998. Barr's achievement was spread across 
two games, neither of which was a no-hitter. In contrast Jenks was perfect 
for 14 appearances over 27 days (July 17 - August 12). His teammate Mark 
Buehrle broke the record for most consecutive batters retired on July 28, 
2009 ending with 45 in a row. On January 19, 2009, Jenks avoided arbitration 
and signed a one-year $5.6 million contract.[6] On December 2, 2010, the 
White Sox declined to tender him a contract and he became a free agent.[7] 
After the 2010 season, Jenks signed a two-year, $12 million contract with 
the Boston Red Sox.[8][9] Jenks struggled for much of 2011 with injuries, 
going on the disabled list three times during the season. On September 
14, 2011 the Red Sox announced that Jenks had been diagnosed with a pulmonary 
embolism. He pitched in 19 games during the season, going 2-2 with an ERA 
of 6.32. On December 12, Jenks had another surgery, this time to remove 
bone spurs from his back. He was supposed to have only two removed. According 
to Jenks, Dr. Kirkham Wood, the head of Massachusetts General Hospital's 
orthopedic bone unit, started to remove a third bone spur and didn't finish 
it. The part Wood left in created a serrated edge that sliced Jenks' back 
open in two places, causing him to leak spinal fluid and triggering an 
infection in his spine. Jenks was forced to undergo emergency surgery on 
December 28, only two weeks after his first back procedure. Although his 
back was still sensitive from the first surgery, Jenks had no choice but 
to have emergency surgery right away. Otherwise, the infection could have 
gone all the way to his brain and possibly killed him. Due to his muscles 
being "torn open," as he put it, Jenks was bedridden for seven weeks. The 
Red Sox placed Jenks on the 60-day disabled list, and ruled him out for 
at least the first three months of the season.[10][11][12] On July 3, 2012, 
he was released by the Red Sox.[13] On March 23, 2012, Jenks was arrested
