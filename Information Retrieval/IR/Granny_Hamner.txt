Granville Wilbur Hamner (April 26, 1927 – September 12, 1993) was an American 
shortstop and second baseman in Major League Baseball. Hamner was one of 
the key players on the "Whiz Kids", the 1950 National League champion Philadelphia 
Phillies. He was born in Richmond, Virginia. Hamner (whose brother Garvin 
was also an infielder in the majors) spent 15 1⁄2 years with the Phillies, 
coming to the club as a 17-year-old during World War II and becoming one 
of the team leaders of the 1950 champions at the age of 23. A right-handed 
hitting shortstop with power, Hamner compiled more than 80 runs batted 
in four times. In the 1950 World Series, a four-game New York Yankees sweep 
dominated by Yankee pitchers, Hamner batted .429 (6 for 14) with three 
extra-base hits. In March 1952, Hamner was named captain of the Phillies 
by manager Eddie Sawyer.[1] An All-Star three years in a row, Hamner was 
the National League's starting shortstop in the 1952 All-Star Game, played 
on his home field, Shibe Park, in Philadelphia. The game was called off 
after five innings due to rain. On May 16, 1959, Hamner was traded to Cleveland, 
but he batted only .164 for the remainder of the campaign. He then became 
a manager in the minor league system of the Kansas City Athletics, reappearing 
briefly with the A's as a pitcher during the 1962 season (he had dabbled 
on the mound for the 1956-57 Phillies). But the change did not prolong 
Hamner's playing career. He briefly managed in the Phils' farm system in 
the 1970s and 1980s. In 17 major league seasons, Hamner compiled a .262 
batting average with 104 home runs. He was winless with two losses with 
an earned run average of 5.40 in seven games and 13 1⁄3 innings as a pitcher. 
In 1981, Hamner was inducted into the Virginia Sports Hall of Fame. He 
died of a heart attack at age 66 in Philadelphia. DeLuca, Duke (1972-04-18).
