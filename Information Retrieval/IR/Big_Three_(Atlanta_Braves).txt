The Big Three was a trio of Major League Baseball starting pitchers for 
the Atlanta Braves from 1993-2002. The Big Three consisted of Greg Maddux, 
Tom Glavine, and John Smoltz. The Big Three was one of the best trio of 
pitchers in Major League Baseball. The Big Three combined to win six National 
League Cy Young Awards in the 1990s. The Big Three led the Atlanta Braves 
to a 1995 World Series win. Each member of the Big Three had their jersey 
retired by the Atlanta Braves and was inducted into the Baseball Hall of 
Fame. Tom Glavine made his Major League debut on August 17, 1987 while 
John Smoltz made his Major League debut on July 23, 1988. At that time, 
Greg Maddux was playing with the Chicago Cubs. The duo of pitchers would 
get off to a poor start as Tom Glavine would have a 9-21 record, a 4.76 
ERA, and 104 strikeouts over his first two seasons, while John Smoltz had 
a 14-18 record, a 3.54 ERA, and 205 strikeouts over his first two seasons. 
Things would start to turn around after that, as Tom Glavine had a 14-8 
record, a 3.68 ERA, and 90 strikeouts in 1989 and John Smoltz had a 14-11 
record, a 3.85 ERA, and 170 strikeouts in 1990.[1][2] Their dominance would 
begin in 1991 as Tom Glavine had a NL-leading 20 wins along with a 2.55 
ERA and 192 and he would win his first Cy Young Award that season. They 
would help lead the Atlanta Braves to a West Division title and a trip 
to the NLCS that season. John Smoltz did not perform so well in the 1991 
NLCS as he posted a 0-2 record and a 2.55 ERA, while John Smoltz would 
post a 2-0 record and a 1.76 ERA, and he would pitch a complete game shutout 
in Game 7 of the NLCS against the Pittsburgh Pirates to lead the Braves 
to their first World Series appearance since 1958, and their first World 
Series appearance in Atlanta. Tom Glavine's bad postseason luck would continue 
into the World Series, as Chili Davis homered off of him in the first inning 
of Game 2 to give the Minnesota Twins a 2-0 lead. He would stay in the 
game through eight innings, but surrendered another homer to Scott Leius 
in the eighth inning, which would cost the Braves the game, as they fell 
to the Twins 3-2 and were now in a 2-0 hole in the World Series.[3] After 
the Braves won Game 3, John Smoltz took the mound in Game 4, and he would 
last seven innings and surrender two runs, and the Braves would win off 
of a sacrifice fly in the ninth inning to tie the series at 2-2.[4] Tom 
Glavine would start Game 5 and would receive the win as the Braves dominated 
the Twins by a score of 14-5 to take a 3-2 lead heading back to Minneapolis. 
After the Braves fell to the Twins 5-4 in 11 innings in Game 6, John Smoltz 
would take the mound once again in Game 7. John Smoltz would go 7.1 innings 
without surrendering a run, but that would not do for the Braves as the 
Twins would win Game 7 off of a walk-off single in the 10th inning to win 
the World Series.[5] Tom Glavine would have another dominant season in 
1992, as he posted a 20-8 record (he led the NL in wins for the second 
consecutive season), a 2.76 ERA, and 129 strikeouts to lead the Braves 
to another West Division title on 1992. John Smoltz would get things started 
in the 1992 NLCS, as he went eight innings with only surrendering one run 
for a 5-1 win over the Pirates in Game 1. The Braves would win Game 2 to 
take a 2-0 series lead heading into Pittsburgh, and then they turned to 
Tom Glavine to give the Braves a 3-0 series lead. Tom Glavine would give 
up three runs over 6.1 innings in Game 3, and the Braves would ultimately 
lose Game 3 to the Pirates by a score of 3-2.[6] John Smoltz would go to 
the mound for Game 4 and would surrender four runs over 61 innings, but 
the Braves were able to win the game 6-4 to take a 3-1 series lead in the 
NLCS.[7] After the Braves lost Game 5 7-1, the Braves turned to Tom Glavine 
to finish the series in Game 6. However, Tom Glavine would only last 1.0 
innings and would give up eight runs in the second inning and the Braves 
would not record an out in that inning before Tom Glavine was pulled out 
as the Braves got pounded by the Pirates 13-4, which meant that a Game 
7 would be needed to decide the series.[8] The Braves would turn to John 
Smoltz in Game 7 to lead the Braves to their second consecutive World Series 
appearance, but he would give up two runs over six innings which would 
put the Braves in a 2-0 hole, but the Braves scored three runs in the ninth 
inning to wiN Game 7 3-2 and advance to the 1992 World Series.[9] Tom Glavine 
would get things started in Game 1, as he pitched a complete game giving 
up only one run to give the Braves a 3-1 win over the Toronto Blue Jays 
in Game 1, which would put the Braves in front 1-0.[10] John Smoltz would 
start Game 2, where he would surrender three runs in 7.1 innings, but despite 
holding a 4-3 lead entering the ninth inning, Jeff Reardon surrendered 
two runs in the ninth inning and the Braves would lose 5-4.[11] The Braves 
would lose Game 3, and then Tom Glavine would take the mound for Game 4. 
Despite going a full eight innings while only giving up two runs in Game 
4, the Braves still lost Game 4 2-1 and would be in a 3-1 series hole.[12] 
John Smoltz would have a strong Game 5 outing surrendering only two runs 
in six innings to keep the series alive with a 7-2 win in Game 5.[13] The 
Braves would ultimately lose Game 6 4-3 in extra innings and end up losing 
the series in six games. Prior to the 1993 MLB season, the Atlanta Braves 
signed 1992 NL Cy Young Award Winner Greg Maddux from the Chicago Cubs, 
thus marking the beginning of the "Big Three" era and one of the greatest 
trio of starting pitchers in MLB history. The Big Three had a strong 1993 
season as Greg Maddux posted a 20-10 record, led the NL in ERA (2.36) along 
with 197 strikeouts[14] and would win his second straight NL Cy Young Award, 
Tom Glavine would lead the NL in wins for the third consecutive season 
as he posted a 22-6 record, and he would post a 3.20 ERA along with 120 
strikeouts,[1] and John Smoltz would post a 15-11 record, a 3.62 ERA, and 
208 strikeouts.[2] The "Big Three" helped the Atlanta Braves win the NL 
West for the third consecutive season, despite trailing the San Francisco 
Giants for most of the season. The Braves would lose Game 1 of the 1993 
NLCS to the Philadelphia Phillies 4-3 in 10 innings, and then, a pitcher 
of the "Big Three" would take the mound in each of the next three games. 
Greg Maddux took the mound for Game 2, only surrendering two runs in seven 
innings, which would lead the Braves to a 14-3 rout over the Phillies in 
Game 2 to even the series 1-1 heading to Atlanta. Tom Glavine would do 
the same thing in Game 3, which would lead the Braves to a 9-4 win over 
the Phillies to give the Braves a 2-1 series lead. John Smoltz would give 
a similar performance to teammates Maddux and Glavine in Games 2 and 3 
respectively giving up only two runs in 6.1 innings, but the Braves would 
fall to the Phillies 2-1 in Game 4 which would even the series. With none 
of the "Big Three" on the mound in Game 5, the Braves would loose 4-3 in 
10 innings. Greg Maddux could not save the Braves in Game 6 as he surrendered 
six runs in 5.2 innings which would result in the Braves falling to the 
Phillies 6-3 in Game 6 and thus, not returning to the World Series.[15] 
Greg Maddux would win his third consecutive NL Cy Young Award in the 1994 
season as he posted a 16-6 record, had a NL-leading ERA of 1.56, and struck 
out 156 batters that season. However, this strong performance would go 
for naught as the season was cut short due to the 1994â€“95 Major League 
Baseball strike. The Atlanta Braves were second in the NL East at the time 
of the strike and held the top Wild Card spot at that time. The 1995 season 
would see strong performances from the "Big Three" as Greg Maddux would 
win his fourth consecutive NL Cy Young Award with a league-leading 19-2 
record, a league-leading 1.63 ERA, and 181 strikeouts,[14] while Tom Glavine 
had a 16-7 record, a 3.08 ERA, and 127 strikeouts,[1] while John Smoltz 
had a 12-7 record, a 3.18 ERA, and 193 strikeouts,[2] which would lead 
the Atlanta Braves to a NL East title that season and the top seed in the 
NL that season. In Game 1 of the NLDS, Greg Maddux went seven innings and 
gave up three runs as the Braves would go on to beat the Colorado Rockies 
5-4 in Game 1.[16] Tom Glavine would do the same thing in Game 2, and the 
Braves would use a four-run 9th inning to win Game 2 7-4 and take a 2-0 
series lead heading home.[17] John Smoltz's turn did not go so well as 
he gave up five runs in 5.2 innings in Game 3 as the Braves would subsequently 
lose to the Rockies 7-5 in 10 innings.[18] Greg Maddux would take the mound 
in Game 4 and would allow four runs in seven innings as the Braves would 
win Game 4 10-4 to finish out the Rockies and make their fourth consecutive 
trip to the NLCS.[19] Tom Glavine would get the NLCS started by only surrendering 
one run in seven innings in Game 1 as the Braves would beat the Cincinnati 
Reds 2-1 in 11 innings. John Smoltz would only allow two runs in Game 2 
of the NLCS as the Braves would go on to win 6-2 in 10 innings. Greg Maddux 
would give the Braves another strong performance in Game 3 as he only allowed 
one run over eight innings to lead the Braves to a 5-2 win in Game 3. The 
Braves would go on to win Game 4 6-0 and they would sweep the Reds to win 
the NL Pennant and advance to the 1995 World Series. Greg Maddux would 
start the World Series strong for the Braves as he pitched a complete game 
and only surrendered two-hits in Game 1 against the Cleveland Indians as 
the Braves won the game 3-2 to take a 1-0 lead in the World Series. Tom 
Glavine would have a strong outing in Game 2 as he only gave up two runs 
and three hits in six innings to lead the Braves to a 4-3 win in Game 2 
and take a 2-0 series lead heading to Cleveland.[20] Game 3 did not go 
so well for John Smoltz as he surrendered four runs in only 2.1 innings 
as the Braves would lose 7-6 in 11 innings.[21] The Braves would end up 
winning Game 4 5-2 to take a 3-1 lead in the World Series, and then they 
would put Greg Maddux in for Game 5, in the hopes that he can close out 
the series and clinch the World Series title for the Braves. However, Greg 
Maddux would surrender four runs in seven innings as the Braves would go 
on to lose Game 5 7-4 and would have to head to Atlanta to win the World 
Series.[22] Tom Glavine would close out the World Series by only allowing 
one hit over eight innings to win Game 6 1-0 and clinch the Braves first 
World Series title on Atlanta, as Tom Glavine would be named World Series 
MVP for his efforts. The "Big Three" would have another strong season the 
following year as this time, John Smoltz would take the NL Cy Young Award 
with 26 out of 28 first-place votes, as led the league in wins with 24 
and strikeouts with 276, and also posted a 2.94 ERA and won 14 consecutive 
decisions from April 9 to June 19.[23] The "Big Three" would lead the Atlanta 
Braves to another NL East Championship and would again earn the top seed 
in the NL. John Smoltz would start off strong on the NLDS as he surrendered 
only one run in nine innings in Game 1 to lead the Braves to a 2-1 win 
over the Los Angeles Dodgers in 10 innings to take a 1-0 series lead. Greg 
Maddux would have a strong outing in Game 2 as he only surrendered two 
runs and three hits over seven innings to lead the Braves to a 3-2 win 
over the Dodgers. Tom Glavine would finish out the series strong for the 
Braves as he only allowed one run in 6.2 innings to win Game 3 5-2 and 
close out a sweep against the Dodgers. John Smoltz would have a strong 
start to the 1996 NLCS as he only gave up two runs in eight innings to 
lead the Braves to a 4-2 win over the St. Louis Cardinals in Game 1. The 
Braves would send Greg Maddux to the mound for Game 2 in the hopes of taking 
a 2-0 series lead heading to St. Louis. However, it did not go so well 
for him as he gave up eight runs over 6.2 innings as the Braves lost Game 
2 8-3 and the series would be tied 1-1 heading to St. Louis. Tom Glavine 
would take the mound for Game 3 as he would give up three runs in seven 
innings and the Braves would lose Game 3 3-2. The Braves would fall in 
a 3-1 hole after losing Game 4 4-3. John Smoltz would go seven innings 
without giving up a run in Game 5 as the Braves went on to win Game 5 14-0 
and ensure that another game would be played at Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium, 
which was scheduled to be demolished following the season. Greg Maddux 
would take advantage of the extra game in Atlanta to force a Game 7, as 
he would only allow one run in 7.2 innings in the Braves 3-1 Game 6 win. 
Tom Glavine would make a string statement in Game 7 as he pitched seven 
scoreless innings as the Braves beat the Cardinals 15-0 to win the NL Pennant 
for the second consecutive season and advance to the 1996 World Series. 
John Smoltz would get off to a strong start on the World Series as he only 
allowed one run in six innings to lead the Braves to a 12-1 rout over the 
New York Yankees in Game 1. Greg Maddux would pitch an eight inning shutout 
in Game 2 to lead the Braves to a 4-0 win in Game 2 to take a 2-0 lead 
heading to Atlanta. Tom Glavine would have another strong outing in Game 
3 as he only gave up two runs in seven innings. However, the Braves lost 
that game 5-2 as the Yankees scored three runs in the eighth inning.[24] 
The Braves would subsequently lose Game 4 at home 6-6 and the series would 
be tied 2-2. John Smoltz would go eight innings and only allow one run. 
However, despite that, the Braves still lost the game 1-0 and would be 
in a 3-2 series hole heading back to New York.[25] In Game 6, Greg Maddux 
would give up three runs over 7.2 innings as the Braves would lose Game 
6 3-2 and would end up losing the World Series in six games.[26] The "Big 
Three" had yet another strong season in 1997 as Greg Maddux had a 19-4 
record, a 2.20 ERA, and 177 strikeouts[14] while Tom Glavine had a 14-7 
record, a 2.96 ERA, and 152 strikeouts[1] and John Smoltz had a 15-12 record, 
a 3.02 ERA, and 241 strikeouts[2] to lead the Atlanta Braves to a league-best 
101-61 record. The "Big Three" would get the job done for the Braves in 
the NLDS against the Houston Astros as Greg Maddux would pitch a complete 
game in Game 1 while only allowing one run, thus resulting in a 2-1 victory 
for the Braves, Tom Glavine would allow three runs in six innings in Game 
2, but the Braves would win 13-3, and John Smoltz pitched a complete game 
in Game 3 while only allowing one run to close out a sweep of the Astros 
with a 4-1 victory and advance to the NLCS. The NLCS would not start off 
so well for Greg Maddux, as he allowed five unearned runs in Game 1 in 
six innings and the Braves would lose to the Florida Marlins 5-3.[27] Tom 
Glavine would excel in Game 2 as he allowed just one run in 7.2 innings 
to lead the Braves to a 7-1 win in Game 2 and tie the series in 1-1 heading 
to Miami. In Game 3, John Smoltz would allow five runs, including four 
in the sixth inning, in six innings and the Braves would lose 5-2. The 
Braves would win Game 4 and the Braves would be in a favorable position 
to reach the World Series with Greg Maddux and Tom Glavine scheduled to 
pitch in Games 5 and 6 respectively. Greg Maddux would last seven innings 
in Game 5 while only giving up two runs, however, the Braves would only 
score one run and would only get three hits so the Braves ended up losing 
2-1.[28] Tom Glavine would have a rough night in Game 6 as he gave up seven 
runs in 5.2 innings as the Braves would lose 7-4 and fail to reach the 
World Series.[29] The "Big Three" would be strong yet again in 1998 as 
Tom Glavine would take home his second NL Cy Young Award with a NL-leading 
20 wins, a 2.47 ERA, and 157 strikeouts,[1] Greg Maddux would lead the 
NL in ERA with a 2.22 ERA and would have a 18-9 record and 204 strikeouts 
to go along with it,[14] and John Smoltz would have a 17-3 record, a 2.90 
ERA, and 173 strikeouts[2] to lead the Braves to a league-leading 106-56 
record. John Smoltz got the Braves to a strong start in the NLDS against 
the Chicago Cubs as he only allowed one run in 7.2 innings to lead the 
Braves to a 7-1 win in Game 1. Tom Glacine would have a strong outing in 
Game 2 as he allowed just one run and three hits in seven innings as the 
Braves would score in the 9th to tie the game and win off of a walk-off 
single in the 10th and would take a 2-0 series lead.[30] Greg Maddux would 
be masterful in Game 3 as he pitched seven scoreless innings before allowing 
three consecutive singles to start the 8th inning, at which point he was 
pulled out of the game, to lead the Braves to a 7-2 victory and a their 
seventh consecutive trip to the NLCS.[31] John Smoltz and Tom Glavine got 
off to a strong start in the NLCS against the San Diego Padres as John 
Smoltz went seven innings and only gave up two runs in Game 1[32] and Tom4-2 
win in Glavine went six innings only allowing one run in Game 2,[33] but 
despite that, the Braves would still lose both games and would be in a 
2-0 hole heading to San Diego. Greg Maddux's Game 3 start would not go 
so well as he gave up two runs in just five innings as the Braves fell 
to the Padres 4-1 and would be in a 3-0 hole.[34] The Braves would stay 
alive in Game 4 with a 8-3 win and Greg Maddux would save the series in 
Game 5 as he would enter in the bottom of the 9th inning after Greg Myers 
hit a two-run homer to cut the Braves lead to 7-6 and get three outs while 
only walking one batter without allowing a hit to save the 7-6 win for 
the Braves and send the series back to Atlanta.[35] Tom Glavine's Game 
6 performance would not go so well as he allowed five runs in the 6th inning 
as the Braves would lose 5-0 and miss the World Series.[36] Although their 
stats didn't look so bright the following year, the "Big Three" still led 
the Braves to a league-best 103-59 record. Greg Maddux pitched seven strong 
innings in Game 1, only surrendering two runs, but reliever Mike Remlinger 
surrendered four runs in the ninth inning and the Braves would lose to 
the Astros 6-1.[37] The Braves would win Game 2 5-1 to even the series 
at 1-1 heading to Houston for Games 3 and 4. In Game 3, after giving up 
two runs in the first inning, Tom Glavine would go five innings without 
surrendering another run as the Braves went on to beat the Astros 5-3 in 
12 innings. In Game 4, John Smoltz would go the first seven innings only 
giving up one run and the Braves held a 7-0 lead, and then in the 8th inning, 
he gave up a three-run homer to Ken Caminiti in the 8th inning which would 
result in John Smoltz being pulled out of the Game as John Rocker would 
halt the Astros rally with three outs as the Braves won the game 7-5 and 
advanced to the NLCS for the eighth consecutive season.[38] Greg Maddux 
got off to a solid start in the NLCS against the New York Mets as he gave 
up only one run in seven innings to lead the Braves to a 4-2 win in Game 
1. John Smoltz would pitch a 1-2-3 inning in the 9th inning to seal a 4-3 
win for the Braves in Game 2 and take a 2-0 series lead heading to New 
York.[39] Tom Glavine pitched seven scoreless innings n Game 3 to lead 
the Braves to a 1-0 win over the New York Mets and put them one game away 
from advancing to the World Series. John Smoltz did his part on Game 4 
as he only allowed two runs in 7.1 innings, but Mike Remlinger could not 
seal it for the Braves as he gave up another run which ultimately cost 
them the game, as they lost 3-2.[40] After allowing two runs in the first 
inning of Game 5, Greg Maddux pitched six scoreless innings, but the game 
was tied 2-2 at that point and the Braves ultimately lost 4-3 in 15 innings.[41] 
The Braves would win Game 6 10-9 in 11 innings to win the NL Pennant and 
advance to the 1999 World Series. Greg Maddux would start the World Series 
strong as he pitched seven scoreless innings, however, he put four consecutive 
hitters on base to start the 8th inning and all four of them would score, 
which would give the Yankees a 4-1 lead and the Yankees would end up winning 
4-1.[42] After the Braves lost Game 2 7-2, Tom Glavine would end up giving 
up five runs in seven innings as the Braves lost 6-5 in ten innings and 
would now face a 3-0 hole.[43] John Smoltz would give up three runs in 
seven innings in Game 4 and the Braves would get swept in the World Series, 
as they lost Game 4 4-1.[44] The 2000 season was a rough one for the Braves, 
as John Smoltz missed the entire season due to undergoing Tommy John surgery.[45] 
However, Greg Maddux and Tom Glavine still did what they had to do to lead 
the Braves to their ninth consecutive division title, and sixth consecutive 
NL East title as Greg Maddux had a 19-9 record, a 3.00 ERA, and 190 strikeouts[14] 
and Tom Glavine had a NL-leading 21 wins, a 3.40 ERA, and 152 strikeouts.[1] 
The postseason did not go well for them as Greg Maddux gave up seven runs 
in just four innings in Game 1[46] and Tom Glavine would give up seven 
runs in just 2.1 innings in Game 2[47] and the Braves would be swept by 
the Cardinals in the 2000 NLDS and would miss the NLCS for the first time 
since 1990. The 2001 season would see some changes for the Braves as John 
Smoltz would become the Braves closer after recovering from Tommy John 
Surgery and being unable to perform as a starter, filling in for the void 
left by John Rocker, who was traded to the Indians. This would leave Greg 
Maddux and Tom Glavine as the two left in the starting rotation in the 
"Big Three". The "Big There" were able to adapt well enough to these changes 
to lead them to their 10th consecutive division title, and seventh consecutive 
NL East title. After Greg Maddux gave up three runs in six innings in Game 
1 of the NLDS against the Astros, John Smoltz pitched two strong innings 
of relief pitching as the Braves started off the NLDS with a 7-4 win over 
the Astros in Game 1.[48] Ton Glavine pitched eight scoreless innings in 
Game 2 and John Smoltz would cap it off with a scoreless 9th inning to 
lead the Braves to a 1-0 win over the Astros in Game 2 to take a 2-0 series 
lead heading home.[49] The Braves would go on to win Game 3 6-2 to advance 
to the NLCS. Greg Maddux would pitch seven strong innings in Game 1 of 
the NLCS against the Arizona Diamondbacks, only surrendering two runs, 
but the Braves would lose the game 2-0. Tom Glavine would go seven innings 
in Game 2 and only give up one run while John Smoltz would pitch a 1-2-3 
9th inning to lead the Braves to a 8-1 win in Game 2 to even the series 
heading home.[50] After the Braves lost Game 3 5-1, Greg Maddux would surrender 
six runs in just three innings as the Braves would lose 11-4 and fall one 
win away from elimination.[51] Tom Glavine would not have a strong Game 
5 either, as he allowed three runs in five innings as the Braves lost Game 
5 3-2 and would be eliminated from the postseason.[52] In what would be 
their final season together, the "Big Three" led the Braves to a 101-59 
record and their 11th consecutive division title, and their 8th consecutive 
NL East title. Tom Glavine would not pitch well in Game 1 of the NLDS against 
the Giants as he gave up eight runs in five innings as the Braves would 
lose 8-5. After the Braves won Game 2 7-3, Greg Maddux would go six innings 
while allowing two runs to lead the Braves to a 10-2 win over the Giants 
in Game 3 and put them one win away from a trip to the NLCS.[53] However, 
Tom Glavine would pitch poorly in Game 4 as he allowed seven runs in just 
2.2 innings as the Braves would lose 8-3. The Braves would end up losing 
Game 5 3-1 and would be eliminated from the postseason in the NLDS. After 
the 2002 season, Tom Glavine wound sign with the New York Mets, ending 
the Big Three's time together in Atlanta. The duo of Greg Maddux and John 
Smoltz would still be good enough to lead the Braves to a 101-61 record 
and their 12th straight division title, also their 9th consecutive NL East 
title. After the Braves lost Game 1 of the NLDS 4-2 to the Chicago Cubs 
and with the Braves leading 3-2 after the 7th inning of Game 2, John Smoltz 
would come into Game 2 and pitch two innings of only allowing one run, 
including pitching a perfect 9th inning, to lead the Braves to a 5-3 win 
in Game 2.[54] After allowing two runs in the first inning of Game 3, Greg 
Maddux would pitch five scoreless innings, but that would not do for the 
Braves as they fell to the Cubs 3-1 in Game 3.[55] John Smoltz would take 
relief duties in Game 4 and would after allowing two doubles to begin the 
bottom of the 9th inning, he would get the next three batters out to seal 
a 6-4 win for the Braves in Game 4 and force a Game 5 back in Atlanta. 
The Braves would lose Game 5 5-1 and would be eliminated from the postseason. 
Following the 2003 season, Greg Maddux would return to the Chicago Cubs 
leaving John Smoltz as the only player of the "Big Three" left with the 
Braves for the 2004 season. John Smoltz would record 44 saves in the 2004 
season to lead the Braves to their 13th consecutive division title, also 
their 10th consecutive NL East title. After the Braves lost Game 1 of the 
NLDS to the Astros 9-3, John Smoltz pitched three scoreless innings in 
relief in Game 2 to help the Braves beat the Astros 4-2.[56] After the 
Braves lost Game 3 8-5, John Smoltz pitched two scoreless innings in relief 
to lead the Braves to a 6-5 win over the Astros and force a Game 5 in Atlanta.[57] 
The Braves would lose Game 5 12-3 and would then be eliminated in the ALDS 
for the third consecutive year. John Smoltz would return to the starting 
rotation for the 2005 season and he would have a 14-7 record, a 3.06 ERA 
and 169 strikeouts to help the Braves win their 14th consecutive Division 
Title, also their 11th consecutive NL East title.[2] John Smoltz's start 
in the NLDS would go well as he would go seven innings and only give up 
one run to lead the Braves to a 7-1 win in Game 2.[58] The other games 
would not go well for the Braves as they lost the NLDS to the Astros in 
four games. John Smoltz would have another successful season the following 
year with a NL-leading 16 wins, a 3.49 ERA, and 211 strikeouts,[2] but 
that would not do for the Braves as they finished 3rd in the NL East would 
end up missing the playoffs and not winning their division for the first 
time since 1990. He would have another successful year in 2007 with a 14-8 
record, a 3.11 ERA, and 197 strikeouts,[2] but again that wouldn't do for 
the Braves as they finished 3rd in their division yet again and missed 
the playoffs for the second consecutive season. Tom Glavine would return 
to the Braves for the 2008 season, but the two of them found not get the 
Braves back into the playoffs as they finished fourth in their division 
that season. That season would be the last for Tom Glavine as he would 
undergo rehab the following season, and would be released from the Braves 
on June 3, 2009 and he would officially retire from baseball on February 
11, 2010. The 2008 season would also be John Smoltz's last season with 
the Braves as he would sign with the Boston Red Sox for the 2009 season. 
He would spend half of that season with the Red Sox, and the other half 
of that season with the Cardinals, after which, he would retire from baseball. 
Greg Maddux would spend three more seasons with the Chicago Cubs and then, 
he would be traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers in the middle of the 2006 
season. John Smoltz would then spend his final two seasons with the San 
Diego Padres and be traded again to the Dodgers in the middle of the 2008 
season, after which, he would retire from baseball. The "Big Three" was 
considered by many to be the greatest pitching-trio of all-time. All three 
pitchers would have their numbers retired by the Braves as Greg Maddux 
would have his number retired on July 31, 2009, Tom Glavine would see his 
number retired on August 6, 2010, and John Smoltz would have his number 
retired on July 8, 2012. All three pitchers would be inducted into the 
National Baseball Hall of Fame in their first year of eligibility as Greg 
Maddux and Tom Glavine would both be inducted in 2014 receiving 97.2% and 
91.9% of the possible votes respectively,[59] and John Smoltz would be 
inducted the following year receiving 82.9% of the possible votes.[60]
