The St. Louis Cardinals 1989 season was the team's 108th season in St. 
Louis, Missouri and the 98th season in the National League. The Cardinals 
went 86-76 during the season and finished 3rd in the National League East 
division. Shortstop Ozzie Smith and third baseman Terry Pendleton won Gold 
Gloves this year. On September 29, team owner August A. Busch, Jr. died 
at the age of 90. The over-achieving 1989 Cardinal team almost made the 
playoffs. Pedro Guerrero finished third in the National League MVP voting 
while leading the league with 42 doubles and finishing second in RBIs (117). 
Joe Magrane won 18 games while José DeLeón won 16 games. Milt Thompson 
played in 155 games and hit .290, mostly substituting for the injured Willie 
McGee. Vince Coleman lead the league in stolen bases for the fifth straight 
year. However, it would be the arch-rival Cubs who would claim the division 
and move on to the playoffs. Infielders Coaches Note: Pos = position; G
