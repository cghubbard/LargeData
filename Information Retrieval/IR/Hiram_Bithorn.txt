Hiram Bithorn (March 18, 1916 – December 29, 1951) was a professional right-handed 
pitcher who became the first baseball player from Puerto Rico to play in 
Major League Baseball.[1] Standing 6 foot 1 inch (1.87 m) and weighing 
about 200 pounds (90 k), Bithorn was a hard throwing pitcher who commanded 
attention when he began his delivery with a distinctive windup, raising 
his long left leg high in the air and throwing a blazing fastball toward 
home plate.[1] He was born as Hiram Gabriel Bithorn Sosa in Santurce, a 
heavily populated area in the city of San Juan, and was one of five children 
born to Waldemar G. Bithorn, a municipal employee, and María Sosa, a public 
school teacher. The Bithorn family traveled frequently to the United States. 
María taught her children English and at one time produced a radio program 
called Abuelita Borinqueña (Puerto Rican Grandmother). The young Hiram 
attended Central High School in Santurce, and his older two brothers, 11 
and 10 years his senior, encouraged and assisted in training him to become 
an athlete.[1] In 1935, Bithorn competed in the III Central American and 
Caribbean Games held in San Salvador, El Salvador, helping his Puerto Rican 
teammates bring home a silver medal in volleyball and a bronze in basketball.[1] 
By this time, he had already begun making a name for himself in baseball 
in 1932, while pitching on a team of nativos playing in the city of Guayama. 
The Puerto Ricans faced the Richmond BBC, a squad composed entirely of 
American players, including slugging first baseman and future Hall of Famer 
Johnny Mize, as the 16-year-old Bithorn led his team to a 10–1 victory 
over the visiting club.[1] Bithorn played winter ball for his home team 
Senadores de San Juan.[1] When San Juan manager Juan Torruella resigned 
only two weeks into the 1938 season, the Senadores chose 22-year-old Bithorn 
as their new skipper, making him the youngest manager in Puerto Rican Professional 
Baseball League history.[1] Within three years, Bithorn was pitching at 
Wrigley Field. Bithorn was drafted by the Chicago Cubs in September 1941 
and debuted in the Major Leagues on April 15, 1942, making history as the 
first Puerto Rican big leaguer.[2] Bithorn won nine games and lost 14 in 
his first season,[2] but he rebounded in 1943 by going 18–12 with an earned 
run average of 2.60 and completing 19 of his 30 starts,[2] leading the 
league in shutouts with seven, establishing a record for Puerto Rican pitchers 
that still stands to this day. During this time, he also formed the second 
Latin American pitcher-catcher combination along with Cuban Chico Hernández.[3] 
After his second season, Bithorn fought for the United States military 
in World War II.[2] His promising start, though, did not last once he returned 
from military service. By this moment his weight had risen to 225 pounds, 
which led to rumors that he may not have the same abilities.[2] Upon returning 
from the war, he returned to the Chicago Cubs, and went 6–5 in 1946. On 
January 25, 1947 he was purchased by the Pittsburgh Pirates only to be 
waived later. On March 22 of the same year, the Chicago White Sox selected 
him off waivers but only pitched two innings, developing a sore arm that 
ended his career. In a four-season career, Bithorn posted a 34–31 record 
with a 3.16 ERA in 105 pitching appearances (53 as a starter), including 
30 complete games, eight shutouts and five saves, striking out 185 batters 
while walking 171 in 509⅔ innings of work. At age 35, Bithorn tried to 
make a comeback in the Mexican Pacific League. He was shot by police officer 
Ambrosio Castillo Cano on December 28, 1951 in El Mante, Tamaulipas, Mexico.[2] 
Bithorn then was transferred to Ciudad Victoria's hospital, where he died 
the next day. Initially, officer Castillo Cano claimed that Bithorn was 
violent and also admitted to being part of a communist cell and that he 
was on an important mission. Eventually this argument was debunked in court 
and Castillo Cano was sentenced to eight years in prison for Bithorn's 
murder.[3] Bithorn's achievement of making it to the majors remained a 
source of pride in Puerto Rico, and he was honored in 1962 when the biggest 
ballpark on the island was built and named after him. Hiram Bithorn Stadium 
is located next to Roberto Clemente Coliseum and across the street from 
Plaza Las Américas Mall, the stadium has also hosted world championship 
boxing fights, the 1979 Pan American Games, and important musical spectacles. 
The Montreal Expos played 22 home games there in the 2003 and 2004 MLB 
seasons, while Rounds 1 and 2 of the 2006 and 2009 World Baseball Classic 
editions also were played there, including teams from Group C and Group 
D. In 2013 the World Baseball Classic Round 1, Pool C was played in the 
stadium, featuring Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, Spain and Venezuela
