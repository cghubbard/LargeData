The Reckouakie tribe of Native-Americans lived in the area that would become 
Rockville Centre until the typical mix of germs and violent expropriation 
dislocated them with the arrival of Dutch and English settlers.[10] The 
hamlet was named "Rockville Centre" in 1849, after local Methodist preacher 
and community leader Mordecai "Rock" Smith. It was incorporated as a village 
in 1893.[11] Rockville Centre emerged in the late nineteenth and early 
twentieth century as a commuter community connected to New York by the 
Long Island Rail Road.[12] In 1915, the New York Tribune went so far as 
to declare that Rockville Centre was a place in which "the average mortal 
could live happily."[13] Like many Long Island communities at the time, 
Rockville Centre's population included a considerable number of supporters 
of the Ku Klux Klan during the 1920s.[14] When the white supremacist organization 
placed a wreath at the town's memorial to its war dead in 1923, the American 
Legion removed it in protest, but the city police received so many calls 
of complaint in response that they were forced to replace the wreath.[14] 
In the late 1960s, the village of Rockville Centre received a stinging 
rebuke for its failure to maintain public housing units primarily inhabited 
by African-Americans.[15] A report from Nassau County's Human Rights Commission 
stated Rockville Centre was "at best indifferent to, if not actually in 
favor of, Negro removal."[15] Martin Luther King Jr. visited Rockville 
Centre in 1968, where he addressed a large audience at South Side Junior 
High School on 26 March 1968.[16] The Rockville Centre Post Office was 
listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989.[17] Rockville 
Centre has five public elementary schools: The Watson School, The Covert 
School, The Wilson School, The Hewitt School, and The Riverside School. 
In addition to the elementary schools, Rockville Centre also consists of 
South Side Middle School and South Side High School. The district extends 
beyond Rockville Centre's borders, including part of South Hempstead, and 
Hempstead. Covert Elementary School is located in South Hempstead. According 
to www.schooldigger.com, South Side High School ranks 116th out of 752 
schools in New York State. This is based on actual test scores. [3], In 
2012, South Side High School was ranked #22 by U.S. News & World Report's 
Best High Schools, and #2 in the state of NY. It has also consistently 
rated in Newsweek's The Top of the Class: The complete list of the 1,300 
top U.S. Schools, #42 in 2008, #44 in 2007, #32 in 2006, #45 in 2005 and 
#65 in 2003. Rockville Centre has one private K-8 Catholic day school; 
The Saint Agnes Cathedral School. The Saint Agnes Cathedral School occupies 
a single campus. The Saint Agnes Cathedral School provides a day school 
education for Kindergarten through Eighth Grade for families across Nassau 
County. The Saint Agnes Cathedral School's upper school (9–12), though 
now defunct, shared the complex at one time. The school is widely regarded 
for their consistently high-rated academic program among Long Island private 
schools, as well as their diverse secondary school placement. Notable current
