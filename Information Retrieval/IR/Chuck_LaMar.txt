Charles G. "Chuck" LaMar (born 1956) was the first general manager of the 
Tampa Bay Devil Rays franchise in American Major League Baseball, being 
hired July 19, 1995 — several months after the Tampa Bay franchise was 
awarded. It began play in the American League East Division in 1998.[1] 
Chuck grew up in Houston, Texas,[2] where his father, Chuck, Sr., was a 
coach at Willow Creek Little League.[citation needed] He attended Madison 
High School where he was a three-sport captain. He played college baseball 
at Texas Christian University. After his senior year, LaMar taught and 
coached at St. Thomas Catholic High School in Houston. During this time, 
his high school-aged brother, Dan, was selected in the first round by the 
Cincinnati Reds.[2] Larry Smith, former head coach at Texas Wesleyan University, 
tabbed LaMar to be his assistant coach when Smith took the head coaching 
job at Indiana University in the Big Ten Conference.[2] LaMar earned his 
master's degree in physical education from Indiana,[citation needed] then 
went on to become the head coach at the University of Mary Hardin-Baylor.[2] 
In 1985, Lamar left to become a full-time scout with the Cincinnati Reds.[2] 
LaMar signed the first working agreement between a Mexico and America professional 
baseball team.[citation needed] From the Reds, LaMar became the director 
of minor league operations with the Pittsburgh Pirates, holding the position 
between 1989-1990.[2] From 1990-1992, the Pirates won three National League 
East Division titles.[3] In 1991, LaMar moved to the Atlanta Braves and 
served as director of player development and scouting (through 1993),[2] 
with the team winning its division in both seasons.[4] He then served as 
assistant general manager and director of player personnel (1994-95),[2] 
working with General manager John Schuerholz during one of the most successful 
periods in Braves' history, as the club won the 1995 World Series.[4] During 
the eight seasons (1998–2005)[2] when LaMar oversaw the Devil Rays franchise, 
the expansion team compiled a 518–777 (.400) record and only once won more 
than 70 games (2004).[5] LaMar's tenure was characterized by moves such 
as trading Bobby Abreu and Dmitri Young while receiving Kevin Stocker and 
Mike Kelly in return. Those trades proved to be failures, as Abreu and 
Young went on to have successful careers. He was also responsible for signing 
Juan Guzmán, Wilson Alvarez, Wade Boggs, Roberto Hernández, and trading 
for Fred McGriff.[2] LaMar was fired on October 6, 2005 by incoming owner 
Stuart Sternberg.[6] Lamar spent the 2007 season with the Washington Nationals 
as special assistant to the general manager and national crosschecker.[7] 
In October 2007, LaMar was appointed director of professional scouting 
by the Philadelphia Phillies, later promoted to assistant general manager 
of player development & scouting in November 2008.[8] On September 6, 2011, 
Lamar resigned from the Phillies. On November 4, 2011, it was announced 
that LaMar would be joining the Toronto Blue Jays as a special assistant 
for amateur scouting.[9] LaMar resides in Rockport, Texas and is married 
with a son and two daughters.[2] LaMar has stated many times that his hero 
is Ted Williams.[citation needed] In February 2007 Deadspin guest columnist 
R.J. Anderson announced LaMaritis; a book about the LaMar reign as GM of
