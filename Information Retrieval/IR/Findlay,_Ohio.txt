one of two cities in Hancock County, along with Fostoria. Findlay is the 
second largest city in Northwest Ohio. In the War of 1812, Colonel James 
Findlay of Cincinnati built a road and a stockade to transport and shelter 
troops in the Great Black Swamp region. This stockade was named Fort Findlay 
in his honor.[8][9] At the conclusion of the war, the community of Findlay 
was born. The first town lots were laid out in 1821 by the future Ohio 
Governor Joseph Vance and Elnathan Corry. Early in its history, prior to 
the Civil War, Findlay was a stop for slaves of African descent along the 
Underground Railroad. During the 1880s, Findlay was a booming center of 
oil and natural gas production, though the supply of petroleum had dwindled 
by the early 20th century. Findlay hosted the highly competitive Ohio State 
Music Festival in 1884. A young cornet player, Warren G. Harding, and his 
Citizens' Cornet Band of Marion placed third in the competition.[10] Harding 
would go on to be elected the 29th President of the United States. On March 
31, 1892, the only known lynching in the history of Hancock County occurred 
when a mob of 1,000 men, many "respectable citizens", broke into the county 
jail in Findlay. They lynched Mr. Lytle, who had fatally injured his wife 
and two daughters with a hatchet the day before, by hanging him twice (first 
from the bridge, then a telegraph pole) and finally shooting his body over 
a dozen times. The authorities had intended to secretly convey the prisoner 
to a suburb at 1 o'clock, where a train was to have been taken for Lima, 
but their plans were frustrated by the mob.[11] In 1908, American songwriter 
Tell Taylor wrote the standard, "Down by the Old Mill Stream" while fishing 
along the Blanchard River in Findlay. The song was published in 1910. For 
three months in the early 1960s, Findlay had the distinction of being the 
only community in the world where touch-tone telephone service was available.
