Paul Frederic Simon (born October 13, 1941) is an American musician, singer-songwriter 
and actor. Simon's fame, influence, and commercial success began as part 
of the duo Simon & Garfunkel, formed in 1964 with musical partner Art Garfunkel. 
Simon wrote nearly all of the pair's songs, including three that reached 
No. 1 on the U.S. singles charts: "The Sound of Silence", "Mrs. Robinson", 
and "Bridge over Troubled Water".[1] The duo split up in 1970 at the height 
of their popularity and Simon began a successful solo career as a guitarist 
and singer-songwriter, recording three highly acclaimed albums over the 
next five years.[2] In 1986, he released Graceland, an album inspired by 
South African township music, which sold 14 million copies worldwide on 
its release and remains his most popular solo work.[3] Simon also wrote 
and starred in the film One-Trick Pony (1980) and co-wrote the Broadway 
musical The Capeman (1998) with the poet Derek Walcott.[4] Simon has earned 
twelve Grammys for his solo and collaborative work, including a Lifetime 
Achievement Award.[5] In 2001, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall 
of Fame[6] and in 2006 was selected as one of the "100 People Who Shaped 
the World" by Time magazine.[7] In 2011, Rolling Stone magazine named Simon 
as one of the 100 Greatest Guitarists.[8] In 2015, he was named as one 
of the 100 Greatest Songwriters by Rolling Stone.[9] Among many other honors, 
Simon was the first recipient of the Library of Congress's Gershwin Prize 
for Popular Song in 2007.[10] In 1986, Simon was awarded an Honorary Doctor 
of Music degree from Berklee College of Music, where he currently serves 
on the Board of Trustees.[11][12] Simon was born on October 13, 1941, in 
Newark, New Jersey, to Hungarian Jewish parents.[13][14][15] His father, 
Louis (1916–1995), was a college professor, upright bass player, and dance 
bandleader who performed under the name "Lee Sims". His mother, Belle (1910–2007), 
was an elementary school teacher. In 1945, his family moved to the Kew 
Gardens Hills section of Flushing, Queens, in New York City.[16] The musician 
Donald Fagen has described Simon's childhood as that of "a certain kind 
of New York Jew, almost a stereotype, really, to whom music and baseball 
are very important. I think it has to do with the parents. The parents 
are either immigrants or first-generation Americans who felt like outsiders, 
and assimilation was the key thought—they gravitated to black music and 
baseball looking for an alternative culture."[17] Simon, upon hearing Fagen's 
description, said it "isn't far from the truth."[17] Simon says about his 
childhood, "I was a ballplayer. I'd go on my bike, and I'd hustle kids 
in stickball." He adds that his father was a New York Yankees fan: I used 
to listen to games with my father. He was a nice guy. Fun. Funny. Smart. 
He didn't play with me as much as I played with my kids. He was at work 
until late at night. ... Sometimes [until] two in the morning."[17] Simon's 
musical career began after meeting Art Garfunkel when they were both 11. 
They performed in a production of Alice in Wonderland for their sixth-grade 
graduation, and began singing together when they were 13,[18] occasionally 
performing at school dances. Their idols were the Everly Brothers, whom 
they imitated in their use of close two-part harmony. Simon also developed 
an interest in jazz, folk, and blues, especially in the music of Woody 
Guthrie and Lead Belly. Simon's first song written for himself and Garfunkel, 
when Simon was 12 or 13, was called "The Girl for Me," and according to 
Simon became the "neighborhood hit." His father wrote the words and chords 
on paper for the boys to use. That paper became the first officially copyrighted 
Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel song, and is now in the Library of Congress. 
In 1957, in their mid-teens, they recorded the song "Hey, Schoolgirl" under 
the name Tom & Jerry, given to them by their label Big Records. The single 
reached No. 49 on the pop charts. After graduating from Forest Hills High 
School, Simon majored in English at Queens College, while Garfunkel studied 
mathematics at Columbia University in Manhattan.[17] Simon was a brother 
in the Alpha Epsilon Pi fraternity,[19] earned a degree in English literature, 
and briefly attended Brooklyn Law School after graduation, but his real 
passion was rock and roll. Between 1957 and 1964, Simon wrote, recorded, 
and released more than 30 songs, occasionally reuniting with Garfunkel 
as Tom & Jerry for some singles, including "Our Song" and "That's My Story". 
Most of the songs Simon recorded during that time were performed alone 
or with musicians other than Garfunkel. They were released on several minor 
record labels, such as Amy, Big, Hunt, King, Tribute, and Madison. He used 
several pseudonyms for these recordings, including Jerry Landis, Paul Kane, 
and True Taylor. Simon enjoyed some moderate success in recording a few 
singles as part of a group called Tico and the Triumphs, including a song 
called "Motorcycle" that reached No. 97 on the Billboard charts in 1962. 
Tico and the Triumphs released four 45s. Marty Cooper, known as Tico, sang 
lead on several of these releases. A childhood friend, Bobby Susser, children's 
songwriter, record producer, and performer, co-produced the Tico 45s with 
Simon. That year, Simon reached No. 99 on the pop charts as Jerry Landis 
with the novelty song "The Lone Teen Ranger." Both chart singles were released 
on Amy Records. In early 1964, Simon and Garfunkel got an audition with 
Columbia Records, whose executive Clive Davis was impressed enough to sign 
the duo to a contract to produce an album. Columbia decided that the two 
would be called simply "Simon & Garfunkel," abandoning the group's previous 
name "Tom and Jerry." Simon said in 2003 that this renaming as "Simon & 
Garfunkel" marked the first time artists' surnames had been used in pop 
music.[20] Simon and Garfunkel's first LP, Wednesday Morning, 3 A.M., was 
released on October 19, 1964; it consisted of 12 songs in the folk vein, 
five written by Simon. The album initially flopped. Simon moved to the 
UK to pursue a solo career, touring folk clubs and coffee houses. At the 
first club he played, the Railway Inn Folk Club in Brentwood, Essex, he 
met Kathy Chitty who became his girlfriend and inspiration for "Kathy's 
Song," "America," and others. He performed at Les Cousins in London and 
toured provincial folk clubs that exposed him to a wide range of musical 
influences. In 1965, he recorded a solo LP The Paul Simon Songbook in Britain. 
While in the UK, Simon co-wrote several songs with Bruce Woodley of the 
Australian pop group the Seekers, including "I Wish You Could Be Here," 
"Cloudy," and "Red Rubber Ball." Woodley's co-author credit was omitted 
from "Cloudy" on the Parsley, Sage, Rosemary and Thyme album. The American 
group the Cyrkle recorded a cover of "Red Rubber Ball" that reached No. 
2 in the U.S. Simon also contributed to the Seekers catalogue with "Someday 
One Day," which was released in March 1966, charting around the same time 
as Simon and Garfunkel's "Homeward Bound." Back on the American East Coast, 
radio stations began receiving requests for one of the Wednesday Morning 
tracks, Simon's "The Sound of Silence." Their producer, Tom Wilson, overdubbed 
the track with electric guitar, bass guitar and drums, releasing it as 
a single that eventually went to No. 1 on the U.S. pop charts.[citation 
needed] The song's success drew Simon back to the United States to reunite 
with Garfunkel. Together they recorded four more albums: Sounds of Silence; 
Parsley, Sage, Rosemary and Thyme; Bookends; and the hugely successful 
Bridge over Troubled Water. Simon and Garfunkel also contributed extensively 
to the soundtrack of the Mike Nichols film The Graduate (1967), starring 
Dustin Hoffman and Anne Bancroft. While writing "Mrs. Robinson," Simon 
originally toyed with the title "Mrs. Roosevelt". When Garfunkel reported 
this indecision over the song's name to the director, Nichols replied, 
"Don't be ridiculous! We're making a movie here! It's Mrs. Robinson!"[21] 
Simon and Garfunkel returned to the UK in the fall of 1968 and did a church 
concert appearance at Kraft Hall, which was broadcast on the BBC, and also 
featured Paul's brother Ed on a performance of the instrumental "Anji."[22] 
Simon pursued solo projects after Bridge over Troubled Water, reuniting 
occasionally with Garfunkel for various projects, such as their 1975 Top 
Ten single "My Little Town." Simon wrote it for Garfunkel, whose solo output 
Simon judged as lacking "bite." The song was included on their respective 
solo albums—Paul Simon's Still Crazy After All These Years and Garfunkel's 
Breakaway. Contrary to popular belief, the song is not autobiographical 
of Simon's early life in New York City.[23] In 1981, they reunited again 
for the famous concert in Central Park, followed by a world tour and an 
aborted reunion album, to have been entitled Think Too Much, which was 
eventually released (without Garfunkel) as Hearts and Bones. Together, 
they were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1990.[6] In 2003, 
Simon and Garfunkel reunited once again when they received a Grammy Lifetime 
Achievement Award. This reunion led to a US tour—the acclaimed "Old Friends" 
concert series—followed by a 2004 international encore that culminated 
in a free concert at the Colosseum in Rome that drew 600,000 people.[24] 
In 2005, the pair sang "Mrs. Robinson" and "Homeward Bound," plus "Bridge 
Over Troubled Water" with Aaron Neville, in the benefit concert From the 
Big Apple to The Big Easy – The Concert for New Orleans (eventually released 
as a DVD) for Hurricane Katrina victims. The pair reunited in April 2010 
in New Orleans at the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival.[25] After Simon 
and Garfunkel split in 1970, Simon began writing and recording solo material 
again. His album Paul Simon was released in January 1972, preceded by his 
first experiment with world music, the Jamaican-inspired "Mother and Child 
Reunion," considered one of the first examples of reggae by a white musician. 
The single was a hit, reaching both the American and British Top 5. The 
album received universal acclaim, with critics praising the variety of 
styles and the confessional lyrics, reaching No. 4 in the U.S. and No. 
1 in the UK and Japan. It later spawned another Top 30 hit with "Me and 
Julio Down by the Schoolyard". Simon's next project was the pop-folk album, 
There Goes Rhymin' Simon, released in May 1973. It contained some of his 
most popular and polished recordings. The lead single, "Kodachrome," was 
a No. 2 hit in America, and the follow-up, the gospel-flavored "Loves Me 
Like a Rock" was even bigger, topping the Cashbox charts. Other songs like 
the weary "American Tune" or the melancholic "Something So Right" — a tribute 
to Simon's first wife, Peggy, which received a Grammy Award nomination 
for Best Song of the Year — became standards in the musician's catalog. 
Critical and commercial reception for this second album was even stronger 
than for his debut. At the time, reviewers noted how the songs were fresh 
and unworried on the surface, while still exploring socially and politically 
conscious themes on a deeper level.[citation needed] The album reached 
No. 1 on the Cashbox album charts. As a souvenir for the tour that came 
next, in 1974 it was released as a live album, Live Rhymin', which was 
moderately successful and displayed some changes in Simon's music style, 
adopting world and religious music. Highly anticipated, Still Crazy After 
All These Years was his next album. Released in October 1975 and produced 
by Simon and Phil Ramone, it marked another departure. The mood of the 
album was darker, as he wrote and recorded it in the wake of his divorce. 
Preceded by the feel-good duet with Phoebe Snow, "Gone at Last" (a Top 
25 hit) and the Simon & Garfunkel reunion track "My Little Town" (a No. 
9 on Billboard), the album was his only No. 1 on the Billboard charts to 
date. The 18th Grammy Awards named it the Album of the Year and Simon's 
performance the year's Best Male Pop Vocal. With Simon in the forefront 
of popular music, the third single from the album, "50 Ways to Leave Your 
Lover" reached the top spot of the Billboard charts, his only single to 
reach No. 1 on this list. Also, on May 3, 1976, Simon put together a benefit 
show at Madison Square Garden to raise money for the New York Public Library. 
Phoebe Snow, Jimmy Cliff and the Brecker Brothers also performed. The concert 
produced over $30,000 for the Library. After three successful studio albums, 
Simon became less productive during the second half of the 1970s. He dabbled 
in various projects, including writing music for the film Shampoo, which 
became the music for the song "Silent Eyes" on the "Still Crazy" album, 
and acting (he was cast as Tony Lacey in Woody Allen's film Annie Hall). 
He achieved another hit in this decade, with the lead single of his 1977 
compilation, Greatest Hits, Etc., "Slip Slidin' Away," reaching No. 5 in 
the United States. In 1980 he released One-Trick Pony, his debut album 
with Warner Bros. Records and his first in almost five years. It was paired 
with the motion picture of the same name, which Simon wrote and starred 
in. Although it produced his last Top 10 hit with the upbeat "Late in the 
Evening" (also a No. 1 hit on the Radio & Records American charts), the 
album did not sell well, in a music market dominated by disco music. Simon 
released Hearts and Bones in 1983. This was a polished and confessional 
album that was eventually viewed as one of his best works, but that marked 
a lull in his commercial popularity; both the album and the lead single, 
"Allergies," missed the American Top 40. Hearts and Bones included "The 
Late Great Johnny Ace," a song partly about Johnny Ace, an American R&B 
singer, and partly about slain Beatle John Lennon. A successful U.S. solo 
tour featured Simon and his guitar, with a recording of the rhythm track 
and horns for "Late In The Evening."[citation needed] In January 1985, 
Simon lent his talent to USA for Africa and performed on the relief fundraising 
single "We Are the World." As he commented years later, after the disappointing 
commercial performance of Hearts and Bones, Simon felt he had lost his 
inspiration to a point of no return, and that his commercial fortunes were 
unlikely to change. While driving his car in late 1984 in this state of 
frustration, Simon listened to a cassette of the Boyoyo Boys' instrumental 
"Gumboots: Accordion Jive Volume II" which had been lent to him by Heidi 
Berg, a singer songwriter he was working with at the time. Lorne Michaels 
had introduced Paul to Heidi when Heidi was working as the bandleader for 
Lorne's "The New Show". Interested by the unusual sound, he wrote lyrics 
to the number, which he sang over a re-recording of the song. It was the 
first composition of a new musical project that became the Grammy-award 
winning album Graceland, a mixture of musical styles including pop, a cappella, 
isicathamiya, rock, zydeco and mbaqanga. Simon travelled to South Africa 
to embark on further recording the album. Sessions with African musicians 
took place in Johannesburg in February 1985. Overdubbing and additional 
recording was done in April 1986, in New York. The sessions featured many 
South African musicians and groups, particularly Ladysmith Black Mambazo. 
Simon also collaborated with several American artists, singing a memorable 
duet with Linda Ronstadt in "Under African Skies," and playing with Los 
Lobos in "All Around the World or The Myth of the Fingerprints." Simon 
was briefly listed on the U.N. Boycott list but removed after he had indicated 
he had not violated the cultural boycott.[26][27] Warner Bros. Records 
had serious doubts about releasing such an eclectic album to the mainstream, 
but did so in August 1986. Graceland was praised by critics and the public, 
and became Simon's most successful solo album. Slowly climbing the worldwide 
charts, it reached #1 in many countries, including the UK, Canada, Australia, 
and New Zealand—and peaked at #3 in the U.S. It was the second-best-selling 
album of 1987 in the US, selling five million copies and eventually reaching 
5x Platinum certification. Another seven million copies sold internationally, 
making it his best-selling album. Much of the success of the album was 
due to the lead single, the upbeat "You Can Call Me Al," whose lyrics describe 
a man experiencing an identity crisis. The track featured many memorable 
elements—a catchy synthesizer riff (played by Adrian Belew of King Crimson], 
an easy whistle solo, and an unusual bass run, in which the second half 
was a reversed recording of the first half. "You Can Call Me Al" was accompanied 
by a humorous video featuring actor Chevy Chase, which introduced Simon 
to a new audience through MTV. In the end, the track reached UK Top 5 and 
the U.S. Top 25. Further singles, including the title track, "The Boy in 
the Bubble" and "Diamonds on the Soles of Her Shoes," were not commercial 
hits but became radio standards and were highly praised. At age 45, Simon 
found himself back at the forefront of popular music. He received the Grammy 
Award for Album of the Year in 1987 and also Grammy Award for Record of 
the Year for the title track one year later. He also embarked on the very 
successful Graceland Tour, which was documented on music video. Simon found 
himself embracing new sounds, which some critics viewed negatively—however, 
Simon reportedly felt it was a natural artistic experiment, considering 
that world music was already present on much of his early work, including 
such Simon & Garfunkel hits as "El Condor Pasa" and his early solo recording 
"Mother and Child Reunion," which was recorded in Kingston, Jamaica. One 
way or another, Warner Bros. Records (who by this time controlled and reissued 
all his previous Columbia albums) re-established Simon as one of their 
most successful artists. In an attempt to capitalize on his renewed success, 
WB Records released the album Negotiations and Love Songs in November 1988, 
a mixture of popular hits and personal favorites that covered Simon's entire 
career and became an enduring seller in his catalog. After Graceland, Simon 
decided to extend his roots with the Brazilian music-flavored The Rhythm 
of the Saints. Sessions for the album began in December 1989, and took 
place in Rio de Janeiro and New York, featuring guitarist JJ Cale and many 
Brazilian and African musicians. The tone of the album was more introspective 
and relatively low-key compared to the mostly upbeat numbers of Graceland. 
Released on October 1990, the album received excellent critical reviews 
and achieved very respectable sales, peaking at #4 in the U.S. and No. 
1 in the UK. The lead single, "The Obvious Child," featuring the Grupo 
Cultural Olodum, became his last Top 20 hit in the UK and appeared near 
the bottom of the Billboard Hot 100. Although not as successful as Graceland, 
The Rhythm of the Saints was received as a competent successor and consistent 
complement on Simon's attempts to explore (and popularize) world music, 
and also received a Grammy nomination for Album of the Year. Simon's ex-wife 
Carrie Fisher says in her autobiography Wishful Drinking that the song 
"She Moves On" is about her. It's one of several she claims, followed by 
the line, "If you can get Paul Simon to write a song about you, do it. 
Because he is so brilliant at it." [28] The success of both albums allowed 
Simon to stage another New York concert. On August 15, 1991, almost a decade 
after his concert with Garfunkel, Simon staged a second concert in Central 
Park with African and South American bands. The success of the concert 
surpassed all expectations, and reportedly over 750,000 people attended—one 
of the largest concert audiences in history. He later remembered the concert 
as, "...the most memorable moment in my career." The success of the show 
led to both a live album and an Emmy-winning TV special. In the middle, 
Simon embarked on the successful Born at the Right Time Tour, and promoted 
the album with further singles, including "Proof"—accompanied with a humorous 
video that again featured Chevy Chase, and added Steve Martin. On March 
4, 1992, he appeared on his own episode of MTV Unplugged, offering renditions 
of many of his most famous compositions. Broadcast in June, the show was 
a success, though it did not receive an album release. After Unplugged, 
Simon's place in the forefront of popular music dropped notably. A Simon 
& Garfunkel reunion took place in September 1993, and in another attempt 
to capitalize on the occasion, Columbia released Paul Simon 1964/1993 in 
September, a three-disc compilation that received a reduced version on 
the two-disc album The Paul Simon Anthology one month later. In 1995 he 
made news for appearing on The Oprah Winfrey Show, where he performed the 
song "Ten Years," which he composed specially for the tenth anniversary 
of the show. Also that year, he was featured on the Annie Lennox version 
of his 1973 song "Something So Right," which appeared briefly on the UK 
Top 50 once it was released as a single in November. Since the early stages 
of the nineties, Simon was fully involved on The Capeman, a musical that 
finally opened on January 29, 1998. Simon worked enthusiastically on the 
project for many years and described it as "a New York Puerto Rican story 
based on events that happened in 1959—events that I remembered." [29] The 
musical tells the story of real-life Puerto Rican youth Salvador Agron, 
who wore a cape while committing two murders in 1959 New York, and went 
on to become a writer in prison. Featuring Marc Anthony as the young Agron 
and Rubén Blades as the older Agron, the play received terrible reviews 
and very poor box office receipts from the very beginning, and closed on 
March 28 after just 68 performances—a failure that reportedly cost Simon 
11 million dollars. Simon recorded an album of songs from the show, which 
was released in November 1997. It was received with very mixed reviews, 
though many critics praised the combination of doo-wop, rockabilly and 
Caribbean music that the album reflected. In commercial terms, Songs from 
The Capeman was a failure—it found Simon missing the Top 40 of the Billboard 
charts for the first time in his career. The cast album was never released 
on CD but eventually became available online. After the disaster of The 
Capeman, Simon's career was again in an unexpected crisis. However, entering 
the new millennium, he maintained a respectable reputation, offering critically 
acclaimed new material and receiving commercial attention. In 1999, Simon 
embarked on a North American tour with Bob Dylan, where each alternated 
as headline act with a "middle" section where they performed together, 
starting on the first of June and ending September 18. The collaboration 
was generally well-received, with just one critic, Seth Rogovoy, from the 
Berkshire Eagle, questioning the collaboration.[30] In an attempt to return 
successfully to the music market, Simon wrote and recorded a new album 
very quickly, with You're the One arriving in October 2000. The album consisted 
mostly of folk-pop writing combined with foreign musical sounds, particularly 
grooves from North Africa. While not reaching the commercial heights of 
previous albums, it managed at least to reach both the British and American 
Top 20. It received favorable reviews and received a Grammy nomination 
for Album of the Year. He toured extensively for the album, and one performance 
in Paris was released to home video. On September 21, 2001, Simon sang 
"Bridge Over Troubled Water" on "America: A Tribute to Heroes," a multinetwork 
broadcast to benefit the September 11 Telethon Fund. In 2002, he wrote 
and recorded "Father and Daughter," the theme song for the animated family 
film The Wild Thornberrys Movie. The track was nominated for an Academy 
Award for Best Song. In 2003, he participated on another Simon & Garfunkel 
reunion. One year later, Simon's studio albums were re-released both individually 
and together in a limited-edition nine-CD boxed set, Paul Simon: The Studio 
Recordings 1972–2000. At the time, Simon was already working on a new album 
with Brian Eno called Surprise, which was released in May 2006. Most of 
the album was inspired by the September 11 terrorist attacks, the Iraq 
invasion, and the war that followed. In personal terms, Simon was also 
inspired by the fact of having turned 60 in 2001, which he humorously referred 
to on "Old" from You're the One. Simon showed special care about the musical 
venture he traveled since 1986's Graceland.[clarification needed] As he 
put it, "Once you go away for a bit, you wonder who people think you are. 
If they don't know what you're up to, they just go by your history. I'm 
so often described as this person that went to other cultures, which is 
true, but I never thought of it that way. I suspect people are thinking, 
'What culture did you go to?' But this record is straight-ahead American." 
Surprise was a commercial hit, reaching #14 in the Billboard 200 and #4 
in the UK. Most critics also praised the album, and many of them called 
it a "comeback". Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic wrote that "Simon 
doesn't achieve his comeback by reconnecting with the sound and spirit 
of his classic work; he has achieved it by being as restless and ambitious 
as he was at his popular and creative peak, which makes Surprise all the 
more remarkable." The album was supported with the successful Surprise 
Tour. In March 2004, Walter Yetnikoff published a book called 'Howling 
at the Moon', in which he criticized Simon personally and for his tenuous 
business partnership with Columbia Records in the past.[31] On March 1, 
2007, Simon made headlines again when the Library of Congress announced 
that he would be the first recipient of the recently created Gershwin Prize 
for Popular Song. Simon received the prize during a concert gala at the 
Warner Theatre in Washington, D.C., on the evening of May 23. The event 
featured his music, and was nationally broadcast on PBS on the evening 
of June 27, 2007.[32] Performers at the concert included Shawn Colvin, 
Philip Glass, Alison Krauss, Jerry Douglas, Ladysmith Black Mambazo, Lyle 
Lovett, James Taylor, Stevie Wonder, and Simon's former partner Art Garfunkel.[33] 
On June 26, Warner Bros. released the definitive Paul Simon greatest-hits 
collection. The Essential Paul Simon consisted of two discs that reviewed 
36 songs from his ten studio albums, and was also released on a special 
edition featuring a DVD of music videos and memorable live performances. 
The album was a commercial hit, reaching #12 in the UK. After living in 
Montauk, New York, for many years, Simon relocated to New Canaan, Connecticut.[34] 
Simon is one of a small number of performers who are named as the copyright 
owner on their recordings (most records have the recording company as the 
named owner of the recording). This noteworthy development was spearheaded 
by the Bee Gees after their successful $200 million lawsuit against RSO 
Records, which remains the largest successful lawsuit against a record 
company by an artist or group. All of Simon's solo recordings, including 
those originally issued by Columbia Records, are currently distributed 
by Sony Records' Legacy Recordings unit. His albums were issued by Warner 
Music Group until mid-2010.[35] In mid-2010, Simon moved his catalog of 
solo work from Warner Bros. Records to Sony/Columbia Records [35] where 
Simon and Garfunkel's catalog is. Simon's back catalog of solo recordings 
would be marketed by Sony Music's Legacy Recordings unit. In February 2009, 
Simon performed back-to-back shows in New York City at the Beacon Theatre, 
which had recently been renovated. Simon was reunited with Art Garfunkel 
at the first show as well as with the cast of The Capeman; also playing 
in the band was Graceland bassist Bakithi Kumalo. In May 2009, Simon toured 
with Garfunkel in Australia, New Zealand, and Japan. In October 2009, they 
appeared together at the 25th Anniversary of The Rock & Roll Hall of Fame 
concert at Madison Square Garden in New York City. The pair performed four 
of their most popular songs, "The Sound of Silence," "The Boxer," "Cecilia," 
and "Bridge Over Troubled Water." Simon's album So Beautiful or So What[36] 
was released on the Concord Music Group label on April 12, 2011.[37] The 
album received high marks from the artist, "It's the best work I've done 
in 20 years."[35] It was reported that Simon attempted to have Bob Dylan 
guest on the album.[35] On November 10, 2010, Simon released a new song 
called "Getting Ready for Christmas Day". It premiered on National Public 
Radio,[38] and was included on the album So Beautiful or So What. The song 
samples a 1941 sermon by the Rev. J.M. Gates, also entitled "Getting Ready 
for Christmas Day".[39] Simon performed the song live on The Colbert Report 
on December 16, 2010.[40] The first video featured J.M. Gates' giving the 
sermon and his church in 2010 with its display board showing many of Simon's 
lyrics; the second video illustrates the song with cartoon images. In the 
premiere show of the final season of The Oprah Winfrey Show on September 
10, 2010, Simon surprised Oprah and the audience with a song dedicated 
to Oprah and her show lasting 25 years (an update of a song he did for 
her show's 10th anniversary).[41] Rounding off his 2011 World Tour, which 
included United States, England, the Netherlands, Switzerland and Germany, 
Simon appeared at Ramat Gan Stadium in Israel in July 2011, making his 
first concert appearance in Israel since 1983.[42] On September 11, 2011, 
Paul Simon performed "The Sound of Silence" at the National September 11 
Memorial & Museum, site of the World Trade Center, on the 10th anniversary 
of the September 11 attacks. On February 26, 2012, Simon paid tribute to 
fellow musicians Chuck Berry and Leonard Cohen who were the recipients 
of the first annual PEN Awards for songwriting excellence at the JFK Presidential 
Library in Boston, Massachusetts.[43] In 1986 Simon was awarded an Honorary 
Doctor of Music degree from Berklee College of Music where he currently 
serves on the Board of Trustees.[44][45] On June 5, 2012, Simon released 
a 25th anniversary box set of Graceland, which included a remastered edition 
of the original album, the 2012 documentary film Under African Skies, the 
original 1987 "African Concert" from Zimbabwe, an audio narrative "The 
Story of 'Graceland'" as told by Paul Simon, and other interviews and paraphernalia.[46] 
He played a few concerts in Europe with the original musicians to commemorate 
the anniversary.[47] On December 19, 2012, Simon performed at the funeral 
of Victoria Leigh Soto, a teacher killed in the Sandy Hook Elementary School 
shooting.[48] On June 14, 2013, at Sting's Back to Bass Tour, Simon performed 
his song "The Boxer" and Sting's "Fields of Gold" with Sting.[49] In September 
2013, Simon delivered the Richard Ellmann Lectures in Modern Literature 
at Emory University. In February 2014, Simon embarked on a joint concert 
tour titled On Stage Together with English musician Sting, playing 21 concerts 
in North America.[50] The tour continued in early 2015, with ten shows 
in Australia and New Zealand,[51][52] and 23 concerts in Europe,[53] ending 
on 18 April 2015. On August 4, 2015, Simon performed "Me and Julio Down 
by the Schoolyard", "Homeward Bound", and "Late in the Evening" alongside 
Billy Joel at the final concert of Nassau Coliseum on Long Island, New 
York.[54] On September 11, 2015, Simon appeared during the premiere week 
of The Late Show with Stephen Colbert. Simon, who performed “Me and Julio 
Down by the Schoolyard” with Colbert for his surprise appearance, had been 
promoted prior to the show as "Simon and Garfunkel tribute band Troubled 
Waters."[55] Simon's additional performance of "An American Tune" was posted 
as a bonus on the show's YouTube channel. Simon also wrote and performed 
the theme song for the comedian Louis C.K.'s show Horace and Pete, which 
debuted January 30, 2016. The song, which can be heard during the show's 
opening, intermission, and closing credits, is sparse, featuring only Simon's 
voice and an acoustic guitar. Simon made a cameo appearance onscreen in 
the tenth and final episode of the series. On February 22, 2016 a Simon 
spokesperson announced the upcoming release of his thirteenth solo studio 
album, Stranger to Stranger.[56] Simon began writing new material shortly 
after releasing his twelfth studio album, So Beautiful or So What, in April 
2011. Simon collaborates with the Italian electronic dance music artist 
Clap! Clap! on three songs—"The Werewolf", "Street Angel", and "Wristband". 
Simon was introduced to him by his son, Adrian, who was a fan of his work. 
The two met up in July 2011 when Simon was touring behind So Beautiful 
or So What in Milan, Italy. He and Clap! Clap! worked together via email 
over the course of making the album. Simon also worked with longtime friend 
Roy Halee, who is listed as co-producer on the album. Halee, who had since 
retired, was mostly recruited to advise on how to create natural echo. 
He was unfamiliar with Pro Tools, so engineer Andy Smith helped him with 
it. "I always liked working with him more than anyone else," Simon noted.[57] 
On June 29, 2016, Simon announced that he may be retiring from performing 
music.[58] On July 25, 2016, he performed "Bridge over Troubled Water" 
at the 2016 Democratic National Convention.[59] In an in-depth interview 
reprinted in American Songwriter, Simon discusses the craft of songwriting 
with music journalist Tom Moon. In the interview, Simon explains the basic 
themes in his songwriting: love, family, social commentary, etc., as well 
as the overarching messages of religion, spirituality, and God in his lyrics. 
Simon goes on in the interview to explain the process of how he goes about 
writing songs, "The music always precedes the words. The words often come 
from the sound of the music and eventually evolve into coherent thoughts. 
Or incoherent thoughts. Rhythm plays a crucial part in the lyric-making 
as well. It's like a puzzle to find the right words to express what the 
music is saying."[60] In the late 1990s, Simon wrote and produced a Broadway 
musical called The Capeman, which lost $11 million during its 1998 run. 
In April 2008, the Brooklyn Academy of Music celebrated Paul Simon's works, 
and dedicated a week to Songs From the Capeman with a good portion of the 
show's songs performed by a cast of singers and the Spanish Harlem Orchestra. 
Simon himself appeared during the BAM shows, performing "Trailways Bus" 
and "Late In the Evening". In August 2010, The Capeman was staged for three 
nights in the Delacorte Theatre in New York's Central Park. The production 
was directed by Diane Paulus and produced in conjunction with the Public 
Theater.[61] Simon has also dabbled in acting. He played music producer 
Tony Lacey, a supporting character, in the 1977 Woody Allen feature film 
Annie Hall. He wrote and starred in 1980's One Trick Pony as Jonah Levin, 
a journeyman rock and roller. Simon also wrote all the songs in the film. 
Paul Simon also appeared on The Muppet Show (the only episode to use only 
the songs of one songwriter, Simon). In 1990, he played the character of—appropriately 
enough—Simple Simon on the Disney Channel TV movie, Mother Goose Rock 'n' 
Rhyme. In 1978, Simon made a cameo appearance in the movie, The Rutles: 
All You Need Is Cash. He has been the subject of two films by Jeremy Marre, 
the first on Graceland, the second on The Capeman. On November 18, 2008, 
Simon was a guest on The Colbert Report promoting his book Lyrics 1964–2008. 
After an interview with Stephen Colbert, Simon performed "American Tune". 
Simon performed a Stevie Wonder song at the White House in 2009 at an event 
honoring Wonder's musical career and contributions. In May 2009, The Library 
of Congress: Paul Simon and Friends Live Concert was released on DVD, via 
Shout! Factory. The PBS concert was recorded in 2007. In April 2011 Simon 
was confirmed to appear at the Glastonbury music festival in England. Simon 
has appeared on Saturday Night Live (SNL), either as host or musical guest, 
14 times. On one appearance in the late 1980s, he worked with his political 
namesake, Illinois Senator Paul Simon.[62] Simon's most recent SNL appearance 
on a Saturday night was on the March 9, 2013 episode hosted by Justin Timberlake 
as a member of the Five-Timers Club. In one SNL skit from 1986 (when he 
was promoting Graceland), Simon plays himself, waiting in line with a friend 
to get into a movie. He amazes his friend by remembering intricate details 
about prior meetings with passers-by, but draws a complete blank when approached 
by Art Garfunkel, despite the latter's numerous memory prompts. Simon appeared 
alongside George Harrison as musical guest on the Thanksgiving Day episode 
of SNL (November 20, 1976). The two performed "Here Comes the Sun" and 
"Homeward Bound" together, while Simon performed "50 Ways to Leave Your 
Lover" solo earlier in the show. On that episode, Simon opened the show 
performing "Still Crazy After All These Years" in a turkey outfit, since 
Thanksgiving was the following week. About halfway through the song, Simon 
tells the band to stop playing because of his embarrassment. After giving 
a frustrating speech to the audience, he leaves the stage, backed by applause. 
Lorne Michaels positively greets him backstage, but Simon is still upset, 
yelling at him because of the humiliating turkey outfit. This is one of 
SNL's most played sketches. Simon closed the 40th anniversary SNL show 
on February 15, 2015, with a performance of "Still Crazy After All These 
Years," sans turkey outfit. Simon also played a snippet of "I've Just Seen 
a Face" with Sir Paul McCartney during the special's introductory sequence. 
On September 29, 2001, Simon made a special appearance on the first SNL 
to air after the September 11, 2001 attacks. On that show, he performed 
"The Boxer" to the audience and the NYC firefighters and police officers. 
He is also a friend of former SNL star Chevy Chase, who appeared in his 
video for "You Can Call Me Al" lip synching the song while Simon looks 
disgruntled and mimes backing vocals and the playing of various instruments 
beside him. Chase would also appear in Simon's 1991 video for the song 
"Proof" alongside Steve Martin. He is a close friend of SNL producer Lorne 
Michaels, who produced the 1977 TV show The Paul Simon Special, as well 
as the Simon and Garfunkel concert in Central Park four years later. Simon 
and Lorne Michaels were the subjects of a 2006 episode of the Sundance 
Channel documentary series, Iconoclasts. Simon has won 12 Grammy Awards 
(one of them a Lifetime Achievement Award) and five Album of the Year Grammy 
nominations, the most recent for You're the One in 2001. He is one of only 
five artists to have won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year more than 
once as the main credited artist. In 1998 he was entered in the Grammy 
Hall of Fame for the Simon & Garfunkel album Bridge over Troubled Water. 
He received an Oscar nomination for the song "Father and Daughter" in 2002. 
He is also a two-time inductee into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame; as 
a solo artist in 2001, and in 1990 as half of Simon & Garfunkel. In 2001, 
Simon was honored as MusiCares Person Of The Year. The following year, 
he was one of the five recipients of the annual Kennedy Center Honors, 
the nation's highest tribute to performing and cultural artists. In 2005, 
Simon was saluted as a BMI Icon at the 53rd Annual BMI Pop Awards. Simon's 
songwriting catalog has earned 39 BMI Awards including multiple citations 
for "Bridge over Troubled Water," "Mrs. Robinson," "Scarborough Fair" and 
"The Sound of Silence". As of 2005, he has amassed nearly 75 million broadcast 
airplays, according to BMI surveys.[63] In 2006, Simon was selected by 
Time Magazine as one of the "100 People Who Shaped the World."[citation 
needed] In 2007, Simon received the first annual Library of Congress Gershwin 
Prize for Popular Song. (Stevie Wonder and Paul McCartney followed in 2009 
and 2010.) Named in honor of George and Ira Gershwin, this new award recognizes 
the profound and positive effect of popular music on the world's culture. 
On being notified of the honor, Simon said, "I am grateful to be the recipient 
of the Gershwin Prize and doubly honored to be the first. I look forward 
to spending an evening in the company of artists I admire at the award 
ceremony in May. I can think of a few who have expressed my words and music 
far better than I. I'm excited at the prospect of that happening again. 
It's a songwriter's dream come true." Among the performers who paid tribute 
to Simon were Stevie Wonder, Alison Krauss, Jerry Douglas, Lyle Lovett, 
James Taylor, Dianne Reeves, Marc Anthony, Yolanda Adams, and Ladysmith 
Black Mambazo. The event was professionally filmed and broadcast and is 
now available as Paul Simon and Friends. In 2010, Simon received an honorary 
degree from Brandeis University, where he performed "The Boxer" at the 
main commencement ceremony. In October 2011, Simon was inducted into the 
American Academy of Arts and Science. At the induction ceremony, he performed 
"American Tune." In 2012, Simon was awarded the Polar Music Prize.[64] 
When Simon moved to England in 1964, he met Kathleen Mary "Kathy" Chitty 
(born 1947) on April 12, 1964, at the first English folk club he played, 
Railway Inn Folk Club in Brentwood, Essex, where Chitty worked part-time 
selling tickets. She was 17, he was 22, and they fell in love. Later that 
year they visited the U.S. together, touring around mainly by bus.[65] 
Kathy returned to England on her own with Simon returning to her some weeks 
later. When Simon returned to the U.S. with the growing success of "The 
Sound of Silence", Kathy, who was quite shy,[66] wanted no part of the 
success and fame that awaited Simon and they split.[67] She is mentioned 
by name in at least two of his songs: "Kathy's Song" and "America," and 
is referred to in "Homeward Bound" and "The Late Great Johnny Ace." There 
is a photo of Simon and Kathy on the cover of The Paul Simon Songbook. 
Simon has been married three times, first to Peggy Harper in late autumn 
1969. They had son Harper Simon in 1972 and divorced in 1975. The song 
"Train in the Distance," from Simon's 1983 album Hearts and Bones, is about 
this relationship.[68] Simon's 1972 song "Run That Body Down," from his 
second solo album, casually mentions both himself and his then-wife ("Peg") 
by name. His second marriage, from 1983 to 1984, was to actress and author 
Carrie Fisher to whom he proposed after a New York Yankees game.[68] The 
song "Hearts and Bones" was written about this relationship. The song "Graceland" 
is also thought to be about seeking solace from the end of this relationship 
by taking a road trip.[69] A year after divorcing, Simon and Fisher resumed 
their relationship for several years. His third wife is folk singer Edie 
Brickell, 24 years his junior, whom he married on May 30, 1992. They have 
three children: Adrian, Lulu, and Gabriel.[70] Paul Simon and his younger 
brother, Eddie Simon, founded the Guitar Study Center in New York City.[71] 
The Guitar Study Center later became part of The New School in New York 
City.[72] Simon is a proponent of music education for children. In 1970, 
after recording his "Bridge Over Troubled Water", at the invitation of 
the NYU's Tisch School of the Arts, Simon held auditions for a young songwriter's 
workshop. Advertised in the Village Voice, the auditions brought hundreds 
of hopefuls to perform for Simon. Among the six teenage songwriters Simon 
selected for tutelage were Melissa Manchester, Tommy Mandel and rock/beat 
poet Joe Linus, with Maggie and Terre Roche (the Roche Sisters), who later 
sang back-up for Simon, joining the workshop in progress through an impromptu 
appearance. Simon invited the six teens to experience recording at Columbia 
studios with engineer Roy Halee. During these sessions, Bob Dylan was downstairs 
recording the album Self-Portrait, which included a version of Simon's 
"The Boxer". Violinist Isaac Stern also visited the group with a CBS film 
crew, speaking to the young musicians about lyrics and music after Joe 
Linus performed his song "Circus Lion" for Stern. Manchester later paid 
homage to Simon, on her recorded song, "Ode to Paul." Other musicians Simon 
has mentored include Nick Laird-Clowes, who co-founded the band the Dream 
Academy. Laird-Clowes has credited Simon with helping to shape the band's 
biggest hit, "Life in a Northern Town".[73] In 2003, Simon signed on as 
a supporter of Little Kids Rock, a nonprofit organization that provides 
free musical instruments and free lessons to children in public schools 
in the U.S. He sits on the organization's board of directors as an honorary 
member. Simon is also a major benefactor and one of the co-founders, with 
Dr. Irwin Redlener, of the Children's Health Project and The Children's 
Health Fund[74][75] which started by creating specially equipped "buses" 
to take medical care to children in medically underserved areas, urban 
and rural. Their first bus was in the impoverished South Bronx of New York 
City, but they now operate in 12 states, including on the Gulf Coast. It 
has expanded greatly, partnering with major hospitals, local public schools 
and medical schools and advocating policy for children's health and medical 
care. In May 2012, Paul Simon performed at a benefit dinner for the Turkana 
Basin Institute in New York City, raising more than $2 million for Richard 
Leakey's research institute in Africa.[76] This discography does not include 
compilation albums, concert albums, or work with Simon and Garfunkel. Simon's 
solo concert albums often have songs he originally recorded with Simon 
and Garfunkel, and many Simon and Garfunkel concert albums contain songs 
Simon first recorded on solo albums. Finally, Paul Simon has a few songs 
that appear on compilation albums and nowhere else. For example, "Slip 
Slidin' Away" appears only on the compilation albums Negotiations and Love
