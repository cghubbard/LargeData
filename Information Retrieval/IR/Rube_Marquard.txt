Richard William "Rube" Marquard (October 9, 1886 – June 1, 1980) was an 
American left-handed pitcher in Major League Baseball in the 1910s and 
early 1920s. He achieved his greatest success with the New York Giants. 
He was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1971. Marquard was born 
in Cleveland, Ohio to German immigrant Fred Marquard and Lena Heiser Marquard.[1] 
Rube Marquard claimed an 1889 date of birth, but 1900 census data and a 
birth certificate show an 1886 date of birth. Lena Marquard died of an 
abdominal infection in 1899 and Rube's grandmother took responsibility 
for raising him. Marquard quit school after the fifth grade; biographer 
Larry Mansch writes that he "simply refused to attend any longer."[2] Newspaper 
reports first mentioned Marquard in 1905 when he played with an amateur 
team in Cleveland. Though pitching for a poor team that had a 1-15 win-loss 
record at one point, Marquard attracted attention as a top pitcher. He 
broke a City League record with 16 strikeouts in a game against a team 
known as Brittons Printing. In September, the City League season finished 
and he signed with the semipro Telling Strollers, an independent team sponsored 
by an ice cream company.[3] He started his minor league baseball career 
in 1906.[4] Despite his nickname, he was a city kid. As he told it in The 
Glory of Their Times, a writer in his minor league days compared him favorably 
with Rube Waddell, and very soon Marquard was being called "Rube" also.[5] 
In 1907, he went 23-13 with a 2.01 earned run average and led the Central 
League in wins.[6] In 1908, he went 28-19 with a 1.69 ERA and led the American 
Association in wins.[7] The New York Giants purchased Marquard for $11,000 
– a then unheard-of sum to pay for a baseball player's contract – and his 
lack of success early in his major league career led to his being tagged 
"the $11,000 lemon". From 1911 to 1913, Marquard won at least 23 games 
each season and helped the Giants win three consecutive National League 
pennants. In 1911, he led the league with 237 strikeouts. In 1912, he led 
the league with 26 wins.[8] He also made baseball history by winning 19 
decisions in a row. Marquard allegedly celebrated by buying an opal stickpin 
to reward himself. Upon being told by a friend that opals were a jinx, 
he threw the pin into a river; but apparently the curse had already done 
its work, as he lost his next decision. In 1914, Marquard went 12-22, and 
in 1915, he joined the Brooklyn Robins. He helped the team win pennants 
in 1916 and 1920. He then played for the Cincinnati Reds and Boston Braves.[8] 
Marquard finished his major league career in 1925 with a record of 201–177 
and a 3.08 ERA.[8] His 1,593 strikeouts, at the time, ranked third in major 
league history among left-handers (behind Rube Waddell and Eddie Plank), 
and stood as the NL record for southpaws until his total was surpassed 
by Carl Hubbell in 1942. He later pitched and managed in the minor leagues 
until 1933.[4] After baseball he worked as a betting window teller at Narragansett 
Park.[9] Marquard was a performer in vaudeville, appearing with Blossom 
Seeley and later marrying her. He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame 
in 1971. His selection has often been criticized by the sabermetrics community, 
since Marquard's career adjusted ERA+ was only slightly better than league 
average. Bill James described Marquard as "probably the worst starting 
pitcher in the Hall of Fame."[10] Marquard had been interviewed for the 
popular baseball book, The Glory of Their Times, in the early 1960s, and 
his chapter is thought to be one of the primary reasons for his election. 
However, most of the stories that he "recounted" were later found to be 
false.[11] Marquard died in Baltimore, Maryland at age 93. He is interred
