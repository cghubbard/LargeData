Dover is a town in Morris County, New Jersey, United States. Located on 
the Rockaway River, Dover is about 31 miles (50 km) west of New York City 
and about 23 miles (37 km) west of Newark, New Jersey. As of the 2010 United 
States Census, the town's population was 18,157,[9][10][11] reflecting 
a decline of 31 (-0.2%) from the 18,188 counted in the 2000 Census, which 
had in turn increased by 3,073 (+20.3%) from the 15,115 counted in the 
1990 Census.[20] Dover has become a majority minority community, with nearly 
70% of the population as of the 2010 Census identifying themselves as Hispanic, 
up from 25% in 1980.[21] Joseph Latham was deeded the land that includes 
present-day Dover in 1713, from portions of land that had been purchased 
from Native Americans by the Proprietors of West Jersey. On May 31, 1722, 
Latham and his wife Jane deeded 527 acres (2.13 km2) over to John Jackson 
of Flushing, New York. Jackson settled on the eastern portion of his land 
along Granny's Brook at the site of what would later become the Ross Ribbon 
Factory on Park Heights Avenue.[22] Iron ore at the time was so plentiful 
that it could be collected off the ground at the nearby Dickerson Mine 
in Mine Hill. At Jackson's Forge, ore would be processed into bars that 
would then be transported to Paterson and other industrial areas towards 
the east. The passage of the Iron Act by the British Parliament led to 
financial difficulties, leading Jackson into bankruptcy in 1753, with all 
of his property and belongings sold off at a Sheriff's sale. Quaker Hartshorne 
Fitz Randolph purchased Jackson's property and annexed to his own existing 
property, which would later become part of Randolph Township.[23] Dover 
was incorporated as a town on April 1, 1869, within Randolph Township and 
became fully independent as of March 5, 1896.[24] On May 7, 1896, Dover 
was reincorporated as a city and regained its status as a town on March 
21, 1899, after the referendum that approved the change was invalidated 
by a court ruling.[25] The town charter was amended in 1875. In its past, 
Dover has had extensive iron and mill works, machine shops, stove, furnace, 
and range works, boiler and bridge works, rolling mills, drill works, knitting 
and silk mills, and a large hosiery factory (MacGregors). During this period, 
Dover was a port on the Morris Canal while it was operational; the boat 
basin was located at what is today the JFK Commons Park.[26] Sources attribute 
the town's name to Dover, England[27] or Dover, New Hampshire.[28][29] 
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town had a total area 
of 2.730 square miles (7.070 km2), including 2.684 square miles (6.951 km2)

government and is governed by a Mayor and Board of Aldermen. The Mayor 
is elected at-large. The Board of Aldermen consists of eight members, with 
two Aldermen elected to two-year terms from each of the four wards on a 
staggered basis, with one Aldermanic seat coming up for election each year 
in each ward.[7][40] As of 2016[update], the Mayor of Dover Town is Demorcat 
James P. Dodd, whose term of office ends on December 31, 2019.[3] Members

the Fourth Ward of Michelle E. Yzarnotegui, who won a new term in the November 
2014 general election but resigned in January 2015 in order to address 
family health issues, was to be filled by nominations from the Democratic 
municipal committee.[47][48] Steven Toth was chosen to fill the vacant 
seat. Dover serves as the lead agency operating a joint municipal court 
that also serves the neighboring municipalities of Mine Hill Township, 
Mount Arlington, Victory Gardens and Wharton.[49] Established in 2009, 
the joint municipal court was forecast to offer annual savings in excess 
of $250,000 over the 10-year life of the agreement.[50] Dover Town is located
