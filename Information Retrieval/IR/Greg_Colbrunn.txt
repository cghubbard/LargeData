Gregory Joseph Colbrunn (born July 26, 1969) is an American former Major 
League baseball player and hitting coach. Primarily a first baseman during 
his active career, the Fontana, California, native played in the Major 
Leagues for 13 seasons (1992–2004) and seven different teams. He threw 
and batted right-handed and was listed at 6 feet (1.8 m) tall and 190 pounds 
(86 kg). He served as the Boston Red Sox hitting coach during the 2013 
and 2014 seasons. Colbrunn graduated from Fontana High School and was selected 
by the Montreal Expos in the sixth round of the 1987 Major League Baseball 
draft, turning down a scholarship from Stanford University to begin his 
professional baseball career.[1] Despite missing the entire 1991 season 
with an injury, he rose through the Montreal farm system and made his MLB 
debut with the Expos on July 9, 1992, and singled in his first at bat off 
Francisco Oliveras of the San Francisco Giants.[2] After his debut with 
Montreal, Colbrunn would also play for the Florida Marlins, Minnesota Twins, 
Colorado Rockies, Atlanta Braves, Arizona Diamondbacks and Seattle Mariners. 
He batted over .300 five times during his Major League career, and had 
his most successful seasons with the Marlins and Diamondbacks, exceeding 
the 100-games played mark in 1995, 1996 and 2000. He set personal bests 
in home runs (23) and runs batted in (89) for the 1995 Marlins, and amassed 
146 hits for the Marlins in both 1995 and 1996. He batted .310 in 334 career 
games with the D-Backs, with a career-high .333 mark during part-time duty 
in 2002. He hit for the cycle on September 18, 2002, against the San Diego 
Padres.[3] Colbrunn was part of the Diamondbacks' victorious 2001 World 
Series team, starting at first base in Game 6 and collecting two singles 
in five at bats, with a base on balls, two runs scored and one RBI, in 
Arizona's 15–2 thrashing of the New York Yankees. In his 13-season MLB 
career, Colbrunn batted .289; his 801 career hits included 155 doubles, 
12 triples and 98 homers. After his playing career ended in 2005, Colbrunn 
became a coach in the Yankees' organization, serving as the hitting instructor 
for the Charleston RiverDogs of the Single-A South Atlantic League from 
2007–09 and in 2011–12.[4] In 2010, Colbrunn managed the RiverDogs to a 
65–74 (.468) record.[5] Then, following the 2012 season, Colbrunn joined 
the coaching staff of new Red Sox manager John Farrell as primary batting 
instructor. Under his guidance, the 2013 Red Sox led the Major Leagues 
in runs scored (853), runs per game (5.27), slugging percentage (.446), 
on-base percentage (.349), on-base plus slugging (.795), total bases (2,521) 
and extra-base hits (570).[1] The Red Sox won the American League East 
Division title, the American League pennant and the 2013 World Series. 
Colbrunn returned to Farrell's staff for 2014. On June 4, he was compelled 
to take a medical leave of absence after he suffered a cerebral hemorrhage 
during the Red Sox' road trip to Cleveland, Ohio, and was hospitalized 
in the Cleveland Clinic.[6] He returned to his duties on a part-time basis 
on June 30.[7] However, the 2014 Red Sox struggled offensively all season 
long, finishing at or near the bottom of the American League in almost 
every category, including runs scored (12th, with 634).[8] After the 2014 
season concluded, Colbrunn stepped down from his position with the Red 
Sox and declined another assignment within the organization.[8] On October 
24, the Yankees announced that Colbrunn, a resident of nearby Mount Pleasant, 
South Carolina,[1] would return to the Charleston RiverDogs as their batting
