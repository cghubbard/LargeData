William Timothy Lollar (born March 17, 1956) is a former professional baseball 
pitcher. He played all or part of seven seasons in Major League Baseball 
from 1980 to 1986 for the New York Yankees (1980), San Diego Padres (1981–84), 
Chicago White Sox (1985) and Boston Red Sox (1985–86), primarily as a starting 
pitcher. Lollar played collegiately for the University of Arkansas. He 
was drafted by the Yankees in the 4th round of the 1978 Major League Baseball 
Draft and was immediately assigned to the Double-A West Haven Yankees, 
just two steps below the majors. Lollar played 28 games as an infielder 
in 1978 and 65 games as an infielder in 1979 for the West Haven Yankees 
both years.[1] He made his major league debut in 1980 as a pitcher. Lollar 
debuted for the Yankees on June 26, 1980. He made 14 appearances for New 
York, including one start. He went 1–0 with 2 saves and a 3.34 earned run 
average. Lollar was traded to the Padres near the end of spring training 
along with three other players for outfielder Jerry Mumphrey and pitcher 
John Pacella. Lollar spent the strike-shortened 1981 season splitting time 
between the starting rotation and the bullpen for the Padres. He had a 
record of 2–8 in 24 games, including 11 starts, and an ERA of 6.10. In 
1982, Lollar was installed in the starting rotation permanently. He rewarded 
the Padres with a career-high 16 wins while lowering his ERA to 3.13. He 
was in turn rewarded by being made the Padres' Opening Day starter in 1983, 
but he slumped badly, posting a record of 7–12 with an ERA of 4.61. The 
Padres made the postseason for the first time as a franchise in 1984, with 
Lollar going 11–13 with a 3.91 ERA. He made two postseason starts—one each 
in the NLCS and the World Series—but did not make it out of the fifth inning 
in either one. In World Series Game 3 against the Detroit Tigers, he pitched 
just 1.2 innings, giving up 4 home runs including a home run to Marty Castillo. 
After the season, he was traded to the White Sox along with Ozzie Guillen, 
Bill Long and Luis Salazar, primarily in exchange for LaMarr Hoyt. Lollar 
stayed with the White Sox for just a few months before being traded to 
the Red Sox for outfielder Reid Nichols. In 1986, the Red Sox converted 
Lollar into a relief pitcher, but it was a failure, as Lollar posted a 
6.91 ERA while giving up nearly two baserunners per inning. He was released 
during spring training in 1987. He played that season in the minors, posting 
a record of 3–4 with an ERA of 5.87 while splitting the year between the 
Detroit Tigers and St. Louis Cardinals organizations. He retired after 
the season. Lollar was considered a particularly good hitter for a pitcher, 
being asked to occasionally pinch-hit, and hitting eight career home runs 
in four seasons in the National League. He was even called upon to pinch-hit 
for position players twice while with the American League Red Sox. The 
first was on August 13, 1985, when he pinch hit for shortstop Jackie Gutiérrez, 
popping out to third base.[2] The second was on August 12, 1986. Lollar 
pinch-hit for shortstop Rey Quiñones with two out in the 9th and the tying 
run on first base. Despite not having batted in a major league game in 
nearly a year, Lollar singled off Kansas City Royals closer Dan Quisenberry. 
Unfortunately for the Red Sox, the next batter, Wade Boggs, grounded out 
to end the game.[3] After baseball Lollar became a PGA golf pro and instructor
