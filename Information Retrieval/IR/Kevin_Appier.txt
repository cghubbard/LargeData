Robert Kevin Appier (/ˈeɪpiər/; born December 6, 1967) is a former right-handed 
Major League Baseball pitcher who played for the Kansas City Royals, Oakland 
Athletics, New York Mets, and Anaheim Angels. Appier's solid pitching during 
his first full season in the majors earned him several rookie acclades 
in 1990.[1] His fastball, tight slider and nasty forkball contributed to 
impressive pitching statistics, distinguishing himself as one of the American 
League's top right-handed starting pitchers throughout much of the 1990s.[1] 
Appier enjoyed the most success with the Royals in the early to mid-1990s 
as one of the league's earned run average leaders, a Cy Young Award contender 
in 1993 and culminating in 1995 with a selection to the American League 
All-Star team.[1] He was a starting pitcher on the World Series Champion 
Anaheim Angels in 2002 before retiring four seasons later. Appier had a 
strong rookie campaign for the Royals in 1990, going 12-8 and posting the 
league's fourth-best ERA (2.76), thus earning him Rookie Pitcher of the 
Year honors. In 1991, he had 13 wins (tied for the team best), and pitched 
3 shutouts, two of which were back to back against the Boston Red Sox and 
New York Yankees. He was the Opening Day starter in 1992 and posted a 15-8 
record with the league's second-best ERA (2.46) for a team that only went 
72-90. Highlights of the season included a career-high nine-game winning 
streak and the American League Pitcher of the Month award for July, in 
which he went 4-0 with a 1.55 ERA. In 1993, Appier posted an 18-8 record 
with an AL leading 2.56 ERA, set a club record of 33 consecutive scoreless 
innings, and finished third in Cy Young Award balloting. In 1995, he was 
selected for his only All-Star team, pitching 2 perfect innings for the 
American League. He reached a career high in strikeouts in 1996 with 207, 
and won his first of two Roberto Clemente Awards (the other in 1998). Appier 
suffered through his first sub-.500 season in 1997, despite posting a 3.40 
ERA (7th best in AL) Despite being one of the better pitchers in baseball 
during this time period, his accomplishments went largely unnoticed due 
to playing for the Royals, a small market team that was generally not in 
contention during Appier's tenure. In 1997, under the promise of the team's 
improvement, he signed a long-term extension. During that offseason, he 
suffered a fall at his home resulting in a separated clavicle. Though he 
recovered from that injury, in March 1998 he needed surgery for an unrelated 
long-term progressing shoulder ailment, the repair of a torn labrum,[2] 
causing him to miss nearly the entire 1998 season. In 1999, after losing 
faith in the direction of the Royals organization and eager to play with 
a contender, Appier requested to be traded. In the middle of the 1999 season, 
Appier was dealt to the Oakland A's for three pitchers, Jeff D'Amico, Brad 
Rigby and Blake Stein. As the Athletics made their surprising run winning 
the AL West title in 2000, Appier provided a solid veteran arm in support 
of Oakland's developing young starters, making his 8th Opening Day start 
and winning 15 games for the fifth time in his career. Despite a good showing, 
he lost his only start in that year's ALDS when the Athletics were shut 
out. In Game 5, after the Yankees scored 6 runs in the first inning, Appier 
(for the first time in 10 years) came in to relieve in the 2nd inning, 
pitching four innings and allowing one run. For the series, Appier posted 
a 3.48 ERA with 13 strikeouts in 10.1 innings pitched. A free agent after 
the season, Appier signed a contract with the New York Mets, with which 
he tied for the team lead in wins, going 11-10 with a 3.57 ERA and went 
undefeated in his final 12 appearances, going 6-0 during that span. Making 
a playoff push, the Mets went 6-0 in his final six starts with Appier going 
4-0 with a 1.87 ERA. After the one season campaign in New York, Appier 
was traded to Anaheim for Mo Vaughn. During a solid season with the World 
Series winning Angels in 2002, Appier went 14-12 with a 3.92 ERA. In Game 
Two of the ALDS, Appier went 5 innings, giving up 3 runs, and left the 
game leading 4-3, but received a no-decision in an Angels victory after 
a blown save by Francisco Rodríguez. In Game One of the ALCS, Appier went 
5 innings in a 2-1 loss against the Minnesota Twins. He also started Game 
Five, going 5 1⁄3 innings and leaving with the Angels leading 3-2 in the 
game that sent Anaheim to the World Series, though he once again did not 
receive the decision. He finished the ALCS with a 3.48 ERA. Starting Game 
Two of the World Series, Appier did not factor into the decision after 
allowing 5 runs in 2+ innings, as the Angels went on to win the game 11-10. 
With the Angels facing elimination, Appier started Game Six, pitching four 
innings of shutout ball before yielding a fifth inning 2-run HR, and leaving 
with a man on base who eventually scored via stolen base and wild pitch 
off Francisco Rodriguez, leaving him with an 11.37 ERA for the Series, 
which the Angels won in seven games. In 2003, Appier was plagued with a 
previously undiagnosed flexor tendon injury and was eventually released 
at the end of July. He signed with the Royals, but after five starts needed 
surgery. After missing most of 2004, Appier briefly retired, but came out 
of retirement and re-signed with the Royals to a minor-league contract 
before the 2005 season, failing to make the team in Spring training and 
retiring on March 29. In October, Appier applied for reinstatement with 
Major League Baseball and signed a minor-league contract with the Seattle 
Mariners. During 10 games with the AAA Tacoma Rainiers, Appier was 1-2 
with a 4.54 ERA. On June 3, 2006, Appier asked for and was granted his 
release by the Mariners, officially retiring the next month. In 2011, Appier 
was inducted into the Kansas City Royals Hall of Fame. During his 13 seasons 
with Kansas City, he accumulated an overall record of 115-92 with and ERA
