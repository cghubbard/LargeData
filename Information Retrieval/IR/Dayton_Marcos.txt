The Dayton Marcos were a Negro league baseball team based from Dayton, 
Ohio that played during the early twentieth century. The Dayton Marcos 
history predates the formal organized leagues of Negro league baseball. 
As an independent team, and also as the only black team in the Ohio-Indiana 
League [1] they played black and white teams all over the country throughout 
the 1910s. Old newspaper accounts and fading memories are some of the only

formed Negro National League, which was formed by Rube Foster. The Marcos 
were one of the original eight teams to play in the first organized major 
Negro league to survive a full season. At that time, the Marcos were owned 
by Daytonian Moses Moore, a real estate agent. Moore owned the San Marco 
Hotel and apparently named his team after that enterprise.[3] He also built 
Dahomey Park, the first black-owned and operated amusement park in the 
United States. [4] Local newspapers sometimes referred to the team as "Moses 
Moore's Marcos." During this time, the Marcos did play against some strong 
competition, including that of Satchel Paige. In 1920, the team was headed 
by 36-year-old Candy Jim Taylor.[5] They played their first game in the 
league against the Chicago Giants on June 12, 1920, at Westwood Field on 
Western Avenue, which is now James H. McGee Blvd. [6] Dayton left the league 
after one year and a last place finish, and played independently until 
the mid-1920s. They then rejoined briefly for part of 1926, when they finished 
in second-to-last and left the league once again. The Marcos survived until
