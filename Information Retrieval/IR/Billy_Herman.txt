As player As manager William Jennings Bryan "Billy" Herman (July 7, 1909 
– September 5, 1992) was an American second baseman and manager in Major 
League Baseball (MLB) during the 1930s and 1940s. Known for his stellar 
defense and consistent batting, Herman still holds many National League 
(NL) defensive records for second basemen and was inducted into the National 
Baseball Hall of Fame in 1975. Born in New Albany, Indiana, in 1909, Herman 
attended New Albany High School. Herman broke into the majors in 1931 with 
the Chicago Cubs and asserted himself as a star the following season, 1932, 
by hitting .314 and scoring 102 runs. His first at-bat was memorable. Facing 
Cincinnati Reds pitcher Si Johnson, Herman chopped a pitch into the back 
of home plate, which then bounced up and hit Herman in the back of the 
head, knocking him out.[1] A fixture in the Chicago lineup over the next 
decade, Herman was a consistent hitter and solid producer. He regularly 
hit .300 or higher (and as high as .341 in 1935) and drove in a high of 
93 runs in 1936. After a sub-standard offensive year in 1940, Herman was 
traded to the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1941. He had one of his finest offensive 
season in 1943, when he batted .330 with a .398 on-base percentage and 
100 runs driven in. Herman missed the 1944 and 1945 seasons to serve in 
World War II, but returned to play in 1946 with the Dodgers and Boston 
Braves (after being traded mid-season). At 37, he was considered prime 
managerial material by the new owners of the Pittsburgh Pirates. On September 
30, 1946, Herman was traded to Pittsburgh with three marginal players (outfielder 
Stan Wentzel, pitcher Elmer Singleton and infielder Whitey Wietelmann) 
for third baseman Bob Elliott and catcher Hank Camelli. Herman was promptly 
named playing manager of the 1947 Pirates, but he was aghast at the cost—Elliott—the 
Pirates had paid for him. "Why, they've gone and traded the whole team 
on me", he said.[2] Elliott won the 1947 NL Most Valuable Player award 
and led Boston to the 1948 National League pennant. Herman's 1947 Pirates 
lost 92 games and finished tied for seventh in the NL, and he resigned 
before the season's final game. (His last appearance as a Major League 
player was on August 1 of that year.) Herman then managed in the minor 
leagues and became a Major League coach with the Dodgers (1952–57) and 
Braves (now based in Milwaukee) (1958–59)—serving on five National League 
pennant winners in eight seasons. Then he moved to the American League 
(AL) as the third-base coach of the Boston Red Sox for five years (1960–64), 
before managing the Red Sox to lackluster records in 1965 and 1966; his 
1965 Boston club lost 100 games. After his firing by the Red Sox in September 
1966, he coached for the California Angels (1967) and San Diego Padres 
(1978–79) and served in player development roles with the Oakland Athletics 
and the Padres. Herman finished his career with a .304 batting average, 
1163 runs scored, 47 home runs, 839 RBI, and 428 strikeouts. He won four 
NL pennants (in 1932, 1935, 1938, and 1941) but no World Series championships 
as a player (although he was a coach on the 1955 World Series champion 
Brooklyn Dodgers). His record as a Major League manager was 189-274 (.408). 
Herman holds the NL records for most putouts in a season by a second baseman 
and led the league in putouts seven times. He also shares the Major League 
record for most hits on opening day, with five, set April 14, 1936. Herman 
moved to Palm Beach Gardens, Florida in 1968. He was inducted into the 
Baseball Hall of Fame in 1975. He died of cancer in 1992.[3] Herman's granddaughter
