existence due to the natural spring water that gushed forth from the depths 
of the earth.[10] It was discovered by accident in 1880 by a farmer, Travis 
Mellion, when his daughter Opal fell ill with a form of tuberculosis. He 
asked for advice from nearby campers, and they suggested the spring that 
oozed from the bank of the Fishing River. Water was collected and brought 
to his daughter to drink. Over the course of a few weeks, there was noticeable 
improvement to her health, and she was eventually cured. A log-cabin farmer, 
Frederick Kugler, also begin to treat his rheumatic knees and a recurring 
sore from a Civil War wound, and he was cured of his ailments shortly after. 
Rev. John Van Buren Flack traveled here in 1880 after hearing about the 
medicinal values of the spring water. The spring belonged to land owner 
Anthony W. Wyman. After Flack investigated the water sources, he advised 
Wyman to have the land platted, water analyzed, and to begin advertising 
the cures the water held. Flack built a home on a 40-acre (160,000 m2) 
tract that Wyman had platted and opened the town's first dry goods store 
as well as the first church. The spring was named "Excelsior", which later 
changed to Siloam. On August 17, 1880, Flack and Wyman partnered together 
to form the community of Excelsior. The post office at the time denied 
the original town name of "Excelsior", as there was already a town in southern 
Missouri with that name, therefore the town was named originally Vigniti. 
The city kept the name until 1882, when it was renamed Excelsior Springs. 
Within one year, nearly two hundred households had built in the valley 
and the nearby hillsides. The springs proved successful and brought many 
new people to the area, who camped out in tents or in covered wagons. On 
February 7, 1881, the town received the designation of village. On July 
12, 1881, the community was incorporated as a fourth class city, bringing 
several hotels, boarding houses, churches, schools, an opera house, livery 
stables, and stores. In 1881, a second mineral spring was found by Captain 
J.L. Farris, first called Empire Spring but later known as Regent Spring. 
Yet a third spring, Relief Spring, was discovered at the basin in the Fishing 
River. In a short span of time, many springs were discovered in the area, 
the most prominent being the Relief, Superior, and Saratoga springs. A 
pump was installed at the Siloam Spring, and steps from Broadway Street 
and the city's first hotel, the Excelsior, were constructed. Soon a small 
wooden bridge was built over the Fishing River to an undeveloped peninsula 
used for visitors to relax while exploring the spring. No city in Missouri 
had boomed as much as Excelsior Springs had in the first year of existence. 
The city's first hotel, the Excelsior, was built with a foundation of 30 ft 
(9.1 m) by 70 feet (21 m), and locals wondered if a hotel that size would 
ever be filled to capacity. The Excelsior opened its doors for business 
on March 1, 1881, and quickly proved that it could be filled, with many 
visitors coming to the small town seeking out the medicinal value to the 
waters held, many from as far away as St. Louis, St. Joseph, Kansas City, 
and Leavenworth. The hotel remained the leading place to stay until the 
first Elms Hotel was built and opened in 1888. In 1887, the Chicago, Milwaukee 
and St. Paul railroad extended its line from Chicago to Kansas City via 
Excelsior Springs. This brought a larger influx of visitors to the growing 
city. By this time the Relief Springs and Land Company had been formed 
primarily to advertise and pique the interest of outsiders. The company 
acquired 1,000 acres (4.0 km2) of land surrounding the city and the Fishing 
River. The historic Elms Hotel's foundation was soon poured. The Music 
Hall, a state-of-the-art theater for the time, was built nearby with a 
seating capacity of 1,320 people. An amusement pavilion was erected but 
was soon changed into a bottling works facility. A larger pavilion with 
benches and hooks for cups was placed at Siloam Spring where visitors could 
partake in the water; soon these mugs became stained due to the high iron 
content of the water. Partnered with the Milwaukee Railroad, the city began 
to advertise their resort status nationwide. In 1897, the city received 
its first telephone service. Discovery of new waters continued around the 
area. Internationally renowned professor Dr. W.P. Mason of the Rensselaer 
Polytechnic Institute analyzed the waters. His finding reported the Siloam 
and Regent spring waters to have bicarbonates of iron and manganese, a 
rare combination that had only been found in four springs in the entire 
continent of Europe, and Excelsior Springs held the only two known in the 
United States. The rarity of having 20 separate mineral springs within 
the area gave Excelsior Springs the reputation of having the world's greatest 
collection of mineral waters. Other minerals found in the springs were 
Saline-Sulphur, Soda-Bicarbonate, and Calcic-Bicarbonate (also known as 
Lithia). Mineral water resorts of the time rarely held such variety, most 
only mineral water baths, but Excelsior Springs held four distinct types 
of treatment within the region of tonic, alternative, and eliminative treatments, 
along with the mineral water baths. The city received international attention 
in 1893 at the Chicago's World Fair when medals were awarded for the iron-manganese 
water from the Regent Spring and Soterian ginger ale. October 1893 brought 
more train service to the city with the opening of the Sulpho-Saline route 
connecting to the Wabash line. Fires destroyed the Excelsior Hotel and 
the Elms Hotel, leaving only boarding houses to take in visitors. Plans 
were soon drawn up for the rebuilding of the Elms Hotel. The "Second" Elms 
Hotel was finished in 1908, but was soon destroyed again by fire. The third 
and present-day Elms Hotel was constructed in 1912. Also built were the 
Wholf's Tavern (later renamed Royal Hotel) and Snapp Hotel (later renamed 
Oaks Hotel). By 1909, the growing city boasted 14 modern hotels and about 
200 boarding and rooming houses. The development of a park system was approved 
as well, costing $200,000 at the time. This brought the Excelsior Springs 
Golf Course and the construction of many structures including the Masonic 
Hall, auditorium, Odd Fellows Building, and Morse buildings. Hourly transportation 
on the Kansas City interurban railroad began in January 1912. The expansion 
of public utilities and a system of highways connecting Excelsior Springs 
and Kansas City helped the city thrive. The day of August 6, 1925, proved 
to be one of Excelsior Springs' darkest moments. This day was when the 
lynching of 33-year-old Walter Mitchell occurred. He was hanged from a 
tree beside the Wabash railroad tracks. Mitchell was accused of sexually 
assaulting a young woman and was promptly arrested and held at the Clay 
County Jail in nearby Liberty, Missouri. A group of men then dragged Mitchell 
to the scene of the crime where he was hanged. Mitchell had been acquainted 
with the purported victim. She was the girlfriend of one of Mitchell's 
partners in a cattle-stealing operation that took place in Clay and Platte 
counties during the mid-1920s. The assault allegations were a result of 
a falling out amongst partners. The Excelsior Springs Call newspaper reported 
that Mitchell was guilty of stealing cattle, but not the crime he was hung 
for.[citation needed] The Great Depression did not have the impact on Excelsior 
Springs as it had on several other communities, surviving mostly due to 
its health resort status. Between 1930 and 1940, the town gained 370 citizens, 
reporting 4,800 total at the end of the decade, when populations in most 
other small towns were declining. In November 1931, one of the most intense 
gun battles happened at the historic Elms Hotel. Four robbers attempted 
to hold up the hotel and managed to flee by automobile, which were followed 
by local law enforcement. Gunshots were exchanged in the hotel lobby and 
veranda. The four criminals fled to nearby Kansas City, but were later 
apprehended. In 1932, Mafia gangster Lonnie Affronti shot Azalea Ross and 
her husband in an ambush shoot-out on Route 10. Ross was the chief witness 
in a narcotics trial against Affronti. The gangland aided in hiding Affronti 
for five years before he was captured in Brooklyn, New York, in 1937. One 
of his accomplices during the shoot-out, Charley Harvey, was apprehended 
and killed himself in the city jail a short time later. The present city 
hall, the Hall of Waters, was constructed between 1936 and 1938 by architects 
Keene & Simpson above the Siloam and Sulpho-Saline Springs. Citizens gathered 
on May 27, 1936, amongst national attention when the cornerstone of the 
Hall of Waters was lowered in place. CBS transmitted the event to 62 stations 
across the country. The local newspaper recorded many well-known names 
of the present time, including Hollywood B-movie actress Evalyn Knapp, 
artist Thomas Hart Benton, and author Homer Croy. In 1937 the structure 
was partially complete, and the water bar in the lower level opened, providing 
mineral waters to health-seekers and visitors alike. In the following months 
the mineral water pool was opened, along with male and female hydrotherapy 
departments. A two-story hall had also been erected where the minerals 
were made available at fountains. The first floor contained the women's 
bath department, sunroom, covered porch, grand foyer, management office 
for the springs, and the chamber of commerce. The swimming pool was large 
enough to met standards for championship meets. In the south wing were 
the special hydrotherapy departments devoted to research for the waters' 
medicinal values. The bottling department was located on the east side 
of the north wing, which shipped five varieties of bottled mineral water 
to locations all over the world. On Election Day 1948, Harry S. Truman 
spent the night at the Elms Hotel when it appeared that he was losing his 
re-election bid to Republican Thomas E. Dewey. However, in the wee hours 
of the morning, he was awakened by his aides informing him that he had, 
in fact, won the election. He was whisked away to Kansas City. He later 
was photographed at Union Station in St. Louis holding a copy of the Chicago 
Tribune that famously proclaimed "Dewey Defeats Truman." Flooding caused 
issues in 1955, and a dike was constructed, which resulted in the elimination 
of the stone terraces and walkways at Siloam Park, to protect the Hall 
of Waters from further flood damage by the nearby Fishing River. There 
were subsequent floods in the late 1960s, 1993,[11] and 2015.[12] The late 
1950s and early 1960s proved difficult times for the city due to the severe 
decline in popularity of the resort spa town. By 1967, the bottling operations 
had lost $25,000, and the city decided it was time to put their mineral 
water history behind them and move forward to new horizons. As of 2008[update], 
however, Excelsior Springs has licensed the rights to the mineral water 
to Excelsior Springs Bottling Company to allow for commercial bottling 
and distribution of the historic water.[13][14] Excelsior Springs sports 
a quaint historic downtown district, which is currently undergoing renewed 
development. Once haunted by empty buildings and numerous antique stores, 
there are now a quilt shop, an art store, and several small bistros alongside 
the old antique stores. Additionally, it is home to two theaters: The Paradise 
Playhouse, home to professional productions; and The Slightly Off-Broadway 
Theater, home to Excelsior Springs' local community theatre productions.[15] 
The actor Michael Douglas had his second starring role in a movie, Adam 
at Six A.M., which was released in 1970. The movie was filmed in Excelsior 
Springs, as well as in Cameron, Missouri. In 1974, the National Civic League 
selected Excelsior Springs as an All-America City, reinvigorating this 
small town somewhat.[17] The Greater Excelsior Springs Area conducted centennial
