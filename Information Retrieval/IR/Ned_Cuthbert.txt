Edgar Edward "Ned" Cuthbert (June 20, 1845 – February 6, 1905) was an American 
professional baseball player. Cuthbert's baseball career began in 1865 
with the Keystone Club of Philadelphia. After two seasons as a second baseman 
and outfielder with the Keystones, he moved across town to the West Philadelphia 
club, playing only four games for them before joining Philadelphia Athletics. 
With Cuthbert, the Athletics won national championships in 1867 and 1868. 
A solid batsman and outfielder, Ned jumped to the Chicago White Stockings 
in 1870. Cuthbert was with a number of teams in the National Association 
and its successor, the National League, playing in Philadelphia, Chicago, 
St. Louis, and Cincinnati. After game-fixing allegations surfaced as part 
of the Brown Stockings 1877 season, Brown Stockings ownership officially 
withdrew from the National League and folded the team. In time for the 
1878 season, Ned Cuthbert and four other former players of the Brown Stockings 
spent the next few years (1878–1881) playing as a reorganized, semi-professional 
baseball team, filling vacant positions with the best of the St. Louis 
amateur players. Cuthbert played with the semi-professional Brown Stockings 
(1878, 1879, and 1881) and the St. Louis Red Stockings (1880). It was Cuthbert 
who, while working at his saloon during these years, convinced grocery 
and saloon owner Chris von der Ahe to invest in the Brown Stockings and 
return them to professional baseball status. Von der Ahe purchased the 
Brown Stockings in 1880, changed their name to the Browns, and returned 
them to professional status in 1882. In 1882, Cuthbert became the player/manager 
for the St. Louis team of the newly formed American Association. The following 
year, Cuthbert relinquished the managerial duties but continued with the 
Brown Stockings as a player before jumping to the Baltimore Monumentals 
of the ill-fated Union Association in 1884, his final season. Reportedly, 
Ned stole the first base in organized baseball in 1865 while playing for 
the Philadelphia Keystones, simply by waiting for the pitcher to be distracted 
and running from first to second base. However, according to Peter Morris' 
"A Game Of Inches", base-stealing was part of baseball well before 1865; 
the earliest explicit account of stealing a base goes back to 1856. Ned 
Cuthbert died of endocarditis in St. Louis, Missouri, and was laid to rest
