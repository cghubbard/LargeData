As player As manager Ralph George Houk (/ˈhaʊk/; August 9, 1919 – July 
21, 2010), nicknamed The Major, was an American catcher, coach, manager, 
and front office executive in Major League Baseball. He is best known as 
the successor of Casey Stengel as manager of the New York Yankees in 1961–63, 
when his teams won three consecutive American League pennants and the 1961 
and 1962 World Series championships. A native of Lawrence, Kansas, Houk 
was a catcher working his way through the Yankees' farm system when the 
U.S. entered World War II. He enlisted in the armed forces, became an Army 
Ranger, and rose to Major (the source of his Yankee nickname). He was a 
combat veteran of Bastogne and the Battle of the Bulge, and was awarded 
the Bronze Star, Purple Heart, and the Silver Star with oak leaf clusters.[1][2] 
Returning to baseball after the war, Houk eventually reached the Major 
Leagues, serving as the Yankees' second- and third-string catcher behind 
Yogi Berra. A right-handed hitter, Houk played in only 91 games over eight 
seasons (1947–54), finishing with a batting average of .272. Although the 
Yankees participated in six World Series during that period, Houk had only 
two Series at bats (one in 1947, the other in 1952), batting .500. During 
his last five years as a big-league player (1950–54), Houk played in only 
31 regular-season games, made 30 total plate appearances, and caught 83 
innings.[3] But by 1953 he had transitioned to becoming the Yankees' full-time 
bullpen coach, effectively beginning his managerial apprenticeship. In 
1955 he was named manager of the Yanks' Triple-A affiliate, the Denver 
Bears of the American Association. Following three highly successful seasons 
at Denver, culminating with the 1957 league playoff and Junior World Series 
championships, Houk returned to the Bronx as Stengel's first-base coach 
from 1958–60. From late May through early June 1960, Houk served as acting 
manager of the Yanks for 13 games while Stengel, 70, was sidelined by illness. 
(The team won 7 and lost 6.) Then, after the Yanks lost the 1960 World 
Series to the Pittsburgh Pirates—and with Houk one of the hottest managerial 
candidates in baseball—the Yankees "discharged" Stengel (to use Stengel's 
own words) and promoted Houk. Houk was known as a "player's manager"—albeit 
one with a quick temper. Future Los Angeles Dodgers manager Tommy Lasorda 
briefly played for Houk at Denver and called Houk the best handler of men 
he ever played for, and modeled his managerial style on him.[4] The Kansas 
Sports Hall of Fame, of which Houk is a member, describes Houk as "rough, 
blunt and decisive" and his tantrums in arguments with umpires earned him 
45 ejections as a manager in the majors. Houk is tied with Billy Martin 
for fourteenth place on baseball's "most ejected" list.[5] The early 1960s 
Yankees responded to Houk's leadership; the 1961 team led by Roger Maris 
(61 home runs), Mickey Mantle (54 homers) and Whitey Ford (25 victories) 
won 109 games and beat the Cincinnati Reds in five games in the World Series. 
His 1962 club won 96 games, and were victorious over the San Francisco 
Giants in seven games in the Fall Classic. In 1963, the Yanks won 104 games 
and rolled to the pennant, but were swept in four games by the Los Angeles 
Dodgers in the Series. Houk moved into the Yankees' front office as general 
manager on October 23, 1963,[6] replacing Roy Hamey, and Berra, at the 
end of his playing career, became the Yanks' new manager. Yogi would win 
the 1964 pennant after a summer-long struggle with the Baltimore Orioles 
and Chicago White Sox, but Houk and the Yankee ownership quickly became 
disenchanted with Berra's work and in late August they made up their mind 
to fire him regardless of how the season turned out. After Berra's seven-game 
loss to the St. Louis Cardinals in the 1964 World Series, Houk sacked Berra. 
Later, Houk said that the Yankee brain trust had concluded Berra wasn't 
ready to be a manager, though he didn't elaborate on the reasoning.[7] 
To succeed Berra, he then hired Johnny Keane, who had just resigned as 
manager of the champion Cardinals. Houk had admired Keane as a competitor 
in the American Association from almost a decade before and according to 
author David Halberstam, the Yankees had made overtures to Keane during 
the 1964 regular season about becoming their manager for 1965.[8] But the 
great postwar Yankee dynasty was aged and crumbling, the farm system had 
seriously deteriorated, and the Kansas City Athletics were no longer a 
reliable source for Major League talent. Keane, a longtime minor league 
manager, was better suited by temperament for managing young players than 
established and aging superstars, and his hiring was a failure. The team 
fell to sixth in 1965—their first losing record since 1925, and only their 
second since 1918. When they won only four of the first 20 games of 1966, 
Houk fired Keane on May 7 and named himself manager, assuming that job 
for the second time. Houk (eventually succeeded as general manager by Lee 
MacPhail) thus began a second, and far less successful, term as Yankee 
manager, finishing the 1966 season. Their talent and farm system both depleted, 
the Yankees finished in last place for the first time since 1912. A long 
rebuilding process followed, including Bobby Richardson's retirement (Richardson's 
roommate, Tony Kubek, had retired because a bad back after the 1965 season) 
and the trading away of Maris, Clete Boyer and, during the 1967 season, 
Elston Howard. Houk would continue to manage the Yankees from 1967 until 
1973. His best season was 1970, when the Yanks won 93 games, but finished 
15 games behind the eventual World Series champion Baltimore Orioles. He 
worked for George Steinbrenner for one season, in 1973, and was the Bombers' 
manager during their final game in 1973 at the "original" Yankee Stadium 
prior to its closure for two years for renovation. After the final game 
of 1973, he resigned as manager. While Steinbrenner's commanding style 
has led some to think the new owner influenced Houk's departure, he told 
Bill Madden of the New York Daily News it was the constant booing of Yankee 
fans that pushed him. Houk even said that Steinbrenner insisted he'd get 
some new players to restore the team's greatness. "And he did, bringing 
in Catfish and Reggie, " Houk told Madden in the sportswriter's book Pride 
of October. "That'll make you good in a hurry!" Apart from a brief stint 
with the Detroit Tigers' Class B affiliate in Augusta, Georgia; he had 
spent the first 35 years of his adult life on the Yankees' payroll. On 
October 11, 1973—less than two weeks after Houk left the Yankee organization—he 
became the manager of the rebuilding Detroit Tigers. The veteran club (its 
1973 roster averaged 31.8 years of age[9]) had won the AL East in 1972 
under Billy Martin, but was in need of replacing its longtime stars, including 
Hall of Famer Al Kaline, with younger talent. The low point came in 1975, 
when Houk's team lost 102 games, but the 1976 Tigers improved their record 
by 14 games behind the heroics of rookie pitcher Mark Fidrych, who won 
19 games while becoming a national sensation. By 1978, Houk had restored 
Detroit to respectability and its first winning record since 1973, bringing 
to the team future stars of the Sparky Anderson Tigers such as Lou Whitaker, 
Alan Trammell and Jack Morris. After an 86–76 season in 1978, and with 
the roster's average age a youthful 26.3,[10] Houk retired. Houk's name 
had been linked by the media with the Boston Red Sox' managerial job since 
his days as a Yankees' coach. After two years of retirement, in the autumn 
of 1980, Houk, now 61, was ready to get back into baseball. In late October, 
when the Red Sox called about their opening (they had fired Don Zimmer), 
he jumped at the chance. Although not as daunting as his Detroit assignment, 
Houk faced another rebuilding job: the powerful Boston team of the 1970s 
was about to lose marquee players such as Carlton Fisk and Fred Lynn and 
needed to retool its roster. But Houk rose to the challenge, and in four 
seasons produced three over-.500 teams. On his watch, Boston broke in young 
players Wade Boggs, Roger Clemens, Bruce Hurst and Marty Barrett. When 
Houk retired from managing permanently in October 1984, just after his 
65th birthday, he bequeathed the core of another pennant winning ballclub 
(in this case, the 1986 Red Sox) to his successor, John McNamara. His final 
record, over 20 years with the Yankees (1961–63, 1966–73), Tigers (1974–78) 
and Red Sox (1981–84) was 1,619 wins and 1,531 losses (.514), plus eight 
wins and eight losses in the World Series. After his first three championship 
seasons, he never appeared in the postseason. Houk served with the Minnesota 
Twins as a special assistant to general manager Andy MacPhail, Lee's son, 
from 1987–89 before retiring from the game for good.[6] He thus enjoyed 
one additional world championship season, when the Twins defeated the Cardinals 
in the 1987 World Series. Colorful opinions about Houk can be found in 
Jim Bouton's classic 1970 memoir, Ball Four. Houk was Bouton's first big 
league manager and sparred with him over contracts when Houk was the Yankees' 
GM. Houk was portrayed by Bruce McGill in the 2001 film 61*. He died on 
July 21, 2010 in Winter Haven, Florida, just nineteen days before he would 
have turned 91. At age 90 he was, at the time, the oldest living manager 
of a World Series-winning, pennant-winning or post-season team. He was 
survived by a daughter, Donna; a son, Robert; four grandchildren and 10 
great-grandchildren. On July 22 the Yankees announced players and coaches 
would wear a black armband in Houk's memory on the left sleeve of their
