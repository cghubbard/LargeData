The St. Louis Cardinals 2016 season was the 135th for the Major League 
Baseball (MLB) franchise in St. Louis, Missouri, the 125th season in the 
National League (NL), and the 11th at Busch Stadium III. They entered the 
season having won a major-league best 100 games, as three-time defending 
NL Central division champions, and with five consecutive playoff appearances. 
Forbes magazine determined the value of the club to be $1.6 billion in 
2016, making them the seventh-most valuable franchise in MLB. The Cardinals 
were eliminated from playoff (Wild Card) contention following the San Francisco 
Giants' 7-1 victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers on Sunday, October 2. 
This was the first time the Cardinals failed to make the playoffs since 
2010. The Cardinals entered the 2016 season having won a major league-best 
100 games, their third consecutive National League Central division title,[1] 
and fifth consecutive playoff appearance.[2] Their 2015 season ended in 
the National League Division Series (NLDS) when the rival Chicago Cubs 
defeated them in four games.[3] Former Cardinals David Eckstein, Jim Edmonds 
and Troy Glaus were announced as first-time candidates on the 2016 ballot 
for the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum on November 9.[4] In 
mid-December, former Cardinals player and manager Joe Torre led an expedition 
to Cuba composed of MLB officials and players, including then-current Cardinals 
catcher Brayan Peña and former Cardinals outfielder Jon Jay. It was MLB's 
first visit there since 1999, and one anticipated as an important step 
to help normalize relations with the United States that had begun to ease 
earlier in the year.[5][6] Former Cardinals manager Vern Rapp died on December 
31, 2015.[7] Chris Correa, the previous director of scouting for the Cardinals, 
plead guilty on January 8, 2016, to five of 12 counts in a United States 
district court in Houston related to alleged corporate espionage of the 
Houston Astros. Reports of the investigation first became public in July 
2015.[8] For the 2016 franchise Hall of Fame ballot, the Cardinals announced 
on January 17 it would include Chris Carpenter, Keith Hernandez, Jason 
Isringhausen, Mark McGwire, Matt Morris, Édgar Rentería, Scott Rolen, and 
Joe Torre.[9] According to Forbes magazine, at $1.6 billion, the Cardinals 
were the seventh-most valuable franchise in MLB. Their revenue in 2015 
was $300 million, while their operating income was $60 million.[10] It 
was an increase from the year before at $1.4 billion, when they were ranked 
sixth in MLB.[11] On October 26, 2015, the club announced intent to retain 
all of manager Mike Matheny's coaching staff.[12] Greg Hauch resigned as 
the head athletic trainer in November, whom Adam Olsen replaced the following 
month.[13] Injuries to the starting rotation emerged: Carlos Martínez strained 
his shoulder late in the previous season and the Cardinals appraised him 
likely to recover in time for the beginning of the season.[14] Lance Lynn 
had Tommy John surgery, and on November 10, the Cardinals announced he 
would miss the 2016 season.[15] On December 17, catcher Yadier Molina underwent 
surgery on his left thumb, and second since the previous September, to 
correct a ligament that had not properly healed. He was estimated to miss 
at least part of spring training.[16] The Cardinals announced on January 
21, 2016, they had extended an invitation to spring training to 22 non-roster 
players in addition to those already on the 40-man roster, bringing the 
total at that point to start spring training with club 61. Further, 26 
of their prospects were also invited to their Spring training Early Program 
(STEP). The 22 non-roster invitees included pitchers RHP Silfredo Garcia, 
LHP Austin Gomber, RHP Juan González, RHP Jeremy Hefner, LHP Corey Littrell, 
RHP Deck McGuire, RHP Trey Nielsen, RHP Daniel Poncedeleon, RHP Robby Rowland, 
RHP J. C. Sulbaran, RHP Tyler Waldron, and RHP Luke Weaver. Non-pitchers 
included catchers Steve Bean, Luis Cruz, Eric Fryer, Carson Kelly, and 
Alberto Rosario. Also included were infielders Jonathan Rodriguez, David 
Washington, Jacob Wilson and Patrick Wisdom and outfielder Jeremy Hazelbaker.[51] 
The next day, the club invited outfielder Carlos Peguero.[38] The 26 players 
invited to STEP were Sandy Alcantara, John Brebbia, Junior Fernandez, Jack 
Flaherty, Derian Gonzalez, Josh Lucas, Mike Mayers, Alex Reyes, Arturo 
Reyes, Rowan Wick and Jacob Woodford; catchers Christopher Chinea, Jose 
Godoy, Ryan McCarvel and Brian O’Keefe; infielders Eliezer Alvarez, Paul 
DeJong, Juan Herrera, Chris Jacobs, Oscar Mercado, Darren Seferina and 
Edmundo Sosa; and outfielders Harrison Bader, C. J. McElroy, Nick Plummer 
and Magneuris Sierra.[51] Shortstop Jhonny Peralta injured his thumb on 
March 7, damaging the ulnar collateral ligament.[52] He underwent surgery 
three days later and was expected to miss 10 to 12 weeks of play.[53] Longtime 
3B coach Jose Oquendo for the past 16 years, is placed on medical leave 
of absence March 27, due to rehabbing his right knee in Florida. He has 
been on crutches after his second procedure on the knee. 1B coach Chris 
Maloney now moves to 3B, Assistant hitting coach Bill Mueller moves to 
1B coach. Derrick May who was in the organization's minor leagues, is now 
the assistant hitting coach.[54] The team suffered another unexpected injury 
in their final spring training game on March 31, when their newly acquired 
shortstop Ruben Tejada signed on March 19, strained his left quad running 
to first base in a 9–1 win over the New York Yankees. Jedd Gyorko will 
substitute for him and make the first game start in Pittsburgh on April 
3. The injury to Tejada forces the Cardinals to open the season with five 
players: Tejada, Jhonny Peralta, Mitch Harris, Lance Lynn and Jordan Walden, 
on the 15-day disabled list.[55] Another serious injury, this one to backup 
catcher Brayan Pena's left knee after slipping in a dugout a few days ago, 
puts him on the 15-day disabled list after surgery from two to four weeks, 
along with the five others. Non-Roster Invite Eric Fryer takes his place 
on the 25-man roster.[56] The Cardinals played Opening Day in the first 
game of the Major League Baseball (MLB) season on April 3, commencing at 
PNC Park against the division rival Pittsburgh Pirates. Adam Wainwright 
made his fifth career Opening Day start for the Cardinals. The game had 
a starting temperature of 39 degrees (F). Outfielder Tommy Pham suffered 
a tear in his left oblique in the first inning and placed on the 15-day 
disabled list (DL).[58] The Cardinals lost the game, 4–1, with Wainwright 
taking the first loss of the season. Free agent starting pitcher acquisition 
Mike Leake made his Cardinals debut on April 6 against the Pirates, allowing 
four runs and seven hits in 4 1⁄3 IP, resulting in being charged with the 
loss as Pittsburgh won, 5–1, and swept the opening series.[59] Yadier Molina, 
33, broke the all-time Cardinals' games catching record on April 8, in 
his 1,440th game, passing Ted Simmons (1968-1980). His 1,343 games started 
since the beginning of the 2005 season topped the majors.[61] On April 
8, Jeremy Hazelbaker, Aledmys Díaz, and Greg Garcia established a new MLB 
record by each hitting a pinch hit home run, becoming the first to hit 
three pinch hit home runs in one game for the same team. The previous record 
of two pinch hit home runs by the same team in the same game had previously 
occurred on 57 occasions, most recently in 2011. It was Díaz' first major 
league home run. The Cardinals won this contest, 7-4, over the Atlanta 
Braves.[62] Hazelbaker's home run gave him two in his first four career 
games, joining Joe Cunningham (1954) as the only Cardinals to accomplish 
the feat.[63] The Cardinals swept the Braves on April 10 in a 12–6 win. 
Brandon Moss hit his first career home run against Atlanta off Williams 
Pérez, thus giving him a home run against all 30 teams.[64] Seung-hwan 
Oh was credited with his first major league win.[65] Hazelbaker's first 
career four-hit game, including his first career triple, came in a 10–1 
victory over the Milwaukee Brewers in the Cardinals' April 11 home opener 
at Busch Stadium.[66] In his second appearance of the season, starter Jaime 
García turned in a career start against the Milwaukee Brewers on April 
14. He pitched a complete game, one-hit shutout while striking out a career-high 
13 batters and inducing 13 ground outs as St. Louis won, 7–0. He became 
the first left-handed pitcher in franchise history to achieve a one-hit 
shutout while striking out at least 13.[67] The 13 strikeouts were the 
most by a lefty since Steve Carlton struck out 16 in 1970, with García 
posting a game score of 97, a season-high for MLB through April 14. The 
Cardinals did not have a nine-inning complete game by a starter all of 
last season. It was the first one-hitter by a Cardinals' pitcher since 
Wainwright held the Arizona Diamondbacks to one hit on May 20, 2014.[68] 
In this game, Brandon Moss and Matt Adams both contributed pinch hit home 
runs.[69] The club was smoking hot at the plate on April 15, with a new 
Busch III record of six home runs in a 14-3 thrashing of Cincinnati. Matt 
Holliday hit his first two home runs of the season, Aledmys Díaz and Randal 
Grichuk both also hit their second on the year, and Brandon Moss and Matt 
Adams homered off the bench. Moss' and Adams' home runs were the fifth 
and sixth off the bench in 2016. The club had only four in the entire 2015 
season. The six home runs gave the team 17 in its first 10 games. They 
had only 137 in 2015 which ranked 25th out of the 30 teams. Cardinals pinch 
hitters are hitting .563 (9-for-16) with six homers and nine RBIs. The 
team record of 10 pinch hit home runs was set in 1998.[70][71] Joey Votto 
hit his first home run of the season, tying the single-game mark for two 
teams at Busch III with seven, done by these same teams one day before 
the 10th anniversary in doing it on April 16, 2006.[72] Catcher Eric Fryer 
made his first start for the Cardinals on April 17 at Busch Stadium against 
the Reds. He reached base in all four plate appearances, including three 
hits in three at bats and first walk of the season, to extend a streak 
of seven consecutive plate appearances reaching base to open the season. 
His collected his first two doubles for the Cardinals, including driving 
in Aledmys Díaz for the decisive run in a 4–3 win, allowing St. Louis to 
take two of three in the series from Cincinnati.[73] The Cardinals optioned 
Greg Garcia to their AAA-Memphis club on April 18, when they reactivated 
Rubén Tejada. Garcia had six hits in ten at bats for a .600 batting average, 
six runs scored, one double, one home run, two RBIs, four walks, a HBP, 
a .733 OBP, and a 1.000 SLG in 15 plate appearances.[74] Trevor Rosenthal 
recorded his 100th career save by striking out the side against the Chicago 
Cubs on April 20, becoming the fifth Cardinals pitcher to accumulate 100 
saves.[75] In an 11–2 win over the San Diego Padres on April 23, Díaz garnered 
his first five-hit game and Hazelbaker hit another pinch hit home run.[76] 
After collecting two hits in his first two at bats in a game against the 
Arizona Diamondbacks on April 25 to give him 26 hits in 52 at bats, Díaz 
became the first rookie in MLB history to carry at least a .500 batting 
average at any point after accumulating 50 at bats, per the Elias Sports 
Bureau.[77] On April 29, the club announced that former owner Sam Breadon, 
starting pitcher Chris Carpenter, center fielder Terry Moore, and catcher 
and manager Joe Torre were selected as the 2016 class to be inducted into 
the franchise Hall of Fame, with the enshrinement scheduled for August 
27, 2016.[78] The team ended April with a three-game losing streak at home 
to the Nationals, falling to 5-6 at Home, 7-6 on the Road, for a .500 record 
(12-12) for the month. The Cardinals, through the first month of 2016 having 
improved their run-scoring and home run rates from the previous season, 
likewise received increased hitting contribution from Wainwright. He hit 
his first home run of season in a 10–3 win over the Philadelphia Phillies 
on May 2, also being credited with his second win of the season.[79] In 
each of four consecutive plate appearances spanning April 27 to May 7, 
he became the first Cardinal pitcher since 1900 to garner an extra base 
hit while batting, per the Elias Sports Bureau.[80] Carpenter's first career 
walk-off home run came on May 7 in a 6–4 win over Pittsburgh.[81] Mike 
Leake, the club's top free agent acquisition in terms of amount of money 
awarded from the previous off-season, earned his first win a Cardinals 
uniform on May 10 against the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim in an 8–1 advantage.[82] 
Reliever Seth Maness landed on the DL for the first time in his career 
on May 14 (retroactive to May 13), after an exam revealed an inflammation 
on his right (pitching) elbow. He was having pitching difficulties, getting 
hit hard in his previous 1⁄3 inning against the Anaheim Angels on May 12. 
For the season, he has a 6.39 ERA and 1.97 WHIP in 12 2⁄3 innings. The 
velocity on all four of his pitches has been down an average of 2-3 mph 
this season. He will eventually be able to join a Minor League affiliate 
on a rehab assignment, instead of as a member of that club's roster. That 
rehab assignment can last up to 30 days.[83] To take Maness' place on the 
MLB roster, the club called up left-handed reliever Dean Kiekhefer from 
Memphis. He made his major league debut on May 14 in Los Angeles in the 
sixth inning against the Dodgers, striking out four and allowing no walks 
in 1 2⁄3 innings. The only hit and run charged to him—both firsts of his 
career—was a home run to Corey Seager.[84] Molina made the 1,500th career 
appearance overall of his major league career in the May 14 game against 
Los Angeles.[85] On May 19, Matt Carpenter established a new career-high 
six RBI in a game at Busch Stadium against the Colorado Rockies, with two 
doubles and his ninth HR of the season in a 13–7 win. Carpenter is the 
first Cardinal since Red Schoendienst in 1953 to record two doubles, a 
home run and six RBI in a single game, and the first Cardinals leadoff 
hitter since Shawon Dunston in 2000 to have six RBI in a single game. His 
batting average went up 13 points to .259, far below his .313 he was hitting 
after 41 games in 2015.[86] Reliever Jonathan Broxton started the season 
with a 2.25 ERA through May 19, but after allowing five earned runs while 
recording one out against the Arizona Diamondbacks on May 20 at Busch Stadium, 
his ERA jumped to 4.96, and the Diamondbacks held a 9–2 advantage.[87] 
As a result, backup infielder Rubén Tejada made his first major league 
appearance as a pitcher in the ninth inning, pitching one complete inning 
while allowing two earned runs on back-to-back home runs to Chris Herrmann 
and Brandon Drury.[88] The Cardinals #1 pitching prospect and #11 in all 
of MLB, Alex Reyes, returned from his 50-game suspension, pitching four 
scoreless innings on May 22, for AAA Memphis.[89] He gave up two singles, 
walked three, and struck out eight.[90] He tested positive for marijuana, 
and Major League Baseball suspended Reyes on November 9, 2015, for 50 games 
including the remainder of his Arizona Fall League play, and start of the 
2016 season.[91] Center fielder Randal Grichuk hit his first career walk-off 
home run on May 23 in a 4–3 win against the Cubs.[92] Reliever Mitch Harris 
is transferred to the 60-day DL, and the team bought LF José Martínez from 
the Kansas City Royals for cash.[93] Third Baseman Matt Carpenter was granted 
paternity leave to attend the birth of his first child on May 25, causing 
him to miss the rubber game against the Chicago Cubs. The team can replace 
him on the roster for up to three days before going with only 24 active 
players. The Cardinals recalled Greg Garcia from AAA Memphis to take Carpenter's 
place on the active roster.[94] After missing three games (May 25–27), 
Carpenter returned and Greg Garcia was also kept on the roster, hitting 
a torrid .615 for the season. Rubén Tejada was designated for assignment 
for the move to make room for Carpenter and to keep Garcia. Tejada had 
signed a one-year $1.5 mil. contract, but only hit .176 (6-for-34) with 
two doubles. Tejada can now choose to accept the Cardinals' assignment 
to Triple-A, or sign with another team.[95] While playing the Nationals 
in the seventh inning of a 2–1 loss at Busch Stadium on May 26, Stephen 
Drew hit a high infield fly that stayed over the pitcher's mound. With 
both Aledmys Díaz and Mike Leake attempting to catch the ball, Molina posited 
himself and waited. As the ball deflected off Díaz' glove, he almost collided 
with Leake, but Molina instinctively moved his glove and caught the ball 
before it hit the ground.[96] The Cardinals defeated the Nationals the 
next day, 6–2, as Stephen Piscotty hit his first career grand slam against 
Max Scherzer, Garcia homered and drew two walks batting leadoff[97] and 
Mike Matheny achieved his 400th career managerial win.[98] He managed his 
700th game on May 30, a 6–0 win against the Milwaukee Brewers. Matt Holliday 
collected his 1,000th career hit with the Cardinals on May 31 against the 
Brewers.[99] In a 3–1 loss to the Brewers on June 1, Brandon Moss' 10th 
home run, a pinch-hit, accounted for the only Cardinals' run of the game. 
In the 54th game of 2016, this tied the franchise club record for pinch-hit 
home runs in a season with 10, set in 1998. The Major League record is 
14, set in 2001, by both the Arizona Diamondbacks and San Francisco Giants. 
In 2001, the Diamondbacks were World Series champions, while the Cardinals 
and Giants in those respective years, hosted Mark McGwire and Barry Bonds 
both breaking the individual single-season home run record. The 2016 Cardinals, 
with 72 home runs at the one-third mark as a team, were 32 ahead of the 
year before. Through this point, Moss and Hazelbaker both led the 2016 
team with three pinch-hit home runs.[100] Warren and Carol Reckmeyer garnered 
fame in the 2015 series during which the Giants visited and a photograph 
of the couple walking to the game circulated that showed them wearing their 
Cardinals and Giants jerseys. When walking side by side, they jerseys read, 
“Together Since 1952.” From Mount Morris, Illinois, they threw out the 
first pitch on Saturday, June 3, 2016, to managers Matheny and Bruce Bochy, 
both former catchers. Warren wore his No. 19 Cardinals jersey while Carol 
wore her Giants No. 52 jersey.[101] Both Aledmys Díaz and Seung-Hwan Oh 
garnered early attention for the National League (NL) Rookie of the Year 
Award. As of June 6, Díaz was third in the NL in batting at .328 and had 
hit eight home runs and 30 RBIs.[102] Oh, in his first 31 games and 32 2⁄3 
innings pitched, had struck out 46 batters – tied for first among NL relievers 
– while walking eight and permitting an ERA of 1.65.[103] On June 6, 2B 
Kolten Wong was optioned to AAA-Memphis, in anticipation of Jhonny Peralta's 
activation from the disabled list.[104] On June 6, Matt Carpenter won the 
NL Major League Baseball Player of the Week Award for the May 30-June 5 
week. He batted .560 (14-for-25), with five doubles, two triples, three 
RBI, and 10 runs scored. He led all of MLB with a .577 OBP and his 10 runs. 
He slugged .920 for a 1.497 OPS. This was his second career weekly award, 
having won previously for the week of April 13−19, 2015.[105] He won it 
less than two weeks after the birth of his first child, daughter Kinley 
on May 25.[106] On June 17, Kolten Wong was recalled, while OF'er Jeremy 
Hazelbaker was optioned to AAA-Memphis. Wong played some of his seven games 
in centerfield, while hitting .429 (12-for-28), with 4 HR and 11 RBI. He 
hit safely in all seven games. Hazelbaker hit .250 in his 61 G with 7 HR, 
3 of them as a pinch-hitter. He led the team with 4 SB.[107] The day after 
Wong was recalled, OF'er Tommy Pham was recalled from AAA-Memphis on June 
18, and struggling OF'er Randal Grichuk was optioned. Grichuk hit only 
.206 with 8 HR, and 27 RBI in 62 G.[108] For the third consecutive day 
(June 19), the Cardinals recalled (activated) a player, and optioned another. 
RHP reliever Seth Maness was activated, and Dean Kiekhefer was optioned 
to AAA-Memphis.[109] On June 25, manager Mike Matheny told closer Trevor 
Rosenthal he would be used in a different role. The move will bump Rosenthal 
out of a closer's job that has been his since late in 2013. He had a frightful 
14.14 ERA in June and 5.63 for the season, and blew a save opportunity 
on June 24, when he gave up in succession a double, a walk, and then a 
game-winning three-run home run when leading 3-1 against the Seattle Mariners. 
He averaged 7.9 walks per 9 inn. His percentage of first-pitch strikes 
was only 61%. Matheny has not named a replacement closer, but said he will 
instead consider Seung Hwan Oh, Kevin Siegrist, and Jonathan Broxton as 
options for future save situations. Oh compiled 357 career saves pitching 
in Korea and Japan, and currently ranks among the top eight National League 
relievers in ERA (1.66), strikeouts (51), Holds (14) and WHIP (0.79). Broxton 
was an All-Star closer for the Dodgers in 2009 and 2010. He has compiled 
118 career saves, though none since 2014. Siegrist is the only Cardinals 
reliever besides Rosenthal to close a game (May 12) this season. He has 
tallied seven career saves and entered Saturday with a season ERA of 2.79.[110] 
The Cardinals tied a franchise record, not seen since 1940, with 13 extra-base 
hits (6 Home Runs, 5 Doubles, 2 Triples) in an 11-6 win against the Seattle 
Mariners, at Safeco Field on June 26. The six home runs, second time in 
a game this season (April 15), boosted the team total to 101. They had 
137 in all of 2015, and 105 in 2014. Matt Carpenter tripled, and hit two 
home runs in the barrage of 17 hits. Tommy Pham also hit two home runs. 
Jedd Gyorko hit one, as did Matt Holliday, the 150th for him as a Cardinals' 
player. All six home runs were solo blasts and all came in the sixth-ninth 
innings. The six home runs were one short of the seven for the franchise 
record, set in 1996, and 1913.[111][112] Backup catcher Brayan Pena was 
activated prior to the game on June 28, after missing 75 games on the DL. 
Eric Fryer was designated for assignment.[113] These moves drop the 40-man 
roster personnel to 38. Through the games on June 28, the Cardinals are 
the worst base-running team in the NL. The stat is called BsR, explained 
on the stat site Fangraphs as an all-encompassing base running statistic 
that considers “stolen bases, caught stealings, and other base running 
plays (taking extra bases, being thrown out on the bases, etc).” A BsR 
number of six is “great,” while zero is “average” and negative-six is “awful.” 
The Padres actually lead the NL with an astounding 12.2 BsR, while the 
Cubs are at 9.7. The Cards are minus-9.7. In 2015, the Cards finished 15th 
in baseball with a 0.7 BsR, essentially right at the league average.[114] 
The Cardinals ended June with a 15-23 (.395) home record. The team won 
50-plus home games in each of Mike Matheny's first four seasons, has now 
lost seven consecutive home games. They are 25-15 (.625) in away games, 
trailing only the Cubs and Giants. The Cardinals haven't finished a season 
with a losing home record since 1999. That team finished 75-86 overall.[115] 
Brandon Moss hit the longest home run in Busch Stadium history in a 4–2 
loss to Kansas City on June 30, which traveled 477 feet (145 m), and to 
that point, was the second-longest home run of the season in the major 
leagues.[116] Newly appointed part-time closer Kevin Siegrist had his season 
interrupted with a bout of mononucleosis. He was placed on the DL July 
1, retroactive to June 30. Sam Tuivailala was recalled.[117] Playing Milwaukee 
on July 2, Yadier Molina recorded his 1,500th career hit, becoming the 
34th catcher in MLB history, and second for the Cardinals, after Ted Simmons.[118] 
Oh recorded his first MLB save by pitching a perfect ninth with two strikeouts.[119] 
After the 9-8 win on July 3, the club is 43-38 at the end of the first 
half of the season. Their third consecutive Home win raises it to 18-23 
(.439). Away, they are 25-15 (.625). In 2015, the club was 55-26 (.679) 
at Home, 45-36 (.556) Away. On July 5, Infielder/Outfielder Brandon Moss 
was placed on the DL because of a sprained left ankle. Randal Grichuk was 
recalled.[120] On July 5, Matt Carpenter was named as a reserve (3B) to 
the NL All-Star team in San Diego, July 12.[121] Brayan Pena was back on 
the DL on July 6, with a left knee inflammation, after making only two 
starts after activated on June 28. He started July 5's game and went 0-for-3 
and allowed a passed ball, a wild pitch and two stolen bases. The club 
purchased Alberto Rosario from AAA-Memphis.[122] The Cardinals had swept 
4 teams this season coming into July. In the 2 series following each sweep, 
they are 9-15. After the sweep of the Brewers in the beginning of July, 
they lost 3 of 4 to the Pirates, winning the last game to make that record 
10-18. They then went to Milwaukee, losing the 1st game, but came back 
to win the final 2. Now 12-19 after sweeping an opponent. Matt Carpenter 
strained his right oblique muscle swinging at a pitch against the Pirates 
on July 6, and won't be able to play in the July 12 All-Star Game. Aledmys 
Diaz will replace him on that roster. Entering Thursday (July 7), Diaz's 
.319 average led NL shortstops. He ranked second with a .534 slugging percentage, 
and 54 runs scored. He is the first Cardinals' rookie since Albert Pujols 
to make the All-Star team.[123] Carpenter is the fourth player to go on 
the DL in the last week. As a leadoff hitter, Carpenter entered the day 
leading the NL with a .421 on-base percentage, and a .991 OPS. He also 
ranks among the league's top six in doubles (25), extra-base hits (44), 
walks (58), triples (5), runs (56), and slugging percentage (.570).[124] 
Before the first game after the All-Star Game break, on July 15, LH reliever 
Kevin Siegrist was activated from the DL, after missing 10 games. Sam Tuivailala 
was optioned to AAA.[125] Adam Wainwright pitched a three-hit, complete-game 
shutout and 5−0 win against Miami on July 15; the first hit he allowed 
was a double to Adeiny Hechavarria in the sixth inning. It was Wainwright's 
10th career shutout, and 22nd complete game, coming on the night of celebrating 
the 10th anniversary and tribute to the 2006 World Series championship 
team. Wainwright was a reliever, and threw the final, winning pitch in 
that World Series. It was the sixth shutout by the team in 2016, against 
four times being shutout. The Marlins, who have four players in the lineup 
batting higher than .300, were shut out for just the fourth time this year.[126] 
In the consecutive starts against the Milwaukee Brewers and San Diego Padres 
on July 10 and 18, Mike Leake struck out at least ten batters in consecutive 
games for the first time in his career, after previously having two total 
ten-strikeout games in 189 starts. Covering his previous 48 2⁄3 innings, 
he had struck out 45 batters while walking three.[127] In the first three 
games of the July 18−21 series against the Padres, Jedd Gyorko homered 
in each game. That included a streak of five consecutive games against 
San Diego with a home run, totaling six. He also had 13 hits in 21 at bats 
with 10 RBI. He had hit the go-ahead home run in both of the first two 
games of the series, including driving in all three in the 3−2 win in the 
second game.[128] By saving both games of a doubleheader on July 20, Seung-hwan 
Oh was the first Cardinals pitcher to do so since Jason Isringhausen in 
2004.[129] On July 21, with a 5−5 tie in the bottom of the ninth, Aledmys 
Díaz batted against Carlos Villanueva with the bases loaded and singled 
home the game-winning run for his first career walk-off hit.[130] On July 
22, while playing the Los Angeles Dodgers, Matt Adams hit a 444 feet (135 m) 
home run in the 16th inning for walk-off, 4−3, win. It was the second time 
in his career he had hit a walk-off home run in the 16th inning.[131] The 
Cardinals announced on July 23 that they had selected the contract of right-hand 
pitcher Mike Mayers to major his major league debut and start the following 
day against the Dodgers, a Sunday nationally-televised game on ESPN at 
Busch Stadium. Reliever Miguel Socolovich was optioned to AAA-Memphis. 
The club will be the last team in the Majors to employ a sixth starting 
pitcher this season when Mayers takes the mound. The need to find a fill-in 
starter was the result of the Cardinals having to play a doubleheader on 
July 20, and then a 16-inn. game on July 22.[132][133] He was destroyed 
by the Dodgers, giving up 9 runs, all earned, 8 hits (one Double, two HRs), 
walking two, striking out only one in just 1.1 IP. He endured the shortest 
start by a pitcher making his Major League debut in 12 years, and the first 
Cardinals pitcher in 92 years to allow six first-inning runs in his debut. 
His early exit meant that a bullpen two days removed from covering 10 innings 
had to shoulder another 7 2/3. Seth Maness threw a career-high 53 pitches 
over 3 2/3 innings to settle things.[134] After the Mayers' debacle the 
previous night, on July 25, the Cardinals optioned him back to AAA, and 
purchased the contract of RHP Jerome Williams, 34. To make room for him 
on the 40-man roster, Jordan Walden was transferred from the 15-day to 
the 60-day disabled list.[135] RHP Reliever Trevor Rosenthal was placed 
on the 15-day disabled list July 26, from a right shoulder inflammation 
in his rotator cuff. LHP Dean Kiekhefer was recalled from AAA. RHP Sam 
Tuivailala will be recalled after the opener of that day's double-header 
to serve as the 26th man.[136] The Cardinals won the scintillating back-and-forth 
rubber game 5-4 on July 27, in New York with a two-run ninth-inning rally, 
pushing them past that team in the Wild Card standings. Yadier Molina tied 
the game 4-4 with a one-out double to centerfield in the top of the ninth, 
and later, a two-out pinch-hit double by Kolten Wong gave them the deciding 
fifth run. It was the first blown save by Mets' closer Jeurys Familia, 
who had 36 for the season going into the ninth inning, since July 30, 2015. 
He had 52 consecutive saves in that span of 363 days (excluding the 2015 
playoffs), the third longest streak in history.[137] With their 11-6 win 
in Miami July 29, the Cardinals have a 31-17 (.646) Road record, best in 
baseball. Their Home record is 25-30 (.455), for a 56-47 record, nine-games-over 
.500 high point for the season. They also moved past the Marlins into the 
second Wild Card spot, behind the Dodgers, who have a two-game lead. The 
game marked the 10th time this season that the Cardinals have scored 11 
or more runs in a game. From 2014-15, the club reached that level of offensive 
output only five times. The burst of scoring snapped a streak of six consecutive 
one-run wins by the club.[138] On the day before the non-waiver trade deadline 
this year (Mon. Aug. 1, 3pm), the Cardinals traded outfielder Charlie Tilson 
for LHP reliever Zach Duke, 33. Duke led the AL with 53 appearances mostly 
in a setup role which is how the Cardinals plan to use him, posting 2-0, 
2.63 ERA and 1.25 WHIP over 37 2⁄3 innings. Duke is under contract in 2017, 
earning $5 mil. this year and $5.5 mil. next year.[139] LH batters hit 
.264 against him compared to .182 for righties, a backwards split contrasting 
with the usual split for pitchers. But RH batters have walked 13 times, 
giving them a .325 OBP against Duke, compared to him walking LH batters 
only 3 times for a .299 OBP.[140] At the end of July, the Cardinals HOME 
record is 25-30 (.455), AWAY record 31-19 (.620). All-Star shortstop Aledmys 
Diaz (26 on August 1), will go on the DL August 2, with a hairline fracture 
in his right thumb. He was hit by a pitch on July 31, from Marlins' starter 
Andrew Cashner. He is expected to miss several weeks. Jhonny Peralta will 
take over at shortstop when he comes off the DL, August 2. Diaz was hitting 
.312/.376/.518 with 14 home runs and 57 RBIs.[141] He was the only Cardinals' 
player to appear in last month's All-Star Game.[142] Brandon Moss (missed 
25 G), and Jhonny Peralta (missed 15 G) were activated from the DL on August 
2. Recent trade LH-reliever Zach Duke was added to the roster. To make 
room, OF'er Randal Grichuk and LH-reliever Dean Kiekhefer were optioned 
to AAA-Memphis.[143] The rash of debilitating injuries continued on August 
2, when it was determined after the game that LH-reliever Tyler Lyons had 
a stress reaction on his sore right knee, and will be placed on the DL, 
August 3. He had underwent treatment, but a scan revealed it was more than 
just discomfort. The move to the DL is retroactive to July 31, and Dean 
Kiekhefer was recalled from Memphis.[144] Infielder Matt Carpenter was 
activated on August 5, after missing 24 games from his in-game July 6 injury. 
LH-reliever Dean Kiekhefer was optioned to AAA-Memphis.[145] The Cardinals 
before the August 5th game (57-51 .528) lost two of three games to the 
worst team—with the fewest runs scored in baseball, the Atlanta Braves, 
(39-69 .361), thanks to the final two games. The relief pitchers in the 
ninth inning of game two (5-13) were blasted for six runs, and starter-ace 
Adam Wainwright was hit hard for six runs in the first two innings in game 
three (3-6), although kept in the game through six innings giving up nine 
hits in total, but no more runs. Carlos Martinez now 10-7, and Wainwright 
now 9-6, took the losses. The team has now lost consecutive series, six 
of eight games, against last-place clubs (Cincinnati Reds and Braves). 
The team dropped to 1⁄2 game behind the Miami Marlins for the final Wild 
Card spot.[146] In the wildest and largest ninth-inning comeback win all 
season, the Cardinals at home on August 8, scored all five of their runs 
in the bottom of the ninth after two outs, for a 5-4 win. Previously, the 
team was an awful 2-45 when trailing after eight innings. The team fell 
into a 0-4 hole, and were 0-for-11 with runners in scoring position. It 
was the 10th time in the last 15 games that a starter could not get to 
the sixth inning. Down to his last strike at 1-2, Brandon Moss got the 
tying run in with a bases-loaded walk, and Yadier Molina then finished 
off the improbable comeback win by getting hit in the ribs by a pitch. 
The Cardinals have won three of the last four Major League games to end 
on a walk-off hit-by-pitch. It happened most recently for St. Louis on 
Aug. 14, 2014, when Jon Jay took a pitch off his body. That was also against 
the Reds. With the win, the team got its 59th win against 53 losses, tying 
the Miami Marlins for the second Wild Card spot with 50 games remaining 
in the season.[147] Michael Wacha could go only five innings, as the fifth 
starter in a week to not get to the sixth inning.[148] RHP Michael Wacha 
was placed on the DL with right shoulder inflammation on August 9, the 
day after his five-inning start. Backup catcher Brayan Pena was transferred 
to the 60-day DL, to make room for the Cardinals purchasing their long-awaited, 
ninth-best prospect in baseball, RHP Alex Reyes from AAA-Memphis, and added 
him to the roster.[149] He made his debut that evening (20 days before 
his 22nd birthday), pitching a perfect ninth inning in getting his first 
batter to strike out, with a speed gun registering 101.4 mph. The next 
two batters were ground outs.[150] The merry-go-round on yet another Cardinals' 
player injured and to the DL continues, this time it is first-baseman Matt 
Adams early on August 11, with a right shoulder inflammation. Some extra 
throwing work earlier in the week may have triggered the injury. It was 
not considered prudent to have Adams stay unplayable on the bench with 
four big games in Chicago on Aug. 11-14, against the division leading Cubs 
(71-41 .634), on a season-high nine-game winning streak. The Cardinals 
are 12 games behind (60-54 .526), going 4-6 on their last ten games, but 
tied with the Miami Marlins for the final Wild Card spot, with 48 games 
to go. Outfielder Randal Grichuk was recalled from AAA.[151] For the 11th 
time since July 1, another Cardinals' player is headed to the DL. Matt 
Holliday had his right thumb fractured from a HBP from Cubs' reliever Mike 
Montgomery in the 10th inning of their first game of the four-game series, 
August 11. It will also be the fifth Cardinals' player on the DL since 
the beginning of August. Four of the 10 who were on the DL have returned 
to the active roster.[152] Luke Weaver made his debut in Chicago on August 
13 ending their 11-game unbeaten streak in the month, pitching four innings, 
giving up just two runs on four hits (Double and two-run HR by Addison 
Russell), striking out three, and walking three. Alex Reyes gets his first 
major league win in relief, pitching three innings (fifth-seventh), giving 
up only one hit, while walking one and striking out three. Brandon Moss 
hit his 20th home run, a solo blast in the sixth, cutting the Chicago lead 
to 2-1. Jedd Gyorko hit his 17th home run in the seventh, a solo blast 
that tied the score. Two runs on a wild pitch and a bases-loaded walk gave 
the Birds a 4-2 lead. But the big blow was then a grand slam in the eighth 
inning by 25th birthday boy Randal Grichuk. It was only the second time 
a Cardinals' player has hit a grand slam on his birthday, with Colby Rasmus 
the first. It was the first slam by a Cardinals' player at Wrigley Field 
since Adam Kennedy in 2008. Grichuk has hit two home runs since his recall 
from AAA on August 11.[153] For the 12th time since July 1, and sixth for 
August, a Cardinals' player is headed to the DL. Reliever Seth Maness on 
August 16 came aboard the DL train for the second time in 2016 (May 14-June 
19), missing 31 games. He will undergo season-ending Tommy John surgery 
on August 18, missing the remaining 44 games in 2016, and maybe all of 
the 2017 season. Reliever Sam Tuivailala was recalled. Matt Holliday will 
have surgery August 17 on his fractured right thumb. His prognosis for 
returning before the end of the season is unknown. After a medical review 
of his injury, Maness had surgery to fix his Ulnar collateral ligament 
of elbow joint instead of Tommy John surgery ligament replacement, drastically 
reducing his recovery time from 12–15 months to 6–8 months, which would 
make him available for Spring Training in 2017.[154][155] Rookie Luke Weaver 
got his first major league win (now 1-1), at home in the first of a three-game 
set against the Oakland Athletics, winning 3-1 on August 26. He celebrated 
his 23rd birthday on the 21st. Jedd Gyorko gave him all the runs he would 
need with a two-run home run in the first inning. Weaver became the sixth 
Cardinals' pitcher since 1913 to strike out seven in his home debut. He 
gave up just four hits (Double and a Home Run) and two walks in six innings. 
His ERA dropped to 3.60 and WHIP to 1.18 with 22 strikeouts, against 17 
hits and five walks in his season total of 18.2 innings. Native St. Louisan 
and starter, lefty Ross Detwiler picked up the loss (now 1-3), going 5.1 
innings. The A's haven't played in St. Louis since 2010.[156] Yadier Molina 
played in his 1,580th game as a member of the St. Louis Cardinals on August 
26, 10th all-time. He tied Rogers Hornsby and Ray Lankford on the list 
of most games played by a Cardinals' player.[157] Alex Reyes, 21, will 
make his first MLB start at home on August 27, while Mike Leake recovers 
from a case of the shingles. He turns 22 on August 29. As a reliever, he 
has pitched 9 1⁄3 innings, has held opponents to five hits and no runs. 
He's struck out 13 and walked four. In 14 starts with Triple-A Memphis 
this season, Reyes went 2-3 with a 5.23 ERA and 1.454 WHIP. Though he averaged 
12.5 strikeouts per nine innings, Reyes was often hampered by a lack of 
efficiency and lapses in command. Nevertheless, his repertoire -- highlighted 
by a fastball that can reach triple digits, a curveball and changeup -- 
makes him one of the franchise's most hyped prospects in years. Reyes ranked 
by MLB Pipeline as the Cardinals' No. 1 prospect and as the eighth-best 
prospect in baseball. Leake, who is 9-9 with a 4.56 ERA, had not previously 
missed a start this season.[158] As of August 27, with Carlos Martinez, 
24 (born on Sep. 21), Alex Reyes, 21 (born on Aug. 29), and Luke Weaver, 
23, (born on Aug. 21) all in the rotation, the Cardinals have three of 
the most exciting young starting pitching talents in baseball. Reyes' start 
on August 27, at home against the Oakland Athletics showed his potential 
giving up only two hits (both singles), striking out four and giving up 
just one run, but also weak spots with lack of command a key factor in 
his giving up four walks and long innings. He pitched 4 2⁄3 innings, throwing 
89 pitches. His fastball hit 100 mph, has an above-average curve, and mixed 
in 22 changeups which manager Mike Matheny described as "incredible." Another 
bright side was starting his major league career with 14 scoreless innings, 
snapped in that fifth inning. His ERA is now an impressive 0.64 over 14 
innings in six games (1 Win, 1 Save), striking out 17, walking eight, giving 
up seven hits for a 1.07 WHIP.[159] In the game, the team blew a 2-1 lead 
in the eighth inning, losing 2-3.[160] Through August 28, the team continues 
to struggle for wins at Home, compared to their #1 baseball ranking on 
the Road. The last time the Cardinals lost more Home games than the 37 
presently, was in the non-playoff year, 2007. They averaged 52.5 Home wins 
during Mike Matheny's first four seasons. They would have to win 11 of 
their final 14 Home games to finish at Home over .500. Statistically, the 
biggest inconsistency between the team's home and road results has been 
on the offensive side. The Cardinals have averaged 5.58 runs per game and 
1.58 homers per game away from Busch Stadium. At home, those averages are 
4.4 and 1.28, respectively. The difference in home and road ERAs is negligible. 
If there's a silver lining for the Cardinals, who hold a half-game lead 
for the NL's second Wild Card spot, it's this: 19 of their next 26 games 
will be on the Road, before their final seven games at Home. Only two NL 
teams have a worse Home record: the Atlanta Braves (19-44) with a 48-83 
record, and the Arizona Diamondbacks (25-43) with a 55-76 record. The San 
Diego Padres are 30-34 with a 55-75 record, and the Philadelphia Phillies 
are 30-33 with a 60-70 record, for two bad teams that are better at Home. 
Their arch-rivals in the Central Division, the Chicago Cubs are a blistering 
45-19 (.703) at Home, and an excellent 37-28 (,569) on the Road, for an 
overall MLB best 82-47 (.636), leading the Cardinals by 14 games, with 
only 33 games remaining.[161] For the 13th time since July 1, and the seventh 
in August (six in July), a player is placed on the DL. RHP and starter 
Mike Leake has a severe case of the shingles and wasn't healing fast enough. 
His DL on August 29, is retroactive to August 22. He is 9-9 with a 4.56 
ERA in 25 starts, and eligible to return on Sept. 6. LHP reliever Dean 
Kiekhefer was recalled.[162] For the entirety of a lackluster season, the 
Cardinals haven't been able to eclipse the 10 games over .500 mark. Prior 
to the August 31st game against the Brewers, the Cards had gone into five 
games this season with the chance to get to 10 games over .500 with a win. 
After the loss to the Brewers, they are now 0-6, while being outscored 
15-40 in those games. On September 2, Matt Adams was activated from the 
DL, after missing 18 games since August 10, from his right shoulder inflammation. 
He was hitting .248 with 12 home runs and 44 RBIs before his injury. He 
played five rehab games at AAA-Memphis, hitting .188 including 1 double 
and 1 home run. The rosters expanded on September 1, allowing the present 
26 active players, while 14 remain inactive or on the DL.[163] On September 
4, catcher Brayan Pena was activated from the 60-day DL, and AAA-Memphis 
rookie catcher Carson Kelly, 22, was purchased. Shortstop Dean Anna was 
designated for assignment to make room for Kelly on the 40-man roster. 
Seth Maness was transferred from the 15-day to the 60-day DL.[164] Newly 
called-up catcher Carson Kelly made his debut on September 5, against the 
Pittsburgh Pirates with a line-drive double in the eighth inning, and then 
scored his first run. He also was credited with his first assist as catcher 
in a 2-3 strikeout play.[165] Three final call-ups from the minors happened 
on September 6, when José Martínez (OF) making his major league debut, 
and two relievers who were here earlier, Mike Mayers, and Sam Tuivailala.[166] 
Yadier Molina's fourth career grand slam on September 6, gave the 2016 
Cardinals an NL record tying 25 consecutive games with at least one home 
run, matching the San Diego Padres set earlier this year. The major league 
record is 27 games, set by the 2002 Texas Rangers. The grand slam was Molina's 
first since 2012. It was the team's 197th home run for 2016, leading the 
NL. Their team record is 235 set in 2000.[167] In yet another improbable 
comeback on September 6, the Cardinals won a critical game against the 
Pittsburgh Pirates, 9-6, with two outs and two strikes against Matt Carpenter 
leading off the ninth, trailing 5-6. He homered for the 18th time this 
season, tying the game at 6-all. Yadier Molina hit a double and then hot-hitting 
Randal Grichuk smashed his 22nd home run, giving them an 8-6 lead. Jhonny 
Peralta made it back-to-back with his seventh home run of the year, ending 
the five-home run night for the Redbirds and a 9-6 win after Seung Hwan 
Oh got his 16th save. Molina in the first inning hit a grand slam, seventh 
this year, with Matt Adams adding his 14th homer in the third inning for 
a 5-0 lead. The Pirates stormed back to take the lead after scoring one 
in the third, one in the fourth, and four in the fifth inning. Mike Mayers 
got his first major league win in relief with a scoreless eighth inning, 
keeping the team just one run behind. His debut on July 24 was one of the 
worst in MLB history, but this night he was perfect. The Cardinals now 
lead the NL with 201 home runs with their fourth five-homer game. Carpenter's 
home run was the first pinch-hit blast of his career, but the 15th by the 
team this season setting a new MLB record. The previous Major League high 
had been 14, set by the 2001 Arizona Diamondbacks and 2001 San Francisco 
Giants. Eight different Cardinals have contributed a pinch-hit homer this 
season.[168][169][170] Mike Leake, recovered from his two-week fight with 
shingles, is activated on September 7. He starts against the Pirates, who 
are mired in their eight-game losing streak, longest for them since 2011.[171] 
The Cardinals have allowed 69 steals against them through September 8, 
while they have stolen only 32. Yadier Molina is not at fault as much as 
the pitchers letting the runners get good jumps, instead of holding them 
closer to first base. Since his debut in 2004, the team has never allowed 
more than 64 steals until this year. Molina's pop time -- defined as the 
time elapsed from the moment the pitch hits the catcher's mitt to the moment 
the intended fielder receives the throw -- is the same as it was last year 
(1.92 seconds), when he allowed 37 stolen bases and ranked third in the 
National League with a caught-stealing percentage of 41. That pop time 
ranks seventh best among all catchers in 2016. The dip in Molina's average 
arm strength on steal attempts -- 80.51 mph to 79.85 mph -- isn't enough 
to alone explain the increase in attempts. There is great responsibility 
on the pitching staff. Mike Leake has allowed a career-high 13 steals for 
the most on the staff, while Jaime Garcia has allowed 11.[172] Another 
Home loss on September 8, gave the Cardinals 38 at Home, most since their 
franchise 2007 season record. They have only 30 wins for a .441 winning 
percentage, with 13 remaining Home games. The 12-5 loss to the lowly Milwaukee 
Brewers dropped them out of the second Wild Card spot. A club that never 
had a dozen runs scored off it at home last year has now had it happen 
three times in 2016. Still seeking their first home series win since July, 
the Cardinals fell to 2-8 in the first game of a homestand with this loss.[173] 
The last team to advance to postseason play with a losing home record was 
the 2001 Atlanta Braves. The surprising shortstop, Aledmys Diaz was activated 
before the game on September 11, after missing 36 games from a right thumb 
fracture suffered on July 31.[174] Diaz was hitting .312/.376/.518 with 
14 home runs, 25 doubles, 57 RBIs, and 64 runs scored in 96 games at the 
time of his injury.[175] For the 13th consecutive year starting in 2004, 
the team surpassed 3 million in home attendance on September 11.[176] Carson 
Kelly made his first start as catcher on September 11. Fellow rookie Luke 
Weaver was the starting pitcher. Both started the 2015 season at Class 
A Advanced Palm Beach. Kelly was taken in the second round in the 2012 
draft. Weaver was the Cardinals' first-round pick (27th overall) in the 
2014 Draft.[177] Former starter Michael Wacha was activated on September 
14, and will be placed in the bullpen as a reliever for the remainder of 
the season.[178] The 2017 season opens for the Cardinals against the Cubs 
at home on April 3 (3:15pm tentative) for a three=game set. An opening-series 
matchup between the Cubs and Cards in St. Louis hasn't happened since 2000. 
It will be the first time since 2011 that the Cardinals will open the season 
at home. The Cardinals' schedule is home-heavy early, with 50 of the team's 
81 home games to be played before the All-Star break. St. Louis will end 
the year at home with series against division opponents Chicago (Sept. 
25-28) and Milwaukee (Sept. 29-Oct. 1).[179] Former closer Trevor Rosenthal 
was activated from the DL before the September 15 game. Rosenthal went 
on the DL July 26, with a 5.13 ERA in 40 appearances. He boasted a strikeout 
rate of 13 per nine innings, but also had the worst walk rate (7.3) of 
his career.[180] Alex Reyes was promoted from the bullpen to be a starter, 
replacing the declining and struggling starter Jaime Garcia. The decision 
by manager Matheny came two days after Garcia lasted a career-short 1 2⁄3 
innings in his 29th start of the season. Garcia now shifts to the bullpen. 
His role will be an unfamiliar one, as Garcia hasn't pitched in relief 
since he was a rookie in 2008. This was not a planned move, but Garcia's 
8.23 ERA over his last six starts necessitated a change by the Cardinals, 
who are locked in a tight Wild Card race with the Giants and Mets. Reyes 
has made a strong first impression since his Aug. 9 callup. Despite a walk 
rate of 5.1, he's posted a 1.29 ERA and struck out 34 over 28 innings. 
In his two previous spot starts, Reyes allowed three runs in 10 2⁄3 innings. 
[181] With their 70th loss in San Francisco (76 wins, .521) on September 
15, the Cardinals were officially eliminated from the NL Central title. 
They are 17 games behind the Cubs with 16 games to play. The Cubs having 
lost earlier, clinched with their previous 93 wins (53 losses .637). It 
was the first NL Central title for them since 2008.[182] The win moved 
the Giants one game in front of the New York Mets and two games ahead of 
the Cardinals in the National League Wild Card standings.[183] With four 
RBI against Colorado on September 20, Adam Wainwright increased his season 
total to 18, breaking the record for all pitchers in the designated hitter 
(DH) era – since 1973 – and the most since Ferguson Jenkins drove in 20 
for the Cubs in 1971.[184] He presently has 13 hits (7 Doubles, 1 Triple, 
2 HRs) in 58 AB for a .224/.250/.483 line.[185] For the modern Cardinals' 
record, Bob Gibson had 19 RBIs in 1970, with 33 hits (3 Doubles, 1 Triple, 
2 HR) in 109 AB for a .303/.347/.404 line.[186] The Cardinals had a notable 
attendance streak snapped on September 26, as the club did not draw at 
least 40,000 at Busch Stadium for the first time since Sept. 24, 2013. 
The streak spanned 240 games. Monday's announced attendance was 34,942 
in a miserable 2-15 loss, keeping them one game out of the second Wild 
Card spot with six games to play.[187] Long-time Cardinals' outfielder 
since 2009, Matt Holliday was activated from the DL on September 30, with 
a present .242/.318/.450 line with 19 home runs and 60 RBIs. He was informed 
earlier in the week that the team would not pick up his 2017 option for 
$17 million, and would pay the contractual $1 million buyout. He signed 
a $120 million seven-year extension deal after the 2009 season in the largest 
contract in Cardinals' history. He averaged 147 games played for the first 
five years, but injuries severely hurt his playing time in 2015 and this 
year. He posted five 20-homer seasons and four 90-RBI seasons. Holliday 
produced a cumulative WAR of 24.1 in those eight years. According to Fangraphs, 
which created a tool to convert WAR to dollars in order to estimate the 
value of a player, Holliday has been worth $168.6 million since 2010. He 
was active in the community with many charity appearances. He will turn 
37 in mid-January 2017, after playing 13 major league seasons, the first 
five with the Colorado Rockies, and first half of 2009 with the Oakland 
Athletics until traded on July 24 to the Cardinals. After what could be 
his final at-bat with the Cardinals at home on September 30, against the 
Pittsburgh Pirates, he hit his first ever pinch-hit home run, his 20th 
of the season, giving him 61 RBIs for the season, in his 980th game with 
the Cardinals that included six 20-homer seasons.[188] With his 20th home 
run, Holliday became the sixth Cardinals' player to reach that mark, tying 
the NL record held by the 1965 Milwaukee Braves, and later 2003 Atlanta 
Braves. The homer also extended the team's pinch-hit home run major league 
record, now 17.[189] He singled in a crucial second run in the 4-3 come-from-behind 
win over the Pirates, in his second consecutive pinch-hit appearance, October 
1, giving him 62 RBIs for the season. His 2016 statistics now show for 
109 games played in 382 at-bats: .246/.322/.461 with a .782 OPS, with 48 
runs, 94 hits (including 20 doubles, 1 triple), 35 walks, 71 strikeouts, 
8 hit-by-pitches, and 9 ground-into-double plays, with a 107 OPS+. For 
his eight years with the Cardinals, he hit .293/.380/.494 with an .874 
OPS, and 138 OPS+ in 981 games and 3,581 at-bats.[190] He gave a brief 
appearance in left field in the team's 162nd game, for 110 games in 2016, 
and 982 games as a Cardinals' player. The team has not completely ruled 
out a new contract in 2017 with him, although neither side expects it to 
happen.[191] The attendance (38-43 .469) was 3,444,490 down 2.2% from the 
3,520,889 in 2015. Their attendance is second in the 15-team NL only to 
the Los Angeles Dodgers that has over four times the St. Louis metro population.[192] 
Away, the club was 48-33 (.593), among the best in MLB. Scored 779 runs, 
giving up 712, +67. In 2015, scored 647, allowed 525, +122. Home record 
was the worst for the team since 1997, at 41-40 (.506). Before that, the 
1990 Cardinals were 34-47 (.420). Regular Season Schedule (calendar style)

Cardinals - PITCHING) Source: Cardinals front office After testing positive 
for marijuana, Major League Baseball suspended pitching prospect Alex Reyes 
on November 9, 2015, for 50 games including the remainder of his Arizona 
Fall League (AFL) play and start of the 2016 season.[91] A total of eight 
players were selected from the Cardinals system in the rule 5 draft on 
December 10: Luis Perdomo (RHP to Colorado), Fernando Baez (RHP to Tampa 
Bay), Juan Caballero (RHP to Miami), Cory Jones (RHP to Baltimore), Mike 
O'Neill (OF to Cubs), Jhonny Polanco (RHP to Boston), Robelys Reyes (SS 
to Arizona) and Kender Villegas (RHP to Milwaukee). The Cardinals selected 
Matthew Bowman, a right-handed pitcher, from the New York Mets.[228] Entering 
the 2016 season, MLB.com ranked Reyes as the tenth-best prospect in all 
the minor leagues, and Baseball Prospectus at number 13.[229] The Cardnials 
sold Carlos Peguero's contract to the Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles of Nippon 
Professional Baseball (NPB) on July 8.[230] In their updated prospect rankings, 
Baseball America placed Reyes second of all prospects in baseball in their 
July 8 update. Also making the top 100 were Luke Weaver (75), Jack Flaherty 
(88), and Harrison Bader (89).[231] In 2016, the Cardinals signed three 
Cuban players as free agents: outfielders Randy Arozarena ($1.25 million 
on July 27) and Jonatan Machado, and right-handed pitcher Johan Oviedo.[232] 
The draft was held on June 9–11, 2016, at Secaucus, New Jersey. Day one 
of the MLB Draft included the first 77 overall selections. The Cardinals, 
in addition to their trio of first-round picks, will also make the 70th 
overall selection that day. Because they posted MLB's best record in 2015, 
the Cardinals receive the last pick in each subsequent round. Rounds 3–10 
will be held on June 10, followed by rounds 11–40 a day later. The Cardinals 
have not yet announced who they will send to Secaucus to serve as their 
on-site representative for the event's first day.[237] Because Heyward 
and Lackey both received qualifying offers and signed with the Chicago 
Cubs as free agents prior to the 2016 season, the Cardinals were allotted 
a total of three selections within the first 40 picks.[238] Former Cardinals' 
relief pitcher Randy Flores (2004–08) is in his first year as scouting 
director for any team, and is the fourth scouting director for the club 
since 2011. Instead of an analytical background as were his three predecessors, 
he brings a unique perspective as a former player.[239] The organization 
has been assigned a pool of $9.1433 million to use when signing players 
taken in the first 10 rounds. In addition, any bonus greater than $100,000 
for a player taken after the 10th round will apply toward the bonus-pool 
total. Any team going up to 5 percent over its allotted pool will be taxed 
at a 75 percent rate on the overage. Overspending beyond 5 percent would 
cost the team future Draft picks, which the Cardinals are not expected 
to do. The signing deadline is July 15.[240] According to one MLB.com columnist, 
the Cardinals had the second-best draft of the 30 teams, with only the 
first-pick team in all rounds, Philadelphia Phillies, getting more raw 
talent and expected signable draftees.[241] With their 42 picks, the Cardinals 
drafted 16 RHP's, 10 outfielders, 4 LHP's, 3 SS's, 3 C's, 3 2B-men, 2 3B-men, 
and 1 1B-man. Their first-round (compensatory A round) pick, Dylan Carlson 
rescinded his college commitment to California State University-Fullerton 
on June 14, and agreed to a signing bonus of $1.35 mil., which is $550,500 
under the slot value for the 33rd draft pick.[242] Three more draft picks 
came to terms on June 16, including fifth-rounder Walker Robbins, who signed 
for $134,400 over the $315,600 slot value. Three undrafted free agents 
were also added.[243] The Cardinals signed their #1 draft pick, Delvin 
Perez, 17, on June 17, for the full slot value of $2,222,500. He is 6' 
2", 180 lbs.[244] On June 18, the team announced the signing of their last 
remaining unsigned first-round pick, RHP Dakota Hudson. He signed for $2 
mil., which was $122,000 over the slot value.[245] As of June 23, the Cardinals 
have signed 32 of their 42 draft picks including all of rounds one-to-10, 
with 10 unsigned.[246][247] With the signing of 2B-man J.R. Davis on July 
2, the Cardinals have signed 33 draft picks, leaving nine unsigned.[248]
