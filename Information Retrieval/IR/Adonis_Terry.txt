William H. "Adonis" Terry (August 7, 1864 – February 24, 1915) was an American 
Major League Baseball player whose career spanned from his debut with the 
Brooklyn Atlantics in 1884, to the Chicago Colts in 1897. In his 14 seasons, 
he compiled a 197-196 win–loss record, winning 20 or more games in a season 
four different times.[1] Born in Westfield, Massachusetts, Terry began 
his professional career with the minor league Brooklyn Grays in 1883, who 
won the Interstate Championship that season. The following season, the 
team was admitted into the American Association as the Brooklyn Atlantics, 
and he stayed with the team. In that 1884 season, the team finished in 
ninth place, and his win-loss record reflected that. Although his record 
was 19-35, he led the team with an earned run average of 3.55, and struck 
out 230 hitters.[2] Over the next three seasons, Terry had average-to-good 
seasons, had a combined record of 40 wins and 49 losses,[1] even throwing 
a no-hitter against the St. Louis Browns on July 24, 1886.[3] But it was 
not until 1888 that he turned into a star pitcher. In that season, he had 
a 13-8 record, a 2.03 ERA,[1] and tossed his second no-hitter, this time 
against the Louisville Colonels on May 27, 1888.[3] In 1889, the team won 
the American Association championship with Terry winning 22 games. He pitched 
five games, winning two, in the "World Series" after the season with the 
New York Giants, a series that Brooklyn lost six games to three.[3] The 
Bridegrooms joined the National League in 1890, and again finished first 
behind Terry's 26-16 record and the team tied the Louisville team of the 
American Association in the World Series with three wins and three losses 
each and one tie.[3] The 1891 season turned out to be a disappointment 
for both Brooklyn and Terry, as the team finished in sixth place and Terry 
record fell to 6-16 and a 4.22 ERA.[4] On June 10, 1892, Brooklyn released 
Terry, and was quickly signed by the Baltimore Orioles on June 14. He played 
just one game for Baltimore, a complete games loss, and was then traded 
to the Pittsburgh Pirates on June 17 in exchange for Cub Stricker.[1] He 
pitched well in his 2-plus seasons for Pittsburgh, winning 18 games in 
1892 and 12 more in 1893. In 1894, he changed teams for the last time. 
After pitching in one game for the Pirates, he was then picked up by the 
Chicago Colts and had moderate success in his four seasons with them. He 
went on to win 21 games in 1895 and 15 more in 1896.[1] On July 13, 1896, 
he had the unfortunate distinction of giving up all four home runs to Philadelphia 
Phillie hall-of-Famer Ed Delahanty in a game played at the old West Side 
Grounds. Pitching the complete game, he and his Colts were able to prevail, 
winning the game 9-8.[5][6] He played only one game the following season 
in 1897, a complete-game loss, before his career came to end.[1] His career 
totals include a 197 wins and 196 losses, a 3.74 ERA, and 1,553 strikeouts 
in 3,514.3 innings pitched. He was also a versatile player, often playing 
other positions, including 216 games in the outfield, with games also played 
at shortstop, first base and third base.[1] After his Major League career 
was over, he became an umpire for 39 games in the 1900 National League 
season. He had filled the umpire position from time to time during his 
playing days. In total, he umpired 51 games, 48 of them as the home plate 
umpire, as the custom was that there was only one umpire used in each game.[1] 
Adonis is the honoree of old-time baseball events that are held in his 
hometown of Westfield, such as the group Westfield Wheelmen Vintage Base 
Ball Club.[7] Terry died in Milwaukee, Wisconsin at the age of 50 from
