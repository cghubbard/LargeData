Stephen Douglas Rogers (born October 26, 1949) is a former starting pitcher 
in Major League Baseball who played his entire career for the Montreal 
Expos. He batted and threw right-handed. Rogers was born in Jefferson City, 
Missouri and raised in Springfield, Missouri. He is a graduate of the University 
of Tulsa, where he was named to the all-tournament team at the 1971 College 
World Series While at the University of Tulsa he was a member of the Kappa 
Sigma Fraternity.[1] Rogers was originally drafted by the New York Yankees 
in the 60th round of the 1967 amateur draft. He ultimately failed to come 
to terms on a contract with New York and was subsequently drafted by the 
Montreal Expos in the 1st round (4th overall) of the 1971 amateur draft. 
Rogers is remembered as arguably the most successful pitcher in Montreal 
Expos history. Rogers was known for an unusual delivery, appearing to almost 
stumble during his follow-through. Although he never won 20 games, Rogers 
averaged 14 wins per season between 1974 and 1985. Rogers rarely missed 
a turn in the rotation until a throwing arm injury shortened his career. 
His most productive season came in 1982, when he collected a career-high 
19 wins, pitched four shutouts, and led all National League pitchers with 
a 2.40 ERA. According to the book No More Mister Nice Guy by former Expos 
manager Dick Williams, who was Rogers' manager from 1977 to part of 1981, 
Williams was not a fan of Rogers. Williams accused Rogers of being unwilling 
to step up when his team needed him in big games once the Expos became 
contenders. According to Williams, Rogers was at his best when the Expos 
were bad because he had no pressure. Williams called Rogers "a fraud", 
claiming that he had "king of the mountain syndrome". However, Rogers defeated 
the Philadelphia Phillies and their ace Steve Carlton twice in the 1981 
National League Division Series. He held the Phillies to one run in Game 
One and hurled a six-hit 3–0 shutout, helping himself with two RBI in the 
deciding Game Five, to send Montreal to the National League Championship 
Series. In Game Three of that Series, Rogers pitched a seven-hit 4–1 complete 
game against the Dodgers, but lost Game Five in relief when he allowed 
a pennant-winning home run to Rick Monday. The decision of manager Jim 
Fanning to use Rogers in that game, on only two-days rest, is still debated 
by Montreal fans. As injuries hampered his ability to pitch, Rogers was 
released by the Expos on May 21, 1985. He later signed with the California 
Angels and Chicago White Sox but did not pitch for either team. In a 13-year 
career, Rogers posted a 158-152 record with a 3.17 ERA and 1621 strikeouts 
in 2837.2 innings. He pitched 129 complete games with 37 shutouts in 399 
appearances, 393 as a starter. In four post-season games, Rogers was 3-1 
with a 0.97 ERA and two complete games. Rogers now resides in Princeton 
Junction, New Jersey and works for the Major League Baseball Players Association.[2]
