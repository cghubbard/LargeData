Graig Nettles (born August 20, 1944), nicknamed "Puff", is an American 
former Major League Baseball third baseman. During a 22-year baseball career, 
he played for the Minnesota Twins (1967–1969), Cleveland Indians (1970–1972), 
New York Yankees (1973–1983), San Diego Padres (1984–1986), Atlanta Braves 
(1987), and Montreal Expos (1988). Nettles was one of the best defensive 
third basemen of all time, and despite his relatively low career batting 
average, he was an excellent offensive contributor, setting an American 
League record for career home runs by a third baseman. As a part of four 
pennant-winning Yankee teams, Nettles enjoyed his best season in 1977 when 
he won the Gold Glove Award and had career-highs in home runs (37) and 
runs batted in (107) in leading the Yankees to the World Series against 
the Los Angeles Dodgers. Born and raised in San Diego, California. Nettles' 
unusual first name derives from his mother's dislike of the names Greg 
and Craig – and her combining the two to produce "Graig." "My dad was away 
at the war, so he didn't have any say."[1] The name also led to confusion 
for baseball card companies; the error-prone inaugural 1981 Fleer baseball 
card set includes an error card where his name is spelled "Graig" on the 
front, and "Craig" on the back. Nettles graduated from San Diego High School 
in 1962 then attended San Diego State College on a basketball scholarship.[2] 
and played for both the Aztecs' basketball and baseball teams.[3] In 1964 
and 1965, he played collegiate summer baseball for the Alaska Goldpanners 
of the Alaska Baseball League, helping to lead the team to two league championships. 
The Minnesota Twins drafted Nettles in the fourth round of the 1965 Major 
League Baseball draft. He made his MLB debut with the Twins on September 
6, 1967. Nettles batted .222 in 96 games with the Twins in 1969.[4] On 
December 10, 1969, the Twins traded Nettles with Dean Chance, Ted Uhlaender, 
and a player to be named later (PTBNL) to the Cleveland Indians for Luis 
Tiant and Stan Williams.[5] After playing three seasons with the Indians, 
the New York Yankees acquired Nettles with Jerry Moses for John Ellis, 
Jerry Kenney, Charlie Spikes, and Rusty Torres.[6][7] The Indians traded 
Nettles due to a feud between Nettles and manager Ken Aspromonte.[8] Nettles 
was named the AL player of the month for April 1974, as he set the AL record 
for home runs in a month with 11.[9] On September 7, 1974, Nettles was 
caught using a bat that had six superballs inside it. He said that he had 
received the bat from a Yankees fan in Chicago and did not know that the 
bat had been altered.[10] On September 14, 1974, Nettles and his brother 
Jim homered in the same game, joining a select club that includes Bret 
and Aaron Boone, José and Héctor Cruz, Felipe and César Crespo, Al and 
Tony Cuccinello, Joe and Dom DiMaggio, and Rick and Wes Ferrell. The seven 
sets of brothers hit their homers playing for opposing teams. Nettles was 
named the starting third baseman for the AL in the 1975 MLB All-Star Game.[11] 
During a brawl in a game against the Boston Red Sox on May 20, 1976, Nettles, 
who was on second base at the onset of the brawl, tackled Boston pitcher 
Bill Lee from behind. When it appeared that the dust had settled and the 
brawl was over, Lee confronted Nettles for tackling him from behind. The 
fracas resumed when Nettles swung at Lee. More players joined in the fray 
and Nettles broke Lee's collarbone when they went down in the pile.[12] 
During Game 3 of the 1978 World Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers 
at Yankee Stadium, with the Dodgers leading the series two games to none, 
Nettles made several plays at the hot corner to stop potential run-scoring 
hits, and helping the Yankees gain a key win in the series.[13] New York 
went on to win the next three contests and clinch the world championship.[14] 
In July 1980, Nettles hit his 267th career home run, the most among AL 
third basemen.[15] In the fall of 1982, George Steinbrenner, the Yankees 
owner, stated that Nettles "is in the twilight of his career, and if he 
never plays another game for me, he has earned more than what I have paid 
him."[16] This comment insulted Nettles, and led to his increased dissatisfaction 
with the Yankees.[16] The Yankees acquired Toby Harrah in February 1984, 
intending to platoon him with Nettles at third base.[17] Dissatisfied with 
the platoon, Nettles reported to spring training at the deadline for his 
arrival. On March 30, 1984, the Yankees traded Nettles to the San Diego 
Padres for Dennis Rasmussen and a PTBNL.[18] Nettles had wanted to play 
closer to his San Diego home, and his approval of the trade was required 
given his years of service.[19][20] Nettles famously characterized his 
career with the Yankees when he said that "[w]hen I was a little boy, I 
wanted to be a baseball player and join the circus. With the Yankees I 
have accomplished both."[21] Nettles was involved in the infamous 1984 
"San Diego Padres–Atlanta Braves Beanball Game", while playing for the 
Padres during a Braves home game on August 12, 1984. Nettles charged the 
mound, and attempted to tackle Braves relief pitcher Donnie Moore, after 
Moore intentionally beaned Nettles. Nettles missed and then was thrown 
to the ground by Braves first baseman (and former longtime Yankee teammate) 
Chris Chambliss. In 1985, after teammate Eric Show surrendered Pete Rose's 
record-breaking 4,192nd hit, Nettles was known for saying, "The Birch Society 
is going to expel Eric for making a Red famous.",[22] in reference to Show's 
association with the anti-Communist group, the John Birch Society. The 
Padres declined to offer Nettles a contract after the 1986 season, making 
him a free agent.[23] He signed with the Braves for the 1987 season as 
a non-roster player, making the Braves' 24-man Opening Day roster.[24] 
Nettles re-signed with the Braves for the 1988 season. The Montreal Expos 
purchased Nettles on March 24, 1988. In his 22-season career, Nettles hit 
.248 with 390 home runs and 1,314 RBI in 2,700 games. He had a career fielding 
percentage of .964, exceptional for the hot corner (third base). After 
retiring at age 43, Nettles coached for the Yankees (1991) and Padres (1995). 
Nettles resides in Lenoir City, Tennessee, a suburb of Knoxville. Graig 
and his wife Ginger have four children: Michael, Barrie, Tim, and Jeff. 
Jeff was selected by the Yankees in the 47th round of the 1998 draft.[25] 
Nettles managed and played for the St. Lucie Legends of the Senior Professional 
Baseball Association in 1989. He also played for the league's Bradenton 
Explorers. Nettles batted .301 and played in a total of 62 games; 10 for 
St. Lucie and 52 for Bradenton. Nettles managed the Bakersfield Blaze of 
the California League in 1996 to a 39-101 record. Nettles served as a consultant 
for The Bronx Is Burning, a television drama that documented the 1977 Yankees.[26] 
On March 21, 2008 he announced that he had been diagnosed with prostate 
cancer in late November 2007 and would undergo surgery at Manhattan's Memorial 
Sloan–Kettering Cancer Center on April 8.[27] His brother had been diagnosed 
with prostate cancer earlier in 2007.[28] Nettles wrote a controversial 
book, Balls, a memoir of his baseball career written in collaboration with 
Peter Golenbock.[21] In the book, Nettles criticized Steinbrenner and some 
players as well.[16] When the book's advance promotion came to Steinbrenner's 
attention in March 1984, Nettles was summarily traded to his hometown San 
Diego Padres.[29][30] Baseball writer Bill James noted in his 1984 Baseball 
Abstract that Nettles is arguably the best position player (i.e., non-pitcher) 
in major league history whose surname begins with the letter "N." As of 
2012[update] this judgment appears to hold up: the only three players elected 
to the baseball Hall of Fame with "N" surnames are pitchers Hal Newhouser, 
Kid Nichols and Phil Niekro. In 1991, Nettles was also inducted by the 
San Diego Hall of Champions into the Breitbard Hall of Fame honoring San 
Diego's finest athletes both on and off the playing surface.[31] As of 
2010, Nettles holds the single-season major league record for assists by 
a third baseman, and is tied with Brooks Robinson for second-most all-time. 
His 412 assists in 1971 broke the record of 405 shared by Harlond Clift 
in 1937 and Robinson in 1967. In 1973, his first year as a New York Yankee, 
he recorded 410 assists, breaking Clete Boyer's franchise record of 396 
in 1962; Robinson would tie this mark in 1974. To date, Nettles and Robinson 
have four of the six 400-assist seasons by a third baseman in Major League 
history. Nettles is mentioned in the video for Bruce Springsteen's 1985 
hit Glory Days. At the end of the video, Springsteen's character, a pitcher, 
tells a teen that he lost an imaginary game playing against the San Diego
