The Mexican Baseball League (Spanish: Liga Mexicana de Béisbol or LMB) 
is a professional baseball league based in Mexico. It is a Class Triple-A 
league in organized Minor League Baseball, one grade below Major League 
Baseball (MLB).[2] Unlike the other two Triple-A circuits, the International 
League and the Pacific Coast League, Mexican League teams are not affiliated 
with Major League teams. The Mexican League has two minor leagues of its 
own, the Liga Norte de Mexico, and the Mexican Academy League. An additional 
baseball circuit, the Mexican Pacific League, is a Winter league. The Mexican 
League was founded in 1925 by sportswriter Alejandro Aguilar Reyes and 
former baseball player Ernesto Carmona.[3] The league included six teams 
(74 Regimiento, México, Agrario, Nacional, Guanajuato and Águila). 74 Regimiento 
of Puebla won the initial league championship. Since then, the league has 
expanded to 16 teams, divided equally into a north and a south zone, the 
champions of which meet to contest a best-of-seven game playoff series. 
The season begins in mid-March with the playoffs running through mid-August. 
Judges, under the doctrine of stare decisis, use the case Federal Baseball 
Club of Baltimore v. National League of Professional Baseball Clubs to 
maintain that the baseball leagues and commissioner are not violating anti-trust 
laws because they are not doing anything different from what was done when 
the previous holding was handed down. Included in the previous ruling was 
the fact that the baseball leagues at the time of the ruling could transmit 
information about their games via telegraph wires; radio and television 
are merely extensions of the type of coverage provided by the older medium. 
Further, because the leagues are only negotiating as agents for their member 
clubs, their actions in negotiating the television and radio broadcasts 
are essentially no different from their actions with telegraphs. Therefore, 
the previous decision can be maintained. Judges also have asserted that 
this the previous decision has not ever been objected to by Congress, in 
that no corrective legislation which would have overturned the ruling has 
ever been enacted, so it must also be of the opinion of Congress that baseball 
does not fall under the rules of the Sherman Antitrust Act (some judges 
have found differently, but final rulings have always overall held in favor 
of Organized Baseball). The ruling went untested until the Mexican League 
was formed. Players who went to play in the Mexican League were blacklisted 
from Major League Baseball. One such player, Danny Gardella, was blacklisted 
because he had violated his contract and gone to play professional baseball 
in Mexico. During 1948, Gardella brought a claim against Commissioner of 
Baseball Happy Chandler, the National League and American League, as well 
as their presidents (Ford Frick and Will Harridge, respectively). Gardella 
charged that they were engaged in interstate commerce because the defendants 
had made contracts with radio broadcasting and television companies that 
sent narratives or moving pictures of the games across state lines. MLB 
then settled with Gardella and offered all Mexican League jumpers amnesty, 
protecting the ambiguity of the antitrust protection.[4] In 1949, Gardella 
won a major appeal against baseball's reserve clause in the federal courts. 
This successful appeal is recognized as the first major step towards baseball 
free agency, even though it was decades in the making. During 1979, the 
Mexican Central League was absorbed into the expanded Liga Mexicana de 
Beisbol (Mexican Baseball League). The newly expanded league featured a 
20-team circuit with four divisions. However, after a series of team bankruptcies, 
the Mexican League was reduced to 14 teams in two divisions. The following 
are the locations of the Mexican League teams. Red markers indicate teams 
in the South Division, while green markers indicate teams in the North
