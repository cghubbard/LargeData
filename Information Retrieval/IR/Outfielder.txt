An outfielder is a person playing in one of the three defensive positions 
in baseball, farthest from the batter. These defenders are the left fielder, 
the center fielder, and the right fielder. An outfielder's duty is to try 
to catch long fly balls before they hit the ground or to quickly catch 
or retrieve and return to the infield any other balls entering the outfield. 
Outfielders normally play behind the six other members of the defense who 
play in or near the infield. By convention, each of the nine defensive 
positions in baseball is numbered. The outfield positions are 7 (left field), 
8 (center field) and 9 (right field). These numbers are shorthand designations 
useful in baseball scorekeeping and are not necessarily the same as the 
squad numbers worn on player uniforms. Outfielders named to the MLB All-Century 
Team are Hank Aaron, Ty Cobb, Joe DiMaggio, Mickey Mantle, Willie Mays, 
Stan Musial, Pete Rose, Babe Ruth, Ted Williams and Ken Griffey Jr.. Players 
can be characterized as either corner outfielders or a center fielder. 
Corner outfielders are often slower and have less defensive value than 
the center fielder. However, there are some important differences between 
right fielders and left fielders. Right fielders tend to have the best 
throwing arms of the outfield so they can make the long throw to third 
base, but often are not as fast as left fielders. Center fielders are generally 
the fastest and most athletic of the three, because they have to run the 
farthest in order to field balls in the gaps and back up the other outfielders 
when balls are hit to them. Many of the best power hitters in baseball 
play in the outfield, where they do not have as constant involvement in 
fielding plays as other positions, especially before the institution of 
the designated hitter. For example, Babe Ruth was moved from pitcher to 
the outfield. Left fielders and right fielders are more often slow power 
hitters, and center fielders are usually fast base-runners and good defensive 
players. Center field is often considered the most difficult outfield position, 
requiring both a good throwing arm and speed. Center fielders on many teams 
often bat lead off. Players who do not routinely start games, but often 
substitute as a pinch hitter or defensive replacement in the outfield are 
referred to as fourth outfielders or even fifth outfielders. These players 
can usually play any of the three outfield positions. Corner outfielders 
are outfielders who play the corner positions of right field and left field. 
Corner outfielders often have less speed than center fielders, but make 
up for this deficiency with their offensive play. The main differences 
between left and right fielders are, first, that left fielders handle more 
chances because right-handed pull hitters tend to hit balls to left; second, 
that right fielders typically have stronger arms; third, that right fielders 
are frequently (not always) slower and less agile defensively. Many left 
fielders have had the speed to play center field, but have lacked the throwing 
ability required. An example of an ultra-fast left fielder is Rickey Henderson 
(Ben Oglivie can fit this description too), whereas the slow-footed but 
very strong-armed Carl Furillo, "The Reading Rifle," sets a standard for 
right fielders in the terms specified here. Gorman Thomas is an example 
of the reverse theory. He was a centerfielder his entire career (mainly 
with the Milwaukee Brewers), but was not nearly in shape as the typical 
player for this position. He compensated for it with sheer hustle and determination. 
Often, when an outfield prospect arrives in the majors, he plays both corner
