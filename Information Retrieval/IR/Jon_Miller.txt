Jon Wesley Miller (born October 11, 1951) is an American sportscaster, 
known primarily for his broadcasts of Major League Baseball. Since 1997 
he has been employed as a play-by-play announcer for the San Francisco 
Giants. He was also a baseball announcer for ESPN from 1990 to 2010. Miller 
received the Ford C. Frick Award from the National Baseball Hall of Fame 
in 2010.[3] Jon Miller was born on Hamilton Air Force Base[1][2] and grew 
up in Hayward, California, listening to Giants announcers Russ Hodges and 
Lon Simmons on the radio.[4] He attended his first baseball game in 1962, 
a 19–8 Giants' victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers at Candlestick Park.[5] 
As a teenager, Miller played Strat-O-Matic and recorded his own play-by-play 
into a tape recorder, adding his own crowd noise, vendors, and commercials.[4][6][7] 
After graduating from Hayward High School in 1969, Miller commuted across 
the bay to take broadcasting classes at the College of San Mateo.[4] He 
began his broadcasting career at the college's FM radio station (KCSM-FM) 
and UHF/PBS TV station (KCSM-TV), which reached much of the Bay Area. His 
first baseball broadcasts were from CSM games.[8] At age 20, Miller joined 
KFTY-TV in Santa Rosa to work as their sports director.[9] During this 
period, he would sit in the press box at Candlestick Park and record play-by-play 
of an entire game on his tape recorder. Miller submitted one of these tapes 
to broadcaster Monte Moore, who helped Miller get his first baseball play-by 
play job in 1974, calling that year's World Series champion Oakland Athletics.[10] 
Miller was dismissed by the Athletics following the 1974 season.[11] For 
a brief period in the 1970s, Miller broadcast for the California Golden 
Seals of the National Hockey League. He also spent the early part of his 
career announcing San Francisco Dons and Pacific Tigers men's college basketball 
(1976–1980), the Golden State Warriors (part-time, 1979–1982) and Washington 
Bullets (part-time, 1984–1985) of the NBA, and the original San Jose Earthquakes 
of the North American Soccer League. Jon Miller's first network exposure 
came in 1976, when he was selected by CBS-TV to broadcast the NASL Championship 
Game. From 1974–1976, Miller did play-by-play for the Washington Diplomats 
of the NASL. He also announced the Soccer Game of the Week for nationally 
syndicated TVS from 1977–1978.[12] Miller was hired by the Texas Rangers 
shortly before the 1978 season to replace the ill Dick Risenhoover after 
the Rangers were unable to lure Fred White from Kansas City.[13] After 
two seasons with Texas (1978–79), he was hired by the Boston Red Sox (1980–82). 
"The lure of doing baseball in Boston was too much to pass up," Miller 
recalled.[13] In 1983, he was hired by Baltimore's WFBR Radio, which at 
the time served as the flagship station for the Baltimore Orioles.[10] 
After the 1982 season, Chuck Thompson moved from the radio booth to do 
TV broadcasts full-time, and WFBR's president Harry Shriver brought in 
Miller to handle radio play-by-play duties with fellow broadcaster Tom 
Marr. In his first year in Baltimore, Miller called the Orioles' World 
Series championship run, including the last out of Game 5:[14] He eventually 
signed a contract directly with the Orioles and, while the broadcast rights 
eventually moved to rival station WBAL, Miller remained their primary announcer 
through 1996.[15][16] At the end of that season, Orioles owner Peter Angelos, 
displeased with Miller's often candid commentary on the Orioles play, declined 
to renew his contract, citing a desire for a broadcaster who would "bleed 
more orange and black."[17][18] Miller returned to the Bay Area and joined 
his hometown Giants, whose colors are coincidentally also orange and black.[5] 
Since 1997,[19] Miller has been the primary play-by-play voice of the San 
Francisco Giants (replacing Hank Greenwald), calling games on KNBR radio 
as well as KTVU (1997–2007) and KNTV (2008–present) television. In February 
2007, he signed a six-year extension to remain the voice of the Giants 
through at least the 2012 season.[20] On July 16, 2010, the Giants organization, 
including fellow broadcaster Dave Flemming, honored Miller at AT&T Park 
in a pregame ceremony about one week before Miller received the Ford C. 
Frick Award.[21] Before the game started, Miller threw out the ceremonial 
first pitch.[22] On September 4, 2010, Miller called his first game for 
CSN Bay Area as a substitute for Dave Flemming, who was broadcasting a 
Stanford football game on the radio.[23] On May 27, 2003, during a game 
between the Giants and Arizona Diamondbacks, Miller called a play involving 
two defensive errors by the Diamondbacks and at least three separate baserunning 
mistakes by Giants outfielder Rubén Rivera. When Rivera was finally thrown 
out at home plate trying to score what would have been the winning run, 
Miller declared,[24][25] The phrase was repeated numerous times on sports 
radio and highlight shows such as SportsCenter, and quickly became one 
of the most famous calls of Miller's long career. He did a similar call 
on the radio during Game 3 of the 2004 World Series, when Jeff Suppan made 
a baserunning mistake.[citation needed] On August 7, 2007, Miller made 
the call of Barry Bonds' record-breaking 756th home run on KNBR. His call 
of the historic home run will likely go down in history as the voice of 
the moment:[26] On October 29, 2014, Miller made the radio call of the 
final out of the 2014 World Series, the Giants' third title in five years. 
His call also mentions the pitching performance of Madison Bumgarner through 
the playoffs. Millers call went like this:[27] From 1986–1989 Miller did 
backup play-by-play for NBC's Saturday Game of the Week telecasts, paired 
with either Tony Kubek or Joe Garagiola. He also called regional telecasts 
for The Baseball Network in 1994–1995. From 1990–2010 Miller did national 
television and radio broadcasts of regular-season and postseason games 
for ESPN, most prominently alongside Hall of Famer Joe Morgan on the network's 
Sunday Night Baseball telecasts. Among his ESPN assignments, Miller called 
13 World Series and 10 League Championship Series for ESPN Radio.[28] During 
Game 3 of the 2000 World Series, Miller was forced to leave the booth after 
the top of the first inning due to an upper respiratory infection.[29] 
Charley Steiner, serving as a field reporter for the network, filled in 
on play-by-play for the rest of the game; Miller resumed his duties in 
Game 4 of the Series. In November 2010, it was announced that Miller and 
Morgan would not be returning to the Sunday night telecasts for the 2011 
season.[30] Miller was offered, but declined, a continued role with ESPN 
Radio.[31] Miller's voice can be heard in a 1982 episode of Cheers, during 
a scene where the gang at the bar is watching a Red Sox game on the television. 
He also is briefly heard in the films 61* and Summer Catch and in the English 
release of the animated movie My Neighbors the Yamadas, and appears as 
himself in two episodes of the HBO series Arliss.[32] In 1998, Miller wrote 
a book with Mark S. Hyman entitled Confessions of a Baseball Purist: What's 
Right—and Wrong—with Baseball, as Seen from the Best Seat in the House 
(ISBN 0-8018-6316-3), where he expounds on the current state of the sport.[33] 
Miller guest-starred as Jordan in the episode "Little Octi Lost" of the 
2016 reboot of the Cartoon Network original series The Powerpuff Girls. 
Miller received numerous honors for his ESPN work, including six Cable 
ACE Award nominations (winning the award in 1991 and 1996) and several 
Emmy Award nominations.[19] The National Sportscasters and Sportswriters 
Association inducted him into its Hall of Fame in 1998, the Baseball Hall 
of Fame selected him for its Ford C. Frick Award in 2010, and the National 
Radio Hall of Fame inducted him in 2014.[19][34] Miller's delivery is notable 
for his easygoing, sometimes humorous manner and measured use of hyperbole, 
particularly in banter with his partner sportscasters. He livens up many 
broadcasts with a few Hawaiian and Japanese phrases spoken with impeccable 
pronunciation, and has been known to announce a half inning totally in 
Spanish.[citation needed] It is notable that Miller generally pronounces 
foreign language names with the source language pronunciation, in contrast 
with broadcasters who "Americanize" foreign-named players.[35] Miller is 
also known for his meticulous scorekeeping, having scored over 5,500 games 
since he started broadcasting.[36] Miller will occasionally quote lines 
from Shakespeare plays during radio broadcasts.[37] He is well known for 
his foul ball call, "That ball is fooooul", and his emphatic cries of "Safe!" 
on close plays and "Two!" for a successful double play.[38] He is also 
known for his unique pronunciation of the word safe, which sounds more 
like an umpire's call "tafe!", on plays where a baserunner attempts to 
slide into a base prior to being tagged out. Early in his career, Miller 
would punctuate home runs with the signature call, "Tell it goodbye!" (in 
emulation of longtime Giants announcer Lon Simmons), although he has eschewed 
this in recent years (although he continues to refer to a home run as a 
"big fly"). His home run call for Hispanic batters is now punctuated, "Adios, 
pelota!"[39][40] Miller is noted in baseball circles for his impersonation 
of Los Angeles Dodgers announcer Vin Scully.[41][42] Miller also imitates 
Harry Caray, Chuck Thompson, Jack Buck, Al Michaels, Babe Ruth, Bob Sheppard, 
and Harry Kalas, among others.[43][44][37] Asked how he got into broadcasting 
play by play of baseball games, he recalled being in stands at Candlestick 
Park as a child and looking into the broadcast booth. In the middle of 
the at-bat, he watched as the broadcaster consumed a handful of fries and 
a drink between pitches, thinking, "That is the life for me."[45][37] While 
calling games on the radio for the Giants, Miller occasionally introduces 
himself and his fellow broadcaster(s), followed by the phrase, "your Giants 
broadcasters". The same is repeated when Miller is on TV, except he replaces 
the word "broadcasters" with "telecasters." (Miller is referred to by fellow 
Giants broadcaster Mike Krukow as "The Big Kahuna".) He would use similar 
terminology for his Sunday Night Baseball telecasts on ESPN ("your Sunday 
night telecasters") and his World Series broadcasts for ESPN Radio ("your 
World Series broadcasters"). Miller was married for seven years in the 
1970s, a marriage which produced two daughters.[4] In 1986, he re-united 
with his childhood babysitter, Janine Allen, who had also married and divorced 
and had one daughter. Janine and Jon married in 1987 and have one son together.[4] 
The Millers reside in Moss Beach, California.[19] Jon's daughter Emilie 
Miller is an actress who appeared in a 2014 episode of Law & Order: Special
