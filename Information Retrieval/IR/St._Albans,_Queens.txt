St. Albans is a middle class community in the New York City borough of 
Queens centered on the intersection of Linden Boulevard and Farmers Boulevard, 
about two miles north of JFK Airport. It is southeast of Jamaica, west 
of Cambria Heights, north of Springfield Gardens, and northwest of Laurelton.[2] 
The neighborhood is part of Queens Community Board 12,[3][4] and is served 
by the St. Albans Post Office, ZIP Code 11412. The population within the 
ZIP code, according to the 2010 census, was 34,882 – a decline of 7% from 
the 37,452 of 2000.[1] The small western enclave of Addisleigh Park is 
a U.S. historic district where many notable African Americans have lived, 
including Jackie Robinson, W. E. B. Du Bois, and many jazz musicians and 
entertainers including Fats Waller, Ella Fitzgerald, Lena Horne, and Count 
Basie.[5] Part of a land grant to Dutch settlers from New Netherland Governor 
Peter Stuyvesant in 1655, the area, like much of Queens, remained farmland 
and forest for most of the next two centuries. By the 1800s, the lands 
of four families—the Remsens, Everitts, Ludlums, and Hendricksons—formed 
the nucleus of this sprawling farm community in the eastern portion of 
the Town of Jamaica. In 1814, when the Village of Jamaica (the first village 
on Long Island) was incorporated, its (the village's) boundaries extended 
eastward to Freeman's Path (now Farmers Boulevard), and south to Lazy Lane 
(called Central Avenue in 1900, then Foch Boulevard in the 1920s,[6][7][8] 
and now Linden Boulevard), thus including parts of present-day St. Albans.[9] 
In 1852, the old mill pond that is now at the center of Baisley Pond Park 
was acquired by the Brooklyn waterworks for use as a reservoir.[10] In 
1872, the Long Island Rail Road's Cedarhurst Cut-off was built through 
the area, but no stop appears on the first timetables. In 1892, an area 
called Francis Farm was surveyed and developed for housing. There were 
numerous Francis families farming in the eastern portion of the Town of 
Jamaica in the 1880s.[11] Francis Lewis Boulevard (named for a signer of 
the Declaration of Independence, from Queens), which does not yet appear 
on maps from 1909,[12] nor in 1910,[13] is now the eastern boundary of 
St. Albans. Soon, the first street lights illuminated the crossroads that 
is now Linden Boulevard and Farmers Boulevard. New shops clustered around 
August Everitt's lone store. By July 1, 1898, the St. Albans Long Island 
Rail Road station opened where the tracks crossed Locust Avenue (now Baisley 
Boulevard).[14][15] The station was razed and replaced with the current, 
grade separated station on October 15, 1935. In 1899, a year after Queens 
became part of New York City (and with the Town of Jamaica and the Village 
of Jamaica thereby dissolved), the new post office for the 600 residents[16] 
was named St. Albans, after St Albans in Hertfordshire, England, which 
itself was named after a Saint Alban, thought to be the first Christian 
martyred in England. The name had been in use for the area since at least 
1894 for the name of the school district,[17] and the LIRR station was 
named St. Albans when it opened in 1898. A 1909 map also shows a St Albans 
Avenue and a St Albans Place in the area.[12][18] The St. Albans Golf Course, 
built in 1915, brought rich and famous golfers, including baseball star 
Babe Ruth. The Depression forced the golf course owners to try to sell, 
but plans for private development fell through. The land was seized by 
the federal government in 1942,[19] and construction soon began on the 
St. Albans Naval Hospital, which opened in 1943.[20] After construction 
was completed in 1950,[21] the hospital had 3000 beds and contained a network 
of 76 wards. The hospital was turned over to the Veterans Administration 
in 1974 and more recently evolved into the Veterans Administration St. 
Albans Primary and Extended Care Facility. Within St. Albans is the small 
western enclave of Addisleigh Park, a U.S. historic district that consists 
of single-family homes built in a variety of styles between the 1910s and 
1930s. Though originally intended as a segregated community for white people 
only, from the late 1930s many notable African Americans have lived there.[5] 
Today, it remains a predominantly African American enclave that is more 
upscale than surrounding areas in southeast Queens.[22] Between 1900 and 
1940, the village of Addisleigh Park was developed by a handful of eminent 
white entrepreneurs including Edwin H. Brown, Gerald C. English, and Alexander 
Rodman.[23] Restrictive covenants were established to prohibit the sale 
of any of its properties to blacks.[24] A 1926 New York Times article insists, 
“Addisleigh, together with the St. Albans Golf Club, was laid out under 
the personal direction of Edwin H. Brown, and carries a land and house 
restriction of the highest type.”[25] Two lawsuits were filed successfully 
by white residents who accused their neighbors of breaking the contractual 
segregation imposed on the neighborhood by its developers. Simeon Bankoff, 
Executive Director of the New York Historic Districts Council, says about 
this backlash “It was unpleasant, as it was a case of a number of narrow-minded 
neighbors trying to fight what they saw as an invasion of unwanted people 
in their area.”[26] Affluent white New York City-based public figures moved 
into Addisleigh Park to experience the privacy of suburban seclusion. Addisleigh 
Park boasted well-kept rows of Tudor and Colonial homes. The neighborhood's 
close proximity to Manhattan allowed for quick and frequent commuting. 
During the Swing Era, Manhattan's 52nd Street served as the epicenter of 
Swing Era live entertainment and musical innovation. For this reason, many 
successful African American jazz musicians began to recognize Addisleigh 
Park as the newest suburban haven for wealthy, influential artists. In 
1948, the United States Supreme Court ruled that racially restrictive covenants 
violated the equal-protection clause of the 14th Amendment, though by that 
year, Addisleigh Park had already become a haven for world-famous African 
Americans in jazz and sports.[27] The neighborhood was declared a historic 
district by the NYC Landmarks Preservation Commission in 2011.[5] Public 
schools are operated by the New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE): 
There is one charter school: Private schools include: Numerous MTA bus 
lines runs through the neighborhood, including the Q4, Q5, Q42, Q84, and 
Q85, all of which connect to the New York City Subway and the Long Island 
Rail Road at Jamaica Center.[29] As a neighborhood adjacent to Hollis, 
St. Albans was home to many artists of the Hip Hop and Rap music genres 
in the 1970s and 1980s. St. Albans housing consists mostly of detached, 
one and two-family homes. Linden Boulevard is the major shopping street. 
The neighborhood and the surrounding areas are considered the heart of 
Queens' working class Black community, with 34% claiming Caribbean ancestry.[citation 
needed] As of the 2010 United States Census, the vast majority of residents 
were black, with black residents comprising 92% of the 34,882 people living 
in St. Albans. Of the remaining 8% of residents, 1.4% are white, 1% are 
Asian, 2.4% are of another race, and 2.7% are multiracial Americans.[1] 
In 2011 The New York Times reported that many foreclosures were occurring 
and there was a high level of unemployment. At that time, many black people 
were moving from St. Albans to the Southern United States.[30] Many famous 
jazz musicians used to live in St. Albans, particularly in some of the 
large houses in Addisleigh Park. The following notable people are known 
to have lived in the area: Music Sports Other Famous stride pianist Fats 
Waller was the first well-known musician to move into Addisleigh Park at 
the peak of his career in the late 1930s. Waller had grown up in the Church 
(his father was a pastor).[51] He subsequently had his home in Addisleigh 
Park fashioned with a built-in Hammond organ.[52] He died in 1943 from 
bronchial pneumonia. In 1937, jazz pianist and bandleader Count Basie moved 
his orchestra from Kansas City to New York. Basie made the Woodside Hotel 
(a Queens staple) his band headquarters.[citation needed] Count Basie’s 
orchestra performed at world-famous Manhattan venues including the Roseland 
Ballroom and the Savoy Ballroom. In 1946, Basie and his wife, Katy, bought 
a home in Addisleigh Park, where the couple lived until 1973 when it was 
sold to bandleader/singer/pianist, Robert (Bubber) Johnson.[53] Singer, 
film actress, and Civil Rights Activist Lena Horne also moved into the 
Addisleigh Park neighborhood in the year 1946. Soon after Horne, jazz trumpeter 
and bandleader Mercer Ellington, son of jazz great Duke Ellington, moved 
into Addisleigh Park in 1948. Eight years earlier, he had worked for renowned 
jazz trumpeter Cootie Williams as his road manager. Cootie Williams bought 
a home in Addisleigh Park in 1947.[54] While residing in Addisleigh Park, 
Mercer Ellington employed Dizzy Gillespie, Kenny Dorham, and Charles Mingus. 
Throughout the 1940s, Mercer and his father, Duke Ellington, frequently 
borrowed musicians from one another’s ensembles. Saxophonist Earl Bostic 
moved to Addisleigh Park in 1948, the same year Bostic’s sextet hit success 
with their first single “Temptation”.[55] Bostic was born in Tulsa, Oklahoma. 
In the early 1930s, he played with Midwestern territory bands before moving 
to New York City in 1938 to play with Don Redman. Bostic’s second hit, 
“Flamingo,” was produced in 1951, while he was still living in Addisleigh 
Park. In 1956, Bostic and his wife left Addisleigh Park to settle in Los 
Angeles. Earl Bostic died onstage from a heart attack in Rochester, New 
York, in 1965. Bostic’s neighbors on Murdock Avenue were Ella Fitzgerald 
and her then-husband, famous bassist and cellist Ray Brown. Fitzgerald 
owned her Addisleigh Park home from 1949 until 1956.[56] During the late 
1930s and early 1940s, Fitzgerald had become one of the most recognizable 
names of wide-release swing music in the United States. She met Brown in 
1946 while on tour with Dizzy Gillespie’s band.[57] The couple divorced 
in 1952.[57] Between the years 1949 and 1956, Fitzgerald sang scat with 
various bebop bands. She was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom 
by President George H. W. Bush in 1992.[58] Vicksburg, Mississippi native 
and famous jazz bassist Milt Hinton moved into Addisleigh Park in 1950.[52] 
In his younger years, he had lived and worked in Chicago alongside celebrated 
jazz musicians Art Tatum and Eddie South. He moved to New York City for 
a job in Cab Calloway’s orchestra in 1936. Hinton bought a home on 113th 
Avenue in Addisleigh Park in 1950. He lived in the neighborhood until his 
death in 2000. Saxophonist John Coltrane bought a home on Mexico Street 
in Addisleigh Park in the year 1959.[59] Coltrane had just met tremendous 
critical success after his collaborations with Thelonious Monk and Miles 
Davis. In January 1960, Coltrane released Giant Steps, his first album 
with Atlantic Records. Giant Steps is considered to be the album that catapulted 
Coltrane into jazz legend. Coordinates: 40°41′30″N 73°45′45″W﻿ / ﻿40.6916°N
