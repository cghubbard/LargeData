Major League Baseball recognizes the player or players in each league[a] 
with the most wins each season.[b] In baseball, wins are a statistic used 
to evaluate pitchers. Credit for a win is given by the official scorer 
to the pitcher whose team takes and maintains the lead while he is the 
pitcher of record. If a game is tied or if the lead changes to the other 
team, all pitchers who have participated and exited the game to that point 
are unable to receive credit for the victory. A starting pitcher is ineligible 
for the win if he has not completed five or more innings of the game; instead, 
the scorer would award the victory to the relief pitcher who was "most 
effective... in the official scorer's judgment".[2] The National League's 
first win champion was Albert Spalding, who led the senior circuit with 
47 wins after leading the semi-professional National Association in each 
of its five seasons. Hall of Fame pitcher Cy Young led the American League 
in wins in each of its first three years (1901–1903), amassing 33, 32, 
and 28 victories in those seasons for the Boston Americans.[3] Warren Spahn 
leads all players with 8 win championships for the Boston and Milwaukee 
Braves in his 21 seasons.[4] Three players have led their league in wins 
six times during their careers. Grover Cleveland Alexander led the National 
League in victories six times, with a single-season career-high 33 wins 
in 1916.[5] In the American League, two pitchers have accomplished the 
same feat: Walter Johnson, whose 36 wins in 1913—his first season leading 
the league—were a single-season career high,[6] and Bob Feller.[7] In addition 
to his three American League wins, Young also led the National League twice 
(1892, 1895) to amass the third-highest total of win championships in major 
league history.[3] Joe McGinnity and Tom Glavine also captured five wins 
titles in the National League.[8][9] Pitchers who have led their league 
four times include Steve Carlton,[10] Roger Clemens,[11] Christy Mathewson,[12] 
Hal Newhouser,[13] and Robin Roberts.[14] Charles "Old Hoss" Radbourn holds 
the single-season record for the most games won in a major league season; 
he notched 59 victories in 1884.[15] There is a discrepancy in Radbourn's 
victory total in 1884. The classic MacMillan Baseball Encyclopedia, as 
well as other sources credit Radbourn with 60 wins (against 12 losses), 
other sources place his win total as high as 62. He and John Clarkson (53 
wins in 1885) are the only pitchers to exceed 50 wins in a single season 
in the current major leagues; Guy Hecker also accomplished the feat in 
the American Association.[15] The American League leader is Jack Chesbro, 
who won 41 games for the New York Yankees in 1904; his total is the highest 
since Major League Baseball's consolidation in 1901.[15][16] The highest 
total in the National League since 1901 is Mathewson's 37 victories in 
1908.[12][15] The largest margin of victory for the title is 21 wins, achieved 
by Clarkson in 1889; he won 49 games,[17] while his closest competitors 
(Charlie Buffinton and Tim Keefe) won 28 each.[18][19] The American League 
title's largest margin of victory is 16 wins—Ed Walsh notched 40 wins in 
1908,[20] followed by Addie Joss and Ed Summers with 24 victories.[21][22] 
The number of wins required to lead the league each season has gone down 
significantly over the last century. For example, from 1900–1920, the average 
number of wins for the AL league leader was 30.8; from 1990–2010, it was 
20.9. Ties for the win championship are common. The most recent tie in 
the American League was in 2012, when Jered Weaver and David Price tied 
for the lead with 20 wins each, and the most recent tie in the National 
League was in 2011, when Ian Kennedy and Clayton Kershaw tied with 21 wins 
each. The most pitchers to share the title in a single season is six, accomplished 
in 2006 when Aaron Harang, Derek Lowe, Brad Penny, John Smoltz, Brandon 
Webb, and Carlos Zambrano each won 16 games in the National League. In 
the American League, four pitchers shared the award in the strike-shortened
