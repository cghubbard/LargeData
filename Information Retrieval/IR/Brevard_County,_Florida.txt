Brevard County is a county in the state of Florida. As of the 2010 census, 
the population was 543,376, making it the 10th largest county in Florida.[1] 
The official county seat has been located in Titusville since 1894.[2] 
Brevard County comprises the Palm Bay–Melbourne–Titusville, FL Metropolitan 
Statistical Area. It is located along the east Florida coast along the 
Atlantic Ocean. Influenced by the presence of the John F. Kennedy Space 
Center, Brevard County is also known as the Space Coast. As such, it was 
designated with the telephone area code 321, as in 3-2-1 liftoff. The county 
is named after Theodore Washington Brevard, an early settler, and state 
comptroller. The history of Brevard County can be traced to the prehistory 
of native cultures living in the area from pre-Columbian times to the present 
age. The geographic boundaries of the county have changed significantly 
since its founding. The county is named for Judge Theodore W. Brevard, 
an early setter, and state comptroller.[3] In federal maps printed before 
2012, nearly half of Brevard was prone to flooding. Most of this was in 
the relatively undeveloped low-lying areas, west of Interstate 95, on the 
banks of the St. Johns River. About 18,900 homes out of 164,000 single-family 
homes were in that area.[4] According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county 
has a total area of 1,557 square miles (4,030 km2), of which 1,016 square 
miles (2,630 km2) is land and 541 square miles (1,400 km2) (34.8%) is water.[5] 
Most of the water is the Atlantic Ocean, the St. Johns River and the Indian 
River Lagoon. The county is larger in area than the nation of Samoa and 
nearly the same size, and population, as Cape Verde.[6] It is one-third 
the size of the state of Rhode Island. Located halfway between Jacksonville 
and Miami, Brevard County extends 72 miles (116 km) from north to south, 
and averages 26.5 miles (42.6 km) wide. Marshes in the western part of 
this county are the source of the St. Johns River. Emphasizing its position 
as halfway down Florida is the presence of two roads that are halfway down 
Florida's numbering system, State Road 50 and State Road 500. The Atlantic 
Intracoastal Waterway along the eastern edge of Brevard County is the major 
waterway route in Brevard County. It includes the Indian River. Additional 
waterways include Lake Washington, Lake Poinsett, Lake Winder, Sawgrass 
Lake, the St. Johns River, and the Banana River. Brevard County is the 
sole county in the Palm Bay – Melbourne – Titusville, Florida Metropolitan 
Statistical Area (formerly the Melbourne-Titusville-Cocoa, Florida Standard 
Metropolitan Statistical Area and Melbourne-Titusville-Palm Bay, Florida 
Metropolitan Statistical Area). There is no major urban center.[7] The 
county is unofficially divided into three sections: North County, comprising 
Titusville, Mims and Port St. John; Central Brevard, which includes Cocoa, 
Rockledge, Merritt Island, and Cocoa Beach; and South County, which includes 
Melbourne, Palm Bay, Grant, Valkaria, and the South Beaches. The South 
Beaches is a term that measures direction south from the dividing line 
of Patrick Air Force Base, and includes South Patrick Shores, Satellite 
Beach, Indian Harbour Beach, Indialantic, and Melbourne Beach. The county 
government has historically labeled the beach areas differently. The North 
Reach includes 9.4 miles (15.1 km) in Cape Canaveral and Cocoa Beach. The 
Patrick Air Force Base beach is 4.1 miles (6.6 km). The Mid Reach includes 
the 7.6 miles (12.2 km) in Satellite Beach. The South Reach includes the 
3.8 miles (6.1 km) in Indialantic and Melbourne Beach. The South Beaches 
include 14.5 miles (23.3 km) south of Melbourne Beach to Sebastian.[8] 
The United States Board on Geographic Names is considering two proposals 
to officially name the barrier island extending from Port Canaveral to 
Sebastian Inlet. The 45-mile-long (72 km) island includes the city of Cape 
Canaveral, Cocoa Beach, Indialantic, Melbourne Beach, Patrick Air Force 
Base, and Satellite Beach. The American Indian Association of Florida submitted 
in October 2011 a proposal to name the island after the Ais people. The 
United Third Bridge and the Florida Puerto Rican/Hispanic Chamber of Commerce 
in Melbourne submitted in January 2012 a proposal to name the island after 
Juan Ponce de León. The Board of Geographic Names usually takes at least 
eight months to decide on a new name for a geographical feature.[9] There 
are 16 municipalities. The largest by population is Palm Bay, the smallest 
Melbourne Village.[10] The county has eight canals[11] for transportation 
and drainage: The soil contains high levels of phosphorus.[15] The county 
has a Köppen climate classification of Cf with a year-round distribution 
of rainfall. This means a humid subtropical climate with hot, humid summers.[16] 
There are distinct wet and dry seasons. The dry lasts from December through 
May, the wet from June through November. During the dry season, periods 
of drought often occur, and can lead to a persistent and high wild land 
fire threat.[17] In numerous instances these fires have caused property 
damage. In one case several fires in 2008 forced the evacuation of Bayside 
Highschool In the town of Palm Bay. In this particular event 162 homes 
were damaged.[18] January is the coldest month, with an average low of 
50.7 °F (10.4 °C) and an average high 71 °F (22 °C). The warmest months 
are July and August with average highs of 90 °F (32 °C) and average lows 
of 72.2. The driest month is April with 1.6 inches (4.1 cm) of rainfall; 
the wettest is September, with 6.6 inches (17 cm).[19] Offshore ocean temperatures 
have averaged: January – 64 °F (18 °C), February – 62 °F (17 °C), March 
– 67 °F (19 °C) and April – 72 °F (22 °C).[20] Florida is a large subtropical 
state that experiences hurricanes. Although Brevard county is located along 
Florida's eastern peninsula, it is less frequently impacted by direct hurricane 
landfalls than portions of the Panhandle or South Florida. There are two 
predominant reasons for this. First, westward moving tropical systems often 
reach an atmospheric ridge weakness in the Bermuda High by the time they 
approach Florida at a latitude as northerly as Brevard County. Combined 
with frontal systems that exit the United States' East Coast, many of these 
tropical systems are steered northwest and eventually curve northward offshore 
along Florida's East Central Coast. A second reason is that hurricanes 
landfalling along the Florida peninsula Gulf Coast often weaken to a tropical 
storm by the time they move northeast to affect Brevard County (with some 
exceptions, such as 2004's Charley). No major hurricane, defined as category 
3 or higher, has ever struck Brevard since 1850, the beginning of recorded 
climate.[21] Although Brevardians may refer to past storms as "hurricanes", 
by the time they strike there, some of them may have subsided to tropical 
storms or depressions. Because of the threat of storm surge, the beach 
community on the barrier island is often required to evacuate well in advance 
of the storm.[22] The possibility of storm surge is diminished when the 
storm comes across the state instead of from the Atlantic.[23] Tornado-like 
eddies spinning off from even small storms can result in severe damage 
in small areas.[24] Generally, summertime tornadoes are brief, are at the 
EF0 or EF1 level, and may not actually touch down. During the dry season, 
they can attain a force of EF2 and touch the ground for miles.[25] While 
tornadoes in the Midwest are more severe, a higher rate of deaths are experienced 
in Florida, and Brevard County, specifically, due to higher population 
density and quantity of manufactured homes.[26] Five hurricanes have directly 
affected Brevard since 1950: David (September 3, 1979); Erin (August 2, 
1995) – made landfall near Sebastian Inlet and caused mostly minor wind 
damage and more extensive flooding countywide; Charley (August 13, 2004) 
– caused damage in Titusville and North Brevard; Frances (September 3, 
2004) – struck neighboring Vero Beach in Indian River County directly and 
caused widespread wind damage throughout Brevard;[27] and Jeanne (September 
26, 2004) – struck Vero Beach directly, following very nearly the same 
path as Frances. The latter two storms caused widespread damage in South 
Brevard, and resulted in $2.8 billion in claim payments.[28] Slightly more 
than half of one percent (0.6%) of houses were lost.[29] The following 
storms did not affect Brevard County with hurricane-force winds: Floyd 
(September 15, 1999),[30] and Irene (October 16, 1999).[31] Tropical Storm 
Fay dropped a record rainfall of 27.65 inches (70.2 cm) in 2008.[32] The 
winter of 2009–2010 was the coldest on record since 1937 when records were 
first kept.[33] Planting season, which normally starts around February 
14, came six weeks later instead.[34] Some flowers and herbs are planted 
as early as January.[35] December 2010 was the coldest December on record.[36] 
Brevard County works together with the federal and state government to 
control pollution and preserve wetlands and coastal areas through lands 
dedicated to conservation and wildlife protection. There are 250 square 
miles (650 km2) of federally protected wildlife refuges.[37] These lands 
include Merritt Island National Wildlife Refuge, the Canaveral National 
Seashore, the St. Johns National Wildlife Refuge, the Archie Carr National 
Wildlife Refuge, several conservation areas managed by the St. Johns River 
Water Management District, Brevard County's Environmentally Endangered 
Lands Program Sanctuaries,[38] and lands dedicated by the State as conservation 
areas. There are 4,000 species of animals locally.[39] Common mammals include 
North American river otters, bobcats, white-tailed deer, raccoons, marsh 
rabbits,[40] and opossum.[41] Feral pigs, introduced by Europeans, present 
an occasional traffic hazard. Lovebug season occurs twice annually in May 
and August–September. Motorists, usually, encounter swarms of these while 
driving during a four-week period.[42][43] Deer flies are particularly 
noticeable from April through June.[44] There were 596 manatees in Brevard 
County in 2009, out of a total of 3,802 in the state. This is a decline 
from 2007 when there was a total of 859 out of a state total of 2,817.[45] 
Bottlenose dolphin are commonly seen in the intercoastal waterway.[46] 
The poisonous brown recluse spider is not native to the area but has found 
the environment congenial.[47] The Florida Butterfly Monitoring Network 
has counted species of butterflies monthly for a year since 2007. In 2010, 
it counted 45 species.[48] Included are zebra swallowtail butterflies.[49] 
Fish and reptiles include alligators, red snapper, sea turtles,[41] scrub 
lizards,[49] and rat snakes.[50] There are an estimated 3,500 gopher tortoises 
in the county. They are on the endangered list.[51] North Atlantic right 
whales give birth near the coast of Brevard, among other places, from November 
15 to April 15. They are rare, a protected species.[52] Turkey vultures, 
a migrating species, are protected by federal law. They migrate north in 
the summer and return in September.[53] The county's most common winter 
bird is the lesser scaup, a diving duck. In 2008, half a million were counted. 
In 2010, 15,000 were estimated.[54] Local bird counts indicate that there 
are at least 163 species of birds in the county.[55] Other birds include 
the red-shouldered hawk,[56] the loggerhead shrike,[57] the endangered 
red-cockaded woodpecker,[58] Cooper's hawks, pileated woodpeckers, Savannah 
sparrows,[49] rails (which also includes coots), Florida scrub jays (an 
endangered species), wood storks, grackles,[41] great horned owls,[59] 
northern mockingbirds, brown thrashers, catbirds,[60] green-winged teals, 
greater yellowlegs, western sandpipers, least sandpipers, dowitchers, and 
American white pelicans.[50] Peak migration in the fall is from the last 
week in September through the first week in October. Fall migration tends 
to be stronger than spring because birds typically take different flyways.[61] 
Live oak trees, various grasses, and juniper plants were sufficiently common 
to generate pollen noticeable by some people in February, 2011.[62] Native 
trees include cabbage palm (the state tree of Florida), fringetree, coral 
bean, sweet acacia, geiger tree,[63] firebush, beautyberry, coral honeysuckle, 
and blanket flower.[64] Native plants include sea grape, red mulberry, 
purslane, dandelion, Spanish bayonet, blackberry, Jerusalem artichoke, 
dogwood, and gallberry.[65] On the east coast of the state, mangroves have 
normally dominated the coast from Cocoa Beach southward. Northward these 
may compete with salt marshes moving in from the north, depending on the 
annual weather conditions.[66] According to the 2000 census, the county 
had about 80,000 veterans. 21% of the population older than 18 is a veteran.[72] 
This had dropped to 74,000 in 2010. This was 21% of the people in the county.[73] 
An actual count by a local agency in 2010 indicated that 225 of veterans 
were homeless.[74] In 2007, a local census by volunteers counted 1,899 
homeless residents.[75] In the 1950s, the county population was just under 
24,000. In 1960, it was just over 111,000. In 1969, at the height of the 
space program, it was 234,000.[76] U.S. Census Bureau 2010 Ethnic/Race 
Demographics:[77][78] In 2010, 8.3% of the population considered themselves 
to be of only "American" ancestry (regardless of race or ethnicity.)[77] 
There were 229,692 households out of which 23.20% had children under the 
age of 18 living with them, 48.28% were married couples living together, 
11.80% had a female householder with no husband present, and 35.40% were 
non-families. 28.44% of all households were made up of individuals and 
12.53% (4.00% male and 8.53% female) had someone living alone who was 65 
years of age or older. The average household size was 2.33 and the average 
family size was 2.84.[78][81] The population was distributed by age with 
19.8% under the age of 18, 7.9% from 18 to 24, 21.5% from 25 to 44, 30.4% 
from 45 to 64, and 20.4% who were 65 years of age or older. The median 
age was 45.5 years. For every 100 females there were 96.1 males. For every 
100 females age 18 and over, there were 93.9 males.[81] In 2010, the oldest 
person in the county was a 110-year-old Titusville man.[82] The median 
income for a household in the county was $49,523, and the median income 
for a family was $60,842. Males had a median income of $48,191 versus $33,276 
for females. The per capita income for the county was $27,606. About 7.2% 
of families and 10.5% of the population were below the poverty line, including 
14.4% of those under age 18 and 6.9% of those aged 65 or over.[83] In 2010, 
8.6% of the county's population was foreign born, with 59.4% being naturalized 
American citizens. Of foreign-born residents, 49.1% were born in Latin 
America, 22.9% were born in Europe, 18.3% born in Asia, 6.4% in North America, 
2.4% born in Africa, and 0.9% were born in Oceania.[77] In 2010, 90% of 
residents had a high school degree, compared with 85% statewide.[84] In 
2009, 25.7% of residents had an undergraduate degree, below the national 
average of 27.7%,[85] but the same as the rest of Florida.[84] 14.7% of 
residents over 25 had undergraduate degrees in engineering. This is almost 
twice the national average.[86] From 2007 through 2010, the population 
has been essentially static.[87] In 2012, the Urban Institute ranked the 
Brevard metro fourth in the country for racial equality. Criteria were 
integration of neighborhoods, income, and the quality of schools minorities 
attend. The area was ranked first for Hispanic equality with whites.[88] 
As of 2010, 90.20% of all residents spoke English as their first language, 
while 5.29% spoke Spanish, 0.62% German, 0.61% French, and 0.47% French 
Creole (mostly Haitian Creole) as their mother language.[89] In total, 
9.80% of the population spoke languages other than English as their primary 
language.[89] In 2010, Evangelical Protestants numbered 79,893; mainline 
Protestants 30,877; Catholics 64,831; Unaffiliated 353,946.[90] In 2000, 
the following were counted by denomination:[91] The United States Office 
of Management and Budget has designated Brevard County as the Palm Bay-Melbourne-Titusville, 
FL Metropolitan Statistical Area.[92] The United States Census Bureau ranked 
the Palm Bay-Melbourne-Titusville, FL Metropolitan Statistical Area as 
the 98th most populous metropolitan statistical area and the 96th most 
populous primary statistical area of the United States as of July 1, 2012.[93][94] 
Brevard county commissioners are elected by the public to establish ordinances 
and policies for the county. The Commission appoints a County Manager, 
who executes the will of the Commission. The county employed about 2,900 
workers in 2009.[95] There are 16 autonomous municipal governments within 
the county. The various cities, towns and villages of Brevard have varying 
reliance on services provided by the Brevard County government. There are 
about 100,000 homes outside organized municipalities, whose occupants are 
directly served by the county government.[96] A centrally located County 
Government Center in Viera houses the various county government branches, 
including Housing and Human Services, Juvenile Justice, Public Safety, 
Public Works and Solid Waste Management. The Brevard County government 
had annual expenditures just over $1 billion in the fiscal year 2009–2010, 
exclusive of the municipalities.[97] In 2009, real estate taxes for homesteaded 
property averaged .83% of the value of the property.[98] Real estate taxes 
are levied by each authority. They are collected by the County Tax Collector.[99] 
The total taxable real estate base was $33.7 billion in 2009.[100] County 
taxes rose 26.5% in total per capita revenue from 2002 to 2007, and 49.8% 
in property tax per capita in the same time frame.[101] Delinquent taxes 
were $36 million in 2008.[102] In 2012 bonds issued by the county were 
given a rating of AA by the Fitch Group and improved ratings by Moody's.[103] 
Brevard County has two unique election districts. One governs Port Canaveral; 
the other, the maintenance of the Sebastian Inlet. County Commissioners: 
Commissioners were paid $58,308 annually in 2011.[107] The following are 
considered state officials but are elected and paid by the county: Since 
the 2010 U.S. Census, Brevard County lies within Florida's 8th congressional 
district, which is represented by Republican Bill Posey. The county lies 
within two state senatorial districts, 13th and 16th. They are held by 
Thad Altman and Andy Gardiner. The county lies within five state representative 
districts. These seats are held by Tom Goodson representing the 50th district, 
Ritch Workman representing the 52nd district, John Tobia representing the 
53rd district, Steve Crisafulli representing the 51st district, and Debbie 
Mayfield representing the 54th district. Prior to the creation of districts 
in 1967, state representatives were elected by county. Beginning in 1967, 
Brevard County was represented by the 71st, 72nd, 73rd, and 74th districts. 
Following redistricting in 1970, the county was represented by the 44th, 
45th, 46th, 47th and 48th districts. Following redistricting in 1982, the 
county was represented by the 31st, 32nd, 33rd, 34th, 77th, and 78th districts. 
Following redistricting in 1992, the county was represented by the 29th, 
30th, 31st, and 32nd districts. Following redistricting in 2002, the county 
was represented by the 29th, 30th, 31st, 32nd, and 80th districts. The 
county has centralized most county and circuit courts in Viera which try 
a variety of cases including felonies, misdemeanors, traffic, and domestic. 
The courthouse in Titusville provides the venue for circuit and county 
cases arising in the north part of the county while the courthouse in Melbourne 
is the venue for county cases arising in the southern portion of the county. 
An elected State Attorney prosecutes criminal cases for the State of Florida. 
Indigent defendants can be represented by the office of the elected Public 
Defender. The 18th Circuit Court includes Seminole County as well as Brevard 
and covers not only the court itself but the State Attorney and the Public 
Defender.[112] In 2008, the public defender had a staff of 45 lawyers in 
Brevard who handled about 24,000 cases annually.[113] The County elects 
a sheriff, directly responsible to the courts but also to the state for 
the enforcement of state laws. Police chiefs, appointed by their cities 
or towns, perform the same function locally. There is no overlap in jurisdictions. 
Some volunteers work alongside paid professionals.[114] Most municipalities 
are located on at least one waterway. This has resulted in the county and 
seven cities having a boat or access to one to aid boaters, or to enforce 
the law in the water in their jurisdiction.[115] The county jail is a 1976 
facility which rapidly became overcrowded. Voters rejected expanding the 
jail on four occasions.[116] The sheriff solved the problem by the construction 
of a large but less expensive "hardened tent" to house non-violent offenders. 
Crowding reached its peak in 2007 at 1,988 inmates, 300 over capacity. 
The budget for the facility was $42 million in 2010. There were 1,585 residents. 
Costs for feeding and housing was $72 per inmate daily. There were 475 
staff members.[117] The county jail retains inmates awaiting trial or those 
who have been sentenced to a year or less. Longer sentences must be served 
in state prisons, such as the facility in Sharpes for young men. A unit 
of the Coast Guard, homeported at Port Canaveral, plays a role in preventing 
illegal immigration and is an interdictor of drugs in the area. The States 
Attorney's Office sponsors the Victim/Witness Services.[118] This provides 
advocates to alleged victims of violent crime and their families. The advocate 
helps the family understand the legal system as they navigate through it. 
They also seek out financial assistance or counseling they might need. 
In 2005 they helped 8,448 alleged victims in Brevard County. Public safety 
for unincorporated areas of the county is the responsibility of the Brevard 
County Sheriff's Office. All but three of the 17 incorporated municipalities, 
Malabar, Cape Canaveral and Palm Shores, maintain their own law enforcement 
services. Those three contract that service to the Sheriff's Office.[119] 
In 2009, there were 1,200 law enforcement officers working in the county, 
of which 361 are sheriff's deputies.[120] The number of Sheriff's deputies 
had risen to 843 in 2015.[121] Of all crime that came to the attention 
of the sheriff's office in 2007, 80% was drug-related.[122] From January 
to June 2009, the county reported a total of 10,037 crimes. Of these, a 
majority, 3.002, were under the jurisdiction of the sheriff's department.[123] 
In 2009, the crime rate was 3,471.3 property-related crimes per 100,000 
residents, slightly above the national average.[85] Public safety for Port 
Canaveral is under the direction of the Port Authority. Traditionally, 
emphasis was placed on monitoring the content of containerized cargo on 
incoming ships, as well as underwater inspection of arriving ships that 
could be carrying explosive devices. In 2008, the Canaveral Port Authority 
Board of Commissioners approved the creation of an independent police department.[124][125] 
The county runs a fire-rescue service. In the year 2015-2016, they responded 
to 11,383 trauma calls.[126] Three cities provide potable water and sewage 
for their cities and surrounding areas: Cocoa, Melbourne, and Titusville. 
Where available, residents were obligated to hook into the system. In 2012, 
there were 90,000 septic tanks.[127] Stormsewer fees vary. In 2014, the 
county charged $36 annually per household. Cities and towns charged from 
$36 to $$77.52 per household annually.[128] More than 200 parks, three 
campgrounds, and six public golf courses in the county are managed by local 
government agencies.[129][130] Many of these are managed by the Brevard 
County Parks and Recreation, an agency within the Brevard County Government. 
In 11 sanctuaries that protect natural ecosystems, the county's Environmentally 
Endangered Lands (EEL) Program offers passive recreation opportunities 
such as hiking, wildlife viewing, biking and paddling. In 2013, there was 
a total of 24,000 acres (9,700 ha), with 62 miles (100 km) of trails and 
120 miles (190 km) of fire lanes. The quantity of fire lanes was considered 
insufficient.[131] The Merritt Island National Wildlife Refuge[132] and 
the Canaveral National Seashore[133] are two national wildlife refuges 
in the county that offer recreational pursuits such as hiking, wildlife 
viewing, paddling, and environmental education. Brevard County tries to 
provide a number of services to help the aged, juveniles, the physically 
and mentally handicapped, and minorities. According to the Secretary of 
State's office, Republicans are a plurality of registered voters in Brevard 
County. The county Domestic Product was $14.5 billion in 2009.[135] In 
2010 and 2011, the Brookings Institution reported that Brevard ranked in 
the bottom fifth of the nation's top metro areas, based on unemployment, 
gross metropolitan product, housing prices and foreclosed properties.[136] 
Foreclosures reached a monthly high of 963 in March 2009.[137] The county 
reached an annual high foreclosure in 2009 of 9,772.[138] In December 2010, 
Forbes magazine rated the area the worst place in America to find a job.[139] 
Government purchasing contributed 12%-15% of the county's gross domestic 
product from 2000 to 2010.[140] Though the area has a relatively small 
number of high technology companies, 736, a business journal ranked it 
eighth in the country as a high tech center in 2009. The area had 23,096 
high-tech jobs with a ratio of 124 per 1,000 total jobs.[141] In December 
2010, Forbes magazine ranked the area as the worst in the country for finding 
a job, for the second time in 2010.[142] As of the census of 2000: The 
county ranked 17th for per capita income, out of Florida's 67 counties. 
The following were below the poverty line in 2000: In 2012, 79,621 people 
in the county were receiving food stamps.[144] In 2010, there were 5,600 
civilian government workers in the county. They earned an average of $74,000 
each in 2009.[145] 84,401 households in the county (38%) received social 
security payments in 2009 averaging $16,136 for a total of $1.7 billion 
annually. 53,717 (24%) received pension payments averaging $24,327 for 
a total of $1.3 billion annually.[146] In 2011, the county was rated 6th 
worst in the country for foreclosures. There were 1,039 for the third quarter 
of 2010. Nearly half the homes in the county were worth less than their

RealtyTrac. It has since reduced its backlog.[148] Monthly foreclosures 
exceeded 746 from January 2009 through October. Maximum monthly home sales 
were less than 584 during that time frame, creating an accumulating backlog

and county acquiescence to create a self-governing board that could raise 
taxes and sell bonds to pay for roads, water lines, pumping stations and 
other infrastructure needed to support the construction of 16,500 houses, 
apartments and condominiums. The company proved that development could 
fund itself.[155] The Brevard economy has been driven by Trade, Transportation 
and Utilities (18%), Professional and Business Services (17%), Total government 
(15%), Education and Health (14%), Manufacturing (12%), Leisure and hospitality

local small companies as among the fastest growing in the country over 
the past three years – Applied Global Technology (nearly 100% annually) 
and Stops (nearly 200% annually). Though the area has a relatively small 
number of high technology companies, 736, a business journal ranked it 
eighth in the country as a high tech center in 2009. The area had 23,096 
high-tech jobs with a ratio of 124 per 1,000 total jobs.[161] The county 
had 1,050 restaurants in 2007 and nearly that many (1,040) in 2010. There

2010.[162] In the early 2010s, the Shiloh area was proposed by Space Florida 
as a potential location for the development of a commercial-only spaceport. 
Located immediately north of the U.S. Government's Kennedy Space Center, 
the open access to the flyover range on the open Atlantic Ocean to the 
east, and easy access to the tracking facilities of the Eastern Test Range 
make the location an attractive launch site. Among other potential users 
of the commercial spaceport facility, SpaceX was reported to be considering 
Shiloh as one of several potential locations for building a commercial 
launch facility.[163] In 2012 there were 2,900 military jobs in the county.[156]

2,000 civilian federal workers.[145] The Navy maintains a Trident turning 
basin at Port Canaveral for ballistic missile submarines. The Naval Ordnance 
Test Unit (NOTU) tests weapons on these subs, which arrive at the rate 
of one a month. The 2005 base closures included realigning NOTU out of 
state. The community was successful in having this decision revoked.[citation 
needed] The unit employs 100 military personnel and 900 civilian contractors.[164] 
CCAFS houses the Air Force Space & Missile Museum as Launch Complex 26, 
where many unmanned rockets were launched early in the U.S. space program, 
including Explorer 1, the first US spacecraft placed in earth orbit.[citation

help promote the area. The Space Coast Office of Tourism consists of county 
staff and the Brevard County Tourist Development Council (TDC). They attempt 
to attract tourists. The TDC serves as an advisory council to the county 
on the expenditures of revenues received from a tourist tax. This revenue

Texas, Colorado Springs, Colorado, Huntsville, Alabama, and Raleigh, North 
Carolina. It evaluated nine areas: business dynamism/vitality, competitiveness, 
education, economic growth, economic prosperity, livability, productivity/labor

against national figures, and scored high in livability, it usually ranked 
last against these "peers" in the other eight areas.[85] In 2009, the county 
had 13 patents per 1,000 workers, more than double the national average

and short commute times, among others.[191] In August 2009, Florida Trend 
rated two Brevard companies, Harris Corporation[192] and Health First Health 
Plans,[193] in their rankings of the best places to work in Florida. In 
May 2009, the Palm Bay-Melbourne area was ranked as the #8 tech center 
in the United States by Bizjournals. It overcame its low number of total 
high-tech companies and jobs by having a high number of jobs per high tech 
company (#4) and high tech jobs compared to total private-sector jobs (#2).[194] 
Forbes magazine ranked Melbourne 2nd out of 150 metropolitan areas in the 
US, for the percentage of the population that are engineers, 6.6%, just

a leadership development organization for local business and civic groups, 
and Brevard Tomorrow commissioned a survey of people 21-44. Basically,

at the expense of being singles-friendly. While this may have labor repercussions 
later, currently business is having no problems hiring. The county had

mitigation for this new landfill.[243] In 2013, the county, for the first 
time, let a seven-year contract out for bids for solid waste. The resulting 
contract is expected to cost $1 billion over the lifetime of the contract, 
the county's largest single contract. This was the first time in 20 years, 
a bid was requested. In the past, Waste Management, Inc has performed the 
work, not only for the county but for 9 of 16 Brevard municipalities. Waste 
Pro has five of the remaining municipal contracts. Rockledge and Titusville
