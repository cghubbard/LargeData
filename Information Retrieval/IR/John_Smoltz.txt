John Andrew Smoltz (born May 15, 1967), nicknamed "Smoltzie"[1] and "Marmaduke,"[2] 
is an American former baseball pitcher who played 22 seasons in Major League 
Baseball from 1988 to 2009, all but the last year with the Atlanta Braves. 
An eight-time All-Star, Smoltz was one of a celebrated trio of starting 
pitchers, along with Greg Maddux and Tom Glavine, who propelled Atlanta 
to perennial pennant contention in the 1990s, highlighted by a championship 
in the 1995 World Series. He won the National League (NL) Cy Young Award 
in 1996 after posting a record of 24–8, equaling the most victories by 
an NL pitcher since 1972. Though predominantly known as a starter, Smoltz 
was converted to a reliever in 2001 following his recovery from Tommy John 
surgery, and spent four years as the team's closer before returning to 
a starting role. In 2002, he set the NL record with 55 saves, and became 
only the second pitcher in history (joining Dennis Eckersley) to record 
both a 20-win season and a 50-save season. He is the only pitcher in major 
league history to record both 200 wins and 150 saves. Smoltz was one of 
the most prominent pitchers in playoff history, posting a record of 15–4 
with a 2.67 earned run average (ERA) in 41 career postseason games, and 
was named the Most Valuable Player of the 1992 NL Championship Series; 
Andy Pettitte later broke his record for career postseason wins. Smoltz 
led the NL in wins, winning percentage, strikeouts and innings pitched 
twice each, and his NL total of 3,051 strikeouts ranked fifth in league 
history when he retired. He also holds the Braves franchise record for 
career strikeouts (3,011), and the record for the most career games pitched 
for the Braves (708) since the club's move to Atlanta in 1966; from 2004 
to 2014, he held the franchise record for career saves. Smoltz left the 
Braves after 2008 and split his final season with the Boston Red Sox and 
St. Louis Cardinals. Since retiring as a player, he has served as a color 
commentator and analyst on television. He was elected to the Baseball Hall 
of Fame in 2015, his first year of eligibility. John Smoltz was an All-State 
baseball and football player at Waverly High School in Lansing, Michigan 
before the Detroit Tigers selected him in the 22nd round of the 1985 amateur 
draft.[3] He was the 574th selection of the draft.[4] Smoltz played initially 
for the Class A Lakeland Tigers minor league team, and then moved on to 
the Class AA Glens Falls Tigers in 1987, posting disappointing records 
of 7–8 and 4–10.[5] On August 12, 1987, he was traded to the Atlanta Braves 
where he played on their Class AAA Richmond Braves. The 1987 Tigers were 
in a three-team race, chasing the Toronto Blue Jays for the AL East division 
lead; in need of pitching help, Detroit sent their 20-year-old prospect 
to the Braves for the 36-year-old veteran Doyle Alexander. While Alexander 
did help the Tigers overtake the Blue Jays for the division title, he was 
out of baseball by 1989. Smoltz, on the other hand, became one of the cornerstones 
of the Braves franchise for the next two decades. Smoltz made his major 
league debut on July 23, 1988. He posted poor statistics in a dozen starts, 
but in 1989 Smoltz blossomed. In 29 starts, he recorded a 12–11 record 
and 2.94 ERA while pitching 208 innings, and was named to the NL All-Star 
team. Teammate Tom Glavine also had his first good year in 1989, raising 
optimism about the future of Atlanta's pitching staff. Over his career, 
Smoltz threw a four-seam fastball that was clocked as high as 98 miles 
per hour, a strong, effective slider, and an 88–91 mph split-finger fastball 
that he used as a strikeout pitch. He also used a curveball and change-up 
on occasion, and in 1999, he began experimenting with both a knuckleball 
and a screwball, though he rarely used either in game situations.[6] Smoltz 
began the 1991 season with a 2–11 record. He began seeing a sports psychologist, 
after which he closed out the season on a 12–2 pace,[7] helping the Braves 
win a tight NL West race. His winning ways continued into the 1991 National 
League Championship Series. Smoltz won both his starts against the Pittsburgh 
Pirates, capped by a complete game shutout in the seventh game, propelling 
the Braves to their first World Series since moving to Atlanta in 1966. 
Smoltz had two no-decisions against the Minnesota Twins, with a 1.26 ERA. 
In the seventh and deciding game, he faced his former Detroit Tiger hero, 
Jack Morris. Both starters pitched shutout ball for seven innings, before 
Smoltz was removed from the 0–0 game during a Twins threat in the eighth. 
Atlanta reliever Mike Stanton pitched out of the jam, getting Smoltz off 
the hook, and Morris eventually pitched a 10-inning complete game victory. 
The next year, Smoltz won fifteen regular season games and was the MVP 
of the 1992 National League Championship Series, winning two games. He 
left the seventh game trailing, but ended up with a no-decision as the 
Braves mounted a dramatic ninth-inning comeback win. In the World Series 
that year, Smoltz started two of the six games in the series, with a no-decision 
in Game 2 and a win with the Braves facing elimination in Game 5. Before 
the 1993 season, the Braves signed renowned control pitcher Greg Maddux, 
completing – along with Smoltz and Glavine – what many consider to be the 
most accomplished starting trio ever assembled on a single major league 
team. Smoltz again won fifteen games, but suffered his first postseason 
loss to the Philadelphia Phillies in the NLCS despite not allowing an earned 
run. Smoltz had a 6–10 record in the strike-shortened 1994 season, and 
during the break, had bone chips removed from his elbow.[8] Returning as 
the Braves' #3 starter, he posted a 12–7 record in 1995. Smoltz had shaky 
postseason numbers, avoiding a decision despite a 6.60 ERA. But Smoltz 
and the Braves won the franchise's only World Series in Atlanta, thanks 
in great part to Maddux and Glavine, who had begun to overshadow Smoltz. 
The following season, 1996, was the best of Smoltz's career. He went 24–8 
with a 2.94 ERA and 276 strikeouts, including winning a franchise-record 
fourteen straight decisions from April 9 to June 19.[8] He won the NL Cy 
Young Award with 26 of the 28 first-place votes. Smoltz's effectiveness 
in 1997 was only slightly less than his Cy Young season, but frugal run 
support limited him to a 15–12 record. Smoltz also received a Silver Slugger 
Award for his batting. Smoltz continued to post excellent statistics in 
1998 and 1999, but he was spending significant time on the disabled list 
and missed about a quarter of his starts. In 1999, Smoltz began experimenting 
with both a knuckleball and a three-quarters delivery, though he rarely 
used either in game situations.[9] He underwent Tommy John surgery prior 
to the 2000 season, and missed the entire year.[10] When he was unable 
to perform effectively as a starter in 2001, Smoltz made a transition to 
the bullpen, filling a void as Atlanta's new closer down the stretch, replacing 
John Rocker. In 2002, his first full season as a closer, Smoltz set a National 
League record with 55 saves, topping the previous mark of 53 shared by 
Randy Myers (1993) and Trevor Hoffman (1998), but falling two short of 
Bobby Thigpen's major league record of 57; he tied the record on September 
22 in a 4–1 win over the Florida Marlins, and broke it on September 27 
in the first game of a doubleheader, a 3–1 road win over the New York Mets. 
Smoltz finished third in the Cy Young Award voting; Éric Gagné equalled 
his new record a year later with the Dodgers. Injuries limited Smoltz slightly 
in 2003, but he still recorded 45 saves with a 1.12 ERA in 64⅓ innings 
pitched. In 2004, Smoltz finished with 44 saves, but was frustrated with 
his inability to make an impact as a closer during another Braves' postseason 
loss. That year, he broke Gene Garber's franchise record of 141 career 
saves; his final total of 154 saves was eventually surpassed by Craig Kimbrel 
in 2014. By this point, Smoltz was all that remained of the once-dominant 
Atlanta Braves' rotation of the 1990s. Tom Glavine had moved on to play 
for the Mets, a divisional rival, while Greg Maddux returned to his old 
team, the Chicago Cubs. After three years as one of baseball's most dominating 
closers, the team's management agreed to return Smoltz to the starting 
rotation prior to the 2005 season. His renewed career as a starter began 
inauspiciously. He allowed six earned runs in only 1 2⁄3 innings—matching 
the shortest starts of his career—as the Braves were blown out on Opening 
Day by the Marlins. Poor run support contributed to an 0–3 start despite 
stronger pitching performances by Smoltz. After these initial difficulties, 
though, things fell into place. At the All-Star break, Smoltz was 9–5 with 
an ERA of 2.68 and was chosen for the 2005 NL All-Star team. Smoltz gave 
up a solo home run to Miguel Tejada in the second inning of the American 
League's 7–5 victory and was charged with the loss. For his career, he 
was 1–2 in All-Star games, putting him in a tie for the most losses. Smoltz 
finished 2005 at 14–7, with a 3.06 ERA and 169 strikeouts while allowing 
less than one hit per inning. Smoltz had answered the critics who doubted 
he would be able to reach the 200-inning plateau after three years in the 
bullpen. Nonetheless, Smoltz's increased workload caused him to wear down 
towards the end of the season. Despite a sore shoulder, Smoltz pitched 
seven innings in the Braves' 7–1 win over the Houston Astros in Game 2 
of the 2005 NL Division Series; it was the only game the Braves won in 
the series against the eventual National League champions. The victory 
over Houston gave Smoltz a 13–4 record as a starter (15–4 overall) with 
a 2.65 ERA in the postseason. He has the second most postseason wins (15) 
behind only Andy Pettitte with 19. They are followed by Glavine (14) and 
Maddux (11). In 2006, Smoltz finished the season with a record of 16–9, 
an ERA of 3.49, and 211 strikeouts. He was one of four pitchers tied for 
the NL lead in wins, and was third in strikeouts. The fact that the Braves 
bullpen blew six of Smoltz's leads in 2006 robbed him of a strong chance 
at a 20-win season. On September 21, 2006, the Braves announced they had 
picked up Smoltz's $8 million contract option for the 2007 season. On April 
26, 2007, Smoltz agreed to a contract extension with the Braves. The extension 
includes a $14 million salary for the 2008 season, a $12 million vesting 
option for 2009 dependent on his ability to pitch 200 innings in 2008, 
and a $12 or $13 million team option for 2010 dependent on his ability 
to pitch 200 innings in 2009.[11] 2007 was a year of reunions and milestones 
for Smoltz. On May 9, he faced Maddux for the first time since July 10, 
1992. Smoltz earned a win in a 3–2 victory over the San Diego Padres; Maddux 
received no decision. On May 24, exactly eleven years to the day after 
recording his 100th win, Smoltz recorded his 200th win against Glavine.[12] 
He faced Glavine three other times, faring 3–1 overall against him. On 
June 27, Smoltz, Glavine and Maddux all recorded wins on the same day. 
On August 19, Smoltz set the new Braves strikeout record by striking out 
the Arizona Diamondbacks' Mark Reynolds. It was his 2,913th strikeout, 
passing Phil Niekro on the club' all-time list; he struck out a season-high 
12 in the game.[13] He finished the year 14–8 with a 3.11 ERA and 197 strikeouts. 
The stalwart pitcher was the only holdover on the Braves roster from their 
1991 worst-to-first season until Glavine returned to the Braves after an 
absence of several years following the 2007 season. On April 22, 2008, 
Smoltz became the 16th pitcher in major league history to reach 3,000 career 
strikeouts, and the fourth pitcher to strike out 3,000 batters for one 
team, joining Walter Johnson, Bob Gibson and Steve Carlton. On April 28, 
2008, Smoltz was placed on the 15-day disabled list due to an inflamed 
right shoulder.[14] On May 1, 2008, Smoltz indicated that he intended to 
return to being a relief pitcher. After coming off the disabled list on 
June 2, 2008, he blew his first save opportunity in three years. Two days 
later, the Braves placed him back on the disabled list. Smoltz underwent 
season-ending shoulder surgery on June 10, 2008.[15] His contract expired 
at the end of the season, and the contract offer from the Braves was not 
sufficient to keep him.[16] In December 2008, several members of the Boston 
Red Sox organization, including pitching coach John Farrell, vice president 
of player personnel Ben Cherington, and assistant trainer Mike Reinold, 
flew to Atlanta to participate in a 90-minute workout with Smoltz. Throwing 
for only the second time since having surgery on a torn labrum in his pitching 
shoulder, he threw a 50-pitch side session and showcased not only his tremendous 
progress since the surgery, but an arsenal of well-developed pitches which 
made him so successful throughout his career. He impressed the Red Sox 
enough during the workout that less than a month later, a one-year contract 
was offered by the organization.[17] On January 13, 2009, Smoltz signed 
a one-year contract with the Red Sox for a reported base salary of $5.5 million 
with roster time incentives and miscellaneous award incentives which could 
net as much as $10 million.[18] He made his first start in the Red Sox 
rotation on June 25, allowing seven hits and five runs through five innings.[19][20] 
Smoltz posted a 2–5 record over eight games with an 8.32 ERA and no quality 
starts. He was designated for assignment on August 7 after a 13–6 loss 
to the New York Yankees, giving the Red Sox ten days to release or trade 
him, or send him to the minors.[21] The Red Sox offered Smoltz a minor 
league stint in order to prepare him to be placed in the bullpen, but he 
rejected the offer.[22] On August 17, the Red Sox released Smoltz.[23] 
On August 19, 2009, Smoltz signed with the St. Louis Cardinals; he made 
his debut against the Padres on August 23. In his first game for the Cardinals, 
he went five innings, striking out nine and walking none, while setting 
a Cardinals franchise record by striking out seven batters in a row.[24] 
That win against the Padres with the Cardinals was his only win with them 
that season. Smoltz finished 1–3 with an ERA of 4.26 with the Cardinals. 
He was 3–8 with an ERA of 6.35 overall with the Red Sox and Cardinals. 
In Game 3 of the 2009 NL Division Series, Smoltz pitched two innings of 
relief in a losing cause, allowing four hits and an earned run while striking 
out five.[25] On April 16, 2012, the Braves announced that they would retire 
Smoltz's number 29.[26] The ceremony, which took place before the June 
8 game against the Toronto Blue Jays, included speeches by former broadcaster 
Pete van Wieren, former teammate Matt Diaz and former manager Bobby Cox.[27] 
In 2008 and 2010, Smoltz served as a color analyst alongside Joe Simpson 
for Braves games on Peachtree TV. Nationally, Smoltz has been an analyst 
for MLB Network and called regular season and postseason games for TBS.[28] 
In 2014, he was hired by Fox Sports as a game analyst. He will be paired 
with Matt Vasgersian and call games in the No.2 booth.[29] He has also 
joined Fox Sports South and SportSouth to be an analyst for select Braves 
games during the 2014 season.[30] Smoltz will replace Harold Reynolds and 
Tom Verducci, his colleagues from MLB Network, as the lead analyst for 
Major League Baseball on Fox for the 2016 season, teaming up with Joe Buck.[31] 
Smoltz was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility 
in 2015,[32] which surprised many observers; he was the first starting 
pitcher since 1987 to be elected despite having fewer than 250 wins and 
only one Cy Young Award, and the first such starter ever elected on the 
first ballot. Voters may have been swayed by the opinions of Maddux and 
Glavine, who had both recommended the election of Smoltz in their own induction 
speeches in 2014. Smoltz met his first wife Dyan Struble at the Omni Hotel 
in downtown Atlanta; the couple had four children before divorcing in 2007 
after 16 years of marriage.[33] Smoltz lives in Alpharetta, Georgia and 
also has a home at Sea Island, a golf resort. On May 16, 2009, Smoltz married 
the former Kathryn Darden at his home with 70 friends and family in attendance.[34] 
Smoltz is a Christian.[citation needed]. Smoltz is a good friend of professional 
golfer Tiger Woods; the two often golf together.[35] Woods has stated that 
Smoltz is the best golfer outside of the PGA Tour that he has observed.[36] 
Smoltz has stated that he once had a plus 4 handicap.[37] He is also involved 
in the sport of bowling.[38] Smoltz counts Doc Rivers as a personal friend 
dating back to Rivers' playing days in Atlanta. In the edition of January 
12, 2008 of the Boston Globe, Rivers is quoted as saying, "I offered him 
my apartment... I just told him about Terry and the Red Sox organization. 
I told him it's a no-brainer." Smoltz is also an accomplished accordionist, 
and has starred in a television commercial for The Home Depot. Smoltz is 
a distant cousin of baseball Hall of Famer Charlie Gehringer.[39] Smoltz 
produced an automated campaign phone recording on behalf of the candidacy 
of Ralph E. Reed, Jr. for Lieutenant Governor of Georgia during the 2006 
primary.[40] It was speculated that Smoltz would run for Congress in 2010 
as a Republican candidate to fill the departing John Linder's seat in Georgia's 
7th congressional district.[41] On April 22, 2012, Smoltz hosted a fundraiser 
for Andrea Cascarilla, a Democratic candidate for State Representative 
in Michigan's 71st House District.[42] The 71st District encompasses Waverly 
Senior High School, where Smoltz was an All-State baseball and basketball 
player. Smoltz and his good friend Jeff Foxworthy teamed up for the charity 
event "An Evening With Smoltz and Friends" on November 9, 2008 at the Verizon 
Amphitheater in Alpharetta to raise money for the John Smoltz Foundation, 
which has supported numerous charitable endeavors in the Atlanta area over 
the past decade.[43] Smoltz is the Atlanta host for Big League Impact, 
an eight-city fantasy football network created and led by longtime Cardinals 
pitcher and former teammate Adam Wainwright. In 2015, the organization 
raised more than $1 million total for various charitable organizations.[44]
