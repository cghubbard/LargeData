Roberto Enrique Clemente Walker[a] (Spanish pronunciation: [roˈβeɾto enˈrike 
kleˈmente (g)walˈkeɾ]; August 18, 1934 – December 31, 1972) was a Puerto 
Rican professional baseball player. Clemente spent 18 Major League Baseball 
(MLB) seasons playing in the National League (NL) as a right fielder for 
the Pittsburgh Pirates. He was inducted into the National Baseball Hall 
of Fame in 1973, becoming the first Latin American and Caribbean player 
to be enshrined. His untimely death established the precedent that, as 
an alternative to the five-year retirement period, a player who has been 
deceased for at least six months is eligible for entry into the Hall of 
Fame. Clemente was an All-Star for twelve seasons and fifteen All-Star 
Games.[b] He was the NL Most Valuable Player in 1966, the NL batting leader 
in 1961, 1964, 1965, and 1967, and a Gold Glove winner for twelve consecutive 
seasons from 1961 through 1972. His batting average was over .300 for thirteen 
seasons and he had 3,000 major league hits during his career. He also played 
in two World Series championships. Clemente is the first Latin American 
and Caribbean player to help win a World Series as a starter (1960), to 
receive an NL MVP Award (1966), and to receive a World Series MVP Award 
(1971). Clemente was married in 1964; he and his wife had three children. 
He was involved in charity work in Latin American and Caribbean countries 
during the off-seasons, often delivering baseball equipment and food to 
those in need. On December 31, 1972, he died in a plane crash while en 
route to deliver aid to earthquake victims in Nicaragua. Roberto Clemente 
was born in Barrio San Antón,[c] Carolina,[3] Puerto Rico, to Don Melchor 
Clemente and Doña Luisa Walker. He was the youngest of seven siblings; 
Clemente had four brothers and two sisters. During his childhood, his father 
worked as foreman of sugar crops located in the municipality.[4] Because 
the family's resources were limited, Clemente worked alongside his father 
in the fields, loading and unloading trucks. Clemente showed interest in 
baseball early in life and often played against neighboring barrios. He 
attended Vizcarrondo High School in Carolina. During his first year in 
high school, he was recruited by Roberto Marín to play softball with the 
Sello Rojo team after Marín saw Clemente playing baseball in barrio San 
Antón.[5] He was with the team two years as shortstop. Clemente joined 
Puerto Rico's amateur league when he was 16 years old, playing for the 
Ferdinand Juncos team, which represented the municipality of Juncos.[6] 
Clemente's professional baseball career began when Pedrín Zorilla offered 
Clemente, 18, a contract which he signed on October 9, 1952, with the Cangrejeros 
de Santurce, a winter league team and franchise of the LBBPR.[7] He was 
a bench player during his first season but was promoted to the Santurce 
Cangrejeros ("Crabbers") starting lineup the following season. During this 
season he hit .288 as the Crabbers leadoff hitter. While Clemente was playing 
in the LBBPR, the Brooklyn Dodgers offered him a contract with one of the 
team's Triple-A affiliates.[8] After signing with the Dodgers on February 
19, 1954, Clemente moved to Montreal to play with the Royals. Affected 
early on by both climate and language differences, Clemente received assistance 
from bilingual teammates such as infielder Chico Fernandez and pitchers 
Tommy Lasorda [d] and Joe Black.[9] In fact, it was Black who was the original 
target of the Pittsburgh Pirates' June 1, 1954 scouting trip to Richmond.[10][11][12] 
Conducted by pitching coach Clyde Sukeforth, the mission's focus quickly 
shifted when he witnessed Clemente's throwing and batting prowess in pre-game 
drills.[11] Nonetheless, Clemente barely played during Sukeforth's three-day 
visit. With his suspicions further aroused by manager Max Macon's dismissive 
remarks ("You mean you want him?!")[13] and the fact that Clemente took 
batting practice with the pitchers rather than his fellow position players, 
Sukeforth made inquiries and soon ascertained Clemente's status as an unprotected 
bonus baby.[14] Before leaving Richmond, he informed Macon that such subterfuge 
was pointless since the Pirates, well on their way to a fourth consecutive 
last-place finish, would thereby secure first pick in the winter draft.[15] 
Evidently, Macon took Sukeforth at his word; scarcely had the Pirate scout 
departed when, on June 4,[10] Clemente started his first game in over a 
month. In the course of two days and three games (two of which he started), 
Clemente amassed ten at-bats, two more than in the previous thirty games 
combined. Yet just as abruptly, the moment was over and he was back to 
riding the bench, this time for almost two months.[12] Clemente's extra 
inning, walk-off home run of July 25, 1954, the first home run of his North 
American baseball career,[16][e] was hit in his first at-bat after entering 
the game as a defensive replacement, ending a nearly two-month-long drought 
starting on June 6 (17 appearances, 6 starts, and 24 at-bats in 60 games).[12] 
From this point forward, Clemente's playing time increased significantly; 
he started every subsequent game against a left-handed starting pitcher, 
finishing the season with a batting average of .257 in 87 games.[17] Clemente 
would complement his July 25 walk-off homer with another on September 5,[16] 
as well as a walk-off outfield assist (cutting down the potential tying 
run at the plate) on August 18, his 20th birthday.[18] As promised, the 
Pirates made Clemente the first selection of the rookie draft that took 
place on November 22, 1954. During much of his MLB career, Clemente was 
commonly referred to as "Bob Clemente" by sportswriters and announcers,[19] 
and on baseball merchandise such as his annual Topps baseball trading cards 
(except the early 1950s and 1970s cards);[20] this despite the fact he 
clearly preferred being called by his given first name.[21] Also, most 
of his English-speaking teammates, uncomfortable with the foreign-sounding 
"Roberto", likewise resorted to Bob or Bobby.[22] By the late 1960s, this 
practice had become the exception, not the rule; still, it was never entirely 
eradicated, as evidenced on September 30, 1972, the occasion of Clemente's 
3,000th and final regular season hit, when Pirates announcer Bob Prince 
referred to him as "Bobby" while calling the game for KDKA.[23][24] Clemente 
wore number 21, later retired by the Pirates,[25] representing the number 
of letters in his full name, Roberto Clemente Walker.[26] During the off-seasons 
(except the 1958-59, 1962–63, 1965–66, 1968–69, 1971–72, and 1972-73 seasons), 
Clemente played professionally (and sometimes managed the San Juan team) 
for the Santurce Crabbers, Criollos de Caguas, and San Juan Senadores in 
the Puerto Rican baseball winter league, where he was considered a star.[27] 
In September 1958, Clemente joined the United States Marine Corps Reserve. 
He went on to serve his six-month active duty commitment at Parris Island, 
South Carolina, Camp LeJeune in North Carolina, and Washington, D.C. At 
Parris Island, Clemente received his recruit training with Platoon 346 
of the 3rd Recruit Battalion.[28] The rigorous Marine Corps training programs 
helped Clemente physically; he added strength by gaining ten pounds and 
said his back troubles (caused by being in a 1954 auto accident, see below) 
had disappeared. He was a private first class in the Marine Corps Reserve 
until September 1964.[29][30][31] The Pirates experienced several difficult 
seasons through the 1950s, although they did manage a winning season in 
1958, their first since 1948. Clemente debuted with the Pirates on April 
17, 1955 wearing uniform number 13, in the first game of a doubleheader 
against the Brooklyn Dodgers.[32] At the beginning of his time with the 
Pirates, he experienced frustration because of racial tension with the 
local media and some teammates.[33][34] Clemente responded to this by stating, 
"I don't believe in color."[35] He noted that, during his upbringing, he 
was taught to never discriminate against someone based on ethnicity.[35] 
Clemente was at a double disadvantage, as he was a Latin American and Caribbean 
player who knew very little English, and was Black, being of African descent. 
The year before, the Pirates had become the fifth team in the NL and ninth 
in the major leagues to break the baseball color line when they hired Curt 
Roberts who debuted with the team. This was seven years after Jackie Robinson 
broke baseball's color line with the Dodgers.[36] Upon arriving in Pittsburgh, 
Roberts befriended Clemente and helped him adjust to life in the major 
league, as well as to get used to life in the Pittsburgh area.[37] Clemente 
had to sit out several games during his rookie season, due to a back injury 
suffered the previous winter in Puerto Rico, when a drunk driver rammed 
into his car at an intersection.[38] He finished his rookie season with 
a .255 batting average, despite confronting trouble hitting certain types 
of pitches.[39] His defensive skills were highlighted during this season.[40] 
Early in the 1960 season, Clemente led the league with a .353 batting average, 
and he registered runs batted in (RBIs) in 25 out of 27 games.[41] Clemente's 
batting average stayed above the .300 mark throughout the course of the 
campaign. In August, he missed five games as a result of an injury to his 
chin that he suffered when he crashed into the outfield wall.[42] The Pirates 
compiled a 95–59 record during the regular season, winning the NL pennant, 
and defeated the New York Yankees in a seven-game World Series. Clemente 
batted .310 in the series, hitting safely at least once in every game.[43] 
His .314 batting average, 16 home runs, and defensive playing during the 
course of the season had earned him his first spot on the NL All-Star roster 
as a reserve player, and he replaced Hank Aaron in right field during the 
7th and 8th innings in the second All-Star game held that season (two All-Star 
games were held each season from 1959 through 1962). During spring training 
in 1961, following advice from Pirates' batting coach George Sisler, Clemente 
tried to modify his batting technique by using a heavier bat to slow the 
speed of his swing.[44] During the 1961 season, Clemente was named the 
starting NL right fielder for the first of two All-Star games and went 
2 for 4; he hit a triple on his first at-bat and scored the team's first 
run, then drove in the second with a sacrifice fly. With the AL ahead 4–3 
in the 10th inning, he teamed with fellow future HOFers Hank Aaron, Willie 
Mays, and Frank Robinson to engineer a come-from-behind 5-4 NL victory, 
culminating in Clemente's walk-off single off knuckleballer Hoyt Wilhelm.[45] 
Clemente started again in right field for the second All-Star game held 
that season and was 0 for 2, flying and grounding out in the 2nd and 4th 
innings. That season he received his first Gold Glove Award. Following 
the 1961 season, he traveled to Puerto Rico along with Orlando Cepeda, 
who was a native of Ponce. When both players arrived, they were received 
by 18,000 people.[46] During this time, he was also involved in managing 
the Senadores de San Juan of the Puerto Rican League, as well as playing 
with the team during the major league off-season. During the course of 
the winter league, Clemente injured his thigh while doing some work at 
home but wanted to participate in the league's all-star game. He pinch-hit 
in the game and got a single, but experienced a complication of his injury 
as a result, and had to undergo surgery shortly after being carried off 
the playing field;[47] This condition limited his role with the Pirates 
in the first half of the 1965 season, during which he batted .257. Although 
he was inactive for many games, when he returned to the regular starting 
lineup, he got hits in thirty-three out of thirty-four games and his batting 
average climbed up to .340.[48] He participated as a pinch hitter and replaced 
Willie Stargell playing left field during the All-Star Game on July 15. 
In the 1960s, he batted over .300 every year except 1968, when he hit .291.[49] 
He was an All-Star every season he played in the 1960s except for the 1968 
season (it was the only year in his career after 1959 in which he failed 
to hit above .300), and he was a Gold Glove winner every season in the 
1960s beginning in 1961.[49] He won the NL batting title four times: 1961, 
1964, 1965, and 1967, and won the league's MVP Award in 1966, hitting .317 
with 29 home runs and 119 RBIs.[49] In 1967, he registered a career high 
.357 batting average, hit 23 home runs, and batted in 110 runs.[49] The 
1970 season was the last one that the Pirates played at Forbes Field before 
moving to Three Rivers Stadium; for Clemente, abandoning this stadium was 
an emotional situation. The Pirates' final game at Forbes Field occurred 
on June 28, 1970. That day, Clemente noted that it was hard to play in 
a different field, saying, "I spent half my life there."[50] The night 
of July 24, 1970, was declared "Roberto Clemente Night"; on this day, several 
Puerto Rican fans traveled to Three Rivers Stadium and cheered Clemente 
while wearing traditional Puerto Rican attire. A ceremony to honor Clemente 
took place, during which he received a scroll with 300,000 signatures compiled 
in Puerto Rico, and several thousands of dollars were donated to charity 
work following Clemente's request.[51][52] During the 1970 season, Clemente 
compiled a .352 batting average; the Pirates won the NL East pennant but 
were subsequently eliminated by the Cincinnati Reds. During the offseason, 
Roberto Clemente experienced some tense situations while he was working 
as manager of the Senadores and when his father, Melchor Clemente, experienced 
medical problems and underwent surgery.[53] In the 1971 season, the Pirates 
won the NL East, defeated the San Francisco Giants in four games to win 
the NL pennant, and faced the Baltimore Orioles in the World Series. Baltimore 
had won 100 games and swept the American League Championship Series, both 
for the third consecutive year, and were the defending World Series champions. 
The Orioles won the first two games in the series, but Pittsburgh won the 
championship in seven games. This marked the second occasion that Clemente 
helped win a World Series for the Pirates. Over the course of the series, 
Clemente had a .414 batting average (12 hits in 29 at-bats), performed 
well defensively, and hit a solo home run in the deciding 2–1 seventh game 
victory.[54] Following the conclusion of the season, he received the World 
Series Most Valuable Player Award. Though he was frustrated and struggling 
with injuries, Clemente played in 102 games and hit .312 during his final 
season in 1972.[54] He also made the annual NL All-Star roster for the 
12th time (he played in 14/15 All-Star games)[55][f] and won his 12th consecutive 
Gold Glove. On September 30, he hit a double in the 4th inning off Jon 
Matlack of the New York Mets at Three Rivers Stadium for his 3,000th hit.[56] 
It was his last regular season at-bat of his career; he played in right 
field in one more regular season game on October 3 and in the 1972 NLCS 
against the Cincinnati Reds.[54] In the NL playoffs that season, he batted 
.235 as he went 4 for 17. His last game was October 11, 1972 at Cincinnati's 
Riverfront Stadium in the fifth and final game of the series. He and Bill 
Mazeroski were the last Pirate players remaining from the 1960 World Series 
championship team. Clemente was married on November 14, 1964 to Vera Zabala 
at San Fernando Church in Carolina. The couple had three children: Roberto, 
Jr., born in 1965, Luis Roberto, born in 1966,[57] and Roberto Enrique, 
born in 1969.[58][59] Clemente spent much of his time during the off-season 
involved in charity work. When Managua, the capital city of Nicaragua, 
was affected by a massive earthquake on December 23, 1972, Clemente (who 
had been visiting Managua three weeks before the quake) immediately set 
to work arranging emergency relief flights.[60] He soon learned, however, 
that the aid packages on the first three flights had been diverted by corrupt 
officials of the Somoza government, never reaching victims of the quake.[61] 
He decided to accompany the fourth relief flight, hoping that his presence 
would ensure that the aid would be delivered to the survivors.[62] The 
airplane he chartered for a New Year's Eve flight, a Douglas DC-7 cargo 
plane, had a history of mechanical problems and subpar flight personnel, 
and was overloaded by 4,200 pounds.[63] It crashed into the Atlantic Ocean 
off the coast of Isla Verde, Puerto Rico immediately after takeoff on December 
31, 1972.[64] A few days after the crash, the body of the pilot and part 
of the fuselage of the plane were found. An empty flight case apparently 
belonging to Clemente was the only personal item recovered from the plane. 
Clemente's teammate and close friend Manny Sanguillén was the only member 
of the Pirates not to attend Roberto's memorial service. The Pirates catcher 
chose instead to dive into the waters where Clemente's plane had crashed 
in an effort to find his teammate. The bodies of Clemente and three others 
who were also on the four-engine plane, were never recovered.[64] Montreal 
Expos pitcher Tom Walker, then playing winter league ball in Puerto Rico 
(in a league later named after Clemente), helped Clemente load the plane, 
but either because of the plane's weight load or because he wanted Walker, 
who was single, to go enjoy New Year's,[65] Clemente told him not to join 
him on the flight. Walker's son is current Mets second baseman and former 
Pirate Neil Walker.[66] In an interview for the ESPN documentary series 
SportsCentury in 2002, Clemente's widow Vera mentioned that Clemente had 
told her several times that he thought he was going to die young.[36] Indeed, 
while being asked by broadcaster and future fellow Hall of Famer Richie 
Ashburn in July 1971 during the All-Star Game activities about when he 
would get his 3,000 career hit, Clemente's response was "Well, uh, you 
never know. I, I, uh, if I'm alive, like I said before, you never know 
because God tells you how long you're going to be here. So you never know 
what can happen tomorrow."[67] Clemente's older stepbrother, Luis, died 
on December 31, 1954 and his stepsister a few years later. At the time 
of his death, Clemente had established several records with the Pirates, 
including most triples in a game (three) and hits in two consecutive games 
(ten).[68] He won 12 Gold Glove Awards and shares the record of most won 
among outfielders with Willie Mays.[69][70] On July 25, 1956, in a 9–8 
Pittsburgh win against the Chicago Cubs, Clemente hit the only walk-off 
inside-the-park grand slam in professional baseball history.[71][72] On 
March 20, 1973,[73] the Baseball Writers' Association of America held a 
special election for the Baseball Hall of Fame. They voted to waive the 
waiting period for Clemente, due to the circumstances of his death, and 
posthumously elected him for induction into the Hall of Fame, giving him 
393 out of 420 available votes, for 92% of the vote. Clemente's Hall of 
Fame plaque originally had his name as "Roberto Walker Clemente" instead 
of the proper Spanish format "Roberto Clemente Walker"; the plaque was 
recast in 2000 to correct the error.[74] Since 1971, MLB has presented 
the Roberto Clemente Award (named the Commissioner's Award in 1971 and 
1972) every year to a player with outstanding baseball playing skills who 
is personally involved in community work. A trophy and a donation check 
for a charity of the player's choice is presented annually at the World 
Series. A panel of three makes the final determination of the award recipient 
from an annual list of selected players.[75][76] Clemente was posthumously 
presented three civilian awards of the United States government from the 
President of the United States including the first Presidential Citizens 
Medal: Citizens Medal Citation 1973: Clemente's uniform number 21 was retired 
by the Pittsburgh Pirates on April 6. 1984: The United States Postal Service 
issued a Roberto Clemente postal stamp on August 17, 1984.[89] The stamp 
was designed by Juan Lopez-Bonilla and shows Clemente wearing a Pittsburgh 
Pirates baseball cap with a Puerto Rican flag in the background. 2003: 
Clemente was inducted into the United States Marine Corps Sports Hall of 
Fame. A US Post Office in Clemente's hometown Carolina, Puerto Rico was 
named after him.[31] 2005: Clemente was named a member of MLB's Latino 
Legends Team.[90] 2007: Clemente was selected for the All Time Rawlings 
Gold Glove Team (50th anniversary of the Gold Glove award; 1957).[91] 2010: 
Clemente was inducted into the Hispanic Heritage Baseball Museum Hall of 
Fame. 2015: Clemente was enshrined in the Caribbean Baseball Hall of Fame. 
PNC Park, the home ballpark of the Pirates which opened in 2001, includes 
a right field wall 21 feet (6.4 m) high, in reference to Clemente's uniform 
number and his normal fielding position during his years with the Pirates.[92] 
The Pirates originally erected a statue in memory of Clemente at Three 
Rivers Stadium, an honor previously awarded to Honus Wagner. The statue 
was moved to PNC Park when it opened, and stands at the corner near the 
Roberto Clemente Bridge. An identical smaller statue was unveiled in Newark, 
New Jersey's Branch Brook Park in 2012.[93] The team considered naming 
PNC Park after Clemente, but despite popular sentiment the team chose instead 
to sell the naming rights to locally based PNC Financial Services, with 
the bridge being renamed after him considered a compromise.[94] The coliseum 
in San Juan, Puerto Rico was named the Roberto Clemente Coliseum in 1973; 
two baseball parks are in Carolina, the professional one, Roberto Clemente 
Stadium, and the Double-A. There is also the Escuela de los Deportes (School 
of Sports) that has the Double-A baseball park. Today, this sports complex 
is called Ciudad Deportiva Roberto Clemente.[95] The Pittsburgh Pirates 
is one of the most popular baseball teams in Puerto Rico due to Clemente.[96] 
In Pittsburgh, the 6th Street Bridge was renamed in his memory.[97] The 
City of Pittsburgh maintains Roberto Clemente Memorial Park along North 
Shore Drive in the city's North Side which includes a bronze relief by 
sculptor Eleanor Milleville. In 2007, the Roberto Clemente Museum opened 
in the Lawrenceville section of Pittsburgh.[98] Near the old Forbes Field 
where he began his pro career the city of Pittsburgh has renamed a street 
in his honor. Champion thoroughbred horse Roberto, bred in 1968 and owned 
by then-Pirates owner John W. Galbreath, was named for Clemente. The horse 
would go on to become a champion in Britain and Ireland, and in June 1973, 
following Clemente's passing, won the Group I Coronation Stakes at Epsom. 
The state of New York opened Roberto Clemente State Park in The Bronx in 
1973.[99] Some schools, such as Roberto Clemente High School in Chicago 
the Roberto Clemente Charter School in Allentown, Pennsylvania, Roberto 
Clemente Academy in Detroit, Roberto Clemente Elementary School and New 
Roberto Clemente Middle School in Paterson, New Jersey were named in his 
honor.[100] There is also a Roberto Clemente Stadium in Masaya, Nicaragua, 
as well as a middle school in Germantown, Maryland, called Roberto W. Clemente 
Middle School. In addition, he is the namesake for the Roberto Clemente 
Little League in Branch Brook Park in Newark, New Jersey, the Roberto Clemente 
Independent School of the Arts (IS 195) in New York City, and Clemente 
Leadership Academy in The Hill neighborhood of New Haven, Connecticut.[101] 
In 1999, Clemente ranked number 20 on The Sporting News' list of the 100 
Greatest Baseball Players, the highest-ranking Latin American and Caribbean 
player on the list.[102] Later that year, Clemente was nominated as a finalist 
for the Major League Baseball All-Century Team.[103] During the 2003 and 
2004 MLB seasons, the Montreal Expos (who at the time were owned by MLB 
due to an aborted contraction attempt)[104] played 22 home games each season 
at Hiram Bithorn Stadium in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Although the Pirates 
played their annual road series against the Expos in Montreal for 2003, 
the two teams did meet in San Juan for a four-game series in 2004, the 
last series the Expos hosted in San Juan before moving to Washington, D.C. 
and becoming the Washington Nationals the following season. During one 
of those games, in a tribute to Clemente, both teams wore throwback uniforms 
from the 1969 season, the Expos first season and, at the time, Clemente's 
15th with the Pirates. The Pirates throwbacks, replicas of what Clemente 
wore from 1957–early 1970, were similar to their then-current uniforms, 
except that the road jerseys they wore for the game read "Pirates" instead 
of "Pittsburgh", and last names were absent from the backs of the jerseys. 
The Expos won the four-game series three games to one.[96][105][106] Clemente's 
#21 remains active in MLB and is worn by multiple players. Sammy Sosa wore 
#21 throughout his career as a tribute to his childhood hero.[107] The 
number is unofficially retired in the Puerto Rico Baseball League. While 
the topic of retiring #21 throughout Major League Baseball like Jackie 
Robinson's #42 has been broached, and supported by groups such as Hispanics 
Across America, Jackie Robinson's daughter disagrees, believing that MLB 
should honor him another way.[108] In June 2013, at aforementioned Clemente 
Park in The Bronx, a statue of the Hall of Fame icon, sculpted by Cuban-American 
Maritza Hernandez, was installed. It depicts Clemente doffing his cap after 
notching his 3,000th hit on September 30, 1972.[109] Clemente's life has 
been the subject of numerous books, articles and documentaries: 1993: "Roberto 
Clemente: A Video Tribute to One of Baseball's Greatest Players and a True 
Humanitarian", documentary directed by Rich Domich and Michael Kostel, 
narrated by Raúl Juliá and Héctor Elizondo. 2006: Clemente: The Passion 
and grace of Baseball's Last Hero by David Maraniss. 2008: "Roberto Clemente": 
One-hour biography as part of the Public Broadcasting Service history series, 
American Experience which premiered on April 21, 2008.[110] The film is 
directed by Bernardo Ruiz, narrated by Jimmy Smits and features interviews 
with Vera Clemente, Orlando Cepeda and George F. Will.[110] The production 
received an ALMA Award. 2010: Chasing 3000 a movie based on a true story 
of two kids named Mickey (played by Ray Liotta, Trevor Morgan, and Blake 
Woodyard) and Roger (played by Jay Karnes, Rory Culkin, and Nicholas Brady) 
as they go on an adventure to travel across the United States to see Clemente's 
3,000th hit. 2011: 21: The Story of Roberto Clemente was released, a graphic 
novel by Wilfred Santiago (published by Fantagraphics) detailing Clemente's 
life in a comic-book format. In their USA Today Magazine article titled 
"Saluting Pittsburgh's Finest" Richard E. Vatz and Lee S. Weinberg said 
Clemente was "arguably the best in the history of the game" and stated 
that "understanding the magnitude of Roberto Clemente requires an appreciation 
of the gestalt of his presence, which was greater than the sum of his statistics".[111] 
2011: DC-7: The Roberto Clemente Story, a bilingual musical about Clemente's 
life, had its world premiere in November 2011 with a full house at the 
Teatro SEA in Manhattan[112] before moving to New York's Puerto Rican Traveling 
Theatre for a successful seven-week run.[113] The show ran from December 
6 through December 16, 2012 at Puerto Rico's Teatro Francisco Arrivi. 2013: 
"Baseball's Last Hero: 21 Clemente Stories", the first feature dramatic 
film on Clemente's life was finished by California filmmaker and Pittsburgh 
native Richard Rossi.[114] Rossi returned to Pittsburgh to premiere his 
film on Roberto Clemente's birthday, August 18, 2013 [115][116][117] before 
exhibiting the film in New York, other cities, and DVD.[118][119] The feature 
film Baseball's Last Hero: 21 Clemente Stories was filmed by Richard Rossi.[120] 
One of the scenes in the movie features a conversation Clemente has with 
a nun.[121] The scene spurred several people to pitch the Pope for Clemente's 
canonization as a saint. Rossi, a former evangelical minister, received 
several messages of support, including a letter showing papal support from 
Pope Francis in starting the process [122][123][124][125][126][127] from 
the Vatican through the Apostolic Nunciature in Washington, D.C. and from 
Archbishop Jose Horacio Gomez of the Archdiocese of Los Angeles.[128][129][130][131][132][133][134] 
"I've never thought of him in terms of being a saint", said former Pirates 
second baseman Neil Walker, a devout Roman Catholic whose father was a 
teammate of Clemente. "But he's somebody who lived his life serving others,
