Ronald Clarence "Ron" Kulpa (born October 5, 1968) is an umpire in Major 
League Baseball. He wears uniform number 46. Kulpa's professional umpiring 
career began in 1992 and he advanced to the Pacific Coast League in 1998. 
Kulpa was one of the 22 umpires promoted in the wake of the Major League 
Umpires Association's mass-resignation strategy in July 1999, and was named 
to the National League staff for the remainder of the 1999 season. When 
the umpiring staffs from the two leagues merged for the 2000 season, Kulpa 
began working in both leagues. He has worked several MLB Special Events, 
including the All-Star Game (2001, 2015), Division Series (2001, 2002, 
2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2011), League Championship Series (2005, 2013, 
2014), and World Series (2011). He also officiated in the 2009 World Baseball 
Classic. Kulpa was head-butted by Carl Everett of the Boston Red Sox in 
2000 during an argument about the location of the inner boundary of the 
batter's box. Working first base in Game 3 of the 2011 World Series (his 
first World Series as an umpire), Kulpa controversially called St. Louis 
Cardinals hitter Matt Holliday safe after Holliday grounded into what would 
have been the second out of a routine double play in the game's fourth 
inning. Kulpa claimed that Holliday had arrived at first base prior to 
the tag from Texas Rangers first baseman Mike Napoli, although replays 
subsequently proved that Napoli had indeed tagged him out by a full stride, 
prior to Holliday's stumbling across the base and falling.[1] Kulpa later 
told a pool reporter after the game that he was aware Napoli had tagged 
Holliday, but he thought Holliday's foot was already on the base. He did 
not ask for a second opinion.[1] When the game ended, Kulpa reviewed the 
play on tape and admitted he should have called Holliday out. The Cardinals 
went on to win the game 16-7, and eventually won the Series in seven games. 
On August 12, 2013, he ejected Rangers catcher A.J. Pierzynski for arguing 
a ball three call during pitcher Yu Darvish's bid for a perfect game against 
the Houston Astros. The perfect game was broken up moments later on an 
ensuing ball four pitch to Astros batter Jonathan Villar. [2] During the 
9th inning of a bases-loaded Red Sox-Yankees game on May 6, 2016, he ruled 
Andrew Miller's 3-2 breaking ball to David Ortiz, located low and outside 
of the strike zone by 5 ½ inches according to ESPN, a strike. Had the pitch 
been ruled a ball, Ortiz would have walked in the game-tying run.[3] On 
the immediately preceding pitch, Ortiz had expressed visual disproval of 
Kulpa's 3-1 strike call, a correct ruling on a pitch located within the 
strike zone, but caught oddly by catcher Brian McCann; Manager John Farrell 
was ejected in Ortiz's stead following the 3-1 pitch, while Ortiz was ejected 
following the 3-2 pitch.[4] Kulpa was the home plate umpire when Detroit 
Tigers pitcher Justin Verlander threw a no-hitter at Comerica Park vs. 
the Milwaukee Brewers on June 12, 2007.[5] Five days before Verlander's 
no-hitter, Kulpa called balls and strikes in a game between the Red Sox 
and the Oakland Athletics in which Boston pitcher Curt Schilling had a 
no-hitter until Shannon Stewart broke up the no-hitter with a single with 
two outs in the bottom of the ninth inning.[6] Kulpa was the plate umpire 
for Henderson Álvarez's no-hitter on September 29, 2013.[7] Prior to pursuing 
professional umpiring, Kulpa attended Florissant Valley Community College 
before transferring to Missouri Baptist College, where he played baseball.
