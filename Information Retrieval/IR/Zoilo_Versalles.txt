Zoilo Casanova Versalles Rodriguez (Spanish pronunciation: [ˈsoilo βerˈsaʝes];[1] 
December 18, 1939 – June 9, 1995), nicknamed "Zorro", was a Cuban professional 
baseball player. He played as a shortstop in Major League Baseball, most 
notably for the Minnesota Twins. He was the catalyst who led the 1965 Twins 
to their first World Series after moving from Washington to Minnesota. 
The same year he also won the American League Most Valuable Player award. 
Versalles was born in the Vedado neighborhood of Havana, Cuba and he had 
difficulty adjusting to life in the U.S., due largely to the language barrier 
and his fear of failure,[2] leaving him eternally homesick for his native 
Cuba. Versalles was signed as an amateur free agent by the Washington Senators 
prior to the 1958 season and was assigned to the Elmira Pioneers in the 
Class D New York–Penn League where he held his own and hit .292 in 124 
games. The following spring, he went north with the Senators and made his 
major league debut on 1 August 1959. However, he was obviously overmatched 
and after hitting .153 with 15 strikeouts in 59 at-bats, Versalles was 
sent back down and spent the rest of the season with the Fox Cities Foxes 
in the Class B Illinois–Indiana–Iowa League, hitting .278 with 9 home runs. 
In 1960 Versalles split time between Washington and AAA Charleston trying 
to grow as a player and work through a stereotype that he was too sure 
of himself and was thus incapable of taking instruction.[3] Although he 
hit .278 at Charleston with 8 home runs, 50 RBI and 24 stolen bases, he 
committed 42 errors and had only a .940 fielding percentage. In 1961, the 
year the Senators moved to Minneapolis/St. Paul, Minnesota to become the 
Minnesota Twins, Versalles came to the majors to stay. Although his glove 
continued to be average at best, Versalles hit well enough to stay in the 
lineup, finishing the season with a .280 average, 7 home runs, 53 RBI and 
16 stolen bases.[4] Versalles' 1961 Topps card (#21) actually listed his 
first name as ″Zorro″, a nickname frequently used early in his career by 
media, fans and even club officials. The following season, Versalles played 
in 160 games and despite his batting average dropping to .240, he hit 17 
home runs (third most for American League shortstops behind Detroit Tiger 
Chico Fernandez and New York Yankee Tom Tresh who both hit 20) and 67 RBI. 
Versalles led the league in assists with 501 and lowered his errors from 
30 to 26, and got a smattering of MVP votes (finishing 21st). In 1963, 
Versalles raised his batting average to .261 and led the league in triples 
(13) and was voted to his first All-Star team. Starting in the July 9 game, 
Versalles singled and was hit by a pitch in two plate appearances before 
being lifted for Chicago White Sox shortstop Luis Aparicio.[5] Although 
Versalles received his first Gold Glove award in 1963, he was still erratic 
in the field as his five errors in a July 5 double header against the Baltimore 
Orioles[6][7] and season total of 30 errors attests. In 1964, Versalles 
had another solid season, hitting .259 with 20 home runs (second for AL 
shortstops behind Detroit's Dick McAuliffe), 64 RBI, and 14 stolen bases 
and again led the league in triples with 10. Under the tutelage of Twins' 
third base coach Billy Martin,[2] Versalles put it all together during 
his 1965 MVP season and led the American League in plate appearances (728), 
at-bats (666), runs scored (126), doubles (45), triples (12), extra-base 
hits (76) and total bases (308), and was second in assists (487) and third 
in stolen bases (27). He was a near-unanimous winner of the MVP award, 
receiving 19 of 20 first-place votes. The remaining first-place vote went 
to teammate and fellow Cuban Tony Oliva. He also led the league and set 
career highs in both strikeouts (122) and errors (39), which underlined 
his career-long struggles both at the plate and in the field in these areas. 
Versalles was named to his second All-Star team for the July 13 game (played 
in his home park, Bloomington, Minnesota's Metropolitan Stadium) along 
with five fellow Twins (first baseman Harmon Killebrew, catcher Earl Battey, 
pitcher Mudcat Grant and outfielders Jimmie Hall and Tony Oliva), but went 
hitless with a walk in two plate appearances after subbing for starter 
Dick McAuliffe in the sixth inning.[8] Before the World Series began, Versalles 
was pictured on the cover of the October 4 issue of Sports Illustrated 
and was featured in the article which discussed the Twins' chances against 
possible National League opponents.[2] In the Series against the NL champion 
Los Angeles Dodgers, Versalles started all seven games, hit .286 with his 
only home run and all four RBI coming in the lopsided Game 1 win,[9] but 
it was not enough as the Twins lost to the Dodgers four games to three.[10] 
Following his MVP and World Series runner-up season, the team gave Versalles 
a raise to $40,000 annually.[11] His performance almost immediately declined, 
as he hit only .249 in 137 games with an across-the-board drop in his offensive 
production. Despite this, he continued to have memorable moments such as 
on June 9, in the seventh inning of a game against the Kansas City Athletics. 
Versalles was one of five Twins players to hit home runs (along with Killebrew, 
Don Mincher, Oliva and Rich Rollins). These five home runs still stand 
as a major league record for the most home runs in a single inning.[12] 
In July, he was treated for a hematoma in his back which put him on the 
disabled list for a short time, cost him playing time the following season, 
and led to a lifelong condition. Following his continuing struggles at 
the plate, which only accented his inconsistent glove (leading the American 
League in errors 1965–1967), the Twins finally parted ways on November 
27, 1967 when he was traded to the Dodgers along with starting pitcher 
Mudcat Grant for relievers Bob Miller and Ron Perranoski and veteran catcher 
Johnny Roseboro. After one season with the Dodgers, in which he finished 
fourth in league in errors and hit only .196, he was exposed to the 1968 
Major League Baseball expansion draft and was the 10th selection of the 
San Diego Padres. He never suited up for the expansion Padres as he was 
sent to the Cleveland Indians on December 2 to complete an October 29 trade 
that sent first baseman Bill Davis to San Diego. Improving slightly over 
his previous year at the plate, Versalles was hitting .226 in 72 games 
when on July 26, 1969, he was purchased by the new Washington Senators. 
With this trade, Versalles became one of only nine players to don the uniforms 
of both the original and expansion Senators teams, with the others being 
Don Mincher, Camilo Pascual, Pedro Ramos, Johnny Schaive, Roy Sievers, 
Hal Woodeshick, Rudy Hernández, and Héctor Maestri. Although he hit .267 
in limited action with the Senators and was invited back for spring training 
in 1970, he was released on April 6.[4] Following a year playing in the 
Mexican League for Gómez Palacio, he was purchased by the Atlanta Braves 
on May 31, 1972 and he finished his major league career hitting .191 in 
66 games. After being released by the Braves in December, he played in 
Japan in 1972 for the Hiroshima Toyo Carp. For his career, Versalles had 
a batting average of .242 (.252 during his six years with the Twins) with 
1,046 hits, 564 runs, 86 homers, 401 RBI, and 84 stolen bases in 1,065 
games. During his five-year peak (1961–1965), Versalles led all AL shortstops 
with 73 home runs. Baseball statistician/historian Bill James points out 
that Versalles' MVP season makes him the player with the fewest career 
win shares (134) to win an MVP award.[13] While it may be true that Versalles 
could be considered a one-year MVP flash in the pan, he led the league 
in multiple offensive categories and was a near-unanimous selection. He 
also led the league in VORP (52.4), a stat that more accurately measures 
a player's overall production, and WAR (7.6), which includes a player's 
defensive value with his offensive production. At the time, most of the 
talk was not about whether or not he was deserving of the MVP,[2] but whether 
teammate Tony Oliva should actually have been the winner. Oliva's .321 
batting average and 98 RBI were much higher, his strikeouts were less than 
half, and his home run and stolen base totals nearly equaled Versalles. 
Versalles went down in history as the first Latin American player to be 
named most valuable player[14] and he is one of only five Twins to win 
the MVP (along with teammate Killebrew, Rod Carew, and more recent Twins 
Joe Mauer and Justin Morneau) and one of only three Twins to top the league 
in WAR (along with Carew and Mauer). Versalles returned to the Minneapolis 
area following his year in Japan, but found it virtually impossible to 
make a living, partly because he had never learned English and partly because 
of the lingering effects of a back injury he had suffered while running 
out a ground ball with the Dodgers in 1968. Holding a series of menial 
jobs, he lost his house to foreclosure and was eventually forced to sell 
his MVP trophy, his All-Star rings and his Gold Gloves. In addition to 
his back problems he suffered two heart attacks, underwent stomach surgery 
and was sustained solely by disability and Social Security payments. He 
was found dead in his home in Bloomington, Minnesota on June 11, 1995. 
Versalles was survived by his wife Maria, six daughters and several grandchildren.[14]
