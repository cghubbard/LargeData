José Bernabé Reyes (born June 11, 1983) is a Dominican professional baseball 
infielder for the New York Mets of Major League Baseball (MLB). He previously 
played, most notably at shortstop, for the Miami Marlins, Toronto Blue 
Jays and Colorado Rockies. Reyes is a four-time MLB All-Star. He led MLB 
in triples in 2005, 2006, 2008, and 2011. Reyes also led the National League 
(NL) in stolen bases in 2005, 2006, and 2007. He was the NL batting champion 
in 2011. He is also the New York Mets' all-time leader in triples and stolen 
bases. Reyes was spotted by New York Mets scouts during a tryout camp in 
Santiago in the summer of 1999. After initial concerns over Reyes' slight 
frame, the Mets offered him a contract, which he signed on August 16, 1999. 
Despite traditionally sending youngsters to play in their Dominican academy, 
the Mets made an exception with Reyes and sent him to the Kingsport Mets 
of the Rookie-level Appalachian League for the 2000 season.[1] He finished 
the season with a .250 batting average through 49 games. For the 2001 season, 
Reyes was assigned to the Capital City Bombers of the Class A South Atlantic 
League. He excelled both in the field and at the plate, hitting .307 with 
42 extra-base hits and winning the Player of the Year award.[2] After being 
invited to spring training with the major league Mets, Reyes began the 
2002 season with the St. Lucie Mets in the Class A-Advanced Florida State 
League. In the first three months of the season, he demonstrated that he 
could handle the step up, and was promoted to the Binghamton Mets of the 
Double-A Eastern League. In his first game, Reyes had 5 hits and 4 RBIs, 
and completed the season with a .287 average, 27 steals and 26 extra-base 
hits through 65 games.[2] On December 15, 2002, the Mets traded starting 
shortstop Rey Ordóñez to the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. Two weeks later the 
Mets signed veteran Rey Sánchez to a one-year deal, with the plan being 
to allow Reyes to mature in the minors while Sanchez kept the big-league 
spot warm for him.[citation needed] Reyes spent the first two months of 
the 2003 season with the Norfolk Tides of the Triple-A International League, 
where he batted .269 and stole 26 bases in just 42 games.[2] Injuries to 
Mike Piazza and Mo Vaughn had contributed to the Mets' poor performance 
in the National League East, and eventually convinced manager Art Howe 
to begin playing some of the team's younger talent.[1] When Rey Sánchez 
strained his thumb on June 5, 2003, Reyes received his call-up to the majors, 
just a day before his 20th birthday. Reyes made his major league debut 
on June 10, 2003 against the Texas Rangers, the day before his 20th birthday, 
going 2-for-4 with a pair of runs in a 9–7 loss. After the game, Reyes 
collected the ball from his first career hit and sent it to his parents. 
Over the following weeks Reyes' impressive form continued, including a 
grand slam off Jarrod Washburn in an 8–0 victory over the Angels. When 
Rey Sánchez completed his month-long spell on the DL, Reyes' strong play 
moved Sánchez to the bench. Reyes' season was cut short a month early by 
a sprained ankle, but he still managed to compile impressive rookie numbers. 
In 69 games, he batted .307 with 32 RBIs and 13 stolen bases. Reyes finished 
8th in voting for the 2003 NL Rookie of the Year. Prior to the 2004 season, 
the Mets signed Japanese star Kazuo Matsui, whose only condition upon signing 
was that he got a chance to play his regular position, shortstop. As a 
result, Reyes was asked to learn second base duties. Early on in the season, 
Reyes suffered a strained hamstring and remained on the DL until June 19. 
When he returned, the Mets were involved in a close race in the National 
League East with the Marlins, Phillies, and Braves. However, a back problem 
for Reyes and injuries to other key Mets led to a collapse and instead 
of being involved in a pennant race, the team found themselves fighting 
to stay out of last place in the division. By the end of the season Reyes 
had returned to his preferred position at shortstop, with Matsui moving 
to second base. Reyes ended a disappointing season with a batting average 
of .255, 14 RBIs, and 19 stolen bases in 53 games. At the age of 21, Reyes 
was handed the leadoff spot in the Mets' line-up in his first full season 
in the major leagues. Despite struggling slightly with his plate discipline 
— he had only 27 walks in a league-high 733 plate appearances – he finished 
the season with solid numbers. In 161 games he had 48 extra-base hits, 
58 RBIs and 60 stolen bases. Reyes led the National League in stolen bases 
and led the majors in triples. However, he also led all National League 
shortstops in errors with 18. During spring training in 2006, the Mets 
brought in former player Rickey Henderson as a specialist instructor. One 
of the reasons Henderson was hired was to help tutor Reyes in the arts 
of getting on base and stealing bases – skills at which Henderson excelled 
throughout his own career. Reyes won Player of the Week honors in the National 
League for the weeks beginning June 12 and 19, becoming the first Mets 
player to be named the NL Player of the Week for two consecutive weeks 
since Jesse Orosco in 1983.[3] During this two-week period Reyes had 30 
hits in 57 at-bats (a .526 batting average) and raised his season batting 
average from .246 to .302. On June 21, 2006 in a 6–5 loss against the Cincinnati 
Reds Reyes hit for the cycle, becoming the ninth Met in team history to 
do so.[4] Reyes' outgoing personality began to make him a fan favorite 
in New York. He became well known for the elaborate handshakes he creates 
with his teammates to celebrate runs scored.[5] In his spots as 'Professor 
Reyes', Reyes taught the Shea faithful the Spanish language between innings 
on the stadium's Diamond Vision screen, helping to make him one of the 
Mets' most popular players. On August 3, 2006, Reyes signed a four-year, 
$23.25 million contract extension with the Mets, thereby avoiding salary 
arbitration. The contract includes an $11 million option for 2011 with 
a buy-out of $500,000 if the Mets do not pick up the option. Reyes also 
received a $1.5 million signing bonus. On August 15, 2006, Reyes hit three 
home runs in an 11–4 loss against the Philadelphia Phillies at Citizens 
Bank Park in Philadelphia. Two days later, he became the second player 
in Mets history to record at least 50 stolen bases in consecutive seasons. 
On September 7, 2006, Reyes hit the first inside-the-park home run of his 
career, against the Los Angeles Dodgers at Shea Stadium. Reyes was timed 
at 14.81 seconds for his dash around the bases — the equivalent of running 
a circular 100-meter dash in about 13.5 seconds.[6] As the 2006 season 
wound down, Reyes was in pursuit of an unusual feat — reaching 20 home 
runs, 20 triples, 20 doubles, and 20 stolen bases. Reyes finished the 2006 
regular season with an average of .300, 19 home runs, 81 RBIs, 122 runs, 
and 64 stolen bases in 153 games. He increased his on-base percentage by 
54 points, and his slugging percentage was almost 100 points higher than 
in 2005. Reyes' walk rate nearly doubled — in 30 fewer plate appearances, 
he went from 27 walks to 53. He also showed similar improvement in the 
field — in 2006 he had a range factor of 3.86, the lowest of all major 
league shortstops. Reyes picked up a Silver Slugger Award, was called up 
to his first All-Star Game, and finished 7th in NL MVP voting. The Mets 
clinched their spot in the playoffs, and Reyes experienced the postseason 
for the first time in his career. He made his playoff debut on October 
4, 2006 against the Los Angeles Dodgers in the 2006 National League Division 
Series. Though he hit just .167 for the series, he came up big in key situations, 
scoring the winning run in Game 1, driving in the go-ahead run in Game 
2, and knocking in the game-tying run in the 6th inning of Game 3. In Game 
6 of the 2006 National League Championship Series against the St. Louis 
Cardinals and facing elimination, Reyes hit a leadoff home run in the first 
inning to jump start his team and help force a deciding Game 7, which the 
Mets went on to lose, 3–1. In November 2006 Reyes participated in the Major 
League Baseball Japan All-Star Series along with teammates John Maine and 
David Wright. He hit a 2-run walk-off home run in the 10th inning of Game 
5, giving the MLB team their first sweep of their NPB rivals. On July 12, 
2007, Reyes hit the ninth leadoff home run of his career against Cincinnati 
Reds pitcher Bronson Arroyo, setting a new record for the franchise.[7] 
In August Reyes stole his 50th base of the year, becoming the first New 
York baseball player to steal 50 or more bases in three consecutive seasons. 
On August 22, 2007, Reyes stole his 65th, 66th, and 67th bases and broke 
Roger Cedeño's Mets record for the most stolen bases in a single season. 
August also saw Reyes tie the Mets record for stealing at least one base 
in four straight games. In the last month of the season, Reyes' struggles 
were seen to be a key component of the Mets historic late-season collapse. 
He batted .205 and had an on-base percentage of only .279. His struggles 
brought much criticism from Mets fans. On the second to last day of the 
regular season he was involved in a benches-clearing brawl against the 
Florida Marlins, which started when Miguel Olivo charged across the diamond 
and threw a punch at Reyes. Olivo would be ejected from the game and Reyes 
was allowed to stay in. The Mets would win the game 13–0. Reyes finished 
the season with a .280 batting average, 60 extra-base hits, 12 home runs, 
57 RBIs, and 78 stolen bases in 160 games. In spring training and the early 
part of the 2008 season, Reyes vocalized a plan to focus a little more 
on baseball, and a little less on the theatrics — such as his dugout dances 
after home runs — that drew criticism during the late part of 2007 when 
the Mets were struggling. One of the casualties of this change of focus 
was the Professor Reyes segment played between innings at Shea where he 
taught the fans Spanish words and phrases. This was replaced by 'Maine 
Street USA' with John Maine, and 'Do The Wright Thing' with David Wright, 
which failed to match the popularity of Reyes' spots. However, with some 
prodding by his teammates, Reyes was encouraged to continue playing with 
the same energy as he had previously.[8] On July 3, Reyes' childhood friend 
Argenis Reyes was called up from the Triple-A New Orleans Zephyrs. When 
Argenis played, he and José made up the middle infield for the Mets, with 
Argenis Reyes at second base. On July 20, Reyes overtook Mookie Wilson 
as the Mets all-time triples leader after legging out his 63rd career triple 
in the fourth inning of a game against the Cincinnati Reds. On September 
10, Reyes broke the Mets all-time record for stolen bases, previously held 
by Mookie Wilson, with his 282nd career stolen base coming in the third 
inning of a game against the Washington Nationals. After stealing second 
to break the record, he then stole third and scored the go-ahead run on 
a single by David Wright. On September 23, 2008, Reyes achieved his first 
200-hit season with a bases-clearing triple. He is the second Met to reach 
this landmark, after Lance Johnson in 1996. Reyes finished the season with 
a batting average of .297, with 72 extra-base hits (including a majors-leading 
19 triples), 68 RBIs and 56 stolen bases. A few days before spring training, 
Mets manager Jerry Manuel announced that he was considering moving Reyes 
from the leadoff spot to 2nd or 3rd in the line-up. However, Reyes playing 
in the World Baseball Classic meant his playing time in the Mets training 
camp was limited, and led to Manuel deciding to move Reyes back to the 
leadoff spot. Speaking of the decision, Reyes said "That's where I've hit 
all my life... I'd like to be a leadoff hitter."[9] On May 3, 2009, Reyes 
was placed on the DL due to a calf injury. Reyes was expected to be back 
in early June but when rehabbing the injury he pulled himself from an extended 
spring training game; an MRI the following day revealed the tear, which 
Reyes confirmed was different than the initial injury. A September return 
was considered possible but he suffered yet another injury, a torn right 
hamstring while doing rehab work in August.[10] On March 11, 2010, Reyes 
was diagnosed with a hyperactive thyroid gland, and was ordered by doctors 
to cease spring training activity.[11] On March 23, his thyroid levels 
returned to normal and he was cleared to play. He was placed on the 15-day 
disabled list and missed the start of the regular season.[12] On May 25, 
he hit his 1000th career hit off of the Phillies' Jamie Moyer. On June 
8, Reyes hit a game tying home run in the 7th with 2 outs that had to be 
reviewed. The shot was originally called a double because it bounced back 
into play. The Mets went on to win the game in the 11th on a walk off shot 
by Ike Davis. On July 4, Reyes was selected to his third All-Star Game, 
but he was unable to play due to an injury; Dodgers shortstop Rafael Furcal 
replaced Reyes. However, Reyes still attended the All-Star game with his 
family. On June 28, in his 1,000th career game, Reyes stole his 360th base. 
This put him in the top 100 all-time in MLB stolen bases. Reyes was voted 
in as the starting shortstop for the National League in the 2011 Major 
League Baseball All-Star Game. However, he did not participate due to a 
strained left hamstring.[13] Throughout the 2011 season, there were talks 
about Reyes' future and if it would be with the Mets. He decided he did 
not want to talk about it until the end of the season. As well as being 
a possible top target for teams in free agency, he was reportedly involved 
in trade talks with multiple teams, but the Mets decided they would hold 
onto him for the rest of the season and make an effort to re-sign him. 
Reyes was once again placed on the disabled list due to a strained left 
hamstring.[14] On the final day of the season, after bunting for a single 
in his first at bat in the first inning, Reyes asked his manager to remove 
him from the game, ending his season with a .337 batting average, two points 
ahead of Ryan Braun of the Milwaukee Brewers in the race for the NL batting 
title.[15] Braun went 0–4 later in the day to finish at .332.[15][16] Reyes 
became the first Met in franchise history to win an NL batting title.[17] 
Reyes's decision came on the 70th anniversary of Ted Williams' refusal 
sit out a doubleheader on the last day of the 1941 season, putting his 
.400 batting average at risk but ultimately hitting 6-for-8 and raising 
his average from .39955 to .406.[18][19][20][21] Reyes played in 126 games 
in 2011, the fewest games played by a batting champion since Manny Ramirez's 
120 games played in 2002.[22] He became a free agent at the end of the 
season. On December 7, 2011, Reyes agreed to a six-year, $106 million contract 
with the Miami Marlins.[23] Reyes had the first Marlins hit at Marlins 
Park, against Kyle Lohse of the St. Louis Cardinals, breaking up a no-hitter 
in the 7th inning. On June 7, 2012, Reyes hit his first home run as a Marlin 
against the Atlanta Braves. Reyes finished the year 2nd in the NL in triples 
(12), 2nd in at-bats per strikeout (11.5), and 3rd in steals (40). He hit 
.287.[24] He split time between the leadoff role and the #3 spot.[25] On 
November 19, 2012, Reyes was traded to the Toronto Blue Jays along with 
Josh Johnson, Mark Buehrle, John Buck, and Emilio Bonifacio, in exchange 
for Jeff Mathis, Adeiny Hechavarria, Henderson Álvarez, Yunel Escobar, 
Jake Marisnick, Anthony DeSclafani, and Justin Nicolino.[26] Reyes needed 
to be carted off the field during a game against the Kansas City Royals 
on April 12, 2013, after hearing a pop in his left ankle while sliding 
into second. General manager Alex Anthopoulos stated that Reyes would be 
placed on the disabled list and was then expected to miss between 4 weeks 
and 3 months of action.[27] Reyes was placed on the 15-day disabled list 
on April 13. On April 15, Anthopoulos reported that an MRI revealed no 
fracture and that no surgery would be required, but that Reyes was expected 
to miss three months.[28] On April 15, CBS Sports writer Danny Knobler 
reported that Reyes's ankle injury was less severe than originally thought, 
reducing his time on the DL to 8 weeks,[29] however that was later refuted 
by Blue Jays management.[30] He was placed on the 60-day disabled list 
on April 23 to make room for Aaron Laffey.[31] Reyes was held out of baseball 
activities for several weeks before playing two innings in a simulated 
game on June 14.[32] He then began a rehab assignment in High-A Dunedin. 
Reyes played in 3 games and recorded a .417 average with 3 runs scored, 
1 RBI and 1 stolen base.[33] Reyes was promoted to Triple-A Buffalo on 
June 21, and scored the winning run against the Durham Bulls.[34] After 
playing three games in Buffalo, Alex Anthopolous said Reyes would play 
another game in Buffalo, followed by a game in Double-A New Hampshire. 
The plan was for Reyes to then be called up on June 27 when the Blue Jays 
begin a 4-game series against the Boston Red Sox,[35] however it was later 
reported that Reyes would be called up one day earlier.[36] Reyes went 
to Tampa Bay on June 25, rather than going to New Hampshire and was present 
in the dugout, despite not being able to play. He went 0–4 in his return 
to the lineup on June 26, but the Blue Jays won on R.A. Dickey's complete 
game shutout 3–0.[37] Reyes recorded his first hit since coming off the 
disabled list on June 28 against the Boston Red Sox. The hit was also his 
1,500th career hit. Reyes played his first game at home since coming off 
the disabled list on Canada Day and went 3–5 with a solo home run.[38] 
On August 2, in a 7–5 loss to the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, Reyes 
recorded his 500th career RBI on a two-run home run. In a game against 
the Seattle Mariners on August 6, Reyes hit his 100th career home run, 
a solo shot to lead off the game off of Félix Hernández. After experiencing 
a minor hamstring strain during spring training, Reyes began the 2014 season 
batting leadoff for the Blue Jays. In his first at bat on Opening Day he 
aggravated his hamstring injury while running to first base, and was placed 
on the 15-day disabled list at the end of the game. Reyes was activated 
on April 19, after playing in two rehab games with the High-A Dunedin Blue 
Jays.[39] He avoided the disabled list for the rest of the season, playing 
in 143 games and batting .287 with 9 home runs, 51 RBI, and 30 stolen bases.[40] 
On April 28, 2015, Reyes was placed on the 15-day disabled list due to 
a rib strain.[41] He was activated on May 25.[42] Before being traded to 
Colorado, Reyes had batted .285 with 4 home runs and 34 RBI in 69 games 
with the Blue Jays.[43] On July 27, 2015, Reyes was traded to the Colorado 
Rockies, along with Jeff Hoffman, Miguel Castro, and Jesus Tinoco, in exchange 
for Troy Tulowitzki and LaTroy Hawkins.[44] In 47 more games with the Rockies, 
Reyes batted .259 with 3 home runs, 19 RBI, and 8 stolen bases. Overall 
in 2015, combined with both teams, Reyes played 132 totals games with a 
.274 batting average, 24 stolen bases, 9 home runs, and 53 RBI. During 
the 2015-16 offseason, Reyes was charged with domestic violence, stemming 
from an incident with his wife while on vacation in Hawaii. On February 
23, 2016, MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred announced that Reyes would be placed 
on paid administrative leave until at least April, when his trial began.[45] 
On May 13, 2016, Manfred announced that Reyes was suspended without pay 
until May 31, spanning the Rockies' first 51 games of the season.[46] On 
May 31, he was optioned to Triple-A Albuquerque for a rehab assignment.[47] 
Reyes was reinstated from the restricted list and designated for assignment 
by the Rockies on June 15.[48][49] On June 25, 2016, Reyes became a free 
agent and signed a minor league contract with the New York Mets.[50] Reyes 
began his second stint in the New York Mets organization by being assigned 
to the Brooklyn Cyclones.[51] In his stints with the Cylones and the Binghamton 
Mets, Reyes batted .176, and made an error at third base. On July 4, 2016, 
the Mets announced that they would be activating Reyes on July 5.[52] In 
his first MLB game with the Mets since 2011, Reyes went 0-for-4. He received 
no fielding chances but cleanly fielded an attempt at catching a base-stealer 
from Travis d'Arnaud; the throw was late. On July 30, José Reyes was placed 
on the 15-day disabled list with a Grade 1 intercostal muscle strain.[53] 
Reyes represented the Dominican Republic in the 2006 World Baseball Classic. 
The team finished top of their group in both the first and second rounds, 
but fell to Cuba in the semi-finals. Reyes' playing time was limited due 
to the presence of Miguel Tejada in the shortstop spot. In 6 at-bats, Reyes 
collected 1 hit and 1 run, as well as 2 stolen bases. Reyes was again called 
up to the Dominican Republic team for the 2009 competition. He had a disappointing 
tournament as the Dominican Republic were eliminated after only three games, 
suffering two defeats against the underdog Netherlands team. Reyes finished 
the tournament with just 1 hit and 2 runs from 9 at-bats. After two disappointing 
tournaments in 2006 and 2009, Reyes and the Dominican Republic team ran 
the table in 2013 tournament going 7–0 to make it to the Classic Final 
against Puerto Rico. They defeated their 2009 nemesis the Netherlands in 
the semifinal 4–1 and redeemed their 2009 losses. In the final, the Dominican 
Republic defeated Puerto Rico 3–0 to become the first team to go undefeated 
in the tournament. Reyes had a much better tournament in 2013, batting 
.314 with a home run and 11 hits. Reyes is a reggaeton musician and owner 
of a record label. In May 2011, Reyes released his debut song, "Bat Roto" 
(Spanish for "Broken Bat"), that was played on Spanish radio stations and 
in nightclubs in the United States and the Dominican Republic. In July, 
he released a video for his reggaeton song named "No Hay Amigo" ("There 
is No Friend"), which featured established reggaeton artists Julio Voltio, 
Vakero, and Big Mato.[54] Reyes created a record label, EL7 Music, whose 
name was inspired by his uniform number. As of 2011, he had financed all 
of the label's operations.[54] After leaving the Mets for free agency, 
Reyes continued to make his offseason home on Long Island. He had lived 
in Manhasset, New York with his wife, Katherine, and then moved to Old 
Brookville.[55] They have three daughters. Reyes was a close friend to 
former right-handed pitcher José Lima. When Lima died May 23, 2010, Reyes 
said, "He's the funniest guy you could ever meet, he always smiled, he 
was always happy. It was good to know him. It's a real tough day...I've 
known him a long time. People in the Dominican Republic love the guy a 
lot, so it's a very tough day not only for the Dominican people, but for 
everyone because of the guy that he was."[56] On October 31, 2015, Reyes 
was arrested for allegedly assaulting his wife in Wailea, Hawaii.[57] On 
March 30, 2016, prosecutors in Maui moved to dismiss the domestic abuse 
charges on the grounds that his wife was refusing to cooperate as a witness. 
Reyes had been scheduled to go to trial on April 4.[58] On December 7, 
2007, Reyes was announced as the cover athlete for Major League Baseball 
2K8 from 2K Sports, taking over from New York Yankees counterpart Derek 
Jeter. Reyes was also the cover athlete for the Nintendo DS spinoff, Major
