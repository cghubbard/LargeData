Khalil Thabit Greene (born October 21, 1979) is a former Major League Baseball 
shortstop. He bats and throws right-handed. Khalil Greene played high school 
baseball at Key West High school. Greene played all 69 games at third base 
for the Clemson Tigers in his freshman season, all but one of them starts. 
His first collegiate home run was an inside-the-park home run which came 
at the UNLV/Coors Desert Classic on February 27. In his freshman year, 
Greene had 98 hits, setting the record for Clemson freshmen. He led the 
team in hits, multi-hit games (31), at-bats (274), and hit-by-pitches (11). 
His batting average for the season was .358. Greene was a unanimous selection 
to the All-Regional Team in the postseason. In his sophomore season, Greene 
started every one of the team's 69 games at third base. He led the team 
in batting average with runners in scoring position at .444. He was an 
All-ACC second team selection. (The first team selection was Georgia Tech's 
Mark Teixeira.) He was selected to the All-ACC Tournament team. Greene 
again started every game for the Clemson Tigers in his junior season, but 
this time he and erstwhile shortstop Jeff Baker switched positions. He 
set the school record in season fielding percentage at that position (.965), 
while also setting every hit-by-pitch record for the school (in an inning, 
2; in a game, 3; in a season, 21; in a career, 47). He also led the team 
in doubles with 18. He was named the ACC Player of the Week during the 
last week of the season. Peter Gammons made a prediction in his 2001 pre-draft 
column on ESPN.com: "You won't find Clemson shortstop/third baseman Khalil 
Greene or Wake Forest center fielder Cory Sullivan on any top-100 list, 
but check back in five years from now and see if they aren't remarkably 
like Jeff Cirillo and Steve Finley. Greene and Sullivan are players." Greene 
was drafted with the second pick of the fourteenth round (409th overall) 
by the Chicago Cubs, but did not sign. Greene's senior season was his most 
impressive. Collegiate Baseball named him National Player of the Year. 
The publication, along with Baseball America, selected him as a member 
of their All-America first teams. Baseball America also chose Greene for 
their National Midseason Player of the Year. He was the ACC's Player of 
the Year and was named to the All-ACC first team. Greene was named winner 
of the Dick Howser Trophy, the Rotary Smith Award, and the Golden Spikes 
Award at the end of the season. He hit an amazing .480 with 26 home runs 
and 30 doubles with a .557 on-base percentage and .888 slugging percentage 
(for an OPS of 1.445). He broke his own fielding record with a .967 mark. 
In only one of the team's 67 games did he not reach base via walk or hit. 
His last at-bat in Clemson's Doug Kingsmore Stadium was, fittingly, a home 
run.[1] After Greene finished the 2002 season, having graduated with a 
bachelor's degree in sociology, he held school single-season records for 
total bases, extra-base hits, home runs, RBI, consecutive multi-hit games, 
and consecutive games with a home run. He holds career school records in 
total bases and RBI. He holds the ACC single-season record for batting 
average and the ACC career records for doubles and hits. Greene also holds 
the NCAA record for doubles in a career. On June 22, 2002, Greene received 
a special resolution from the South Carolina General Assembly. He'd started 
269 consecutive games. Greene was taken by the San Diego Padres with the 
thirteenth pick of the 2002 Major League Baseball Draft.[2] After finishing 
his college career and being drafted by the Padres, Khalil Greene reported 
to the Single-A Eugene Emeralds where he played only ten games. He batted 
.270 with no home runs and six RBI. He was then called up to the Lake Elsinore 
Storm of the California League where he finished the season. In 46 games, 
he hit nine home runs with 32 RBI while batting .317. In 2003, Greene started 
the season with the Double-A Mobile BayBears. In 59 games, he had a batting 
average of .275. He was then called up to the Triple-A Portland Beavers. 
In 76 games, Greene batted .288 with 10 home runs and 47 RBI. He then saw 
his first major league action on September 3, 2003, where he came into 
the game as a pinch-hitter for Brian Lawrence in the seventh inning and 
flied out against the Arizona Diamondbacks. He got his first start two 
days later against the Houston Astros, but went 0-for-4. His first hit 
came the next day; it was a single sharply hit up the middle against Ron 
Villone. His first home run led off the eighth inning of the September 
16 game against Jerome Williams of the San Francisco Giants. He finished 
the year with an average of .215 with two home runs and six RBI in twenty 
games. His first full season was in 2004. He played 139 games for the Padres, 
going 132-for-484 (.273) with 15 home runs and 65 RBI. He was seventh in 
the league in sacrifice flies with seven. His salary for the season was 
$300,500. Greene placed second in the MLB Rookie of the Year Award voting 
in the National League (to his former minor league roommate Jason Bay), 
despite having to play in fifteen of the last seventeen games of the season 
with a broken hand. In 2005, Greene played in 121 games going 109 for 436 
(.250) with 15 home runs and 70 RBI. He helped the Padres win their fourth 
division title, their first since 1998. In 2006, Greene appeared in 121 
games, and had 101 hits in 412 at-bats (.245) with 15 home runs and 55 
RBI, helping the Padres win their second consecutive National League West 
title. In 2007, Greene hit 155 for 611 for a (.254) average over 153 games. 
He also set a Padres record for home runs by a shortstop with 27, and accrued 
97 RBI. Despite playing in less than five full seasons, Greene is the Padres' 
career leader in home runs at the shortstop position, with 84 through the 
2008 season.[3] On February 4, 2008, the Padres signed Greene to a two-year, 
$11 million extension. In 2008, Greene got off to a terrible start offensively, 
not hitting a single home run until May 2. As of the end of July he was 
hitting only .213 with 10 home runs and 35 RBI and 5 stolen bases. On July 
30, 2008, Greene broke his hand while hitting a storage box after striking 
out for the 100th time in 2008 and his batting average dropped to .213. 
On July 31, it was announced Greene would miss the rest of the season. 
On December 4, 2008, Greene was traded to the St. Louis Cardinals for Mark 
Worrell and a player to be named later; he made $6.5 million in 2009.[4] 
On March 23, 2009 it was announced that relief pitcher Luke Gregerson was 
the player to be named in the trade.[5] Greene took several weeks off during 
May and June 2009, after it was revealed that he was cutting himself in 
mental anguish (revealed to be social anxiety disorder) due to a slow start 
for the Cardinals, hitting .197 with only three home runs at the time. 
He returned to the Cards lineup on June 19 at the Kansas City Royals. Playing 
third base for the first time since college, he went 2-for-2 with a double, 
a solo home run and a walk, eventually being substituted after fouling 
a ball off his foot. Following a 1 for 17 stretch over five games, Greene 
was placed back on the disabled list with social anxiety disorder on June 
29.[6] Greene filed for free agency for the 2010 season, and signed with 
the Texas Rangers.[7] He announced on February 22, 2010 that, suffering 
another episode of social anxiety disorder, he would not be reporting to 
Rangers spring training.[8][9] On February 25, the Rangers voided Greene's 
contract.[10] Khalil Greene writes hip-hop lyrics in his spare time and 
adds them to music.[11] He is an adherent of the Bahá'í Faith, and says
