Robert (Bob) Ralph Moose Jr. (October 9, 1947 – October 9, 1976) was a 
Major League Baseball pitcher from 1967 to 1976. Moose spent his entire 
career with the Pittsburgh Pirates. His best season came in 1969 when he 
posted a 14–3 won-loss record and a 2.91 Earned Run Average working equally 
as a starter and reliever. On September 20 of that year, he no-hit the 
eventual World Series champion New York Mets.[1] He is also known for his 
wild pitch in the bottom half of the ninth inning which allowed George 
Foster to score the winning run in the fifth and deciding game of the 1972 
NLCS, sending the Cincinnati Reds to the World Series after Pittsburgh 
had a one-run lead entering the bottom of the ninth.[2] During the 1974 
season, Moose suffered a blood clot under the shoulder of his pitching 
arm. Surgery was required to remove the clot plus one of Moose's ribs.[3] 
Moose was killed in an auto accident heading to Bill Mazeroski's golf course
