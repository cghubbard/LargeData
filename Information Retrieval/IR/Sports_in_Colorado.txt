Sports in Colorado include professional teams, college sports, and individual 
sports. Colorado is the least populous state with a franchise in each of 
the major professional sports leagues. The state is able to support the 
teams because it contains a large metropolitan area with a higher population 
than any other city within 550 miles (885 km). Therefore, many of the residents 
in the surrounding states support the teams in Denver, as shown by the 
reach of the Broncos' radio network.[1] Colorado is home to five NCAA Division 
I schools, plus a number of additional schools competing at lower levels. 
One school that competes at the lowest NCAA level, Division III, operates 
two Division I teams. The Unser family includes Al Unser, Al Unser Jr., 
Bobby Unser, Robby Unser and Louis Unser, and have won the Indianapolis 
500 among other motorsports events. The Pikes Peak International Hill Climb 
is a major motorsports event held at the Pikes Peak roads. Notable drivers 
include Mario Andretti, Michèle Mouton, Walter Röhrl, Ari Vatanen, Nobuhiro 
Tajima, Stig Blomqvist, Sébastien Loeb and Romain Dumas in addition to 
the Unsers. Meanwhile, the Pikes Peak International Raceway has hosted 
motorsport events including IndyCar Series, NASCAR Busch Series, NASCAR 
Truck Series, AMA Superbike Championship and USAC Silver Crown Series. 
The Cherry Hills Country Club has hosted professional golf tournaments 
such as the U.S. Open, U.S. Senior Open, U.S. Women's Open and PGA Championship.
