Salvador Anthony Yvars (February 20, 1924 â€“ December 10, 2008) was a professional 
baseball catcher. He played all or part of eight seasons in Major League 
Baseball, with the New York Giants from 1947 to 1953 and the St. Louis 
Cardinals from 1953 to 1954. Born in Manhattan's Little Italy to a Spanish 
gravedigger and an Italian laundress, he was a three-sport star at White 
Plains High School, playing football, basketball, and baseball.[1] He originally 
signed with the Giants in 1942, and enlisted in the United States Army 
Air Forces shortly afterward.[1] During his time in the Army, Yvars was 
effectively a test dummy, with him saying of his ability to handle the 
tests, "I could take six and a half G's without a pressure helmet."[1] 
After World War II, Yvars again played for the Giants' farm system. He 
played for Manchester of the New England League during the 1946 season, 
and the Jersey City Jerseys of the International League during the 1947 
season. He made his major league debut on September 27, 1947 in the only 
game he played that season for the Giants.[2] His lone hit of the season 
came off of Schoolboy Rowe, a single to left field.[1] In 1948, Yvars played 
in 15 games and had a batting average of .211.[2] He played three games 
in 1949 and nine in 1950 for the Giants.[2] During the 1951 New York Giants 
season, Yvars was the backup catcher behind Wes Westrum, and played in 
25 games, hitting .317 during the season.[2] During Game Six of the World 
Series, he lined out to right field for the final out as the Yankees took 
the series.[3] Ivars is best remembered as the player on the New York Giants 
who relayed stolen signals to his teammates awaiting in the batters box 
during the 1951 pennant-winning season.[4] In the 1980s, he said he wrote 
a memoir titled How We Stole the Pennant, but lost his publishing deal, 
he claimed, when he refused to detail the personal peccadilloes of teammates.[3] 
The Giants traded Ivars to St. Louis in 1953. He retired the next year, 
and worked as an investment advisor for 50 years.[3] He died in Valhalla, 
New York from amyloidosis at the age of 84, survived by his wife, Antoinette; 
his son, David; daughters Diane, Donna and Deborah; a brother, Jack; five
