The 1970 St. Louis Cardinals season was the team's 89th season in St. Louis, 
Missouri and the 79th season in the National League. The Cardinals went 
76-86 during the season and finished fourth in the National League East, 
13 games behind the Pittsburgh Pirates. The season was also the first of 
26 seasons for AstroTurf at Busch Memorial Stadium. Curt Flood, because 
of a salary dispute with Gussie Busch, was traded after the 1969 season 
but refused to go to the Philadelphia Phillies and on January 16, 1970, 
filed a civil lawsuit to challenge baseball's reserve clause. The case 
eventually reached the Supreme Court and, though he lost, paved the way 
for free agency to change the game. Bob Gibson won a Gold Glove and the 
Cy Young Award this year, with a 3.12 ERA, 23 wins, and 274 strikeouts. 
The Cardinals won only 76 games, their lowest total since the days of the 
154-game schedule. Vic Davalillo had 24 pinch hits, breaking the National 
League record, and tying the Major League record set by Dave Philley in 
1961.[4][5][6][7] Steve Carlton posted one game where he struck out 16 
batters.[8] Third baseman Mike Shannon was limited to 52 games and soon 
would retire because of a kidney disease that threatened his life. Infielders
