Clifton Randolph Pennington (born June 15, 1984) is an American professional 
baseball infielder for the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim of Major League 
Baseball (MLB). He has played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Oakland 
Athletics, Arizona Diamondbacks and Toronto Blue Jays. Pennington played 
for the Texas A&M Aggies baseball team from 2003–2005.[1] Pennington was 
drafted in the first round of the 2005 Major League Baseball Draft by the 
Athletics. On July 31, 2008, he was called up from the Triple-A Sacramento 
River Cats, and made his major league debut that day going 2-4. Following 
the 2009 spring training camp, he was returned to the River Cats.[2] On 
July 31, 2009, Pennington was called back up by the Athletics. He hit his 
first major league home run on August 5, against the Texas Rangers. He 
finished the 2009 season with 4 home runs, 21 RBIs, and a .249 batting 
average. He started the 2010 season in the starting role. He finished the 
season with 6 home runs and 46 RBI. Pennington started slow in the 2011 
season, averaging .160 in his first 10 games. On August 1, he left during 
a game against the Seattle Mariners, after having trouble moving his muscles 
in his face and moving his eyes. Later that day, Pennington was diagnosed 
with Bell's palsy, which paralyzes one side of the face and prevents him 
from controlling his muscles. Although Bell's palsy can last for days, 
weeks, or months, he was listed as day-to-day and only missed two games.[3] 
Near the end of the 2012 season, Pennington had started playing second 
base after the Athletics acquired Stephen Drew from the Arizona Diamondbacks 
to play every day shortstop, also due to the demotion of second baseman 
Jemile Weeks. Pennington went to the post season for the first time in 
his career as the Athletics won the AL West in 2012. They were eliminated 
in the ALDS by the Detroit Tigers in five games. On October 20, 2012, Pennington 
was traded to the Arizona Diamondbacks with Heath Bell and cash considerations. 
Oakland received Chris Young and $500K from Arizona, and the Marlins received 
minor-league infielder Yordy Cabrera from Oakland.[4] Pennington and the 
Diamondbacks agreed to a two-year contract worth $5 million on January 
23, 2013. The contract was finalized on January 30.[5] On April 13, 2013, 
Pennington was ejected for the first time in his MLB career for arguing 
a correctly ruled strike three call made by umpire Jim Reynolds.[6] In 
an 18 inning game on 24–25 August 2013 at the Philadelphia Phillies, Pennington 
walked five times, one shy of the Major League record. Teammate Tony Campana 
also walked five times. The teams drew a combined 28 bases on balls, a 
National League record. The Diamondbacks' 18 walks tied the National League 
mark. The game lasted seven hours and six minutes, the longest in franchise 
history for both clubs.[7][8][9] Pennington signed a one-year, $3.275 million 
deal in January 2014 and avoided arbitration.[10] On August 8, 2015, Pennington 
was traded to the Toronto Blue Jays along with cash considerations for 
minor league shortstop Dawel Lugo.[11] He batted .160 with 2 home runs 
and 11 RBI in 33 games played for the Blue Jays in 2015.[12] In game 4 
of the 2015 American League Championship Series, with two out in the ninth, 
Pennington became the first position player in Major League Baseball history 
to pitch in a postseason game, giving up two hits but recording the final 
out in a 14–2 loss to the Kansas City Royals.[13] On November 17, 2015, 
Pennington signed a two-year contract with the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim.[14]
