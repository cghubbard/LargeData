Trumbull is a town in Fairfield County, Connecticut bordered by the towns 
of Monroe, Shelton, Stratford, Bridgeport, Fairfield and Easton. The population 
was 36,018 according to the 2010 census.[1] Originally home to the Golden 
Hill Paugussett Indian Nation, Trumbull was colonized by the English during 
the Great Migration of the 1630s as a part of the coastal settlement of 
Stratford, Connecticut. The northwest farmers of Stratford petitioned the 
Colony of Connecticut in 1725 to establish their own separate village apart 
from Stratford. The farmers wished to call their village Nickol's Farms, 
after the family that owned a large farm in its center, but the village 
was named Unity. Unity merged with the village of Long Hill (organized 
in 1740) in 1744 to form the Society of North Stratford. After ten years 
of unsuccessful petitions, the Connecticut General Assembly granted complete 
town rights to Trumbull in October 1797. The town was named for George 
Washington's staunch supporter, Revolutionary War Governor, patriot, statesman 
and merchant, Jonathan Trumbull (1710–1785).[2] The Pequonnock River is 
the only major waterway in Trumbull, beginning northwest of Old Mine Park 
at the Monroe border and flowing southeasterly through the Pequonnock River

Trumbull and continues into Beardsley Park in Bridgeport. Major bodies 
of water include Canoe Brook Lake, Pinewood Lake, Tashua Hills Golf Club 
Pond, and the six Twin Brooks Park ponds. Minor bodies of water include
