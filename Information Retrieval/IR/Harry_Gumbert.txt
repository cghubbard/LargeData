Harry Edwards Gumbert (November 5, 1909 – January 4, 1995), nicknamed "Gunboat", 
was an American pitcher in Major League Baseball whose career extended 
for 21 professional seasons, including 15 years and 508 games pitched in 
the big leagues. Born in Elizabeth, Pennsylvania, he threw right-handed 
and was listed at 6 feet 2 inches (1.88 m) tall and 185 pounds (84 kg). 
Gumbert's career began in 1930 in minor league baseball, and after winning 
19 games for the International League edition of the Baltimore Orioles 
in 1935, Gumbert was acquired by the New York Giants late in that season. 
Gumbert was a member of the Giants' 1936–37 National League champions, 
as both a starting pitcher and reliever. He worked in relief in both the 
1936 World Series and the 1937 Fall Classic, and was treated harshly by 
the victorious New York Yankees, allowing 12 hits and 12 earned runs in 
four total games pitched and 3⅓ innings. Traded to the St. Louis Cardinals 
in May 1941, he worked for two more pennant winners and compiled a stellar 
.667 winning percentage (34–17) and earned run average (2.91) as a Redbird. 
He also made a brief appearance (two-thirds of an inning pitched, and no 
earned runs allowed) in the 1942 World Series, in which the Cardinals defeated 
the Yankees in five games. Gumbert spent his final five seasons in MLB 
with the second division Cincinnati Reds and Pittsburgh Pirates. As a reliever 
with Cincinnati, he led the NL in games pitched (61), games finished (46) 
and saves (17) in 1948. He missed the 1945 season while serving in the 
United States Army.[1] In his 15-season big league career, Gumbert compiled 
a 143–113 win–loss record, allowing 2,186 hits and 721 bases on balls in 
2,156 innings pitched. He struck out 709, and registered 96 complete games, 
13 shut outs and 46 career saves. Gumbert was known as one of the best 
fielding pitchers of his time.[citation needed] In 1938 he set a National 
League record for assists by a pitcher, recording 10 on May 23. Two of 
his great uncles, Ad Gumbert and Billy Gumbert, were also Major League
