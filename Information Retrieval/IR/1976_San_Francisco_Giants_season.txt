The 1976 San Francisco Giants season was the Giants' 94th season in Major 
League Baseball, their 19th season in San Francisco since their move from 
New York following the 1957 season, and their 17th at Candlestick Park. 
The team finished in fourth place in the National League West with an 74-88 
record, 28 games behind the Cincinnati Reds. During the first half of the 
1970s, attendance at cold and windy Candlestick Park plummeted, and Giants 
owner Horace Stoneham had faced financial hardship. Finally, in 1976, he 
put the team up for sale. In January 1976, Stoneham agreed to sell the 
team for $13.25 million to a Toronto group consisting of Labatt's Breweries 
of Canada, Ltd., Vulcan Assets Ltd., and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. 
The team would begin play with the 1976 season at Exhibition Stadium and 
be called the Giants.[1] In addition, it was briefly rumored they considered 
a return to the New York metropolitan area, perhaps to a new baseball stadium 
in the New Jersey Meadowlands. Instead, Bob Lurie led a group to buy the 
Giants from Horace Stoneham for $8 million, thereby saving the team from 
potentially being sold to a Canadian brewery and moved to Toronto.[2] Infielders
