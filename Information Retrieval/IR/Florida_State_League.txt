The Florida State League is a minor baseball league based in the state 
of Florida. It is one of three leagues currently classified as Class A-Advanced, 
the third highest classification of minor leagues.[1] Each team in the 
league is affiliated with a Major League Baseball team, and most play in 
their affiliate's spring training facility. The league was founded in 1919, 
and has continued almost entirely uninterrupted to the present day. Most 
players in the Florida State League do not reach this level until their 
third or fourth year of professional play. The league originated in 1919 
with teams in Bartow, Bradenton, Lakeland, Orlando, Sanford, and Tampa, 
Florida. The league closed down in 1928 and resumed play in 1936. It has 
continued uninterrupted, except for a four-year (1942–1945) suspension 
during World War II. In 2009, the Florida State League established a Hall 
of Fame commemorating the league's great players, managers, owners, and 
umpires. The awards and ceremonies for the inaugural class will take place 
at the FSL's winter meetings in Daytona Beach in November. Since 1979, 
the winner of the League Championship Series has become the holder—until 
the following season's championship—of the Watson Spoelstra Florida State 
League Championship Trophy.[2] The Florida State League Hall of Fame began
