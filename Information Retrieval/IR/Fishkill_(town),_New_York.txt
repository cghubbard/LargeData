Fishkill is a town in the southwest part of Dutchess County, New York, 
United States. It lies approximately 60 miles (97 km) north of New York 
City. The population was 22,107 at the 2010 census.[1] Fishkill partly 
surrounds the city of Beacon. The town of Fishkill contains a village, 
which is also named Fishkill. The name derives from the Dutch vis kill, 
meaning "fish creek."[2] The location of Fishkill was known as Tioranda 
by the Native American peoples. The name means "The place where two waters 
meet".[3] In 1683 New York City merchants Francis Rombouts and Gulian Verplanck 
purchased 85,000 acres (340 km2) in Dutchess County from the Wappinger 
confederacy of Native Americans for a quantity of goods including rum, 
powder, and tobacco. Neither ever lived on the land, intending to use it 
only for fur trading. The first white settlers were Rombout's daughter, 
Catharyna, and her husband, Roger Brett, who built a mill at the mouth 
of Fishkill Creek as it flows into the Hudson River.[4] Fishkill played 
an important role in the American Revolutionary War when a huge military 
encampment was established one mile (1.6 km) below the village to guard 
the mountain pass to the south. Signal fires lay in readiness on tops of 
the surrounding mountains. The Fishkill encampment became the main supply 
depot for the northern division of the Continental Army. The first copies 
of the New York State Constitution were printed at Fishkill in 1777.[4] 
In the 19th century mills and factories sprang up in Glenham and Matteawan, 
bringing an influx of skilled weavers from the British Isles. The healthy 
economy came to an end in the post-Civil War depression, and the once thriving 
factories fell into decay. In 1931, Texaco purchased the old woolen mill 
site and established a research center there. Today, the town's industry 
is mostly technology based.[4] In 1996, the animal rights group PETA suggested 
the town change its name to something less suggestive of violence toward 
fish. The town declined.[5] According to the United States Census Bureau, 
the town has a total area of 32.0 square miles (82.9 km2), of which 27.3 
square miles (70.8 km2) is land and 4.7 square miles (12.1 km2), or 14.55%, 
is water.[1] The elevation of the town varies from sea level along the 
Hudson River (Fishkill Waterfront, Fishkill Landing, Dutchess Junction) 
to 1,600 feet (490 m) above sea level (South Beacon Mountain). The southern 
town line is the border between Dutchess and Putnam counties. The western 
town line is defined by the Hudson River and the city of Beacon. To the 
north is the town of Wappinger, and to the east is the town of East Fishkill. 
Fishkill Creek gives the town its name and empties into the Hudson River. 
Interstate 84 passes through the town, with access from Exits 11, 12, and
