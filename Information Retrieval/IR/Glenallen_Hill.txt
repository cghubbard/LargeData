Glenallen Hill (born March 22, 1965) is a former Major League Baseball 
outfielder. Hill played with the Toronto Blue Jays (1989–91), Cleveland 
Indians (1991–93), Chicago Cubs (1993–94, 1998–2000) San Francisco Giants 
(1995–97), Seattle Mariners (1998), New York Yankees (2000), and Anaheim 
Angels (2001) during his thirteen-year career. With the Yankees, he won 
the 2000 World Series over the New York Mets. Hill batted and threw right-handed. 
Hill was also infamous for his defensive escapades, which were once described 
by then-Mariners pitching coach Bryan Price as "akin to watching a gaffed 
haddock surface for air." Hill graduated from Santa Cruz High School in 
1983, and was drafted by the Toronto Blue Jays in the 1983 amateur draft, 
in the ninth round and 219th overall. Hill made his major league debut 
on July 31, 1989, with the Toronto Blue Jays. In 19 games that year, he 
collected 15 hits including his first career home run and seven runs batted 
in. His play that season allowed him to remain with the team for the 1990 
season, where he hit .231 over 84 games including 12 home runs and 32 runs 
batted in. In 1991, he played in 35 games for the Blue Jays compiling a 
.253 average. On June 27, 1991 Hill was traded to the Cleveland Indians. 
Hill played in 37 games for the Indians in 1991 collected 32 hits while 
driving in 14 runs. In his first and only full season in Cleveland in 1992, 
Hill played in 102 games collecting 18 home runs and 49 runs batted in 
(then career-highs). Hill played in 66 games for the Indians in 1993 and 
hit only .224 before being traded to the Cubs on August 19. While a member 
of the Cleveland Indians, he committed a "phantom steal" of second. This 
occurred during a game against the Detroit Tigers which was interrupted 
by a prolonged disturbance in the outfield. When play resumed, no one noticed 
that Hill had moved from first to second, thus giving him a stolen base. 
Hill played in 31 games for the Cubs in his first season hitting .345 while 
driving in 22 runs. In 1994, Hill played in 89 games and clubbed 10 home 
runs while collecting 38 runs batted in before the 1994–95 Major League 
Baseball strike cancelled the remainder of the season. On April 7, 1995 
he was granted free agency. Hill signed with the Giants on April 9, 1995 
where he hit .264 with 24 home runs and 86 runs batted in along with a 
career-high 25 stolen bases. The following year, he played in 98 games 
hitting .280 with 19 homers and 67 runs batted in. In 1997, he hit .261 
with 11 home runs and 64 runs batted in. Hill was the first National League 
player to serve as a designated hitter in regular season play, doing so 
on June 12, 1997 in the first-ever game in interleague play as his San 
Francisco Giants faced the Texas Rangers at The Ballpark at Arlington. 
That year, he played in his first postseason game against the Marlins. 
He went 0 for 7 with two walks.[1] Following the Giants defeat, Hill was 
granted free agency on October 29. As Hill grew up near San Francisco, 
during his stint with the San Francisco Giants he often reached out to 
the community in which he grew up, making numerous public appearances and 
autograph signings. Hill signed with the Mariners on January 8, 1998 and 
hit .290 with 12 homers and 33 runs batted in before being placed on waivers 
and claimed by the Cubs. Hill was selected off waivers by the Cubs on July 
6, 1998. In 48 games Hill hit .351 with 8 homers and 23 runs batted in. 
Hill also played in one game during the 1998 National League Division Series 
where he was one for three with a run batted in and a stolen base.[1] He 
was granted free agency on October 23, but re-signed with the Cubs on December 
7. Hill hit .300 with 20 home runs and 55 runs batted in during the 1999 
season. He played in 64 games in 2000 and hit .262 with 11 home runs. On 
May 11, 2000, Hill became the first, and thus far only player to hit a 
home run on the five-story residential building across the street from 
Wrigley Field at 1032 W. Waveland Ave. The shot came off Steve Woodard 
in the second inning of the Cubs' 14-8 loss to the Milwaukee Brewers.[2] 
He was traded to the Yankees on July 23. Hill played in 40 games for the 
Yankees, mostly as a designated hitter. He hit 16 home runs in a rotating 
designated hitter role and was added to the postseason roster. He played 
in four games in the 2000 American League Division Series against the Oakland 
A's and was 1 for 12 with 2 runs batted in. In the 2000 American League 
Championship Series against the Seattle Mariners, Hill played in two games 
and went 0 for 2, striking out in both of his plate appearances.[1] In 
the 2000 World Series against the New York Mets, Hill played in three games 
going 0 for 3.[1] He earned a World Series ring when the Yankees defeated 
the Mets in five games. On March 28, 2001, Hill was traded to the Angels 
for minor-leaguer Darren Blakely. He appeared in only sixteen games that 
year, hitting .136 before being released on June 1. He retired after the 
season. In a 13-year major league career, Hill compiled a lifetime batting 
average of .271, hitting 186 home runs and driving in 586 RBIs in 1,162 
games. As a pinch hitter Hill had a .287 lifetime average with 13 home 
runs. In 2003, he began coaching in the Colorado Rockies minor league system 
before being named first base coach following the 2006 season.[3] In 2007, 
Hill started wearing a helmet while coaching first base following the death 
of Tulsa Drillers (a Rockies minor-league affiliate) first base coach and 
former major leaguer Mike Coolbaugh from injuries sustained when hit in 
the head by a batted ball.[4] Hill and Oakland's Rene Lachemann were the 
only coaches at the major league level to do so that year. Hill quickly 
became an advocate for all first base coaches to wear helmets.[5] In 2007, 
Joe Garagiola, Jr. (then Vice President of Baseball Operations), adopted 
a rule requiring all professional baseball base coaches to wear helmets 
beginning in 2008.[6] Hill managed the Colorado Springs Sky Sox during 
the 2013 and 2014 seasons while the Sky Sox were the AAA affiliates of 
the Colorado Rockies. He was named the manager of the Albuquerque Isotopes 
on January 8, 2015, after the Colorado Rockies changed their AAA affiliation 
from Colorado Springs to Albuquerque Isotopes. In December 2007, Hill was 
included in the Mitchell Report in which it was alleged that he had used 
performance-enhancing drugs during his career. In the report, Kirk Radomski 
alleged that he met Hill at a social function in 2000 during which they 
discussed Hill's dissatisfaction with the results from his use of Human 
Growth Hormone(HGH). Radomski claims he sent Hill a complimentary bottle 
of HGH, which Hill tried - then later expressed his satisfaction with the 
results. Radomski stated that Hill purchased two kits of HGH from him and 
provided a photocopy of a cancelled check from Hill for $3,200. Hill's 
phone number and address were also included in Radomski's address book. 
As an employee of Major League Baseball, Hill was required to submit to 
an interview by the Mitchell investigators. During the interview, Hill 
denied having used the HGH provided by Radomski, citing that he had been 
suffering from marital stresses at the time. He stated that this had been 
a one-time purchase, and that he had never used performance-enhancing substances. 
He admitted that the drugs had stayed in his possession until 2007 when 
he discovered them while unpacking from a move. Hill claimed that he couldn't 
remember other players with whom he may have discussed steroid use, and 
noted that his lawyer had warned him that naming players would hurt his 
career.[7] On December 20, 2007 Hill was also named in Jason Grimsley's 
unsealed affidavit as a user of steroids.[8] Hill and Grimsley were teammates 
on the 2000 New York Yankees. During his early career, Hill was forced 
to go on the disabled list after suffering injuries during a sleepwalking 
incident. Hill, an arachnophobe, had a nightmare about being attacked by 
spiders and in the process went sleepwalking to try to get away. When he 
woke up from the incident, he had cuts all over his hands and feet due 
to walking across shards of broken glass from a table he knocked over and 
also fell down a flight of stairs. His teammates began calling him "Spiderman" 
afterwards.[9] Hill's son, Glenallen Jr, plays high school baseball and
