The 1959 Chicago White Sox season was the team's 59th season in the major 
leagues, and its 60th season overall. They finished with a record 94–60, 
good enough to win the American League (AL) championship, five games ahead 
of the second place Cleveland Indians. It was the team's first pennant 
since 1919 and would be its last until their championship season of 2005. 
In 1959, the team won its first pennant in 40 years, thanks to the efforts 
of several eventual Hall of Famers – manager Al López, Luis Aparicio, Nellie 
Fox (the league MVP), and pitcher Early Wynn, who won the Cy Young Award 
at a time when only one award was presented for both leagues. Veteran catcher 
Sherm Lollar provided quiet leadership on and off the field, leading the 
team in home runs and RBIs.[3] The White Sox also acquired slugger Ted 
Kluszewski in August, a local area native, from the Pittsburgh Pirates 
for the final pennant push. Kluszewski gave the team the needed power-hitting 
for the stretch run and hit nearly .300 in the final month of play for 
the White Sox. Lopez had also managed the Cleveland Indians to the World 
Series in 1954, making him the only manager to interrupt the New York Yankees 
pennant run between 1949 and 1964. After the pennant-clinching victory, 
Chicago Mayor Richard J. Daley, a lifelong White Sox fan, ordered his fire 
chief to set off the city's air raid sirens. Many Chicagoans became fearful 
and confused since 1959 was the height of the Cold War; however, they relaxed 
somewhat upon realizing it was part of the White Sox' celebration.[4] The 
Sox won Game 1 of the World Series 11–0 on the strength of Kluszewski's 
two home runs, their last postseason home win until 2005. The Los Angeles 
Dodgers, however, won three of the next four games and captured their first 
World Series championship since moving to the west coast in 1958. 92,706 
fans witnessed Game 5 of the World Series at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, 
the most ever to attend a World Series game, or for that matter any non-exhibition 
major league baseball game. The White Sox won that game 1–0 over the Dodgers' 
23-year-old pitcher Sandy Koufax, but the Dodgers clinched the series by 
beating the Sox 9–3 two days later at Comiskey Park. Fox became the last 
player in the 20th century to have five hits on Opening Day.[5] [1] [2]
