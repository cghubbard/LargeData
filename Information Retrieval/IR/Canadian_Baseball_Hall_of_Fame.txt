in St. Marys, Ontario, Canada. The museum commemorates great players, teams, 
and accomplishments of baseball in Canada. The museum was founded in October 
1983 in Toronto at Exhibition Place and later moved to Ontario Place theme 
park. In 1994, it moved to St. Marys. It is dedicated to preserving Canada's 
baseball heritage which dates back to June 4, 1838, when a game closely 
resembling today's baseball was played in Beachville, Ontario. The Hall 
gained some major attention when Pete Rose became eligible for earning 
his 4,000th hit with the Montreal Expos. However Rose has yet to be elected 
to the Hall. Since opening, 111 individual members and teams have been 
inducted into the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame as of 2015. This includes 
professional ballplayers, amateurs, builders, teams, and honorary members 
who have helped popularize the sport in Canada. In addition, the Canadian 
Baseball Hall of Fame awards the Tip O'Neill Award annually to the Canadian 
baseball player "judged to have excelled in individual achievement and 
team contribution while adhering to the highest ideals of the game of baseball" 
and the Jack Graney Award for Lifetime Media Achievement.[1][2] The 32 
acre facility in St. Marys also includes four baseball fields designed 
by landscape architect Art Lierman of London, Ontario. Bold indicates a
