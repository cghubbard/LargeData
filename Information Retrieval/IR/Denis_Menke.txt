Denis John Menke (born July 21, 1940) is a former professional baseball 
infielder. He played all or part of thirteen seasons in Major League Baseball 
from 1962 to 1974. He played for the Milwaukee Braves (1962–65), Atlanta 
Braves (1966–67), Houston Astros (1968–71, 1974) and Cincinnati Reds (1972–73), 
all of the National League. He was elected to the National League All-Star 
team in 1969 and 1970.[1] During his career, Menke hit 101 home runs and 
compiled a batting average of .250. In 1964, Menke hit 20 home runs, his 
single season best. In 1970, as a Houston Astro, he compiled a .304 batting 
average, the only time he hit over .300 as a major leaguer. In 1969, Menke 
and Houston outfielder Jim Wynn hit grand slam home runs in the same inning.[1] 
Menke was a versatile player in the field. He played first, second, third 
base, shortstop, and 5 games as an outfielder. Menke complied a career 
fielding percentage of .969. He played his last major league game July 
10, 1974 with the Houston Astros.[1] Menke was one of the five Houston 
players who went to the Reds in a blockbuster trade between the 1971 and 
1972 seasons. Along with Menke, the Reds received future Hall of Fame second 
baseman Joe Morgan, starting pitcher Jack Billingham, center fielder César 
Gerónimo and utility outfielder Ed Armbrister, while the Astros received 
second baseman Tommy Helms, first baseman Lee May and utility infielder 
Jimmy Stewart. This trade is generally regarded as being one of the most 
lopsided in the history of Major League Baseball, as it was a major force 
in developing the Big Red Machine that would go on to win back to back 
World Series in 1975 and 1976, although Menke would be traded back to Houston 
before then. However, Menke did play in the 1972 World Series for the Reds, 
that saw them lose to the Oakland A's in seven games. Menke started his 
coaching career as a manager in 1977 with the Burlington Bees of the Midwest 
League, a farm team of the Milwaukee Brewers. The Bees won the League Championship 
that season in a three-game play-off against the Waterloo Indians. The 
following year he managed the Dunedin Blue Jays of the Florida State League, 
with 59 wins and 89 losses. The next year (1979) his record was 68 wins 
and 69 losses.[2] For the years 1980 and 1981 he was the first base coach 
for the Toronto Blue Jays.[2] Menke returned to the Astros as a hitting 
coach in 1983 and continued in that position until moving to third base 
coach in 1988.[2] In 1989 he joined the Philadelphia Phillies as the hitting 
coach and continued in that position until 1996. In 1993 the Phillies lost 
to the Blue Jays in the World Series.[2] Menke finished his coaching career 
returning to the Cincinnati Reds as the bench coach for the years 1997–2000.[2]
