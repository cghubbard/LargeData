The 1950 Philadelphia Phillies won the National League pennant by two games 
over the Brooklyn Dodgers. Nicknamed the "Whiz Kids" because of the youth 
of their roster, they went on to lose the World Series to the New York 
Yankees in four straight games. On January 10, 1950, owner Bob Carpenter 
announced that the club had officially abandoned the nickname "Blue Jays" 
and would be the "Phillies". The club had adopted the nickname in 1944 
but it never caught on among fans.[4] The pre-season 1950 City Series was 
planned for three games prior to Opening Day. Snow flurries and cold weather 
in Philadelphia caused the cancellation of the first game. The Athletics 
beat the Phillies 7–4 and the Phillies won the following game 11–2.[5]
