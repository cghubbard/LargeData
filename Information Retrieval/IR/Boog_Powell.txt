John Wesley "Boog" Powell (born August 17, 1941) is a former major league 
first baseman who played for the Baltimore Orioles (1961–74), Cleveland 
Indians (1975–76) and Los Angeles Dodgers (1977). He was with the Orioles’ 
World Series Champion teams in 1966 and 1970, the American League Champion 
teams in 1966, 1969, 1970 and 1971, and the American League East Division 
Champion teams in 1969, 1970, 1971, 1973 and 1974. The 4-time All-Star 
won the American League's Most Valuable Player award in 1970 and in 1964 
posted a .606 slugging percentage to lead the American League. He batted 
left-handed and threw right-handed, playing first base, outfield, and designated 
hitter. Powell was born in Lakeland, Florida; he played for that city's 
team in the 1954 Little League World Series. After his family moved to 
Key West when he was 15, Powell played at Key West High School and graduated 
in 1959.[1] He joined the Orioles after leading the International League 
in home runs at Rochester in 1961. He spent his first three seasons in 
Baltimore as a slow-footed third baseman and left fielder before switching 
to first base in 1965. At the plate he was an immediate success, hitting 
25 home runs in 1963; in 1964 he led the American League in slugging percentage 
(.606) while blasting a career-high 39 home runs despite missing several 
weeks because of a broken wrist. He slumped to .248 with 17 home runs in 
1965, then won the American League Comeback player of the Year honors in 
1966 (.287, 34 home runs, 109 runs batted in) while being hampered by a 
broken finger. In 1966, Powell, along with Frank Robinson and Brooks Robinson, 
led the Orioles to the 1966 World Series, where they surprised the baseball 
world by sweeping the Los Angeles Dodgers in four games to become baseball's 
world champions. Before the 1968 season, Powell lamented, "once, just once, 
I'd like to go through a whole season without an injury." and he did just 
that, playing over 150 games each of the next three seasons. In 1969 he 
hit a career-high .304 with 37 home runs and 121 runs batted in, and in 
1970 he was the American League Most Valuable Player, hitting 35 home runs 
with 114 runs batted in and narrowly missed a .300 average during the last 
week of the season. In the 1970 World Series, Powell homered in the first 
two games as the Orioles defeated the Cincinnati Reds in 5 games. Prior 
to the 1971 season, Powell appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated 
for the 1971 baseball preview issue. Powell helped Baltimore to a third 
straight World Series that year, blasting a pair of home runs in game two 
of the 1971 American League Championship Series against the up-and-coming 
Oakland Athletics, but he hit only .111 in the 1971 World Series as Baltimore 
lost to the Pittsburgh Pirates in seven games. In a 17-season career, Powell 
posted a .266 batting average with 339 home runs, 1187 RBI and a .361 on-base 
percentage in 2042 games. Powell hit three home runs in a game three times, 
and was second only to Eddie Murray on the Orioles' all-time home run list 
before Cal Ripken Jr. surpassed Powell in 1994. In 1983, Powell received 
5 votes for the Hall of Fame (1.3% of all BBWAA voters) in his only appearance 
on the ballot. Powell had been an American League all-star for four straight 
years (1968–1971). However, Oriole manager Earl Weaver believed in making 
liberal use of the platoon system; in 1973 and 1974, Powell fell victim 
to it, limiting his at-bats. The aging slugger was traded to Cleveland 
with Don Hood for Dave Duncan and a minor leaguer before the 1975 season. 
Powell, again a regular with the Indians, batted .297 (with 129 hits) and 
27 home runs (his best season since 1970), and a .997 fielding percentage. 
However, he hit only nine home runs in 1976. 1977 was his final season, 
as a pinch-hitter for the Dodgers. He hit .244 with no home runs and 5 
RBI's. He was released on August 31, 1977. In the 1970s and 1980s Powell 
appeared in more than ten different television commercials for Miller Lite 
beer, including a memorable one with umpire Jim Honochick. Playing on the 
theme of mocking umpires who make bad calls, the ad featured Honochick 
trying unsuccessfully to read the label on a beer bottle as Powell did 
the voice over. Borrowing Powell's glasses to bring the label into focus, 
and suddenly able to see who is standing next to him at the bar and providing 
the narration, Honochick exclaims "hey, you're Boog Powell!"[2][3] Powell 
is mentioned in the 4th episode of Cheers, entitled "Sam at Eleven". The 
fictional star of Cheers, ex-Red Sox reliever Sam Malone, relates his greatest 
moment in the Major Leagues: retiring Boog Powell in both games, to win 
the two games of a doubleheader[4] Powell is also mentioned in the 4th 
episode of Bill Burr's Netflix original show F Is for Family. While searching 
for his wife after having an argument, Frank Murphy drives past a batting 
cage and hears the crack of the bat hitting a pitch. He then quips to his 
daughter Maureen, "that's either your mother or Boog Powell." Powell currently 
owns Boog's Barbecue, which sells barbecue sandwiches, pit beef, and ribs 
in two locations: on Eutaw Street at Oriole Park at Camden Yards, and the 
Boardwalk in Ocean City, Maryland. Boog Powell is an avid angler, kicking
