The Boston Red Sox' 2010 season was the 110th in the team's history. The 
Red Sox opened and closed the season at home at Fenway Park against the 
New York Yankees.[3][4] The last time the Boston Red Sox opened and closed 
the season at home against the New York Yankees was the 1950 season.[5] 
With a 2010 record of 89 wins and 73 losses, the Red Sox finished 3rd in 
the American League East and failed to advance to the playoffs.[6] The 
2010 MLB Playoffs were the first conducted without the Red Sox having qualified 
since 2006. On November 5, 2009, the day after the Red Sox-rival Yankees 
clinched their 27th title, Boston declared numerous players free agents. 
Among these free agents were: left-fielder Jason Bay, left-handed relief 
pitcher Billy Wagner, and productive bench-outfielder Rocco Baldelli. On 
the same day, Boston traded pitchers Hunter Jones and Jose Alvarez to the 
Florida Marlins for a young outfielder named Jeremy Hermida. Many questioned 
the move, since Hermida's career has been far below the speculated potential 
he was drafted in the 1st round (11th overall) in the 2002 Major League 
Baseball Draft. Contrary to popular opinion, Epstein supported Hermida 
saying, "We still think there's a good hitter in there ... Jeremy is a 
player who hasn't fulfilled his potential yet. We were able to acquire 
him at a reasonable cost to see if he can fulfill that potential with us."[7] 
We still think there's a good hitter in there ... Jeremy [Hermida] is a 
player who hasn't fulfilled his potential yet. We were able to acquire 
him at a reasonable cost to see if he can fulfill that potential with us 
Days later, on November 9, Boston resigned two key players in the 2009 
campaign. Catcher/first baseman Victor Martínez, who was brought to Boston 
in a block-buster trade at the trade deadline from the Cleveland Indians 
for pitchers Justin Masterson, Nick Hagadone and Bryan Price,[8] had a 
$7.1 million option picked up after hitting .336 with 8 HR and 41 RBI in 
56 games during 2009. "We're going to really look for Victor to be an everyday 
catcher for us next year. We feel like that puts us in the best position 
to win with Victor catching as much as he can. The other spot we'll have 
available is for more of a traditional backup. We'll see what Tek's decision 
is before we move forward", Epstein told Boston reporters at the General 
Managers' Meeting in Chicago.[9] Boston also signed veteran knuckle-baller 
Tim Wakefield to a two-year deal worth $10 million. Before the All-Star 
break, Wakefield was tied for the American League lead in wins with 11 
and was selected to his first All-Star game. (However, he did not pitch 
as part of the 2010 American League All-Star Manager Joe Maddon's decision.) 
Unfortunately, Wakefield did not get an opportunity to finish his season 
the same way as injuries kept him to just four starts after the All-Star 
Break. "He wants to end his career in a Red Sox uniform, which is something 
we would like to see as well. For us, the finances made a lot of sense", 
Epstein told reporters at the GM Meeting in Chicago on the same day.[10] 
On the same day, Boston declined team options on C Jason Varitek and SS 
Álex González, only to have Varitek exercise his own $3 million option 
to remain with the Red Sox for the 14th straight season two days later, 
keeping his "captain" status. Ever since the 2004 departure of former Red 
Sox star-shortstop Nomar Garciaparra at the Trade Deadline, Boston sports 
fans have witnessed an array of shortstops brought in to stop the bleeding. 
The following players have each held stints as short stop: Orlando Cabrera 
in 2004, Edgar Rentería in 2005, Álex González in 2006 and again in 2009, 
Julio Lugo from 2007–2009, and other part-time players such as Alex Cora 
(2005–2008), Royce Clayton (2007), Jed Lowrie (2006–2011), and Chris Woodward 
and Nick Green in 2009. None of these players were successful in taking 
over. On December 4, the Red Sox inked former Toronto Blue Jays SS Marco 
Scutaro to a two-year, $11 million contract, with a dual option for 2012 
worth $6 million if the Red Sox pick it up, and $3 million if Scutaro picks 
it up. "We were looking to upgrade at shortstop. We were pretty clear about 
that going into the winter. Right from the start, we identified Marco as 
the best free agent and a guy who would be the best fit for this ballclub. 
It was a process of doing our due diligence and making sure we understood 
the whole landscape of the position through trades and free agency and 
then doing more due diligence on Marco", remarked Theo Epstein regarding 
the signing. Scutaro had a break-out season with Toronto in 2009, batting 
.282, scoring 100 runs, belting 12 homers, and producing a .379 OBP as 
the leadoff hitter.[11] Right from the start, we identified Marco [Scutaro] 
as the best free agent and a guy who would be the best fit for this ballclub. 
On December 9, Boston made a move for the bettering of their bullpen, which 
had lost both Takashi Saito and Billy Wagner to free agency signings by 
the Atlanta Braves (who picked up both relievers), and acquired reliever 
Ramón A. Ramírez from the Tampa Bay Rays. Ramírez had pitched for the Cincinnati 
Reds from 2008–2009, compiling a 1–1 record with a 2.97 ERA, striking out 
29 in 39.1 innings over the two seasons.[12] The next day, Boston traded 
minor-league pitcher Chris Province to the Minnesota Twins for starter/reliever 
Boof Bonser. Bonser pitched for the Twins from 2006–2008 before undergoing 
season-ending right shoulder surgery in the spring of 2009, compiling an 
18–25 record with a sub-par 5.12 ERA, striking out 317 in 391.2 innings 
and 60 starts.[13] The following week, on December 16, 2009, Boston made 
a double-headed offseason splash that eclipsed the Scutaro signing the 
previous month. Boston announced that they had come to terms with former 
Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim starter John Lackey and former Milwaukee 
Brewers center-fielder Mike Cameron. Lackey was inked to a five-year pact 
worth a reported $82.5 million, sealing his future with the Sox through 
2014. For his career, Lackey has a record of 102–71 with a 3.81 ERA (1201 K/1501.1 
IP/1.31 WHIP[14]). His best season was 2007, where he went 19–9 with a 
3.01 and made the All-Star Team. He also finished 3rd in the Cy Young Award 
voting for the American League the same year. The addition of Lackey creates 
arguably the strongest "big three" atop any rotation in the Major Leagues. 
With aces Josh Beckett and Jon Lester already manning the 1–2 slam, Lackey 
provides the 3-hole punch that can likely compete with that of American 
League East division rival Yankees, consisting of ace CC Sabathia, former 
Blue Jay ace A. J. Burnett, and long-time Yankee playoff star Andy Pettitte. 
Cameron was signed to a two-year deal worth between $15 and $16 million, 
signing him for the 2010 and 2011 seasons. Cameron has hit .250 with 265 
HR, 926 RBI, .340 OBP, and a .448 SLUG% in his impressive 1,829 Major League 
career games. He has eclipsed 20 home runs in eight different seasons, 
while playing for the Chicago White Sox, Cincinnati Reds, Seattle Mariners, 
New York Mets, San Diego Padres and, of course, the Brewers.[15] On December 
29, it was made official that Boston would not be bringing back left-field 
slugger Jason Bay as the New York Mets signed him to a four-year deal worth 
$66 million, which signs him from 2010–2013. There is also a fifth-year 
vesting option worth $17 million, with a $3 million buyout. The option 
becomes guaranteed if Bay reaches 600 plate appearances in 2013, or 500 
plate appearances in both 2012 and 2013. The deal also includes a full 
no-trade clause, $8.5 million signing bonus, $6.5 million in 2010, and 
$16 million in each of the final three guaranteed seasons. In his only 
full season with the Red Sox, he notched a .267 average, hitting 36 HR 
and 119 RBI (both career highs) and earning the first Silver Slugger Award 
of his career.[16] To continue the impressive and economical 2009–10 offseason 
by the Boston front office, Theo Epstein added former Mariner and Los Angeles 
Dodger, third-baseman Adrián Beltré, to the Bay-less 2010 roster. Signing 
a one-year deal worth $9 million, with a $5 million player option for 2011, 
which would increase to $10 million if Beltre makes 640 plate appearances 
in 2010, the Red Sox bought themselves an additional half-season to determine 
the future of third-baseman Mike Lowell, the Red Sox hot-corner man since 
coming from the Florida Marlins club in 2006, along with starting ace Josh 
Beckett, in exchange for now super-star shortstop Hanley Ramírez. Beltre 
had a very down year with Seattle in 2009, hitting only .265 with 8 HR 
and 44 RBI in 111 games and 477 at-bats, a performance severely hindered 
by left shoulder woes. For his career, Beltre has hit .270 with 250 HR 
and 906 RBI.[17] Speculation arose, however, concerning the intellectuality 
of this move, as many had questioned Beltre's offensive capabilities, and 
those of the Red Sox themselves, stating that the loss of Jason Bay would 
hurt the club, who have won at least 95 games in all but one of Terry Francona's 
seasons as manager. In response to this, Theo Epstein stated, "I think 
Adrian's reputation is that he's one of best defenders in the game, period, 
let alone one of the best defensive third baseman. He's got all the attributes 
you look for in a third baseman. He's got quickness, he's got great hands. 
His feet are tremendous. Great arm and very quick release. He has that 
signature play coming in on balls, which he does better than maybe anyone 
in the history of the game. He attacks the baseball. He's really a weapon 
defensively, and we're looking forward to having him help our run prevention. 
But as Adrian said, he's not just just a defender. He has the ability to 
be a very well-rounded player and, in fact, a leader on the team. We look 
forward to having him help our club win in all phases of the game this 
year."[18] ...[Adrián Beltré]'s not just just a defender. He has the ability 
to be a very well-rounded player and, in fact, a leader on the team. We 
look forward to having him help our club win in all phases of the game 
this year. The Beltre signing occurred on January 8. One day prior, the 
Red Sox acquired another Mariner in infielder/outfielder Bill Hall via 
trade in exchange for poorly-performing first-baseman/outfielder Casey 
Kotchman, filling a hole at first base for Seattle, who have declined to 
re-sign first-baseman slugger Russell Branyan. Boston will also receive 
an undisclosed Minor League player to be named later, and cash considerations. 
Hall will likely be used as a bench player who can give almost anyone a 
day off when necessary, and if Hall finds his form, Boston may even consider 
using him to make yet another blockbuster deal at the trade deadline this 
season, or even in the next offseason. The 30-year-old struggled immensely 
at the dish in 2009, hitting a microscopic .201 with 8 HR and 36 RBI in 
334 at-bats. The Mariners are paying the better part of Hall's 2010 salary, 
and the rest is being sent to the Red Sox in the form of cash considerations.[19] 
During the last three weeks of January, Boston avoided arbitration hearings 
with five players by signing them to contracts, keeping alive Epstein's 
streak of never going to arbitration with any player during his tenure 
with the Red Sox. On January 14, he first signed Japanese setup man Hideki 
Okajima to a one-year deal worth $2.75 million, with bonus clauses taking 
effect after 55 games, 60 games, 65 games and 70 games, each clause worth 
an additional $50,000. In his three-year career with Boston, the 34-year-old 
veteran is 12–4 with six saves, a 2.72 ERA, 192 IP, and 172 K, while showing 
remarkable consistency, making at least 60 appearance each season.[20] 
Just five days later, the Red Sox signed All-Star closer Jonathan Papelbon 
to a one-year, $9.35 million pact, a $3 million update from the $6.25 million 
he made in 2009. Papelbon, 29, has been to the Major League Baseball All-Star 
Game all four years he has been in the big leagues. He is Boston's all-time 
saves leader with 151, and his career is highlighted by stats like 268 
appearances, 1.84 ERA, 346 K, 298 IP, .198 BAA, and a 10.45K/9 IP ratio. 
On this day, Boston also avoided arbitration with key relievers in Manny 
Delcarmen and Ramón S. Ramírez.[21] And, to top off Epstein's 8-year streak, 
the Red Sox signed Jeremy Hermida, whom the Sox acquired just a month earlier, 
to the tune of one-year and $3.345 million. The left-handed hitter is projected 
as a back-up to the Boston outfield, composed of Jacoby Ellsbury, Mike 
Cameron and J. D. Drew, but is happy nonetheless. The Red Sox are hoping 
he will live up to the expectations that the Marlins put on him when they 
picked him 11th overall in the 2002 draft.[22] On February 10, 2010, fans 
gathered at Fenway Park to kick off the Red Sox preseason by celebrating 
Truck Day. The first full team workout of the preseason took place on February 
24, 2010. Playing other teams in the Grapefruit League, the Red Sox had 
17 wins, 14 losses, and 1 tie during spring training. General manager Theo 
Epstein set the tone for the regular season by characterizing it as a "bridge 
year", referring to the next wave of key talent that will be ready to take 
the field in 2011 and 2012. For the 2010 season, Epstein brought in new 
additions: Marco Scutaro, Adrián Beltré, Mike Cameron and John Lackey. 
Over the course of the season, 19 players spent 24 stints on the disabled 
list. Starter players Jacoby Ellsbury, Dustin Pedroia and Kevin Youkilis 
suffered season ending injuries. Due to the abundance of injuries, a number 
of players within the system emerged to have increased visibility on the 
team. Altogether, the Red Sox used 53 players in 2010, six of whom made 
their major league debut in 2010. The Red Sox kicked off their 2010 regular 
season on April 4 at home against the New York Yankees. Trailing the Yankees 
for most of the game, the Sox began to make a comeback when Jorge Posada 
made two consecutive outs and Kevin Youkillis crossed home plate, pulling 
the Sox ahead. The final score was Red Sox 9, Yankees 7. Infielders Coaches
