East Haven is a town in New Haven County, Connecticut, in the United States. 
As of the 2010 census, the town population was 29,257.[1] Located 3 miles 
(5 km) east of New Haven, it is part of the Greater New Haven area. East 
Haven is 35 miles (56 km) from Hartford, 82 miles (132 km) from N.Y. City, 
99 miles (159 km) from Providence, Rhode Island, and 140 miles (230 km) 
from Boston. This area was long settled by indigenous peoples. Long before 
European encounter, Algonquian peoples occupied settlements along the coastline 
and rivers. The area now known as East Haven was obtained by Puritan settlers 
Reverend John Davenport and Theophilus Eaton on November 29, 1638, as part 
of the purchase of New Haven from Sachem Momauguin of the local Quinnipiack 
tribe. Additional land, in what is now known as Foxon, was purchased from 
Chief Montowese on December 11, 1638. In 1639 Thomas Gregson petitioned 
for the purchase of Solitary Cove, later called Morris Cove. This was granted 
on August 5, 1644, and was the last piece of land that made up the original 
town of East Haven. The original town boundaries were from the harbor and 
Quinnipiac River on the west to the Branford and North Branford town line 
on the east. The southern boundary is Long Island Sound, and the North 
Haven town line is the northern boundary. East Farms, as it was first called, 
was considered a parish of the New Haven Colony. Settlers settled into 
Morris Cove and what is now the "center" of East Haven in 1639. The first 
Connecticut ironworks, the third in New England, was founded on the shores 
of Furnace Pond in 1655. Called Lonotononket (Great Pond) by the Quinnipiac, 
it was renamed by English-speaking settlers as Lake Saltonstall. With Branford 
and North Branford having had settlers since 1643, people from the New 
Haven Colony started to settle the Foxon section in 1683. In 1665, the 
New Haven Colony was merged with the Connecticut Colony (Hartford) under 
a charter from King Charles II. With the success of the ironwork mill, 
the area became known as Iron Works Village. In 1675 Iron Works Village 
petitioned the Connecticut Colony to become a separate Town. Negotiations 
with New Haven regarding land never succeeded. This eventually led to the 
relinquishing of village privileges in 1685. Efforts were again made in 
1703. The Connecticut Colony granted the town petition for Township in 
May 1707 and colonists changed the name from Iron Works Village to East 
Haven. Some outstanding land issues with New Haven and a minor feud with 
Governor Gurdon Saltonstall resulted in the rescinding of the township 
status; the area was made a parish of New Haven.[2] In 1706 the first public 
school building was built in East Haven, followed by the appointment of 
a School Committee in 1707. Jacob Hemingway, one of the first Yale students, 
served as the first pastor (1704–1754) of the Congregational church in 
East Haven. Several meeting houses were built over the years. In January 
1772 the Society of East Haven authorized the expense of $1,000 to build 
a new 65-by-50-foot (20 by 15 m) meeting house. while under construction, 
the building was extended by 8 feet (2.4 m) and a steeple was added. In 
1774 the Old Stone (Congregational) Church was finished, and Nicholas Street 
was named its first minister. During the American Revolution, this area 
was subject to troop movement and encampment by both revolutionary and 
British forces. On July 5, 1779, British forces led by General William 
Tryon landed from war ships, attacked Black Rock Fort in Morris Cove and 
captured its 19 defenders. The British attacked New Haven and East Haven. 
General Lafayette and revolutionary forces also visited town and encamped 
on the green. During the Revolution, East Haven lost 16 men. John Howe 
was killed at the Black Rock Fort. Fifteen other men died, mostly of disease 
while held on British prison ships in Long Island Sound. After the war, 
the United States military abandoned Black Rock Fort. East Haven became 
an incorporated town of the new republic in May 1785. At the initial town 
meeting, on July 5, 1785, Isaac Chidsey was named first selectman. When 
relations between the United States and Britain deteriorated in the early 
19th century preceding the War of 1812, the government decided to re-fortify 
Black Rock Fort. A new masonry wall was built for fortification. Six guns 
were installed, and a new barracks for 50 men and a magazine were built. 
The fort was renamed Fort Nathan Hale, in honor of the Connecticut patriot. 
During the War of 1812, the fort successfully defended the area from several 
British raids. In 1863, during the Civil War, a new Fort Hale was built 
to defend against possible raids by the Confederate States. Built next 
to the ruins of the original fort, the fortification included an earthen 
rampart, five fortified bunkers, eighteen guns and a moat with a drawbridge. 
The fort did not see any action during the Civil War. East Haven lost 15 
men during the war. Two men, Charles Benoit and James Murphy died at Andersonville 
prison in Georgia. East Haven's western border was the Quinnipiac River, 
and the town was in charge of four bridges that crossed it. In 1881 East 
Haven was facing a financial problem. The repair and maintenance of the 
four bridges that crossed the Quinnipiac River, along with highway maintenance, 
and payments to Civil War soldiers, presented the town with a $200,000 
debt. The bridges contributed $180,000 of that debt. Combined with requests 
for additional town services, the Board of Selectman voted to sell Fair 
Haven, Granniss Corners, and Morris Cove to New Haven. After a public vote, 
in which East Haven residents voted 123 to sell and 9 against, it ceded 
those three sections to New Haven. The town cleared its debt, at the same 
time losing 70% of its population and 33% of its land area. Since the 1850s, 
Lake Saltonstall had become a major amusement center in the region. The 
lake was used heavily during the summer and by skaters in the winter. The 
lake, which borders the towns of East Haven and Branford, was sold in 1895 
to the New Haven Water Company. The new East Haven continued to grow. In 
1892, after several businesses and the town hall were destroyed in a fire, 
the Board of Selectmen voted to install fire hydrants in the center of 
town and ordered 500 feet (150 m) of hose. Fighting town fires was handled 
by citizen volunteers who came to the fire. By 1899, several young town 
members formed a volunteer fire department. They applied for state recognition 
and started serving the town on January 2, 1900. Policing East Haven was 
handled by New Haven sheriffs until 1900 or so when the town hired Jim 
Smith to be the town's first constable. Smith used the barn on his farm 
as the jail. The constable staff continued to grow until it was organized 
in 1925 under the Board of Public Safety. This included the East Haven 
Fire Department and the newly organized East Haven Police Department. Technology 
was improving the lives of the residents. In 1898 gas lights were installed 
in East Haven. By 1903, four streets were lighted by gas lights. The town 
established its own telephone company in 1899 and had 75 customers before 
selling its holding to the local telephone company. Electric lights made 
their debut in 1918. The East Haven Library was established in 1909. With 
an increase in population, especially Catholic immigrants and descendants 
of Irish and Italian ancestry, the first Roman Catholic church opened in 
East Haven in 1916. Five East Haven men died while serving in World War 
I. The town voted to build a new town hall in 1927. Built at a cost of 
$135,000, the new town hall was dedicated on August 11, 1928. More than 
5,000 residents attended the open house. The next month, on September 22, 
1928, the new East Haven Library was opened and dedicated. During World 
War II many men from East Haven served overseas. Twenty-four died in the 
war. After World War II, East Haven benefited from suburbanization, as 
families followed newly constructed highways and moved out of the older, 
dense cities into less settled areas. The GI Bill helped veterans buy the 
new houses built in outer areas. The population of East Haven nearly doubled 
from the end of the war to 1960. The population increase was also assisted 
by the building of Interstate 95 through the center of town in 1951. A 
less beneficial effect was drawing off retail business and dividing residential 
areas of town. During the Vietnam War, Lance Corporal Richard J. Wolcheski, 
USMC, was the only East Haven man killed. Following the highways, large 
retail stores and fast food franchises started to build outlets on both 
U.S. 1 and State Route 80 in the 1960s and 1970s. The downtown area was 
redeveloped in the 1970s with construction of the East Haven Mall to compete 
with suburban malls. Condominiums were built in the Center and Foxon sections. 
The town added its athletic complex, a new swimming pool to the high school. 
The new East Haven Police headquarters was finished in 1973. New Haven 
and neighboring towns such as East Haven have been destinations for a new 
wave of immigrants since the late 20th century, the majority of whom in 
East Haven are Latinos from Ecuador.[3] In the 2010 census, Hispanics and 
Latinos made up more than 10% of the town's population. Following successful 
Main Street renovations in other older towns, since 2004, the downtown 
area has been revitalized to emphasize its historic attractions and scale, 
based on its tradition as a New England town. Period lighting was installed 
and brick sidewalks to emphasize pedestrian appeal. It has a weekly Farmers' 
Market held on Sunday at the Town Hall square. On March 16, 2009, the town 
came to an agreement with neighboring New Haven over the future of Tweed 
New Haven Regional Airport, which straddles the boundary between the two 
municipalities. This ended 40 years of competition. On August 9, 2013, 
a Rockwell International Turbo Commander 690B crashed on approach, hitting 
two houses in an East Haven residential neighborhood near the airport. 
The impact and the resulting fires destroyed both houses. The private plane 
had taken off from Teterboro Airport in New Jersey.[4] The incident resulted 
in four deaths: the pilot of the plane; his passenger, the pilot's 17-year-old 
son; and two children in one of the houses. They were girls of 13 years 
and one year of age. According to the United States Census Bureau, the 
town has a total area of 13.4 sq mi (34.8 km2)， of which 12.3 sq mi (31.8 km2) 
of it is land and 1.19 sq mi (3.08 km2) of it (8.57%) is water. East Haven 
also contains Stony Island, approximately 660 yards (600 m) from East Haven 
Town Beach in Long Island Sound.[5] The shape of East Haven on a map is 
taller than it is wide. It is bordered on the south by Long Island Sound, 
on the west by New Haven, on the north by North Haven, and on the east 
by Branford, Lake Saltonstall, and North Branford. East Haven shares with 
New Haven the land belonging to local Tweed New Haven Airport and Alling 
Memorial Golf Course. During the Paleozoic Era, 450 to 250 million years 
ago, several tectonic plates collided to form the supercontinent called 
Pangaea. East Haven was located in the middle of this collision, and the 
results can be seen today with the schists, gneisses and granites which 
are exposed.[6] When Pangaea was broken up, during the Triassic and Jurassic 
periods, volcanic activity occurred, depositing basalt or trap rock. Earthquakes 
can still be felt in the area. In February 2001 the area was rocked by 
a 1.8 magnitude earthquake originating in Madison, Connecticut.[7] It is 
estimated that Connecticut was covered by glaciers at least two times. 
The last glacier is estimated to have been 1,800 feet (550 m) thick in 
the New Haven area. 22,000 years ago, the glacier moved south, eroding 
mountains and pushing through East Haven to deposit large amounts of glacial 
till to form Long Island. 14,000 years ago the glacier retreated and shaped 
the coastline, formed Long Island Sound and created Lake Saltonstall. It 
also deposited glacial till, soil, sand, rocks and boulders that the ice 
carried south from the north.[6] The coast is primarily covered by gneiss 
rock (including granite), schist and quartzite. The remaining sections 
are part of the Central Valley of Connecticut and are covered with clastic 
sedimentary rock (redbeds, conglomerate, sandstone, brownstone and shale). 
This soft surface has been resedimented by a number of floods, making the 
soil soft and fertile and ideal for farmland.[6] Brownstone, a sedimentary 
rock that erodes easily, was easily dug into by glaciers and carved out 
many lakes and valleys. The area surrounding Farms River and Lake Saltonstall 
on the East Haven and Branford border is an example of this. The brownstone 
that did not erode was used for building foundations and rock fences found 
throughout New England.[6] Deposits of basalt (lava flow) can be found 
in the north and northeast sections of East Haven. Several quarries can 
be found in this area. Traprock (basalt) is turned into crushed stone. 
It is primarily used in construction and in the bedding of roads. Sand 
and gravel from glacial till is the second most profitable quarried rock. 
They are used as fill, in concrete, leach fields or for road sand.[6] When 
Pangaea was broken up, East Haven had forests. Dinosaurs, reptiles and 
mammals roamed the area. Dinosaur trackways like those found in Rocky Hill 
at Dinosaur State Park were recently found at a construction site near 
Lake Saltonstall. The tracks were made by Eubrontes. Fossils of Triassic 
period reptiles have been found in the area. Stegomus was covered with 
armor plates and looked similar to an armadillo. Today, East Haven is mostly 
covered with broadleaf, hardwood trees. There are a few conifer (evergreen) 
forests, mostly around Lake Saltonstall. Salt marshes are located in areas 
around Long Island Sound. Dinosaurs were long ago succeeded by deer, coyotes, 
squirrels, foxes, chipmunks and rabbits. Garter snakes can be found in 
the area. Pheasants, grouse, ducks and wild turkeys can be found in East 
Haven, as well as cardinals, blue jays, warblers, crows, sparrows, parrots, 
woodpeckers and sea gulls. Trout can be found in the fresh water lakes. 
Bluefish, bass, flounder, blackfish, sand sharks, eels, lobsters, crabs 
and clams can be found in Long Island Sound. The residents of the town 
divide it into three large "sections" rather than smaller neighborhoods. 
These sections are: The area borders Branford and North Branford on the 
east, New Haven on the west to about Grannis Pond in the south, and surrounds 
State Route 80. This is the hilliest section of town. It counts among its 
landmarks the town high school, Foxon Park Beverage (a locally famous soda 
manufacturer), and Camp Murray, a Girl Scouts day camp. Grannis Pond used 
to host a YMCA camp until the land was sold and developed. The area is 
located in the southern section of East Haven, from the Caroline Creek 
section of East Haven on the west to Branford on the east and starting 
at Short Beach Road in the north. This section includes the town beach, 
numerous condominiums, and summer cottages. The area near Tweed New Haven 
Airport has an industrial park that includes Town Fair Tire Centers Headquarters 
and Calabro Cheese Corporation. The Center is not the geographical center 
of town but the hub of the administrative facilities. Landmarks include 
the Town Hall, Fire Department Headquarters, Hagaman Memorial Library, 
the "old" East Haven High School, and other administrative buildings. The 
old high school has been adapted for use by the East Haven Historical Society, 
and a teen center. The Police Department and Public Works Department reside 
on the "Center" - Foxon line. The most recognizable landmark in East Haven 
is the Old Stone Church. Built in 1774, the steeple of the church stands 
out against the low horizon. The Town Green is a 2.4-acre (9,700 m2) park 
located at the eastern end of the central business district (two blocks 
east of the town hall) and is mostly covered by trees. Monuments are dedicated 
to honor war veterans and firefighters. The focal point of the green is 
the gazebo or bandstand. The Green is the site of the annual East Haven 
Fall Festival and summer concerts. Margaret Tucker Park is considered the 
second East Haven Green, with its location across the street from Town 
Hall and the Old Stone Church. They have developed additional land to the 
park, along with a water fountain. Included in this section is the "West 
End", which borders New Haven. Since the late 20th century, conditions 
have declined in this area of older housing. Efforts are underway to revitalize 
the area that most residents think have been overlooked with all the focus 
of the re-development efforts in the center of town.[8] The Senior Center 
is located one block from Town Hall. The town has a weekly Farmers' Market 
held at the Town Hall on Sundays. This market features fresh produce, flowers, 
baked goods and crafts. Some weeks feature fundraising for town institutions. 
East Haven's climate is tempered by its location on Long Island Sound; 
it has a continental climate which is common in New England. Winters are 
usually milder, with less snow accumulation, than those found inland. In 
a normal winter East Haven averages 27 inches (68.58 cm) of snowfall. It 
is not unusual to have a dusting of snow by the coast and an inch of snowfall 
in the northern areas of East Haven. The town is vulnerable to Nor'easter 
weather systems that can drop heavy rain or snow in the region. The Blizzard 
of 1888 dropped about 40 inches of snow, while the Blizzard of 1978 dropped 
almost 2 feet (0.61 m). Summers are moderately warm and humid, though cooler 
than inland. Though rare, the region does experience high [heat waves] 
and some 100 °F (38 °C) days. Precipitation is evenly spread throughout 
the year. East Haven enjoys a fairly long growing season with the last 
frost occurring in mid April and the first frost occurring in mid October. 
On average, East Haven has 207 sunny days and 158 cloud or rainy days. 
Severe weather does occur in East Haven. The area has been hit by several 
hurricanes, most recently in August 2011 when Hurricane Irene severely 
damaged numerous shore areas, destroying houses along Cosey Beach.[9] In 
1985, the eye of Hurricane Gloria came across state 22 west of East Haven. 
The area was without electricity, telephone and cable TV service for 7 
days. Tornadoes sometimes occur in Connecticut. Though the town was not 
directly affected, a tornado touched down in Hamden on July 10, 1989, 7 
miles (11 km) away. [10] On August 11, 2016 a tornado touched down in North 
Haven, 5 miles (8.0 km) away. [11] As of the census[15] of 2010, there 
were 29,257 people and 11,492 households residing in the town. The population 
density was 2,377.7 people per square mile (896.8/km²). The total gender 
makeup of the town is 13,956 (47.7%) male and 15,301 (52.3%) female. Age 
distribution of the estimated 2010 population of the town is as follows: 
The racial makeup of the town is 82.6% White, followed by 10.3% Hispanic 
or Latino, 2.9% African American, 3.3% Asian, .7% from other races and 
0.2% Native American.[15] The median age of a house is 40.0 years. The 
median house purchase price is $240,500.00 and median monthly rental is 
$1,200.00.[16] The town is primarily considered a Democratic town, though 
it has elected a Republican mayor in the last 6 of 7 elections. There are 
15,925 registered voters in East Haven. 5,683 registered Democrats, 2,544 
Republicans, 7,681 unaffiliated and 17 registered to minor parties.[17] 
The median income for a household in the town was $63,136. About 7.8% of 
the population were below the poverty line.[15] 44% of the adult population 
(25 years and old) possess a high school diploma, 6% have associate degrees, 
and 19% have bachelor's degree or higher.[16] Quinnipiac River in East 
Haven, 1907]] According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has 
a total area of 39.9 square miles (103.3 km²), of which 39.0 square miles 
(101.1 km²) is land and 0.9 square miles (2.2 km²), or 2.16%, is water. 
The town of East Haven sits astride the Quinnipiac River in southeastern 
New Haven County. It is 5 miles (8 km) south of Northford and about 13 
miles (21 km) north of New Haven. Towns bordering East Haven are Durham, 
Branford, Meriden, Middlefield, North Branford and North Haven. Situated 
in the East Haven is traversed by U.S. Route 1, Interstate 91, and State 
Highways Route 100, Route 17, Route 80 East Haven has a labor force of 
16,751. 15,128 are employed and 1,623 are not. East Haven has an unemployment 
rate of 9.7%. There are 527 work units in East Haven, employing 6,260 staff 
members.[16] There were 25 registered sex offenders living in East Haven 
as of December 2012.[18] When the town was incorporated in 1785, the system 
of government was that of selectmen and town meeting. When elections are 
held, the three people with the most votes were elected selectmen. The 
person with the most votes became the first selectman. Over the years the 
number of selectmen was increased with population growth, reaching seven 
during the 1950s. In 1960, the town changed to a system of selectmen – 
representative town meeting. This system of government lasted until 1969, 
when the town charter was changed to a mayor – town council based government. 
The mayor is elected to two-year terms. In the 1969 general election, Francis 
W. Messina was elected as the first mayor of East Haven, having been the 
incumbent first selectman. In the early 21st century, the Town Council 
has 15 members. The short mayoral term can make it difficult for politicians 
to achieve longer term goals. There have been two long-serving mayors who 
were repeatedly re-elected. Democrat Anthony Proto was elected in 1975 
and served until 1985 with repeated re-elections. Beginning in the late 
1990s, Republican Joe Maturo, Jr. served as mayor for a decade, being repeatedly 
re-elected to the two-year terms, serving from 1997 to 2007. In 1998 he 
appointed Leonard Gallo as Police Chief, who served until January 2012.[3] 
Maturo was defeated on November 6, 2007 by Democratic challenger, April 
Capone Almon, by an apparent 21 votes. The slim margin of victory forced 
an automatic recount, and two were required. On November 14, 2007, Capone 
Almon was certified as the winner over Maturo by 25 votes. She was the 
first female mayor of East Haven and the youngest at age 32.[19] She was 
re-elected in 2009, serving for two terms. After receiving a preliminary 
report in 2010 of a Department of Justice investigation of police department 
mistreatment of Latino residents, she put Police Chief Gallo on administrative 
leave pending completion of the investigation. That year a separate class 
action civil rights suit was filed on behalf of Latino residents against 
the city by Yale Law School’s Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, 
naming 20 defendants, most with the police department.[20] Former mayor 
Joe Maturo had defeated incumbent mayor Almon on November 8, 2011, by an 
apparent 31 votes. The slim margin of victory forced an automatic recount. 
On November 12, 2011, Maturo was certified as the winner over Almon by 
34 votes. By winning a sixth term, Maturo became the longest-serving mayor 
in the town's history. He reinstated Gallo. DOJ submitted its final report 
to the city in December 2011, detailing a pattern of harassment against 
Latinos. Four officers were arrested on January 24, 2010 under the Department 
of Justice criminal investigation, charged with harassing Latinos. Police 
Chief Gallo was allowed to resign in late January 2012.[3] Two of the officers 
pleaded guilty in 2012, and two were convicted at trial in 2013, being 
sentenced in 2014 to varying terms in prison. In 2013, Maturo defeated 
Jack Stacey to earn a seventh term. Based on the separate 2010 class action 
civil rights suit, the city reached a settlement in June 2014 to pay $450,000 
to the Latino class members and change immigration enforcement to clearly 
separate it from regular policing. The city "will no longer detain undocumented 
people for immigration authorities unless they have a judge-signed criminal 
warrant."[20] The city admitted no wrongdoing. The 2006 Mill Rate was 30.95. 
Total revenue in 2010 was $76,940,939.00 with total expenditures of $78,565,834.00. 
Total Indebtedness was $52,789,047. Moody's Bond rating (2009) for the 
town was Baa1.[16][21] The East Haven Police Department employs over 50 
uniformed officers. Crime rose in 2010, but the town's crime index still 
remains at half the national average.[citation needed] Since the late 20th 
century, the department has been the center of incidents related to racial 
harassment and profiling of minorities. In 1997, an East Haven police officer, 
Sergeant Robert Flodquist, was accused of using excessive force in a police 
action which killed Malik Jones, an African-American suspect. Subsequently 
state and federal prosecutors failed to find enough evidence for criminal 
charges against Flodquist. His shooting of Jones was ruled justified; Flodquist 
testified in the investigation that Jones tried to run him over.[22][23] 
Police Chief Leonard Gallo, who had been hired in 1998 from New Haven by 
Mayor Joseph A. Maturo, Jr., appointed Flodquist as the department's public 
spokesman.[24][25] Neither the family nor civil rights activists were satisfied 
with the failure by the state and federal government to prosecute in the 
Jones case. Activists have used the case "to argue successfully for new 
state legislation aimed at limiting racial profiling" by local and state 
police departments.[26] The Jones family filed a civil suit in US District 
Court, saying that Malik Jones civil rights were violated and seeking damages. 
In July 2003 a federal jury ruled in their favor and awarded them $2.5 
million in punitive damages.[23][26] Because in such a case the city was 
not liable for punitive damages, another hearing was held to settle whether 
there should be compensatory damages; the award was reduced in October 
2010 to $900,000. The East Haven city attorney said the town intended to 
appeal this decision.[26] Separately, in September 2009, the U.S. Department 
of Justice (DOJ) began investigating the East Haven Police for racial profiling 
and harassment of Latinos following the "unwarranted arrest" of Father 
Paul Manship, a Catholic priest who was trying to study complaints by Latino 
parishioners that they were victims of police discrimination.[3] That year 
the police arrested Mayor April Capone Almon and her assistant for allegedly 
interfering with a ticketing action at the beach. The DOJ investigation 
later reported having found that records related to Capone Almon's arrest 
and that of Manship had been altered numerous times.[25] With civil and 
criminal investigations underway, DOJ issued a preliminary report to the 
city in 2010, saying that the police appeared to have a pattern of discrimination 
and harassment against Latinos. Mayor April Capone Almon put Police Chief 
Leonard Gallo (in office since 1998) on administrative leave until the 
investigation was concluded.[3] After Joseph A. Maturo, Jr. was elected 
as mayor in November 2011, he reinstated Gallo. On his first day, the police 
chief barred police commission members, who were investigating an officer 
about whom they had received complaints, from police headquarters and the 
parking lot without his permission. A few days later, the commission established 
a policy requiring its members be given free access to the police headquarters 
and any members of the department. The Department of Justice submitted 
its "scathing" final report of the civil investigation to the city in December 
2011, saying the police department had shown a pattern of discrimination 
against Latinos, and Gallo had "resisted efforts to root out problems."[3] 
Its report concluded that "EHPD has engaged in a pattern or practice of 
discrimination against Latinos, a violation of the Constitution and federal 
law."[27] On January 24, 2012, Sergeant John Miller and three officers 
were arrested by the FBI on a ten-count indictment, on charges of conspiracy, 
false arrest, and excessive force and obstruction of justice in connection 
with the investigation. A local businessman had complained to the mayor's 
office that the officers stopped his employees to check their documentation 
as they entered and left his place of business. Numerous other charges 
were detailed in the indictment.[28] Numerous other complaints had been 
collected.[26] Press reports indicated a suspicion among the investigators 
that the chief of the department, Leonard Gallo, was involved in obstructing 
justice[29] and had tried to hinder the investigation. Several other East 
Haven officers attended the arraignment to show support. Mayor Joseph Maturo 
and the police union also stood by the officers pending results of prosecution. 
The government asked that Officer Dennis Spaulding be barred from entering 
the town for fear he would intimidate possible witnesses; officer Zullo 
was also barred from the town until the cases were resolved.[30] Police 
Chief Leonard Gallo was allowed to resign in late January 2012.[3] In September 
2012, Miller pleaded guilty to having struck a handcuffed person. In October
