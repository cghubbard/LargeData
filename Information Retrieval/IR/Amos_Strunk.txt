Amos Aaron Strunk (January 22, 1889 – July 22, 1979) was a center fielder 
who played in Major League Baseball from 1908 through 1924. A member of 
four World Series champion teams, Strunk batted and threw left-handed. 
He was born in Philadelphia. A dependable and speedy player, both on the 
basepaths and in the field, Strunk was scouted and signed by Philadelphia 
Athletics' manager Connie Mack, who did not hesitate to call him "the most 
underrated outfielder in baseball". Strunk reached the majors in 1908 with 
the Athletics, spending nine years with them before moving to the Boston 
Red Sox (1918–19), and played again for Philadelphia (1919–20) and in parts 
of four seasons with the Chicago White Sox (1920–23). Then, he returned 
with the Athletics in 1924, his last major league season. Five times he 
led American League outfielders in fielding percentage, and played in five 
World Series with the Athletics (1910–11, 1913–14) and Red Sox (1918). 
In a 17-season career, Strunk was a .284 hitter (1418-for-4999) with 15 
home runs and 530 RBI in 1512 games played, including 696 runs, 213 doubles, 
96 triples and 185 stolen bases. Following his baseball career, Strunk 
spent fifty years in the insurance business. He died in Llanerch, Pennsylvania,
