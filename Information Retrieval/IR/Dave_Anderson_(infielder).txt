David Carter Anderson (born August 1, 1960) is a former shortstop/third 
baseman in Major League Baseball who played for the Los Angeles Dodgers 
(1983–89, 1992) and San Francisco Giants (1990–91).[1] Anderson made his 
Major League debut on May 8, 1983, and played his final game on October 
3, 1992.[1] He was a member of the Dodgers team that won the 1988 World 
Series. In Game One of the series, he was on-deck as a decoy to pinch-hit 
for the pitcher before manager Tommy Lasorda brought in the injured Kirk 
Gibson, who went on to win the game with one of the most dramatic home 
runs in World Series history.[2][3][4] Anderson was the manager for the 
1994 Jamestown Jammers of the single A short season New York–Penn League.[5] 
He led the team to a 42–32 record finishing in first place in the Stedler 
Division and losing in the playoff semi-final round to the New Jersey Cardinals.[6] 
He managed throughout the Tigers chain until partially into the 2000 season, 
when he re-signed to coach at his alma mater, the University Of Memphis.[7] 
In 2007, he led the Texas Rangers' AA affiliate, the Frisco RoughRiders 
of the Texas League, to an 85-55 record, ultimately bowing out in the first 
round of the playoffs.[7] On the big league level, Anderson was most recently 
the first base coach for the Texas Rangers, where he was relieved of his 
duties in October 2013. On September 5, 2010, Anderson was involved in 
a controversial play at Target Field. As the Rangers attempted a 2-out 
rally against the Minnesota Twins, Vladimir Guerrero hit a soft grounder 
up the middle. Anderson appeared to make incidental contact with Michael 
Young, who was attempting to retreat to the third base bag to beat a throw 
from Orlando Hudson. Third base umpire Alfonso Márquez called Young out 
for coach's interference, ending the game in a 6–5 Rangers loss.[8] Anderson 
and Young both claimed that they never touched each other, and argued to 
no avail.[9] In April 2011, as the Rangers third-base coach, Anderson encouraged 
Josh Hamilton to tag up and score on a foul pop up in the first inning 
of a game against the Detroit Tigers, after noticing nobody was covering 
the plate. Tigers catcher Victor Martinez was able to return in time to 
apply a tag to a sliding Hamilton, resulting in a small fracture of Hamilton's 
humerus. After the game, Hamilton referred to the play as 'stupid' and 
'dumb' before apologizing to Anderson days later.[10] Anderson returning 
to managing in 2015, serving as the manager of the Salt Lake Bees, the
