Michael Allen Marshall (born January 12, 1960 in Libertyville, Illinois) 
is a former professional baseball outfielder. He played all or part of 
eleven seasons in Major League Baseball, from 1981 to 1991. He played for 
the Los Angeles Dodgers and New York Mets, both of the National League, 
and the Boston Red Sox and California Angels, both of the American League. 
He also played one season in Nippon Professional Baseball for the Nippon 
Ham Fighters in 1992. Marshall served as president and general manager 
of the Chico Outlaws of the North American League. Marshall is now commissioner 
of the Pacific Association of Professional Baseball Clubs. During the course 
of his career, Marshall played first base, third base, outfield and designated 
hitter. As a minor league player, Marshall showed considerable promise. 
He had 24 home runs and 22 steals for Class-A Lodi in the Cal League in 
1979.[1] He won the league's Triple Crown in 1981, when he hit .373 with 
34 homers, 21 stolen bases, and 137 RBIs for the Albuquerque Dukes, a Triple 
A club in the Pacific Coast League.[1] He is one of only two LA Dodger 
minor leaguers to have two 20/20 minor league seasons (Joc Pederson did 
it in 2013 and 2014).[1] In his first major league at bat against the San 
Francisco Giants in September 1981, he smashed a line drive over the right 
field wall at Dodger Stadium that bounced sharply off a stairwell and back 
onto the field. Jack Clark, playing right field, quickly picked up the 
ball and threw it back to the infield; due to the speed and trajectory 
of the ball, and Clark's routine actions, the umpires ruled it a double. 
Clark apparently admitted to Marshall later that it was a homer.[citation

has two World Series rings from the Dodgers' 1981 and 1988 World Series,
