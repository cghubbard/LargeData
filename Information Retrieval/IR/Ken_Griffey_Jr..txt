George Kenneth "Ken" Griffey Jr. (born November 21, 1969) nicknamed "Junior" 
and "The Kid", is an American former professional baseball outfielder who 
played 22 years in Major League Baseball (MLB). He spent most of his career 
with the Seattle Mariners and Cincinnati Reds, along with a short stint 
with the Chicago White Sox. A 13-time All-Star, Griffey is one of the most 
prolific home run hitters in baseball history; his 630 home runs rank as 
the sixth-most in MLB history. Griffey was also an exceptional defender 
and won 10 Gold Glove Awards in center field. He is tied for the record 
of most consecutive games with a home run (8 games, with Don Mattingly 
and Dale Long).[1] Although popular with fans around the league, Griffey 
was unable to shake reports of his petulant demeanor throughout his major 
league baseball career.[2][3][4] Griffey signed lucrative deals with companies 
of international prominence like Nike and Nintendo; his popularity reflected 
well upon MLB and is credited by some[5][6] with helping restore its image 
after the 1994 labor dispute. Griffey is one of only 29 players in baseball 
history to date to have appeared in Major League games in four different 
calendar decades. Following his playing career, Griffey joined the Mariners' 
front office as a special consultant.[7] He was inducted into both the 
Mariners' Hall of Fame[8] and the Reds Hall of Fame.[9] In 2016, Griffey 
was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame, receiving a record 99.32 percent 
of the vote, breaking pitcher Tom Seaver's record of 98.84 percent.[10] 
He is the son of former MLB player Ken Griffey Sr. Griffey was born in 
Donora, Pennsylvania, on November 21, 1969. His family moved to Cincinnati, 
Ohio, where his father, Ken Griffey Sr., played for the Cincinnati Reds, 
when Ken Jr. was six years old.[citation needed] Ken Jr. was in the clubhouse 
during his father's back-to-back championships in the 1975 and 1976 World 
Series. As a young child, Ken Sr. would instill in his son the pride of 
a team accomplishment rather than the individual performance. "My dad would 
have bopped me on the head when I was a kid if I came home bragging about 
what I did on the field. He only wanted to know what the team did." He 
attended Archbishop Moeller High School[11] in Cincinnati (the same high 
school as his future teammate Barry Larkin),[12] where he was the U.S high 
school baseball player of the year in 1987. In 1987, Griffey was selected 
with the first overall pick of that year's amateur draft by the Seattle 
Mariners. In his eleven seasons with Seattle (1989–1999) Griffey established 
himself as one of the most prolific and exciting players of the era, racking 
up 1,752 hits, 398 home runs, 1,152 RBIs, and 167 stolen bases. He led 
the American League in home runs for four seasons (1994, 1997, 1998, and 
1999), was voted the A.L. MVP in 1997, and maintained a .297 career batting 
average. In his first major league at-bat, he doubled.[13] His defense 
in center field was widely considered the standard of elite fielding during 
the decade, exemplified by his streak of 10 straight Gold Gloves from 1990–1999. 
His impressive range allowed frequent spectacular diving plays, and he 
often dazzled fans with over-the-shoulder basket catches and robbed opposing 
hitters of home runs by leaping up and pulling them back into the field 
of play. He was featured on the Wheaties cereal box and had his own signature 
sneaker line from Nike, Inc.. On April 3, 1989, in his very first MLB plate 
appearance, Griffey hit a line drive double off Oakland Athletics pitcher 
Dave Stewart at the Oakland Coliseum.[14] One week later in his first at-bat 
at the Kingdome, Griffey hit his first major league home run.[15] Griffey 
was a frequent participant in the All-Star Game during the 1990s. He led 
his league multiple times in different hitting categories.[16] In 1990 
and 1991, Griffey and his father became the first son and father to play 
on the same team at the same time. In his father's first game as a Mariner, 
on August 31, 1990, the pair hit back-to-back singles in the first inning 
and both scored.[17] On September 14, the pair hit back-to-back home runs 
in the top of the first off California Angels pitcher Kirk McCaskill, becoming 
the first father-son duo to hit back-to-back home runs.[18] The duo played 
a total of 51 games together before Griffey Sr. retired in June 1991. At 
the MLB Home Run Derby in 1993, which was held at Oriole Park in Baltimore, 
Griffey hit the warehouse beyond the right field wall on the fly and he 
is still the only player ever to do so. As with every home run that hits 
Eutaw Street, each feat is honored with a circular plaque, embedded horizontally 
onto the concourse's walkway, in the exact spot where the home run landed.[19][20] 
In 1994, he led the league in voting for All Star game selection. That 
season, which ended prematurely on August 12 due to the labor dispute, 
saw Griffey hit 30 home runs in the Mariners' first 65 games. He would 
go on to have 4 multi-home run games that year. While his pace cooled somewhat 
in the final eight weeks of the season (he only hit 10 home runs in the 
Mariners' last 47 games), his 40 home runs by August 12 still put him two 
ahead of Chicago's Frank Thomas and four ahead of Cleveland's Albert Belle 
for the AL lead. One of the most memorable moments of Griffey's career 
with the Mariners came during the 1995 American League Division Series 
(ALDS) against the New York Yankees. After losing the first two games, 
the Mariners and Griffey were on the verge of elimination, but came back 
to win the next two games, setting up a decisive fifth game. In the bottom 
of the 11th inning of Game 5, with Griffey on first base, teammate Edgar 
Martínez hit a double. Griffey raced around the bases, slid into home with 
the winning run, and popped up into the waiting arms of the entire team. 
The 1995 AL Division Series would kick off a brief rivalry between the 
Yankees and the Mariners. Griffey may have escalated it by saying that 
he would never play for the Yankees, because the Yankees allegedly treated 
his father, Ken Griffey Sr. badly. Also, when Griffey was a kid visiting 
his dad in the Yankee clubhouse, Yankee manager Billy Martin would, believing 
that children did not belong in the clubhouse, kick him out of there. Although 
the Mariners subsequently lost the ALCS to the Cleveland Indians (managed 
by later Mariners manager Mike Hargrove), that moment remains one of the 
most memorable in Mariners history, capping a season that "saved baseball 
in Seattle",[21][22] Seattle's improbable late season playoff run that 
year, spurred by the return of Griffey from injury, led to the construction 
of Safeco Field and the future security of a franchise rumored for years 
to be on the move.[13] The play also inspired the title of the video game 
Ken Griffey Jr.'s Winning Run for the Super NES. In 1997, Griffey led the 
Mariners to the AL West crown and captured the American League Most Valuable 
Player Award, hitting .304, with 56 home runs and 147 RBIs. The next season, 
1998, was a season which was followed closely by the national media as 
both Griffey and Mark McGwire entered the summer ahead of the pace of Roger 
Maris' home run record of 61. Despite Griffey falling short, Major League 
Baseball put forth an effort to draw a new set of young fans and regain 
those disenchanted by the 1994 strike focused on McGwire, Sosa, and Griffey's 
pursuit of Maris' record. Griffey, however, fell out of the spotlight due 
to some nagging injuries and was surpassed by Chicago Cubs slugger Sammy 
Sosa, who finished with 66 home runs, himself falling short of McGwire's 
then record 70. Despite falling out of the record chase, Griffey nearly 
duplicated his 1997 statistics, finishing with 56 home runs and 146 RBI. 
In 1999, he ranked 93rd on The Sporting News' list of the 100 Greatest 
Baseball Players.[23] This list was compiled during the 1998 season, counting 
only statistics through 1997. At age 29 (going on 30), he was the youngest 
player on the list. That same year, Griffey was elected to the Major League 
Baseball All-Century Team. However, when TSN updated their list for a new 
book in 2005, despite having surpassed 400 and 500 home runs, Griffey remained 
at Number 93. While playing with Seattle, Griffey was a 10-time American 
League Gold Glove winner, the 1992 All-Star Game MVP, 1997 AL MVP, 1998 
ESPY co-winner for Male Athlete of the Year, 1999 Players Choice Awards 
Player of the Decade (by the players), and was named to the All-Century 
team in 1999.[24] Griffey used to live in the same neighborhood in Orlando 
as golfer Payne Stewart. After Stewart's death in a plane crash on October 
25, 1999, Griffey started expressing a desire to live closer to his relatives 
in his hometown of Cincinnati. Not only did Griffey want to live closer, 
but he wanted to be able to raise his kids, Trey and Taryn (Tevin wasn't 
born at the time). On February 10, 2000, Griffey was traded to the Reds 
for pitcher Brett Tomko, outfielder Mike Cameron, and minor leaguers Antonio 
Perez and Jake Meyer. Griffey signed a 9-year, $112.5M contract with the 
Reds after the trade was completed, with a club option for a tenth.[25] 
The 2000 season began what has generally been seen by the media as a decline 
in Griffey's superstar status. Although his statistics during this season 
were respectable, they were far below his previous level of play: in 145 
games, Griffey hit .271 with 40 home runs, but his .943 on-base plus slugging 
was his lowest mark in five years. In 2000, Griffey also changed his number 
from 24 to 30, the number his father wore while playing in both Cincinnati 
and Seattle. The number 24 was already retired in honor of Tony Pérez. 
Additionally, from 2001 through 2004, Griffey was plagued by a string of 
injuries, including season-ending injuries in 2002, 2003, and 2004.[26] 
Worse yet for Griffey, the cumulative effects of the injuries lowered his 
bat speed,[27] resulting in less power and fewer home runs (he slugged 
only .426 before succumbing to injury in 2002, his lowest output in seven 
years). Injuries forced Griffey to miss 260 out of 486 games from 2002 
through 2004, diminishing both his skills and his star reputation. In 2004, 
Griffey avoided major injury during the first half of the season, and on 
June 20 became the 20th player to hit 500 career home runs. His 500th home 
run came on Father's Day in a game against the St. Louis Cardinals at Busch 
Stadium, with his father in the stands; the homer tied Griffey with his 
father in career hits with 2,143. However, the injury bug bit again just 
before the All-Star break; he suffered a partial hamstring tear, knocking 
him out of the All-Star Game and putting him on the disabled list yet again. 
Griffey finished the 2004 season on the disabled list after suffering a 
rupture of his right hamstring in San Francisco.[28] The play in question 
occurred at AT&T Park in a game against the San Francisco Giants. Griffey 
was starting in right field for the first time in his 16-year Major League 
career when he raced toward the gap to try to cut off a ball before it 
got to the wall. He slid as he got to the ball, but in the process hyper-extended 
his right leg, tearing the hamstring completely off the bone. He later 
came out of the game, complaining of "tightness" in the hamstring exacerbated 
by chilly conditions in San Francisco.[29] However, there was far more 
to it than anyone realized at the time. Shortly after this injury, the 
Reds' team physician, Timothy Kremchek, devised an experimental surgery 
dubbed "The Junior Operation"[30] that would use three titanium screws 
to reattach Griffey's hamstring. For several weeks, Griffey's right leg 
was in a sling that kept it at a 90-degree angle, and he was not able to 
move the leg until late October. After an intense rehabilitation period, 
he returned for the 2005 season. In April, he hit .244 with one homer (on 
April 30) and nine RBIs.[31] Starting May 1, the 2005 season saw the resurgence 
of a healthy Griffey. His 35 home runs were his highest since his first 
year with the Reds as Griffey slowly moved up the career home run list. 
He ended the season tied with Mickey Mantle, after having passed Jimmie 
Foxx, Ted Williams, Willie McCovey, Ernie Banks, Eddie Mathews, Mel Ott, 
and Eddie Murray. Early in September, he strained a tendon in his left 
foot (an injury unrelated to his past hamstring and calf problems), and 
was listed as day-to-day for several weeks.[32] On September 22, with the 
Reds out of playoff contention, the team decided to bench him for the rest 
of the season so he could immediately have arthroscopic surgery on his 
left knee and a separate operation to repair scars from his 2004 hamstring 
operation. Still, his 128 games in 2005 were the most he had played since 
2000. Griffey's resurgence was recognized when he was named National League 
Comeback Player of the Year. He played in the World Baseball Classic for 
the American team that off-season with his father as a coach. Griffey batted 
.524, but the USA failed to reach the semifinals. During the second game 
of the 2006 regular season, Griffey hit home run #537, surpassing Mickey 
Mantle for 12th on the all-time list. He returned on May 11 from a knee 
injury suffered April 12, and hit a walk-off three-run home run in the 
bottom of the 11th inning against the Washington Nationals. On June 5, 
Griffey tied Fred McGriff's record by hitting a home run in his 43rd different 
ballpark, at the St. Louis Cardinals' Busch Stadium.[33] On June 19, Griffey 
hit career home run 548, tying him with Mike Schmidt, and then six days 
later passed Schmidt with 549. On June 27, he hit his 550th career home 
run against the Kansas City Royals. On September 25, 2006, Griffey hit 
his 27th home run of the season against Chicago Cubs relief pitcher Scott 
Eyre to tie Reggie Jackson for tenth on the all time home run list. Griffey's 
injuries continued in the 2006 off-season. While on holiday in the Bahamas 
with his family, he broke his wrist.[26] Griffey said his hand felt fine 
and he expected to be ready to go for 2007 spring training.[34] At the 
beginning of the 2007 Major League Baseball season, Ryan Freel took over 
center field for the Reds, and Griffey Jr. was moved to right field. Reds 
manager Jerry Narron said that "I've got to do everything I can do to put 
our best club out there. My feeling is that with Ryan Freel out there, 
it gives us strong defense up the middle."[35] Griffey changed his number 
from 30 to 3 to honor his three children.[36] During the next two seasons, 
Griffey would wear number 42 on April 15, beginning a tradition known as 
Jackie Robinson Day.[37] On May 10, 2007, Griffey hit his sixth home run 
of the season and the 569th of his career, tying Rafael Palmeiro for ninth 
place on the career home runs list. He passed Palmeiro on May 13. Griffey 
tied Harmon Killebrew for eighth on the all-time list hitting his 573rd 
career home run on May 22. He then surpassed him on May 25. On June 22, 
2007, Griffey made his first return to Seattle after his trade to the Reds. 
Before the game, the Mariners honored him with a 15-minute presentation 
which included a highlight reel of his playing career with the Mariners, 
a presentation of a "The House that Griffey Built" memorial by Mariners 
hall-of-famers and former teammates Jay Buhner and Edgar Martínez, and 
a 4-minute standing ovation from the sold-out crowd.[38] Griffey did not 
expect such a welcome or a turnout by fans when he came back, and a short 
but emotional speech was given by Griffey afterwards.[39] Many of the fans 
in attendance made signs professing their gratitude and adoration toward 
him with quotes such as: "The House that Griffey Built", "Seattle Junior", 
and "Griffey we miss you."[39] Griffey went 1–5 in the game. On June 24, 
Griffey hit his 583rd and 584th career home runs, tying and passing Mark 
McGwire for 7th place on the all-time career home run list. "Wow. Never 
did I imagine that it would be like this coming back. I spent 11 years 
here, 11 wonderful years here. ... This place will be [my] home. ... I 
didn't realize how much I missed being in Seattle." Following the Cincinnati 
Reds versus Seattle Mariners series from June 22–24, 2007, a fan movement 
emerged petitioning Mariners' management to bring Griffey back. Over 1,900 
signatures were collected on a fan vid-blog/petition.[41] Griffey received 
the most votes of any player in the National League for the 2007 All-Star 
balloting and on the July 10 game, he went on to drive in two runs for 
the National League. On July 16, 2007, Ken Griffey Jr. hit his 587th home 
run to pass Frank Robinson for 6th place on the all-time home run list. 
On July 18, 2007, Griffey hit his 2,500th hit, a first-inning single off 
Atlanta Braves starting pitcher John Smoltz. On September 19, 2007, in 
a game against the Chicago Cubs, Griffey fielded a Derrek Lee single in 
right field, then suddenly went down in pain. The injury, first thought 
to be a lower abdominal strain, was later revealed to be a season-ending 
groin strain. This marked one of many seasons in Cincinnati in which Griffey 
had to end the year on the disabled list. Griffey ended the 2007 season 
with 593 career home runs. On August 22, 2007, Griffey was selected as 
an all-time Rawlings Gold Glove winner, on a list of nine players considered 
the greatest defensive players in the last fifty years.[42] He finished 
the season with 78 runs, 146 hits, 24 doubles, one triple, 30 home runs, 
93 RBIs, and a .277 batting average. On April 4, 2008, Ken Griffey Jr. 
passed Reggie Jackson for 16th on the all-time list after driving in his 
1,702nd RBI.[43] On June 9, Griffey hit his 600th home run on a 3–1 pitch 
from Mark Hendrickson of the Florida Marlins in the first inning at Land 
Shark Stadium in Miami. Fans of both teams gave him a standing ovation.[44] 
Despite being ranked second in the National League All-Star voting for 
outfielders for most of the first half of the season, Griffey finished 
fourth with 2,907,746 ballots, 87,000 votes behind Kosuke Fukudome. He 
was not selected to the All-Star Game as a reserve. At the All-Star Break, 
Griffey was batting .239 with 12 home runs and 42 RBIs. "I always have 
a backup plan...If you can't hit a tough lefty, bunt. If you can't hit 
a tough righty, bunt. If you can't go to the All-Star Game, go to the Bahamas", 
Griffey said.[45] On July 30, Griffey hit his 608th career home run in 
his last game for the Reds.[46] Griffey was criticized by some for his 
effort during his stint with the Reds. Gregg Doyel had this to say of the 
years Griffey was with the Reds in comparison to the 2010 Reds team. "It's 
a different Reds team than the older, beer-bellied softball teams of recent 
years. Those Reds were Ken Griffey and Adam Dunn lounging on the clubhouse's 
leather couches, hitting home runs, misplaying balls in the outfield and 
thinking they had it all figured out, when all they knew how to do was 
lose."[47] On July 31, 2008, at the MLB trade deadline, Griffey was traded 
to the Chicago White Sox in exchange for pitcher Nick Masset and infielder 
Danny Richar, ending his nine-year tenure in Cincinnati.[48] In his first 
game with the White Sox, he went 2 for 3 with 2 RBIs, a walk, and a run.[49] 
On August 20, 2008, Griffey hit his first home run as a member of the White 
Sox, off of the Mariners' R.A. Dickey, which moved him into a tie with 
former outfielder Sammy Sosa for 5th place in career home runs.[50] He 
surpassed Sosa on September 23, with one off Minnesota's Matt Guerrier.[51] 
Griffey's signature moment with the White Sox came on September 30, the 
last game of the 2008 season; an extra 163rd game between the White Sox 
and Minnesota Twins to break the tie atop the AL Central. In the 5th inning 
of the scoreless game, the Twins threatened with Michael Cuddyer on third 
and one out. Twins 3B Brendan Harris flied out softly to Griffey in center 
field, who threw a strike to White Sox catcher A. J. Pierzynski who tagged 
out Cuddyer at home in a homeplate collision to complete the double play 
and end the threat. The White Sox went on to beat the Twins, 1-0, to advance 
to the 2008 American League Division Series, where they fell to the Tampa 
Bay Rays. On October 30, 2008 the White Sox declined a $16 million option 
on Griffey, making him a free agent for the first time in his career. Griffey 
would instead receive a buyout for $4 million, split between the Reds and 
White Sox.[52] Griffey hit 18 home runs with the Reds and White Sox in 
2008.[52] When the 2008 season ended he said he wouldn't retire, saying 
"I've got things to do."[53] As a free agent, Griffey was courted by the 
Mariners and the Atlanta Braves. The national media was dubious about Griffey's 
declining skills, with the Washington Post noting "...the Mariners are 
not about to sign Griffey for baseball reasons; they're bringing him back 
to Seattle to sell tickets."[54] Griffey ultimately accepted a contract 
offer from the Mariners on February 18, 2009, after "agonizing" over the 
decision. Griffey indicated he was motivated by sentimental reasons toward 
Seattle, where he received an overwhelmingly positive reception when he 
last played there as a Cincinnati Red in June 2007, but was inclined towards 
the Braves for its proximity to his home in Orlando, Florida, and his desire 
to be with his family during the season.[55] Apparently, Griffey was very 
close to signing with the Braves; however, a premature report emerged from 
the Atlanta Journal-Constitution that an Atlanta deal was done and a conversation 
with Willie Mays and his own 13-year-old daughter played a factor in his 
choice.[56] Griffey once again sported #24 with the Mariners; the team 
had not issued the number to any player or coach in the nine years between 
his two stints in Seattle. Griffey went 1–2 with a home run in his regular 
season debut against the Minnesota Twins. The home run was Griffey's eighth 
Opening Day home run; as of 2013, he is tied with Frank Robinson and Adam 
Dunn for first place in this category. On April 15, 2009, Griffey hit his 
400th home run as a Mariner (613th of career) off of Los Angeles Angels 
pitcher Jered Weaver, becoming the first MLB player to hit 400 home runs 
with one club (Mariners) and 200 home runs with another (Reds). AP stated, 
"Griffey returned to the Mariners in 2009 and almost single-handedly transformed 
what had been a fractured, bickering clubhouse with his leadership, energy 
and constant pranks."[57] On June 23, 2009, at Safeco Field, Griffey hit 
the 5,000th home run in franchise history off of San Diego Padres pitcher 
Chad Gaudin.[58] This was Griffey's 619th career home run. On September 
1, Griffey hit career home run #621 at the new Yankee Stadium off of Yankees 
pitcher Andy Pettitte in the 6th inning. It marked the 44th different ballpark 
in which he has hit a home run. On August 12, 2009, against his former 
team, the Chicago White Sox, he hit a walk-off RBI single in the bottom 
of the 14th inning to win the game, 1–0, for the Mariners. Griffey returned 
to the Mariners for the 2010 campaign with a similar contract to that of 
2009, but struggled offensively over the first two months while posting 
a mere .184 batting average.[59] On April 27, Griffey passed Andre Dawson 
for 45th on the career hit list. On May 20, 2010, in a game against the 
Toronto Blue Jays, Griffey hit a walk-off RBI single off Blue Jays' closer 
Kevin Gregg to win the game, 4–3, for the Mariners. After starting the 
9th inning trailing 3–1, the Mariners rallied in the bottom of the 9th 
to load the bases on 2 singles and a walk, then tied the game at 3 via 
a walk and a sacrifice fly. The walk-off single was the final hit and RBI 
of Griffey's Major League Baseball career, and moved him past Rafael Palmeiro 
to 14th on the all-time RBI list. In May 2010, Mariners' manager Don Wakamatsu 
made the decision to significantly limit Griffey's playing due to his ongoing 
poor performance.[60][61] On May 10, 2010, beatwriter Larry Larue reported 
that Wakamatsu had not used Griffey in a pinch hitting situation the prior 
week, with two players stating that Griffey had been asleep.[62] National 
media quickly covered the incident, dubbed "Napgate."[61][61][63][64][65][66] 
In the ensuing days, teammate Mike Sweeney said he challenged anyone who 
said Griffey was asleep "to stand up and fight me"[67] with Wakamatsu denying 
Griffey had been asleep;[65] however, Griffey did not deny it.[60][68] 
Griffey's agent stated Larue's initial report had been posted in error 
and that Larue had asked his employer to remove it,[69] both of which they 
refuted.[70][71] In the aftermath of his report, Larue was boycotted by 
players.[65][72] On June 2, 2010, with the clubhouse still in turmoil, 
Griffey left the Mariners after the second game of a 4-game series with 
the Minnesota Twins, leaving in the middle of the night for a cross-country 
drive to his home in Florida.[73] He released a statement through the Seattle 
Mariners organization announcing his retirement effective immediately. 
Seattle Mariner president Chuck Armstrong was only made aware of this by 
Griffey's agent a few hours before gametime the next day; Griffey then 
called from the road to confirm it.[74] His retirement was announced at 
Safeco Field before the Mariners played the Twins.[75] In an interview 
on March 17, 2011, Griffey stated he had retired to avoid being a distraction 
for the team.[7] On February 17, 2011, Griffey was hired by the Mariners 
as a special consultant. He is involved with the Mariners at spring training 
and the regular season, along with visiting most of the Mariners minor-league 
affiliates.[76] On January 22, 2013, the Mariners announced Griffey would 
be the seventh person inducted into the Seattle Mariners Hall of Fame.[8] 
Griffey joined Alvin Davis (1997), Dave Niehaus (2000), Jay Buhner (2004), 
Edgar Martínez (2007), Randy Johnson (2012) and Dan Wilson (2012). He was 
formally inducted on August 10, 2013. Jamie Moyer was selected in 2015. 
A campaign had been formed to rename a section of First Avenue South, which 
runs adjacent to Safeco Field, to Ken Griffey Jr. Drive just after his 
announcement to retire from baseball. Later, the campaign changed direction 
after the death of Mariners announcer Dave Niehaus in November 2010 to 
Dave Niehaus Way South.[77] Writer Bill Simmons pointed out the prevalent 
belief that Griffey was the best home run hitter of the 1990s whom everyone 
was convinced never used PEDs. Therefore, Simmons stated Griffey was the 
one player who would be the most devastating to "an entire generation of 
American men" should he ever be linked to steroids.[78] On Sunday August 
10, 2014, Griffey Jr. was inducted into the Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame. 
Griffey Jr. returned to Cincinnati for the weekend activities and choked 
up during his speech when he mentioned wearing the same uniform as his 
dad. Second baseman Ron Oester, outfielder Dave Parker, and first baseman 
Jake Beckley joined Junior in the Class of 2014. On January 6, 2016, Griffey 
was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame, receiving 99.32 percent of the 
vote, breaking the record previously held by Tom Seaver's 98.84 percent 
in 1992.[10] A flag bearing Griffey's number 24 was flown from the Space 
Needle following the announcement.[79] To coincide with his Hall of Fame 
election, the Mariners announced on January 8, 2016 that they would retire 
his jersey number 24. The retirement took effect with the start of the 
2016 MLB season, with the formal ceremony taking place prior to the Mariners' 
August 6, 2016 game. The jersey retirement includes the number 24 also 
being taken out of circulation of all of the Mariners minor league affiliates. 
The team also honored Griffey in a unique fashion in the 2016 MLB draft, 
selecting his son Trey in the 24th round (matching his jersey number), 
even though Trey, at the time a wide receiver at the University of Arizona, 
had not played baseball since his preteen years.[80] In 2008, Griffey released 
a series of charity wines to support The Ken Griffey Jr. Family Foundation, 
a fund that supports several causes, including the Boys & Girls Clubs of 
America and several children's hospitals across the United States.[81] 
He is also an honorary co-chairman of the AOPA Foundation's Hat in the 
Ring Society, a charitable organization that promotes aviation safety and 
education.[82] In April 2007, Griffey was diagnosed with pleurisy, an inflammation 
of the lining of the cavity surrounding the lungs which can cause painful 
respiration and other symptoms.[83][84] Griffey and his wife Melissa have 
three children: Ken Griffey III (Trey), daughter Taryn Kennedy, and adopted 
son Tevin Kendall. Trey is a wide receiver on the Arizona Wildcats football 
team. Taryn also goes to the University of Arizona, playing for the women's 
basketball team.[85] The Griffey family resides in Winter Garden, Florida, 
where Ken Griffey Sr. is also a resident.[86][87] Griffey was named an 
American Public Diplomacy Envoy by then Secretary of State Condoleezza 
Rice on November 18, 2008.[88] Griffey has a private pilot certificate 
and owns a Cirrus SR22.[89] In January 1988, Griffey, at the age of 18, 
attempted to commit suicide by swallowing 277 aspirin pills but wound up 
in intensive care in Providence Hospital in Mount Airy, Ohio.[90] Griffey 
Jr. cited arguments with his father, Ken Griffey Sr.; depression; and anger 
as reasons for his attempted suicide.[91] On his failed attempt, Griffey 
Jr. stated, "It seemed like everyone was yelling at me in baseball, then 
I came home and everyone was yelling at me there. I got depressed. I got 
angry. I didn't want to live."[91] He stated that he had also previously 
contemplated taking his own life, but he had not acted on it until this 
incident.[91] After Griffey swallowed the aspirin, his girlfriend's mother 
drove him to the hospital.[91] While in intensive care, he ripped the IV 
from his arm in order to stop an argument between him and his father.[91] 
Both Griffey Jr. and his father have stated that the incident changed their 
relationship, and there is now more understanding on both sides.[91] Italics
