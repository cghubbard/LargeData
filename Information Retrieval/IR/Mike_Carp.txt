baseball first baseman and left fielder who is currently a free agent. 
He has played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Seattle Mariners,

camp for the first time, hitting .233 in 43 at bats with the Mets. His

He made his Red Sox debut on April 7 versus the Toronto Blue Jays.[7] On 
June 4, 2013, Carp earned his first career ejection for arguing a strike 
three call made by umpire Andy Fletcher.[8] On September 11, 2013, Carp

used all their relievers. Carp pitched one inning, allowing five bases 
on balls and one earned run.[10][11] Shortly after the All-Star break, 
Carp requested that the Red Sox trade him. The request made news after 
the Red Sox traded veteran pitcher Jake Peavy to the San Francisco Giants 
on July 26.[12] Carp was designated for assignment by the Red Sox on August 
1.[13] Carp was claimed on waivers by the Texas Rangers on August 3, 2014.[14]
