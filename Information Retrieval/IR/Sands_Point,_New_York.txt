Sands Point is a village located at the northernmost tip of the Cow Neck 
Peninsula on the North Shore of Long Island in Nassau County, New York, 
United States. The Incorporated Village of Sands Point lies within the 
town of North Hempstead. The population was 2,675 at the 2010 census. The 
village was incorporated in 1910. In 1917, the village absorbed the communities 
of Barkers Point and Motts Point. It was originally owned by three families, 
the Sands, Vanderbilts, and Cornwells. In 1917 Daniel Guggenheim bought 
his 216-acre (0.87 km2) Hempstead House, formerly Castle Gould. His son 
Harry Guggenheim, founder of Newsday, later erected his estate "Falaise" 
nearby in 1923. Today, the estate belongs to the Friends of the Sands Point 
Preserve, which is a non for profit organization that maintains the property. 
In the 1960s, under less strict building codes, many homes were built on 
1-acre (4,000 m2) parcels. Current zoning allows subdivisions of 2 acres 
(8,100 m2) or more. The Sands Family Cemetery was added to the National 
Register of Historic Places in 1992.[1] Sands Point is bordered almost 
entirely by water - Long Island Sound to the north, Manhasset Bay to the 
west and Hempstead Harbor on the east. It shares land borders with the 
villages of Port Washington, Port Washington North, Manorhaven, and Soundview.

line, including 0.0% of those under age 18 and 0.0% of those age 65 or 
over. In F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby (1925), Sands Point (Port 
Washington/Manhasset neck) was referred to as "East Egg". East Egg residents 
inherited their fortunes and were more highly respected than the nouveau 
riche in newer "West Egg" (Great Neck/Kings Point), because Sands Point 
had "old money". The story's fictional Buchanans lived in the western part 
of Sands Point. Reports incorrectly suggest[6] that Fitzgerald – while 
he was a guest at the mansion of Herbert Bayard Swope on Hoffstot Lane, 
at Prospect Point in Sands Point 40°52′08″N 73°42′51″W﻿ / ﻿40.868887°N 
73.714147°W﻿ / 40.868887; -73.714147 – used the site and its parties as 
his inspiration for the fictional Buchanan home in East Egg. The home may 
have served as one of the many inspirations, as Fitzgerald did likely visit 
it during his time living in Great Neck (1922–24), but not as a guest of 
Swope's. Fitzgerald left Great Neck for Paris in 1924, prior to Swope's 
buying that mansion. The likely story with regard to Swope is that Fitzgerald 
and his good friend Ring Lardner would observe many parties held at the 
home Swope was residing in during the time Fitzgerald was actually living 
in the area. This Swope residence was adjacent to Lardner's home on Shore 
Road in Great Neck, and is not extant, though Lardner's mansion is still 
standing. Another Sands Point mansion, situated next to the Sands Point 
Light and across a shallow bay from Prospect Point, was Beacon Towers. 
Scholars believe it served as one of the many inspirations for Jay Gatsby's 
mansion in the novel, though Gatsby lived on the eastern side of Kings 
Point, in the book. The extravagant Gothic-style residence was built by 
Alva Belmont, formerly Alva Vanderbilt, in 1918. It was demolished in 1945.[7]
