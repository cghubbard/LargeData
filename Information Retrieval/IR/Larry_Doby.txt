Negro leagues Major League Baseball Nippon Professional Baseball As manager 
Lawrence Eugene Doby (December 13, 1923 – June 18, 2003) was an American 
professional baseball player in the Negro leagues and Major League Baseball 
(MLB) who was the second black player to break baseball's color barrier. 
A native of Camden, South Carolina and three-sport all-state athlete while 
in high school in Paterson, New Jersey, Doby accepted a basketball scholarship 
from Long Island University. At 17 years of age, he began his professionall 
baseball career with the Newark Eagles as the team's second baseman. Doby 
joined the United States Navy during World War II. His military service 
complete, Doby returned to baseball in 1946, and along with teammate Monte 
Irvin, helped the Eagles win the Negro League World Series. In July 1947, 
three months after Jackie Robinson, Doby broke the MLB color barrier in 
the American League when he signed a contract to play with Bill Veeck's 
Cleveland Indians. Doby was the first player to go directly to the majors 
from the Negro leagues. A seven-time All-Star center fielder, Doby and 
teammate Satchel Paige were the first African-American players to win a 
World Series championship when the Indians won in 1948. He helped the Indians 
win a franchise-record 111 games and the AL pennant in 1954, finished second 
in the AL Most Valuable Player (MVP) award voting and was the AL's RBI 
leader and home run champion. He went on to play for the Chicago White 
Sox, Detroit Tigers, and Chunichi Dragons before his retirement as a player 
in 1962. Doby later served as the second black manager in the majors with 
the Chicago White Sox, and in 1995 was appointed to a position in the AL's 
executive office. He also served as a director with the New Jersey Nets 
of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He was selected to the National 
Baseball Hall of Fame in 1998 by the Hall's Veterans Committee and died 
in 2003 at the age of 79. Doby was born in Camden, South Carolina, to David 
Doby and Etta Brooks.[1]:p.7 Doby's father served in World War I. He worked 
as a horse groomer and played semi-pro baseball, but drowned in an accident 
at age 37 in New York state.[1]:p.9[2] Doby's mother, who had divorced 
David before his death, moved to Paterson, New Jersey; Doby remained in 
Camden. He lived with his grandmother before moving to live with his father's 
sister and brother-in-law from 1934 to 1938.[1]:p.10 He attended Jackson 
School, which was segregated under South Carolina state law. His first 
opportunity to play organized baseball came as a student at Browning Home-Mather 
Academy, a private school affiliated with the Methodist church. Richard 
Dubose, who had managed Doby's father and was known locally in African-American 
circles for his baseball expertise, gave Doby some of his first baseball 
lessons.[1]:p.59 Reflecting on his years growing up in South Carolina, 
including how he and playmates used worn down broom handles for bats, Doby 
said, "Growing up in Camden, we didn't have baseball bats. We'd use a tree 
here, a tin can there, for bases."[3] After completing eighth grade, Doby 
moved north to Paterson at the age of 14 to be reunited with his mother; 
she visited him weekly while he lived with one of her friends.[1]:p.11[4]:p.30 
At Paterson Eastside High School, Doby was a multi-sport athlete; as well 
as playing baseball and basketball, he was a wide receiver in football 
and lettered in track. After winning a state football championship, the 
Eastside team was invited to play in Florida, but the promoters would not 
allow Doby, the only black player on the team, to participate. Consequently, 
the team voted to forgo the trip as a gesture of support for Doby.[5]:p.31 
During summer vacation Doby played baseball with a black semi-pro team, 
the Smart Sets, where he played with future Hall of Fame shortstop Monte 
Irvin.[1]:p.15 He also had a brief stint with the Harlem Renaissance, a 
professional basketball team, as an unpaid substitute player.[4]:p.30 Upon 
completing high school, he accepted an athletic scholarship to play basketball 
at Long Island University (LIU).[1]:p.23[6] Doby had been dating Eastside 
classmate Helyn Curvy since his sophomore year and, according to Doby, 
being able to remain close to Paterson was the "main reason" he selected 
LIU.[1]:p.23 In the summer before he enrolled at LIU, Doby accepted an 
offer to play for the Newark Eagles of the Negro National League (NNL) 
for the remainder of the 1942 season,[1]:p.19[7]:p.83 and he transferred 
to Virginia Union University as a result.[8]:p.98 A Negro league umpire, 
Henry Moore, advised Newark Eagles' owners Abe and Effa Manley to give 
Doby a tryout at Hinchliffe Stadium in Paterson, which was successful; 
Doby joined the Eagles in 1942 at the age of 17 for $300.[1]:p.20 The contract 
stated Doby would play until September when he would start classes at college; 
to protect his amateur status he signed using the alias "Larry Walker" 
and local reporters were told he originated from Los Angeles, California.[1]:p.20 
On May 31, Doby appeared in his first professional game when the Eagles 
played against the New York Cubans at Yankee Stadium.[4]:p.19[7]:p.83 In 
the 26 games where box scores have been found, Doby's batting average was 
.391.[1]:p.20 Doby recalled a game against catcher Josh Gibson and pitcher 
Ray Brown of the Homestead Grays: Doby's career in Newark was interrupted 
for two years for service in the United States Navy. Doby spent 1943 and 
part of 1944 at Camp Robert Smalls at the Great Lakes Naval Training School 
near Chicago.[10]:p.68 He appeared on an all-black baseball squad and maintained 
a .342 batting average against teams composed of white players, some of 
which featured major leaguers.[11] He then went to Treasure Island Naval 
Base in San Francisco Bay, California. Before serving in the Pacific Theater 
of World War II, Doby spent time at Navy sites in Ogden, Utah and San Diego, 
California. He was stationed on Ulithi in the Pacific Ocean in 1945. Doby 
heard of Jackie Robinson's minor league contract deal with the Montreal 
Royals of the International League from his base on Ulithi listening to 
Armed Forces Radio, and as a result Doby saw real hope in becoming a professional 
baseball player.[4]:p.31 While in Hawaii, Doby met fellow Navy man and 
future teammate Mickey Vernon.[12] Vernon, then with the Washington Senators, 
was so impressed with Doby's skills he wrote to Senators owner Clark Griffith, 
encouraging Griffith to sign Doby should the MLB ever allow integration.[13] 
During his time in the Navy, Doby was described by his colleagues as quiet.[10]:p.71 
Doby was discharged from the Navy in January 1946.[4]:p.57 In the summer 
of that year, Doby and Helyn Curvy were married.[1]:p.33 After playing 
for the San Juan Senators in Puerto Rico, Doby rejoined the Eagles in 1946.[14] 
He made the All-Star roster, batted .360 (fourth in the NNL), hit five 
home runs (fifth) and led the NNL in triples (six).[15] Manager Biz Mackey 
led the Eagles, including Doby, Monte Irvin and Johnny Davis, to the Negro 
World Series championship over Satchel Paige and the Kansas City Monarchs 
in seven games to conclude the 1946 season. For the Series, Doby hit .372 
with one home run, five RBIs, and three stolen bases.[4]:p.31 Many in the 
Negro leagues believed Doby or Irvin would be first to break the MLB color 
barrier, not Robinson.[16] On considering a career in the MLB, Doby said, 
"I never dreamed that far ahead. Growing up in a segregated society, you 
couldn't have thought that that was the way it was going to be. There was 
no bright spot as far as looking at baseball until Mr. Robinson got the 
opportunity to play in Montreal in '46."[16] Cleveland Indians owner and 
team president Bill Veeck proposed integrating baseball in 1942, which 
had been informally segregated since the turn of the century, but this 
was rejected by Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis.[1]:p.19 Veeck had 
begun the process of finding a young, talented player from the Negro leagues, 
and told a reporter in Cleveland that he would integrate the Indians' roster 
if he could find a black player with the necessary talent level who could 
withstand the taunts and pressure of being the first black athlete in the 
AL. The reporter suggested Doby, of whom Veeck had seen at the Great Lakes 
Naval Training School. Doby's name was also mentioned when Veeck talked 
with reporters who covered the Negro leagues.[11]:p.4 Indians scout Bill 
Killefer rated Doby favorably and perhaps just as important for Veeck, 
reported Doby's off-field behavior was not a concern.[17] The Dodgers rated 
Doby their top young Negro league prospect.[11]:p.4 But unlike the Brooklyn 
Dodgers' Branch Rickey, who signed Robinson one full season before bringing 
him to the National League, Veeck used a different strategy, letting Doby 
remain with the Eagles instead of bringing him through the Indians' farm 
system. He told the Pittsburgh Courier, "One afternoon when the team trots 
out on the field, a Negro player will be out there with it."[11]:p.4 While 
Rickey declined to pay for the purchasing rights of Robinson while he played 
for the Kansas City Monarchs, Veeck was "determined to buy Doby's contract 
from the Eagles" and had no problem paying purchasing rights.[18]:p.37 
Effa Manley, business manager for the Eagles, believed her club's close 
relationship with the New York Yankees might put Doby in a Yankees uniform, 
but they did not take interest in him. Veeck finalized a contract deal 
for Doby with Manley on July 3. Veeck paid her a total of $15,000 for her 
second baseman—$10,000 for taking him from the Eagles and another $5,000 
once it was determined he would stay with the Indians for at least 30 days.[19]:p.288 
After Manley agreed to Veeck's offer, she stated to him, "If Larry Doby 
were white and a free agent, you'd give him $100,000 to sign as a bonus."[18]:p.37 
The press were not told that Doby had been signed by the Indians as Veeck 
wanted to manage how fans in Cleveland would be introduced to Doby. "I 
moved slowly and carefully, perhaps even timidly", Veeck said.[11]:p.4 
The Eagles had a doubleheader on July 4 but Doby, who had a .415 batting 
average and 14 home runs to that point in the season, only played in the 
first as Veeck sent his assistant and public relations personnel member, 
Louis Jones, for Doby. The two took a train from Newark to Chicago where 
the Indians were scheduled to play the Chicago White Sox the next day.[11]:p.4 
On July 5, with the Indians in Chicago in the midst of a road trip, Doby 
made his debut as the second black baseball player after Robinson to play 
in the majors after establishment of the baseball color line. Veeck hired 
two plainclothes police officers to accompany Doby as he went to Comiskey 
Park.[20]:p.16 Player-manager Lou Boudreau initially had a hard time finding 
a place in the lineup for Doby, who had played second base and shortstop 
for most of his career. Boudreau himself was the regular shortstop, while 
Joe Gordon was the second baseman.[21] That day, Doby met his new teammates 
for the first time. "I walked down that line, stuck out my hand, and very 
few hands came back in return. Most of the ones that did were cold-fish 
handshakes, along with a look that said, 'You don't belong here", Doby 
reminisced years later.[22][23] Four of Doby's teammates did not shake 
his hand, and of those, two turned their backs to Doby when he tried to 
introduce himself.[24] During warm-ups, Doby languished for minutes while 
his teammates interacted with one another. Not until Joe Gordon asked Doby 
to play catch with him was Doby given the chance to engage. Gordon befriended 
Doby and became one of his closest friends on the team.[25] Doby entered 
the game in the seventh inning as a pinch-hitter for relief pitcher Bryan 
Stephens and recorded a strikeout. In the 1949 movie The Kid from Cleveland, 
Veeck tells the story that Gordon struck out on three swings in his immediate 
at-bat after Doby to save face for his new teammate. However, Doby's second 
strike was the result of a foul ball, both the Associated Press and Chicago 
Tribune stated Doby struck out on five pitches instead of three, and in 
addition, Gordon was standing on third base during Doby's at-bat.[26] From 
Pride and Prejudice: The Biography of Larry Doby: The Indians had a doubleheader 
against the White Sox on Sunday, July 6, for which 31,566 were in attendance; 
it was estimated that approximately 30 percent of the crowd were black. 
Some congregations of black churches let out early while others walked 
immediately from Sunday service to Comiskey Park.[1]:p.53 Boudreau had 
Doby pinch-hit in the first game but for the second, listed him a starter 
at first base, a position Doby was not expected to fill when the Indians 
brought him up to play at second base. Doby had played the position before 
with the Eagles but was without a proper mitt for first base and met much 
resistance when attempts were made to borrow one from teammates, including 
first baseman Eddie Robinson, for whom Boudreau had asked Doby to replace 
that day.[5]:p.32 Doby said only because Gordon asked in the clubhouse 
to borrow one of the first baseman's mitts did he have one to use in the 
second game of the doubleheader as earlier direct requests from Doby were 
rejected.[24] The mitt was loaned by a White Sox player.[5]:p.32 Boudreau 
recounts an incident where Robinson refused the mitt to Doby, but when 
asked by Indians traveling secretary Spud Goldstein, Robinson obliged.[27]:p.96 
It was the only game Doby started for the remainder of the season. Doby 
recorded his first major league hit in four at-bats and had an RBI in a 
5–1 Indians win.[28] A columnist wrote in the Plain Dealer on July 8: "Cleveland's 
man in the street is the right sort of American, as was evidenced right 
solidly once more by the response to the question: 'How does the signing 
of Larry Doby by the Indians strike you? Said the man in the street: Can 
he hit? ... That's all that counts."[29]:p.114 Conversely, Doby was criticized 
from players both active and retired. Noted former player Rogers Hornsby 
said, after watching Doby play one time in 1947: In his rookie year, Doby 
hit 5-for-32 in 29 games. He played four games at second base and one each 
at first base and shortstop.[27]:p.98 Throughout the season he talked with 
Robinson via telephone, the two encouraging each other.[17][31] "And Jackie 
and I agreed we shouldn't challenge anybody or cause trouble—or we'd both 
be out of the big leagues, just like that. We figured that if we spoke 
out, we would ruin things for other black players."[32] After his rookie 
season, Doby again pursued time on the basketball court and appeared with 
the Paterson Crescents of the American Basketball League after signing 
a contract in January 1948.[1]:p.67[8]:p.147 He was the first black player 
to join the league.[20]:p.16 "He was a great American, served the country 
in World War II, and he was a great ballplayer. He was kind of like Buzz 
Aldrin, the second man on the moon, because he was the second African-American 
in the majors behind Jackie Robinson. He was just as good of a ballplayer, 
an exciting player, and a very good teammate." In 1948, Doby experienced 
his first spring training with the Indians in Tucson, Arizona. Unlike their 
white teammates, Doby, along with Satchel Paige and Minnie Miñoso, were 
not permitted to stay at the nearby Santa Rita hotel but instead stayed 
with a local black family and used a rental car provided by the Indians 
for transportation.[10]:p.71 During spring training, Doby read books concerning 
outfield play, and received instruction and encouragement from former Indians 
manager Tris Speaker and Indians' farm system director Hank Greenberg.[10] 
Doby also credited Indians coach Bill McKechnie with helping him adjust 
to the majors and learning the outfield.[24] In an exhibition game in Houston 
against the New York Giants, Doby hit a home run that "may have traveled 
500 feet before landing far beyond the fence in center field."[34] As Moore 
wrote in his biography of Doby, "With that home run, all doubts that Doby 
would make the 1948 Cleveland team vanished.[34] That year, he played in 
121 games and hit .301 for the season with 14 home runs and 66 RBIs.[10]:p.71 
Throughout the regular season Doby was racially abused by opposing teams, 
and Veeck asked AL president Will Harridge for support in getting players 
to rein in their animosity towards Doby.[10]:p.71 Doby played a major role 
in Cleveland's World Series victory against the Boston Braves. In Game 
4 on October 9, Doby hit the first home run by a black player in World 
Series history.[16] A picture featuring an embrace between Doby and white 
teammate Steve Gromek, who had pitched a complete game that day, was on 
the cover of the next day's Plain Dealer.[35] Richard Goldstein of The 
New York Times called the photograph "a signature moment in the integration 
of Major League Baseball."[36] Of the picture, Doby said, "The picture 
was more rewarding and happy for me than actually hitting the home run. 
The picture finally showed a moment of a man showing his feelings for me."[37]:p.66 
The Indians defeated the Braves in six games and with it, Cleveland had 
its first World Series championship since the 1920 season. Doby's .318 
batting average during the Series led the Indians. Nationally syndicated 
columnist Grantland Rice argued that without Doby and Gene Bearden, who 
had won 20 games that year, the Indians would have finished in fourth or 
fifth place.[38] After the Series, Doby received a celebratory parade in 
Paterson, New Jersey, and during the offseason he, along with other teammates, 
appeared in the 1949 film The Kid From Cleveland.[39]:p.115 With additional 
income available due to the post-season run and Series championship, Doby 
and his wife attempted to buy a home in Paterson in an all-white neighborhood 
but were kept out by a petition from members of the community. The Dobys 
were allowed to purchase their desired home when the Paterson city mayor 
intervened on their behalf.[37]:p.67 During the 1949 season, Doby was selected 
to his first MLB All-Star Game. He was one of five Indians selected by 
Boudreau and joined Jackie Robinson, Roy Campanella and Don Newcombe as 
the first black players to be amongst those chosen to participate in the 
1949 All-Star Game.[40] Boudreau fined Doby after he attempted to steal 
home with no outs and bases loaded in a game against the Yankees on July 
20. Of the fine, Boudreau said, "It was not based only on that attempt 
to steal home. Larry has taken several unnecessary chances lately. This 
should make him more careful."[41] His home run (24) and RBI (85) totals 
increased during the 1949 season, and by 1950, he was considered the best 
center fielder in the game by The Sporting News.[42] By the first week 
in July, Doby's .370 batting average trailed only 1949 AL batting champion 
George Kell, who had a .375 average.[43] He earned career-bests in batting 
average (.326), hits (164) and on-base percentage (OBP) (.442), while playing 
in 142 games. Doby hit the 100-RBI mark (102) for the first time in his 
career while his OBP led the AL. He finished eighth in AL MVP voting, highest 
among outfielders.[44] At the end of the season, Cleveland signed him to 
a new, more lucrative contract.[45] Doby was named by Cleveland sports 
writers as the Cleveland Baseball Man of the Year after the season, the 
first time a black player was chosen.[46] Doby hit 20 home runs and 69 
RBIs in 1951, both fewer than last season, and his batting average improved 
to .295. His 21-game hit-streak was the second-longest for the Indians 
that season, behind Dale Mitchell's mark of 23 games in a row.[47]:p.61 
Indians general manager Hank Greenberg reduced Doby's salary due to the 
lower home run numbers despite Doby, who attributed the lower numbers to 
tightness in his legs, stating he would not accept a pay cut.[48][49] Indians 
manager Al López confirmed that Doby was injury-riddled throughout the 
season, stating that he "was beset by first one injury and then another" 
including "a muscle tear in his thigh, a groin pull, an ankle twist."[50] 
Doby received blame for the Indians' failure to win the AL pennant and 
was labeled a "loner" by some in the press, including Plain Dealer sports 
editor Gordon Cobbledick who in an article in Sport wrote "Larry's a mixed-up 
guy—a badly mixed-up guy" stemming from "the emotional impact of discovering 
racial prejudice against him."[51][52] Cobbledick also took issue with 
Doby's assertion that opposing pitchers were knocking him down due to Doby 
being black. The assertion was confirmed by Sam Lacy, who wrote in the 
Baltimore Afro-American, "Statistics show that eight colored players in 
the two major leagues were hit by pitches a total of 68 times during the 
1951 campaign, an average of 8 1⁄2 times per man. No other player was hit 
as many as eight times in the season."[53] One month before spring training 
for the 1952 season, Doby employed former Olympic track and field athlete 
Harrison Dillard to come to his home in New Jersey to prepare his legs 
in hopes of eliminating injuries, which had affected him the previous season.[49] 
Dillard and the Indians' team doctor prescribed lower-body warm-ups to 
Doby before the start of each game.[54] Leg injuries continued to bother 
Doby during the start of the season.[55] On June 4, 1952, he hit for the 
cycle.[56] By the end of the 1952 season, Doby was second in the AL in 
RBIs to teammate Al Rosen by one, 105 to 104. His .541 slugging percentage, 
runs scored (104), strikeout (111), and home run (32) totals were all highest 
in the AL.[57] Leading up to the 1953 season, Doby asked Greenberg and 
Indians management for a pay raise after earning $22,000 the previous season. 
In early March, the raise was granted, and he was slated to make $28,000 
that year.[58] For 1953, Doby had a .263 batting average, which was his 
lowest since joining the league in 1947. He led the AL in strikeouts for 
the second and final time in his career, a career-high 121 times, but hit 
29 home runs and 102 RBIs on the year. He also had 96 walks, which was 
third in the AL.[59] For the sixth time in his major league career, Doby 
was named an All-Star during the 1954 season, one of five Indians named. 
The game was held at Cleveland's Municipal Stadium and featured the second-largest 
crowd to watch an All-Star Game (the largest was in 1935 at the same stadium).[40]:p.131 
In what would prove his final career All-Star at bat, Doby hit a pinch-hit 
solo home run in the eighth inning to tie the game at 9–9; the AL squad 
went on to win, 11–9.[40]:p.131[60] His home run was the first hit by a 
black player in an All-Star Game.[61] The game, which had a record 17 hits 
by the AL and was the highest-scoring All-Star Game until 1998, was called 
the best ever by All-Star Game founder Arch Ward.[40]:p.131[60] As the 
regular season resumed, Doby helped the Indians to win a franchise-record 
111 games and the AL pennant.[62][63] His regular season 32 home runs and 
career-high 126 RBIs were highest in the AL, which led to him finishing 
second in AL MVP voting.[64] The Indians were swept in the 1954 World Series 
by Doby's former Eagles teammate Monte Irvin and the New York Giants.[39]:p.146 
In his last full season with the Indians in 1955, Doby was selected for 
his seventh consecutive and final All-Star Game. Doby's leg injuries affected 
him severely at this point in his career and he did not enter the game.[65][66] 
He finished the 1955 season with 26 home runs and 75 RBIs while hitting 
.291 in 131 games, his fewest played since 1948. Not all in Cleveland were 
disappointed to see Doby leaving. Wrote one Plain Dealer columnist, Franklin 
Lewis: "He has been a controversial athlete. Highly gifted, he was frequently 
morose, sullen, and upon occasion, downright surly to his teammates ... 
He thought of himself, at the beginning, as the symbol of the Negro in 
his league."[37]:p.68 Doby responded, "I was looked on as a Black man, 
not as a human being. I did feel a responsibility to the Black players 
who came after me, but that was a responsibility, basically, to people, 
not just to Black people."[37]:p.68 After spending nine seasons with Cleveland, 
Doby was traded on October 25, 1955, to the Chicago White Sox for Chico 
Carrasquel and Jim Busby. Chicago was looking for a consistent home run 
hitter after finishing the season with 116 home runs as a team.[67][68] 
"The search is over for a long ball hitter. We've certainly needed a consistent 
one—and we've been eying Doby for some time", said White Sox vice president 
Chuck Comiskey.[69] White Sox manager Marty Marion believed Doby's bat 
would be a welcome addition to his club when he said, "The guy used to 
murder us when we played Cleveland. He'll make a big difference in the 
number of one-run and two-run decisions we might lose."[70]:p.73 After 
winning a doubleheader against the Yankees on June 22, 1956, Doby and the 
White Sox swept New York, the first time since the 1945 season the Yankees 
had been swept in a four-game series.[71] The White Sox won eight straight 
games, the longest winning streak in the AL to that point in the season, 
and had done so with the help of Doby's six home runs during the eight-game 
stretch. "You know, when we dealt for Doby, we weren't worried about Larry. 
We knew he'd come through", Comiskey said.[71] Doby finished the season 
with a .268 batting average and led the team with 24 home runs and 102 
RBIs. Chicago finished 1956 in third place in the AL with an 85–69 record.[72] 
In a game on August 20, 1957 against the Washington Senators, Doby helped 
preserve pitcher Bob Keegan's no-hitter with a backhand catch off a long 
line drive from Herb Plews, one of "two close calls" for Keegan that game.[73][74] 
His 1957 home run total of 14 tied for the team-high, as he managed a .288 
average and recorded 79 RBIs, second-highest on the team after former Indians 
teammate Minnie Miñoso. The White Sox finished second in the AL with a 
90–64 record.[75] Doby was part of a December 3, 1957, multi-player trade 
between the White Sox and Baltimore Orioles, then was traded again on April 
1 to Cleveland along with Don Ferrarese for Gene Woodling, Bud Daley, and 
Dick Williams.[76][77] He appeared in 89 games with the Indians that season 
and had a .289 batting average, 13 home runs, and 45 RBIs. He was sent 
to the Detroit Tigers on March 21, 1959, in exchange for Tito Francona.[28] 
Tigers general manager Rick Ferrell said, "this gives us some more power 
and we just hope Doby hits as well in Briggs Stadium this season as he 
has in other years."[78] With the Tigers he appeared in 18 games and was 
the first black player to play for the Tiger franchise.[30]:p.7 He hit 
.218 with four RBIs before Detroit sold the 35-year-old Doby to the White 
Sox on May 13 for $20,000.[79][80] After 21 games with the White Sox, he 
was sent to Triple-A affiliate San Diego Padres of the Pacific Coast League 
after hitting .241 with no home runs and 9 RBIs.[26][81][82] Doby fractured 
an ankle while sliding into third base after hitting a triple during a 
road game the Padres played against Sacramento, and was sent to a local 
hospital in Sacramento before going to Johns Hopkins Hospital for further 
evaluation.[83][84] Doby worked out with the White Sox before the 1960 
season but, due to nagging injuries, did not earn a roster spot.[85] In 
late April he joined the Toronto Maple Leafs of the International League 
on a trial basis but was released by the team on May 6 after X-rays showed 
bone deterioration in his affected ankle.[86][87] Doby finished his 13-year 
major league career with a .283 batting average, accumulated 1,515 hits, 
253 home runs and 970 RBIs in 1,533 games and 5,348 at-bats.[88] Of his 
1,533 career games, 1,146 of them were spent with the Indians. "I played 
against great talent in the Major Leagues and I played against great talent 
in the Negro Leagues. I didn't see a lot of difference", said Doby.[16] 
Doby had participated in baseball clinics in 1962 as a member of a travel 
delegation from the U.S. Department of State.[32] That year, Doby came 
out of retirement and became one of the first Americans to play professional 
baseball in Japan's Nippon Professional Baseball league when he and Don 
Newcombe, a former teammate with the Newark Eagles, signed contracts with 
the Chunichi Dragons.[82][89][90] After the season, Doby returned to the 
U.S. in October and resumed his work as a liquor retailer.[32][91] After 
retiring as a player, Doby became a scout with the Montreal Expos in 1969 
and served as a minor league instructor with the organization in 1970.[81] 
He was batting coach under manager Gene Mauch from 1971 to 1973 and again 
in 1976.[39]:p.117 He managed various teams during five seasons of winter 
league baseball in Venezuela, including Águilas del Zulia during the 1970–71 
winter season.[2][92][93] Doby rejoined the Indians for the 1974 season 
as first base coach for manager Ken Aspromonte. When Aspromonte was fired 
after the 1974 season, the Indians named Frank Robinson the club's player-manager 
and baseball's first black manager.[39]:p.117[94] After Robinson's hire 
as manager, Doby returned to work for the Expos. In 1976, Bill Veeck purchased 
the White Sox for a second time and hired Doby to be the team's batting 
coach. As a team, the White Sox finished the 1976 season with a .255 batting 
average, 586 runs scored and 73 home runs. By June 29, 1977, the team's 
average was .284, and had recorded 382 runs scored and 87 home runs.[95] 
They finished the season second in team batting average (to the Yankees 
and Red Sox, each with a .281 average) and had 192 home runs and 844 runs 
scored as a team.[96] After firing the White Sox's manager and former Doby 
teammate Bob Lemon, Veeck replaced him with Doby on June 30, 1978. At age 
53, Doby became the second black manager in the majors after Robinson.[97][98]:p.114[65] 
"It's so nice to work for a man like Bill Veeck. You just work as hard 
as you can, and if the opportunity arises, you will certainly get the opportunity 
to fulfill your dreams", Doby said after being named White Sox manager.[81] 
To that point in the season, the White Sox had a 34–40 record. On July 
1 in his first game as manager, the White Sox suffered a 10-0 loss to the 
Minnesota Twins but Doby won his first game, 8–5, the next day against 
the same team.[99] The White Sox finished 71–90, including 37–50 under 
Doby, in what would be Doby's sole managerial role.[100] Veeck hired player-manager 
Don Kessinger to succeed Doby after deciding not to re-hire Doby, although 
Kessinger resigned as manager in the second half of the 1979 season.[101] 
After removing Doby from the manager's role and reassigning him to batting 
coach, the position Doby held before being named manager, Veeck said, "Larry 
will always have a role on this team in some capacity."[102] He served 
in that role for one additional season and resigned in October 1979.[103] 
After retiring from baseball, Doby was named director of communications 
for the National Basketball Association's New Jersey Nets from 1980 to 
1989 and also served as the Nets' director of community affairs until 1990.[4]:p.36[104]:p.394 
Doby was named special assistant to the AL's last president, Gene Budig, 
on April 17, 1995.[24] "I was never bitter because I believed in the man 
upstairs. I continue to do my best. I let someone else be bitter. If I 
was bitter, I was only hurting me. I prefer to remember Bill Veeck and 
Jim Hegan and Joe Gordon, the good guys. There is no point in talking about 
the others." The New York Times wrote, "In glorifying those who are first, 
the second is often forgotten ... Larry Doby integrated all those American 
League ball parks where Jackie Robinson never appeared. And he did it with 
class and clout."[24] During the 1997 season, when the long-departed Jackie 
Robinson's number 42 was being retired throughout baseball, and the still-living 
Doby was being virtually ignored by the media, an editorial in Sports Illustrated 
pointed out that Doby had to suffer the same indignities that Robinson 
did, and with nowhere near the media attention and implicit support.[17] 
Scoop Jackson in 2007 wrote, in response to the tradition of MLB players 
wearing jerseys in homage of Robinson, "Second place finishers in America 
are suckers. And so are those who make the story of history less simple 
than it needs to be. This happens sometimes in America. Those who don't 
come first or don't do things a certain way get lost. They disappear."[105] 
"Jackie got all the publicity for putting up with it (racial slurs). But 
it was the same thing I had to deal with. He was first, but the crap I 
took was just as bad. Nobody said, 'We're gonna be nice to the second Black,'" 
Doby said.[106] Doby served as one of the pallbearers at Robinson's funeral.[17] 
As fellow Hall of Famer Joe Morgan wrote, "Anyone who knew Larry knew that 
he admired Robinson and was never jealous of the attention Robinson received."[107] 
Former teammate Al Rosen said: Doby experienced many prejudices during 
his time before, during, and after the majors. One incident took place 
during a game as Doby was sliding into second base when the shortstop from 
the opposing team spat tobacco juice on him.[109] Doby called it the worst 
injustice he experienced on the field.[25] He endured many racial slurs, 
from the stands and elsewhere, during games.[110] He also received death 
threats.[111] After he had retired as a player, Doby recalled memories 
of his days as a barrier-breaker. "You know why I hit so well in Washington 
and St. Louis? They were major Jim Crow seating parks and when I came to 
bat, I knew where the noise was coming from and who was making it. I felt 
like a quarterback with 5,000 cheerleaders calling his name. You know most 
of them couldn't afford to be there. I never forgot them."[22] Shortly 
after the Indians had honored Doby by naming a nearby street after him, 
The Plain Dealer columnist Bill Livingston wrote, "The Larry Doby way of 
pioneering was the same as the Jackie Robinson way in the National League, 
only Doby's debut occurred six short weeks later and with almost no advance 
preparation by Doby or the Indians."[112] Doby threw out the ceremonial 
first pitch at the 1997 Major League Baseball All-Star Game, played at 
Jacobs Field. The decision to have the game in Cleveland coincided with 
the 1997 season marking the fiftieth anniversary of Robinson breaking baseball's 
color barrier. It was also 50 years and 3 days since Doby became the first 
black player in the American League.[113] Doby was elected into the National 
Baseball Hall of Fame on March 3, 1998, by the Veterans Committee at the 
age of 74.[114][115] "This is just a tremendous feeling. It's kind of like 
a bale of cotton has been on your shoulders, and now it's off", said Doby.[116] 
When he received word about his election it was via telephone call from 
fellow Hall member Ted Williams.[117] Upon hearing of Doby's election, 
Gene Mauch, said, "You have to be some kind of special person to go through 
what Larry and Jackie Robinson went through. They both are. I'm not too 
sure there's a player in the game today who could handle it."[33] He was 
inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum on July 26, 
1998.[118] Doby became the first member born in South Carolina elected 
to the Hall.[119] Although he was the first to play in MLB, Doby was the 
last member elected to the Hall of the four players to ever play in both 
a Negro league and MLB World Series, the others being Satchel Paige, Monte 
Irvin, and Willie Mays.[35][120] Doby and his wife, Helyn, had five children, 
six grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.[117][121] When the Dobys 
moved to Montclair, Yogi Berra and his wife became neighborhood friends 
and children of the two families played baseball and football together.[9] 
Doby had a kidney removed in 1997 after a cancerous tumour was detected. 
Helyn, married to Doby for 55 years, died in 2001 after a six-month battle 
with cancer.[82] Doby died on June 18, 2003, at his home in Montclair, 
New Jersey, at age 79 after suffering cancer.[23][122] When Doby died, 
President George W. Bush made the following statement: "Larry Doby was 
a good and honorable man, and a tremendous athlete and manager. He had 
a profound influence on the game of baseball, and he will be missed. As 
the first African American player in the American League, he helped lead 
the Cleveland Indians to their last World Series title in 1948, became 
a nine-time All-Star and was voted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1998. 
Laura joins me in sending our condolences to Larry's family during this 
difficult time."[123] MLB Commissioner Bud Selig (1998–2015) released a 
statement a day following Doby's death: "... Like Jackie, he endured the 
pain of being a pioneer with grace, dignity, and determination and eased 
the way for all who followed. He achieved another historic second 31 years 
later he became the second African-American to manage a big league club, 
following Frank Robinson."[124] Former MLB Commissioner Fay Vincent said: 
"Larry's role in history was recognized slowly and belatedly. Jackie Robinson, 
who broke the color line first but in the same year, quite naturally received 
most of the attention. Larry played out his career with dignity and then 
slid gracefully into various front-office positions in basketball and then 
later in baseball. Only in the 90's did baseball wake up to the obvious 
fact that Larry was every bit as deserving of recognition as Jackie."[25] 
Long before Doby was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame came induction 
in the Indians Hall of Fame in August 1966. Later, in May 1973, he was 
inducted into the South Carolina Hall of Fame and in 2010, the New Jersey 
Hall of Fame.[3][22][125] On August 10, 2007, the Indians paid tribute 
to Doby on Larry Doby Day by collectively using his number (14) on their 
uniforms. The franchise again honored him when in 2012, Eagle Avenue, next 
to the Indians' Progressive Field, was renamed "Larry Doby Way" in an on-field 
postgame ceremony. Among those present at the ceremony were Jim "Mudcat" 
Grant, Indians president Mark Shapiro, Cleveland mayor Frank Jackson, and 
various members of Doby's family.[126] The city of Paterson, New Jersey, 
renamed the Eastside Park baseball field "Larry Doby Field" on June 1, 
2002.[4]:p.14 The Yogi Berra Museum and Learning Center has a section named 
the Larry Doby Wing. Of Berra, Doby said, "Yogi was one of the first opposing 
players to talk to me. As a catcher, Yogi talked to everybody. I finally 
had to tell the umpire: 'Please tell him to shut up. He asked me how my 
family was back in the first inning.'"[9] In 2011, the U.S. Postal Service 
announced that Doby would be one of the four baseball players (along with 
Ted Williams, Joe DiMaggio, and Willie Stargell) to appear on a postage 
stamp in 2012, as part of its "Major League Baseball All-Stars" series.[127]
