New South Wales (abbreviated as NSW) is a state on the east coast of Australia. 
It borders Queensland to the north, Victoria to the south, South Australia 
to the west, the Tasman Sea to the east and surrounds the whole of the 
Australian Capital Territory. New South Wales' capital city is Sydney, 
which is also the nation's most populous city. In March 2014[update], the 
estimated population of New South Wales was 7.5 million,[9] making it Australia's 
most populous state. Just under two-thirds of the state's population, 4.67 
million, live in the Greater Sydney area.[10] Inhabitants of New South 
Wales are referred to as New South Welshmen.[1][2] The colony of New South 
Wales was founded in 1788. It originally comprised a much larger area of 
the Australian mainland and also included Lord Howe Island, New Zealand, 
Norfolk Island and Van Diemen's Land. During the 19th century, large areas 
were separated to form the British colonies of Tasmania, South Australia, 
New Zealand, Victoria, Queensland and the Northern Territory (1863). Lord 
Howe Island remains part of New South Wales, while Norfolk Island has become 
a federal Territory, as have the areas now known as the Australian Capital 
Territory and the Jervis Bay Territory. The prior inhabitants of New South 
Wales were the Aboriginal tribes who arrived in Australia about 40,000 
to 60,000 years ago. Before European settlement there were an estimated 
250,000 Aboriginal people in the region.[11] The Wodi Wodi people are the 
original custodians of the Illawarra region of South Sydney.[12] Speaking 
a variant of the Dharawal language, the Wodi Wodi people lived across a 
large stretch of land which was roughly surrounded by what is now known 
as Campbelltown, Shoalhaven River and Moss Vale.[12] The Bundjalung people 
are the original custodians of parts of the northern coastal areas. The 
European discovery of New South Wales was made by Captain James Cook during 
his 1770 survey along the unmapped eastern coast of the Dutch-named continent 
of New Holland, now Australia. In his original journal(s) covering the 
survey, in triplicate to satisfy Admiralty Orders, Cook first named the 
land "New Wales", named after Wales. However, in the copy held by the Admiralty, 
he "revised the wording" to "New South Wales".[13] The first British settlement 
was made by what is known in Australian history as the First Fleet; this 
was led by Captain Arthur Phillip, who assumed the role of governor of 
the settlement on arrival in 1788 until 1792.[14][15] After years of chaos 
and anarchy after the overthrow of Governor William Bligh, a new governor, 
Lieutenant-Colonel (later Major-General) Lachlan Macquarie, was sent from 
Britain to reform the settlement in 1809.[16] During his time as governor, 
Macquarie commissioned the construction of roads, wharves, churches and 
public buildings, sent explorers out from Sydney and employed a planner 
to design the street layout of Sydney. Macquarie's legacy is still evident 
today. During the 19th century, large areas were successively separated 
to form the British colonies of Tasmania (proclaimed as a separate colony 
named Van Diemen's Land in 1825), South Australia (1836), Victoria (1851) 
and Queensland (1859). Responsible government was granted to the New South 
Wales colony in 1855. Following the Treaty of Waitangi, William Hobson 
declared British sovereignty over New Zealand in 1840. In 1841 it was separated 
from the Colony of New South Wales to form the new Colony of New Zealand. 
Charles Darwin visited Australia in January 1836 and in The Voyage of the 
Beagle (chapter 19 of the 11th edition) records his hesitations about and 
fascination with New South Wales, including his speculations about the 
geological origin and formation of the great valleys, the aboriginal population, 
the situation of the convicts, and the future prospects of the country. 
At the end of the 19th century, the movement toward federation between 
the Australian colonies gathered momentum. Conventions and forums involving 
colony leaders were held on a regular basis. Proponents of New South Wales 
as a free trade state were in dispute with the other leading colony Victoria, 
which had a protectionist economy. At this time customs posts were common 
on borders, even on the Murray River. Travelling from NSW to Victoria in 
those days was very difficult. Supporters of federation included the NSW 
premier Sir Henry Parkes whose 1889 Tenterfield Speech (given in Tenterfield) 
was pivotal in gathering support for NSW involvement. Edmund Barton, later 
to become Australia's first Prime Minister, was another strong advocate 
for federation and a meeting held in Corowa in 1893 drafted an initial 
constitution. In 1898 popular referenda on the proposed federation were 
held in NSW, Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania. All votes resulted 
in a majority in favour, but the NSW government under Premier George Reid 
(popularly known as "yes–no Reid" because of his constant changes of opinion 
on the issue) had set a requirement for a higher "yes" vote than just a 
simple majority which was not met. In 1899 further referenda were held 
in the same states as well as Queensland (but not Western Australia). All 
resulted in yes votes with majorities increased from the previous year. 
NSW met the conditions its government had set for a yes vote. As a compromise 
to the question on where the capital was to be located, an agreement was 
made that the site was to be within NSW but not closer than 100 miles (161 km) 
from Sydney, while the provisional capital would be Melbourne. Eventually 
the area that now forms the Australian Capital Territory was ceded by NSW 
when Canberra was selected. In the years after World War I, the high prices 
enjoyed during the war fell with the resumption of international trade. 
Farmers became increasingly discontented with the fixed prices paid by 
the compulsory marketing authorities set up as a wartime measure by the 
Hughes government. In 1919 the farmers formed the Country Party, led at 
national level by Earle Page, a doctor from Grafton, and at state level 
by Michael Bruxner, a small farmer from Tenterfield. The Great Depression, 
which began in 1929, ushered in a period of political and class conflict 
in New South Wales. The mass unemployment and collapse of commodity prices 
brought ruin to both city workers and to farmers. The beneficiary of the 
resultant discontent was not the Communist Party, which remained small 
and weak, but Jack Lang's Labor populism. Lang's second government was 
elected in November 1930 on a policy of repudiating New South Wales' debt 
to British bondholders and using the money instead to help the unemployed 
through public works. This was denounced as illegal by conservatives, and 
also by James Scullin's federal Labor government. The result was that Lang's 
supporters in the federal Caucus brought down Scullin's government, causing 
a second bitter split in the Labor Party. In May 1932 the Governor, Sir 
Philip Game dismissed his government. The subsequent election was won by 
the conservative opposition. By the outbreak of World War II in 1939, the 
differences between New South Wales and the other states that had emerged 
in the 19th century had faded as a result of federation and economic development 
behind a wall of protective tariffs.[citation needed] New South Wales continued 
to outstrip Victoria as the centre of industry, and increasingly of finance 
and trade as well.[citation needed] Labor returned to office under the 
moderate leadership of William McKell in 1941 and remained in power for 
24 years. World War II saw another surge in industrial development to meet 
the needs of a war economy, and also the elimination of unemployment. Labor 
stayed in power until 1965. Towards the end of its term in power it announced 
a plan for the construction of an opera/arts facility on Bennelong Point. 
The design competition was won by Jørn Utzon. Controversy over the cost 
of what would eventually become the Sydney Opera House became a political 
issue and was a factor in the eventual defeat of Labor in 1965 by the conservative 
Liberal Party led by Sir Robert Askin. Sir Robert remains a controversial 
figure with supporters claiming him to be reformist especially in terms 
of reshaping the NSW economy. Others though, regard the Askin era as synonymous 
with corruption with Askin the head of a network involving NSW police and 
SP bookmaking (Goot). In the late 1960s a secessionist movement in the 
New England region of the state led to a referendum on the issue. The new 
state would have consisted of much of northern NSW including Newcastle. 
The referendum was narrowly defeated and, as of 2010[update], there are 
no active or organised campaigns for new states in NSW. Askin's resignation 
in 1975 was followed by a number of short lived premierships by Liberal 
Party leaders. When a general election came in 1976 the ALP under Neville 
Wran were returned to power. Wran was able to transform this narrow one 
seat victory into landslide wins (known as Wranslide) in 1978 and 1981.[citation 
needed] After winning a comfortable though reduced majority in 1984, Wran 
resigned as premier and left parliament. His replacement Barrie Unsworth 
struggled to emerge from Wran's shadow and lost a 1988 election against 
a resurgent Liberal Party led by Nick Greiner. Unsworth was replaced as 
ALP leader by Bob Carr. Initially Greiner was a popular leader instigating 
reform such as the creation of the Independent Commission Against Corruption 
(ICAC). Greiner called a snap election in 1991 which the Liberals were 
expected to win. However the ALP polled extremely well and the Liberals 
lost their majority and needed the support of independents to retain power. 
Greiner was accused (by ICAC) of corrupt actions involving an allegation 
that a government position was offered to tempt an independent (who had 
defected from the Liberals) to resign his seat so that the Liberal party 
could regain it and shore up its numbers. Greiner resigned but was later 
cleared of corruption. His replacement as Liberal leader and Premier was 
John Fahey whose government secured Sydney the right to host the 2000 Summer 
Olympics. In the 1995 election, Fahey's government lost narrowly and the 
ALP under Bob Carr returned to power. Like Wran before him Carr was able 
to turn a narrow majority into landslide wins at the next two elections 
(1999 and 2003). During this era, NSW hosted the 2000 Sydney Olympics which 
were internationally regarded as very successful, and helped boost Carr's 
popularity. Carr surprised most people by resigning from office in 2005. 
He was replaced by Morris Iemma, who remained Premier after being re-elected 
in the March 2007 state election, until he was replaced by Nathan Rees 
in September 2008.[17] Rees was subsequently replaced by Kristina Keneally 
in December 2009.[18] Keneally's government was defeated at the 2011 state 
election and Barry O'Farrell became Premier on 28 March. On 17 April 2014 
O'Farrell stood down as Premier after misleading an ICAC investigation 
concerning a gift of a bottle of wine. The Liberal Party then elected Treasurer 
Mike Baird as party leader and Premier. Executive authority is vested in 
the Governor of New South Wales, who represents and is appointed by Queen 
Elizabeth II. The current Governor is David Hurley. The Governor commissions 
as Premier the leader of the parliamentary political party that can command 
a simple majority of votes in the Legislative Assembly. The Premier then 
recommends the appointment of other Members of the two Houses to the Ministry, 
under the principle of responsible or Westminster government. It should 
be noted, however, that as in other Westminster systems, there is no constitutional 
requirement in NSW for the Government to be formed from the Parliament—merely 
convention. The Premier is Mike Baird of the Liberal Party.[18] The form 
of the Government of New South Wales is prescribed in its Constitution, 
dating from 1856 and currently the Constitution Act 1902 (NSW).[19] Since 
1901 New South Wales has been a state of the Commonwealth of Australia, 
and the Australian Constitution regulates its relationship with the Commonwealth. 
In 2006, the Constitution Amendment Pledge of Loyalty Act 2006 No 6,[20] 
was enacted to amend the NSW Constitution Act 1902 to require Members of 
the New South Wales Parliament and its Ministers to take a pledge of loyalty 
to Australia and to the people of New South Wales instead of swearing allegiance 
to Elizabeth II her heirs and successors, and to revise the oaths taken 
by Executive Councillors. The Pledge of Loyalty Act was officially assented 
to by the Queen on 3 April 2006. Under the Australian Constitution, New 
South Wales ceded certain legislative and judicial powers to the Commonwealth, 
but retained independence in all other areas. The New South Wales Constitution 
says: "The Legislature shall, subject to the provisions of the Commonwealth 
of Australia Constitution Act, have power to make laws for the peace, welfare, 
and good government of New South Wales in all cases whatsoever".[21] The 
first "responsible" self-government of New South Wales was formed on 6 
June 1856 with Sir Stuart Alexander Donaldson appointed by Governor Sir 
William Denison as its first Colonial Secretary which in those days accounted 
also as the Premier.[22] The State Parliament is composed of the Sovereign 
and two houses: the Legislative Assembly (lower house), and the Legislative 
Council (upper house). Elections are held every four years on the fourth 
Saturday of March, the most recent being on 28 March 2015. At each election 
one member is elected to the Legislative Assembly from each of 93 electoral 
districts and half of the 42 members of the Legislative Council are elected 
by a statewide electorate. New South Wales is divided into 128 local government 
areas. In addition, there is also the Unincorporated Far West Region which 
is not part of any local government area, in the sparsely inhabited Far 
West, and Lord Howe Island, which is also unincorporated but self-governed 
by the Lord Howe Island Board. New South Wales is policed by the New South 
Wales Police Force, a statutory authority. Established in 1862, the NSW 
Police Force investigates Summary and Indictable offences throughout the 
State of New South Wales. The state has two fire services: the volunteer 
based New South Wales Rural Fire Service, which is responsible for the 
majority of the state, and the Fire and Rescue NSW, a government agency 
responsible for protecting urban areas. There is some overlap due to suburbanisation. 
Ambulance services are provided through the Ambulance Service of New South 
Wales. Rescue services (i.e. vertical, road crash, confinement) are a joint 
effort by all emergency services, with Ambulance Rescue, Police Rescue 
Squad and Fire Rescue Units contributing. Volunteer rescue organisations 
include the Australian Volunteer Coast Guard, State Emergency Service (SES), 
Surf Life Saving New South Wales and Volunteer Rescue Association (VRA). 
The estimated population of New South Wales at the end of June 2014 was 
7,565,500 people. The population grew by 1.4% over the preceding year,[23] 
equal to the national rate. The principal ancestries of New South Wales's 
residents (as surveyed in 2011) are:[24] 62.9% of NSW's population is based 
in Sydney.[25] Passage through New South Wales is vital for cross-continent 
transport. Rail and road traffic from Brisbane (Queensland) to Perth (Western 
Australia), or to Melbourne (Victoria) must pass through New South Wales. 
The majority of railways in New South Wales are currently operated by the 
state government. Some lines began as branch-lines of railways starting 
in other states. For instance, Balranald near the Victorian border was 
connected by a rail line coming up from Victoria and into New South Wales. 
Another line beginning in Adelaide crossed over the border and stopped 
at Broken Hill. Railways management are conducted by Sydney Trains and 
NSW TrainLink[27] which maintain rolling stock. Sydney Trains operates 
trains within Sydney while NSW TrainLink operates outside Sydney, intercity, 
country and interstate services. Major roads are the concern of both federal 
and state governments. The latter maintains these through the Department 
of Roads and Maritime Services, formerly the Roads and Traffic Authority, 
and before that, the Department of Main Roads (DMR). The main roads in 
New South Wales are Other roads are usually the concern of the RTA and/or 
the local government authority. Kingsford Smith Airport (commonly Sydney 
Airport, and locally referred to as Mascot Airport or just 'Mascot'), located 
in the southern Sydney suburb of Mascot is the major airport for not just 
the state but the whole nation. It is a hub for Australia's national airline 
Qantas. Other airlines serving regional New South Wales include:[28] The 
state government through Sydney Ferries operates ferries within Sydney 
Harbour and the Parramatta River. It also has a ferry service within Newcastle.[32] 
All other ferry services are privately operated.[33] Spirit of Tasmania 
ran a commercial ferry service between Sydney and Devonport, Tasmania. 
This service was terminated in 2006.[34] Private boat services operated 
between South Australia, Victoria and New South Wales along the Murray 
and Darling Rivers but these only exist now as the occasional tourist paddle-wheeler 
service.[35] The NSW school system comprises a kindergarten to year 12 
system with primary schooling up to year 6 and secondary schooling between 
years 7 and 12. Schooling is compulsory until age 17.[36] Primary and secondary 
schools include government and non-government schools. Government schools 
are further classified as comprehensive and selective schools. Non-government 
schools include Catholic schools, other denominational schools, and non-denominational 
independent schools. Typically, a primary school provides education from 
kindergarten level to year 6. A secondary school, usually called a "high 
school", provides education from years 7 to 12. Secondary colleges are 
secondary schools which only cater for years 11 and 12. The government 
classifies the 13 years of primary and secondary schooling into six stages, 
beginning with early stage 1 (Kindergarten) and ending with stage 6 (years 
11 and 12). The School Certificate was awarded by the Board of Studies 
to students at the end of Year 10. The Board of Studies administered five 
external tests in English-literacy, Mathematics, Science, Australian History, 
Geography, Civics and Citizenship. The tests were designed to grade a student 
on their ability. The results of this test were categorised into bands 
1 through to 6 with band 1 as the lowest and band 6 as the highest.[37] 
Adrian Piccoli the NSW Education Minister confirmed that School Certificate 
tests would not continue after 2011.[38] The Higher School Certificate 
(HSC) is the usual Year 12 leaving certificate in NSW. Most students complete 
the HSC prior to entering the workforce or going on to study at university 
or TAFE (although the HSC itself can be completed at TAFE). The HSC must 
be completed for a student to get an Australian Tertiary Admission Rank 
(formerly Universities Admission Index), which determines the student's 
rank against fellow students who completed the Higher School Certificate. 
Eleven universities primarily operate in New South Wales. Sydney is home 
to Australia's first university, the University of Sydney founded in 1850. 
Other universities include the University of New South Wales, Macquarie 
University, the University of Technology, Sydney and Western Sydney University. 
The Australian Catholic University has two of its six campuses in Sydney, 
and the private University of Notre Dame Australia also operates a secondary 
campus in the city. Outside Sydney, the leading universities are the University 
of Newcastle and the University of Wollongong. Armidale is home to the 
University of New England, and Charles Sturt University and Southern Cross 
University have campuses spread across cities in the state's south-west 
and north coast respectively. The public universities are state government 
agencies, however they are largely regulated by the federal government, 
which also administers their public funding. Admission to NSW universities 
is arranged together with universities in the Australian Capital Territory 
by another government agency, the Universities Admission Centre. Primarily 
vocational training is provided up the level of advanced diplomas is provided 
by the state government's ten Technical and Further Education (TAFE) institutes. 
These institutes run courses in more than130 campuses throughout the state. 
New South Wales is bordered on the north by Queensland, on the west by 
South Australia, on the south by Victoria and on the east by the Tasman 
Sea. The Australian Capital Territory and the Jervis Bay Territory form 
a separately administered entity that is bordered entirely by New South 
Wales. The state can be divided geographically into four areas. New South 
Wales' three largest cities, Sydney, Newcastle and Wollongong, lie near 
the centre of a narrow coastal strip extending from cool temperate areas 
on the far south coast to subtropical areas near the Queensland border. 
The Illawarra region is centred on the city of Wollongong, with the Shoalhaven, 
Eurobodalla and the Sapphire Coast to the south. The Central Coast lies 
between Sydney and Newcastle, with the Mid North Coast and Northern Rivers 
regions reaching northwards to the Queensland border. Tourism is important 
to the economies of coastal towns such as Coffs Harbour, Lismore, Nowra 
and Port Macquarie, but the region also produces seafood, beef, dairy, 
fruit, sugar cane and timber. The Great Dividing Range extends from Victoria 
in the south through New South Wales to Queensland, parallel to the narrow 
coastal plain. This area includes the Snowy Mountains, the Northern, Central 
and Southern Tablelands, the Southern Highlands and the South West Slopes. 
Whilst not particularly steep, many peaks of the range rise above 1,000 
metres (3,281 ft), with the highest Mount Kosciuszko at 2,229 m (7,313 ft). 
Skiing in Australia began in this region at Kiandra around 1861. The relatively 
short ski season underwrites the tourist industry in the Snowy Mountains. 
Agriculture, particularly the wool industry, is important throughout the 
highlands. Major centres include Armidale, Bathurst, Bowral, Goulburn, 
Inverell, Orange, Queanbeyan and Tamworth. There are numerous forests in 
New South Wales, with such tree species as Red Gum Eucalyptus and Crow 
Ash (Flindersia australis), being represented.[39] Forest floors have a 
diverse set of understory shrubs and fungi. One of the widespread fungi 
is Witch's Butter (Tremella mesenterica).[40] The western slopes and plains 
fill a significant portion of the state's area and have a much sparser 
population than areas nearer the coast. Agriculture is central to the economy 
of the western slopes, particularly the Riverina region and Murrumbidgee 
Irrigation Area in the state's south-west. Regional cities such as Albury, 
Dubbo, Griffith and Wagga Wagga and towns such as Deniliquin, Leeton and 
Parkes exist primarily to service these agricultural regions. The western 
slopes descend slowly to the western plains that comprise almost two-thirds 
of the state and are largely arid or semi-arid. The mining town of Broken 
Hill is the largest centre in this area.[41] One possible definition of 
the centre for New South Wales is located 33 kilometres (21 mi) west-north-west 
of Tottenham.[42] The major part of New South Wales, west of the Great 
Dividing Range, has an arid to semi arid climate. Rainfall averages from 
150 millimetres (5.9 in) to 500 millimetres (20 in) a year throughout most 
of this region, and summer temperatures can be scorching hot while winter 
nights can be quite cold. Further east, along the western slopes of the 
Great Dividing Range, rainfall is higher, usually around 600 millimetres 
(24 in) and falls fairly evenly throughout the year.[43] Peaks along the 
Great Dividing Range vary from 500 metres (1,640 ft) to over 2,000 metres 
(6,562 ft) above sea level. Temperatures can be cool to cold in winter 
with frequent frosts and snowfall, and are rarely hot in summer due to 
the elevation. Canberra has a climate typical of the range, as do the regional 
cities of Orange and Armidale. Rainfall is moderate, from 600 millimetres 
(24 in) to 1,500 millimetres (59 in), falling fairly evenly throughout 
the year; however, it peaks slightly in the north in the summer months 
on account of heavy thunderstorms and in the south in winter due to cold 
fronts moving across southern Australia. Snowfall is also common in the 
higher parts of the range, sometimes occurring as far north as the Queensland 
border. On the highest peaks of the Snowy Mountains, the climate can be 
subpolar oceanic with very cold temperatures and heavy snow.[43] The climate 
along the flat, coastal plain east of the range varies from cool oceanic 
in the south to humid subtropical in the far north of the state. Rainfall 
is highest in this area; however, it still varies from around 800 millimetres 
(31 in) to as high as 3,000 millimetres (120 in) in the wettest areas, 
for example Dorrigo. Along the southern coast, rainfall is heaviest in 
winter due to cold fronts, while in the far north, around Lismore, rain 
is heaviest in summer from tropical systems and occasionally even cyclones.[43] 
The highest maximum temperature recorded was 49.7 °C (121 °F) at Menindee 
in the west of the state on 10 January 1939. The lowest minimum temperature 
was −23 °C (−9 °F) at Charlotte Pass in the Snowy Mountains on 29 June 
1994. This is also the lowest temperature recorded in the whole of Australia 
excluding the Antarctic Territory.[44] Since the 1970s, New South Wales 
has undergone an increasingly rapid economic and social transformation.[citation 
needed] Old industries such as steel and shipbuilding have largely disappeared; 
although agriculture remains important, its share of the state's income 
is smaller than ever before.[citation needed] New industries such as information 
technology and financial services are largely centred in Sydney and have 
risen to take their place, with many companies having their Australian 
headquarters in Sydney CBD.[citation needed] In addition, the Macquarie 
Park area of Sydney has attracted the Australian headquarters of many information 
technology firms. Coal and related products are the state's biggest export. 
Its value to the state's economy is over A$5 billion, accounting for about 
19% of all exports from NSW.[46] Tourism has also become important, with 
Sydney as its centre, also stimulating growth on the North Coast, around 
Coffs Harbour and Byron Bay.[citation needed] Tourism is worth over $25.1 
billion to the New South Wales economy and employs 7.1% of the workforce.[47] 
In 2007, then-Premier of New South Wales Morris Iemma established Events 
New South Wales to "market Sydney and NSW as a leading global events destination". 
In July 2011 Events NSW merged with three key state authorities including 
Tourism NSW to establish Destination NSW (DNSW).[48] New South Wales had 
a Gross State Product in 2010–11 (equivalent to Gross Domestic Product) 
of $419.9 billion which equalled $57,828 per capita.[49] On 9 October 2007 
NSW announced plans to build a 1,000 MW bank of wind powered turbines. 
The output of these is anticipated to be able to power up to 400,000 homes. 
The cost of this project will be $1.8 billion for 500 turbines.[50] On 
28 August 2008 the New South Wales cabinet voted to privatise electricity 
retail, causing 1,500 electrical workers to strike after a large anti-privatisation 
campaign.[51] The NSW business community is represented by the NSW Business 
Chamber which has 30,000 members. Agriculture is spread throughout the 
eastern two-thirds of New South Wales. Cattle, sheep and pigs are the predominant 
types of livestock produced in NSW and they have been present since their 
importation during the earliest days of European settlement. Economically 
the state is the most important state in Australia, with about one-third 
of the country's sheep, one-fifth of its cattle, and one-third of its small 
number of pigs. New South Wales produces a large share of Australia's hay, 
fruit, legumes, lucerne, maize, nuts, wool, wheat, oats, oilseeds (about 
51%), poultry, rice (about 99%),[52] vegetables, fishing including oyster 
farming, and forestry including wood chips.[53] Bananas and sugar are grown 
chiefly in the Clarence, Richmond and Tweed River areas. Wools are produced 
on the Northern Tablelands as well as prime lambs and beef cattle. The 
cotton industry is centred in the Namoi Valley in northwestern New South 
Wales. On the central slopes there are many orchards, with the principal 
fruits grown being apples, cherries and pears. About 40,200 hectares of 
vineyards lie across the eastern region of the state, with excellent wines 
produced in the Hunter Valley, with the Riverina being the largest wine 
producer in New South Wales.[54] Australia’s largest and most valuable 
Thoroughbred horse breeding area is centred on Scone in the Hunter Valley.[55] 
The Hunter Valley is the home of the world-famous Coolmore,[56] Darley 
and Kia-Ora Thoroughbred horse studs. About half of Australia's timber 
production is in New South Wales. Large areas of the state are now being 
replanted with eucalyptus forests. Under the Water Management Act 2000, 
updated riparian water rights were given to those within NSW with livestock. 
This change was named the "The Domestic Stock Right" which gives "an owner 
or occupier of a landholding is entitled to take water from a river, estuary 
or lake which fronts their land or from an aquifer which is underlying 
their land for domestic consumption and stock watering without the need 
for an access licence."[57] New South Wales has more than 780 national 
parks and reserves covering more than 8% of the state.[58] These parks 
range from rainforests, waterfalls, rugged bush to marine wonderlands and 
outback deserts, including World Heritage areas.[59] The Royal National 
Park on the southern outskirts of Sydney became Australia's first National 
Park when proclaimed on 26 April 1879. Originally named The National Park 
until 1955, this park was the second National Park to be established in 
the world after Yellowstone National Park in the U.S. Kosciuszko National 
Park is the largest park in state encompassing New South Wales' alpine 
region.[60] The National Parks Association was formed in 1957 to create 
a system of national parks all over New South Wales which led to the formation 
of the National Parks and Wildlife Service in 1967.[61] This government 
agency is responsible for developing and maintaining the parks and reserve 
system, and conserving natural and cultural heritage, in the state of New 
South Wales. These parks preserve special habitats, plants and wildlife, 
such as the Wollemi National Park where the Wollemi Pine grows and areas 
sacred to Australian Aboriginals such as Mutawintji National Park in western 
New South Wales. Throughout Australian history, NSW sporting teams have 
been very successful in both winning domestic competitions and providing 
players to the Australian national teams. The largest sporting competition 
in the state is the National Rugby League, which expanded from the New 
South Wales Rugby League and Australian Rugby Leagues whose headquarters 
are in Sydney. The state is represented by the The 'Blues' in the traditional 
State of Origin series. Sydney is the spiritual home of Australian rugby 
league and to 9 of the 16 NRL teams: (Sydney Roosters, South Sydney Rabbitohs, 
Parramatta Eels, Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks, Wests Tigers, Penrith Panthers, 
Canterbury Bulldogs and Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles), as well as being the
