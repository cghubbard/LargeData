Jeffrey Scott Keppinger (born April 21, 1980) is a former American professional 
baseball infielder. He bats and throws right-handed. Known as a contact 
hitter, Keppinger had one of the lowest strikeout rates in Major League 
Baseball.[1] He led the league in the "at-bats-to-strikeouts" ratio in 
2008 (19.1) and 2010 (14.3).[2] For his career (through 2013), he has only 
214 strikeouts in 2,882 at-bats.[3] In 1994 Keppinger played on the Dunwoody 
Braves summer baseball team. Keppinger was named to the AAU All-American 
team. He also played for the New England Collegiate Baseball League's Keene 
Swamp Bats. Keppinger compiled a .380 batting average at the University 
of Georgia where, in the 2001 College World Series, he hit a two-run home 
run off star pitcher Mark Prior. That same year, he was drafted by the 
Pittsburgh Pirates in the 4th round of the Major League Baseball Draft. 
Keppinger's older brother, Billy, a left-handed pitcher, played independent 
baseball and minor league baseball in the Kansas City Royals system.[4][5] 
At the 2004 trading deadline, while Keppinger was in double-A ball, he 
was traded to the Mets as part of the Kris Benson for Ty Wigginton trade. 
His average soared even higher with the double-A Binghamton Mets and stayed 
above .300 with the triple-A Norfolk Tides earning him a call to the majors 
on August 20. He responded by hitting .284 with three home runs and nine 
RBI in 33 games played. In 2005, Keppinger again excelled in Norfolk while 
hitting .337. He was poised to return to the majors in June when Kazuo 
Matsui was injured, but bad luck struck when Keppinger fractured his kneecap 
around the same time as Matsui. The injury not only prevented his return 
to the majors but ended his entire 2005 season. On July 19, 2006, Keppinger 
was acquired by the Kansas City Royals for middle infielder Ruben Gotay 
and Keppinger was sent to Triple-A Omaha. Keppinger was called up by the 
Royals in August 2006. With a season-ending injury to starting third baseman 
Mark Teahen, Keppinger was expected to see some major league action. A 
key moment in his career occurred on September 9, 2006 at Boston's Fenway 
Park, when, after entering the game against the Red Sox as a pinch runner, 
he came to bat in the top of 12th inning in a 4-4 tie game with two runners 
on. Keppinger, batting against Manny Delcarmen, hit a ball just to the 
left of the right field foul pole for a three-run home run, breaking the 
4-4 tie. The Royals went on to beat the Red Sox in that game 10-4. On January 
2, 2007, Keppinger was designated for assignment by the Royals. Eight days 
later, Keppinger was traded to the Cincinnati Reds. In return, the Royals 
received Minor League pitcher Russ Haltiwanger. On May 13, 2008, Keppinger 
fractured his patella in the second inning of a game against the Florida 
Marlins, placing him on the 15-day disabled list. On June 22, 2008, he 
returned, much to the joy of the Reds who had just recently lost another 
shortstop to injury in Jolbert Cabrera. In 2008 he had the lowest strikeout 
percentage in the majors, at 4.8%, striking out once only every 19.1 at-bats.[6][7] 
On March 31, 2009, Keppinger was traded to the Houston Astros for minor 
league infielder Drew Sutton. Keppinger saw a majority of his playing time 
at third base, filling in for Geoff Blum while he was injured. Still versatile, 
Keppinger also played shortstop, second base, and first base during the 
'08 and '09 seasons.[8] Keppinger began the 2010 season with the Astros 
as the primary backup at second base to starter Kazuo Matsui. However, 
after Matsui's offense proved inept after 71 at-bats, Keppinger was named 
the starter after Matsui was released by the Astros on May 19, 2010.[9] 
On July 19, 2011, Keppinger was traded to the San Francisco Giants for 
pitchers Henry Sosa and Jason Stoffel. He hit a walk-off single against 
his former team, the Houston Astros, on August 27 and 28, 2011.[10] On 
January 26, 2012, Keppinger was signed to a 1-year deal with the Tampa 
Bay Rays. The deal became official the next day.[11] Keppinger had a good 
season as a utility infielder, playing first, second and third base throughout 
the season. Over 115 games, Keppinger batted .325 in 385 at-bats. He also 
hit 9 home runs and 40 RBI with an OPS of .806. On May 19, Keppinger broke 
his big right toe while sitting in the dugout. A foul ball from Martin 
Prado struck Keppinger on the foot and he subsequently missed over a month. 
Keppinger became a free-agent at the end of the season. On December 10, 
2012, Keppinger signed a 3-year, $12 million deal with the Chicago White 
Sox.[12] He was designated for assignment on May 14, 2014.[13] On May 21,
