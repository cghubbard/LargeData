John William Russell (born January 5, 1961) is a former catcher and outfielder 
in Major League Baseball, and former manager of the Pittsburgh Pirates. 
He played 10 seasons from 1984 to 1993 with the Philadelphia Phillies, 
Atlanta Braves and Texas Rangers, mostly as a platoon or reserve player. 
He is currently the bench coach for the Baltimore Orioles. Born in Oklahoma 
City, Russell grew up in Oklahoma, and played college baseball for the 
University of Oklahoma after being selected by the Montreal Expos in the 
4th round of the 1979 MLB Draft. In 1982 he was selected by the Phillies 
as the 13th overall pick in the draft. He made his major league debut with 
the Phillies on June 22, 1984, and stayed with the team through the 1988 
season. After spending most of his first two seasons as a backup left fielder, 
he was the team's principal catcher in 1986 due to Darren Daulton suffering 
a year-ending injury,[1] and batted .241 with 13 home runs and 60 runs 
batted in. It was the Phillies' only winning season in his five years with 
the team, but they finished a distant second place in the division behind 
division rival and eventual champion New York Mets. He saw very little 
playing time in the next two years. He spent 1989 with the Braves, who 
purchased his contract in spring training. When the Braves released him 
at the beginning of the 1990 season he moved on to the Rangers, for whom 
he played until his retirement in 1993. While with the Rangers he caught 
Nolan Ryan's 6th career no-hitter on June 11, 1990. He ended his career 
with a .225 batting average, 34 home runs and 129 RBI in 448 games.[2] 
Upon his retirement as a player, he became a minor league manager for the 
Minnesota Twins. In 1999 he was named as the best Double-A managerial prospect 
by Baseball America. He left the Twins organization after the 2000 season; 
he interviewed with the Phillies for their vacant managerial spot, but 
the job went to Larry Bowa. Eventually he re-joined the Minnesota Twins 
as manager of the Edmonton Trappers. In 2002 Russell led Edmonton to a 
Pacific Coast League title, and was again honored by Baseball America, 
being named the best managerial prospect in the minors. The following year 
he was named the Pirates third-base coach, a job he held from 2003â€“2005. 
Russell was unpopular among some Pirates fans because of the frequency 
of runners he waved home that were thrown out at the plate. He was eventually 
fired, along with the rest of Lloyd McClendon's coaching staff, in 2005. 
After being fired Russell was named as manager of the Phillies AAA team, 
the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Red Barons, a position he held through 2006, 
until the Phillies switched affiliates to the Ottawa Lynx in 2007, with 
Russell still at the helm.[3] Prior to the 2007 season, Russell interviewed 
for the Texas Rangers managerial vacancy; the position ultimately went 
to longtime Oakland A's third-base coach Ron Washington. On November 5, 
2007 he was introduced as the Pirates manager, replacing Jim Tracy.[3] 
In February 2009, the Pirates extended his contract through the 2010 season.[4] 
During the 2010 season, the Pirates announced that John Russell's contract 
had been extended through the 2011 season; though the extension occurred 
during the previous off season, the Pirates waited until June to announce 
the new contract, a move unpopular with many fans.[5] On October 4, 2010, 
Russell was fired as the Pirates manager after a 105 loss season and an 
overall record of 186-299.[6][7] On November 15, 2010, Russell was hired 
as the third base coach of the Baltimore Orioles. Due to ongoing knee issues, 
he traded coaching positions with Willie Randolph and became Bench Coach 
in June 2011.[8] Russell is married to wife Jamie. He has three sons: Stone, 
Brooks, & Steel, the latter whom plays for the Baltimore Orioles affiliate
