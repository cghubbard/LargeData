As player As manager David Allen "Davey" Johnson (born January 30, 1943) 
is an American former professional baseball player and manager. He played 
for the Baltimore Orioles (1965–1972), Atlanta Braves (1973–1975), Yomiuri 
Giants (1975–1976), Philadelphia Phillies (1977–1978) and Chicago Cubs 
(1978). He has managed the New York Mets (1984–1990), Cincinnati Reds (1993–1995), 
Orioles (1996–1997), Los Angeles Dodgers (1999–2000), and Washington Nationals 
(2011–2013). Johnson was the starting second baseman for the Orioles when 
they won four American League (AL) pennants and two World Series championships 
between 1965 and 1972. He made four All-Star Game appearances and received 
the Rawlings Gold Glove Award three times. Johnson won the American League's 
Manager of the Year Award in 1997 when he led the Baltimore Orioles wire-to-wire 
to the American League East Division Championship. He won the same award 
in the National League in 2012 when he led the Nationals to the franchise's 
first division title since 1981. His biggest success as a manager was when 
he led the Mets to the 1986 World Series title. The ball club captured 
the National League (NL) East under his watch in 1988. The teams he piloted 
in the three years from 1995 to 1997 all made it to their respective League 
Championship Series – the Cincinnati Reds in 1995 and the Orioles in both 
1996 and 1997. He later managed the Dodgers and Nationals. After one season 
playing baseball at Texas A&M University, Johnson signed with the Baltimore 
Orioles as an amateur free agent in 1962. After signing, Johnson was assigned 
to the Stockton Ports in the Class C (now Single A) California League where 
he hit .309 with 10 home runs and 63 runs batted in in 97 games. Moved 
up to AA Elmira in 1963, Johnson hit .326 in 63 games before being promoted 
to AAA Rochester for the final 63 games of the season. Returning to the 
Red Wings for the entire 1964 season, Johnson had 19 HRs, 73 RBI, and 87 
runs.[1] In 1965, Johnson made the Orioles out of spring training, but 
saw only limited time in 20 games (hitting .170) and spent the later part 
of the season in the minors, where he batted .301 in 52 games for the Red 
Wings (his final trip back to the minor leagues). Back with the Orioles 
in 1966, Johnson saw limited playing time until June 13 when the Orioles 
traded second baseman Jerry Adair to the Chicago White Sox to make room 
for Johnson at second base. He responded with a .257 batting average, seven 
HRs and 56 RBI to finish third in American League Rookie of the Year balloting 
for the 1966 World Series champions. Johnson would be a full-time starter 
in major leagues for the next eight seasons, averaging over 142 games played 
in a season. In the 1966 World Series, Johnson would win his first World 
Series ring and earn the distinction of being the last player to get a 
hit off Sandy Koufax.[2] Johnson reached the World Series again with the 
Orioles in 1969, 1970, and 1971, winning his second ring in 1970. He also 
won the AL Gold Glove Award at second base all three seasons. Orioles shortstop 
Mark Belanger won the award as well in 1969 and 1971, joining a select 
list of shortstop-second baseman combinations to have won the honor in 
the same season while playing together.[citation needed] Third baseman 
Brooks Robinson also was in the middle of his record 16 straight Gold Glove 
streak when Johnson and Belanger won their awards. Following the 1972 season, 
one in which Johnson would hit only .221 in 118 games, he was traded along 
with starting pitchers Pat Dobson and Roric Harrison, and catcher Johnny 
Oates to the Atlanta Braves for minor league infielder Taylor Duncan and 
former National League Rookie of the Year catcher Earl Williams. The following 
season with the Braves, Johnson enjoyed the best statistical year of his 
career when his offense exploded and he tied Rogers Hornsby's record for 
most single-season home runs by a second baseman with 42 (Johnson actually 
hit 43 that year, but one came as a pinch hitter – The Sporting News Baseball 
Record Book, 2007 p. 23). The 1973 Braves featured the first trio of teammates 
ever to each hit 40 home runs in the same season when Johnson hit 43, Darrell 
Evans hit 41, and Hank Aaron hit 40. Johnson's second-highest home run 
total was 18, in the 1971 season. Four games into the 1975 season and after 
getting a hit in his only at bat, Johnson was released by the Braves. He 
then signed with the Yomiuri Giants in the Japanese League and played with 
the team in both the 1975 and 1976 seasons. In 1977, he returned to the 
United States after signing as a free agent with the Philadelphia Phillies. 
Relegated to a utility infielder role, Johnson still hit .321 with 8 HRs 
in 78 games and played in one game in the Phillies National League Championship 
Series loss to the Dodgers. During the 1978 season, Johnson hit two grand 
slams as a pinch-hitter, becoming the first major leaguer to do it in a 
season.[3] Four other players, Mike Ivie of the San Francisco Giants (1978), 
Darryl Strawberry of the New York Yankees (1998), Ben Broussard of the 
Cleveland Indians (2004), and Brooks Conrad of the Atlanta Braves (2010), 
would go on to equal Johnson's feat.[4] Shortly afterwards, Philadelphia 
dealt him to the Chicago Cubs, where he played the final 24 games of his 
career before retiring at the end of the season. In 1979, Johnson was hired 
to be the manager of the Miami Amigos of the AAA Inter-American League. 
Although Johnson guided the team of released and undrafted players to a 
.708 winning percentage, the league folded 72 games into its only season; 
they planned to play a 130-game season.[5] In 1981, Johnson was hired to 
manage the New York Mets AA team, the Jackson Mets, and he led the team 
to a 68-66 record in his only season with the team. In 1983, Johnson was 
named as the manager of the Mets AAA Tidewater Tides, who finished with 
a 71-68 record. Johnson took over the Mets in 1984, a team that had not 
won a pennant since 1973. He became the first National League manager to 
win at least 90 games in each of his first five seasons. The highlight 
of his time with the Mets was winning the 1986 World Series against the 
Boston Red Sox. While with the Orioles in 1969, Johnson was the final out 
in the Miracle Mets World Series win. However, Johnson rankled Mets management 
with his easygoing style. Years later, he summed up his approach to managing 
by saying, "I treated my players like men. As long as they won for me on 
the field, I didn't give a flying fuck what they did otherwise."[6] When 
the Mets struggled early in the 1990 season, starting the season 20-22, 
he was fired. He remains the winningest manager in Mets history and was 
inducted into the Mets Hall of Fame with Frank Cashen, Darryl Strawberry, 
and Dwight Gooden on August 1, 2010. After more than two seasons out of 
baseball, the Cincinnati Reds hired Johnson 44 games into the 1993 season. 
As was the case with the Mets, Johnson revived the Reds almost immediately. 
He led the team to the National League Central lead at the time of the 
1994 players' strike and won the first official NL Central title in 1995. 
However, early in the 1995 season, Reds owner Marge Schott announced Johnson 
would not return in 1996, regardless of how the Reds did. Schott named 
former Reds third baseman Ray Knight (who had played for Johnson on the 
Mets championship team) as bench coach, with the understanding that he 
would take over as manager in 1996. Johnson and Schott had never gotten 
along, and relations had deteriorated to the point that he had nearly been 
fired after the 1994 season. By most accounts, the final straw came because 
Schott did not approve of Johnson living with his fiancée Susan before 
they were married. According to The Washington Post, Schott had decided 
before the 1995 season even started that it would be Johnson's last one 
in Cincinnati.[7] In 1996, Johnson returned to Baltimore as the Orioles' 
manager. The team earned a wild-card playoff berth in his first season. 
It was the Orioles' first trip to the postseason since winning the 1983 
World Series; Baltimore would follow by winning the American League East 
title in 1997. However, Johnson and Orioles owner Peter Angelos never got 
along. In fact, the two men almost never spoke to each other. The end reportedly 
came when Johnson fined Roberto Alomar for skipping a team banquet in April 
1997 and an exhibition game against AAA Rochester during the 1997 All-Star 
Break. Johnson ordered Alomar to pay the fine by making out a check for 
a fine to a charity for which his wife served as a fundraiser. However, 
Alomar donated the money to another charity after players' union lawyers 
advised him of the possible conflict of interest. In negotiations after 
the season, Angelos let it be known that he was considering firing Johnson 
for the Alomar fine. Johnson was prepared to admit he'd made an error in 
judgment regarding the fine, but Angelos demanded that Johnson admit that 
he'd acted recklessly in not leaving the decision to him—which presumably 
would have given Angelos grounds to fire Johnson for cause. Johnson refused 
to do so, and offered his resignation—which Angelos accepted on the same 
day that Johnson was named American League Manager of the Year.[7] The 
Orioles would not have another winning season (or make the post-season) 
again until 2012. In 1999, Johnson was hired as manager of the Los Angeles 
Dodgers. Johnson suffered the only full losing season of his managerial 
career (as of the 2012 season), finishing in third place eight games under 
.500. While the Dodgers rebounded to second place the next year, it was 
not enough to save Johnson's job. Johnson briefly managed the Netherlands 
national team in 2003 during the absence of Robert Eenhoorn, then served 
as a bench coach under Eenhoorn at the 2004 Summer Olympics.[8] He then 
became manager of Team USA, where he managed the United States team to 
a seventh-place finish out of an 18-team field in the 2005 Baseball World 
Cup, held in The Netherlands. The team finished tied for second in its 
group during group play with a 6–2 record before falling, 11–3, to eventual 
winner and 24-time World Cup champion Cuba in the quarterfinals. A subsequent 
9–0 loss to Nicaragua put the Americans into the seventh-place game with 
Puerto Rico, where they prevailed with an 11–3 win. Johnson served as bench 
coach for Team USA during the 2006 World Baseball Classic, managed Team 
USA at the 2008 Summer Olympics, and managed Team USA in the 2009 World 
Baseball Classic. In 2009, Johnson was also the head coach for the Florida 
Collegiate Summer League, DeLand Suns, and returned as the head coach for 
the 2010 Sanford River Rats season.[9] Johnson first joined the Washington 
Nationals front office on June 7, 2006 when he was appointed as a consultant 
by then-vice president/general manager Jim Bowden.[10] He was named a senior 
advisor to current GM Mike Rizzo after the 2009 campaign. He became the 
Nationals manager on June 26, 2011 after the unexpected resignation of 
Jim Riggleman three days earlier. He served as manager for the rest of 
the 2011 season. On October 31, the Nationals announced that Davey Johnson 
would be their manager for the 2012 season.[11] On October 1, 2012, Johnson 
led the Nationals to the franchise's first division title since 1981 (when 
they were the Montreal Expos), eventually achieving a franchise-record 
98 wins—the most wins in baseball that year. On November 10, Johnson signed 
a contract to return as manager of the Nationals for 2013. On November 
13, Johnson was named National League Manager of the Year.[12] On September 
29, 2013, Johnson announced his retirement. In 2014, he became a consultant.[13] 
Johnson was born in Orlando, Florida. He graduated from Alamo Heights High 
School in San Antonio, Texas.[15] He also attended the Johns Hopkins University 
and Texas A&M University, and graduated from Trinity University in 1964 
with a bachelor's degree in mathematics.[15] Johnson is known for taking 
a statistical approach to baseball, and pioneered computer-based sabermetrics 
while managing the Mets.[16] Johnson's daughter, Andrea, was a nationally 
ranked amateur surfer in the late 1980s. Andrea died in 2005 from septic
