Norwood Oval (currently known as Coopers Stadium due to sponsorship from 
the Adelaide-based Coopers Brewery) is a suburban oval in the western end 
of Norwood, an inner eastern suburb of Adelaide, South Australia. Norwood, 
Payneham & St Peters Council own the Oval but rent it to the Norwood Football 
Club. It has been used for a variety of sporting and community events including 
baseball, soccer, rugby league and American football, but its main use 
is for Australian rules football. It is the home ground for the Norwood 
Football Club ("The Redlegs") in the South Australian National Football 
League (SANFL). The oval is one of two sporting venues in Adelaide to carry 
the name of Coopers Stadium. The other is the soccer specific Hindmarsh 
Stadium which also has naming rights sponsorship from Coopers Brewery. 
The Oval has a capacity of 22,000 people, with grandstand seating for up 
to 3,900. The ground record crowd was set in 1971 when 20,280 turned up 
to watch an SANFL match between Norwood and their traditional SANFL rivals 
Port Adelaide. Norwood Oval's dimensions are 165m x 110m making it the 
narrowest ground in use in the SANFL. In the 1950s the Norwood Football 
Club received permission from the then City of Kensington & Norwood to 
install six light towers at the oval. This allowed Norwood to host not 
only night football matches but also night baseball. Regular night SANFL 
night series matches were played at the oval until 1984 when all night 
games were transferred to the SANFL's own Football Park. In 1973 the SANFL 
introduced the 5 team finals for the first time and Norwood Oval holds 
the distinction of hosting the first ever SANFL Elimination Final when 
home team Norwood defeated rivals Port Adelaide by 6 goals. The First Semi-final 
was also held at Norwood in 1973 when reigning premiers (and 1972 Champions 
of Australia North Adelaide, led by 3 time Magarey Medallist Barrie Robran, 
defeated Norwood in a close game bringing an end to the Redlegs 1973 season. 
Night football returned to Norwood Oval during the early 2000s and Friday 
night games at the oval (mostly featuring The Redlegs, though in 2013 Sturt 
will also use the venue for night games after previously using the Adelaide 
Oval) have been a regular feature in the SANFL ever since. With the popularity 
of the Friday night games, other clubs have started installing lights at 
their grounds with Elizabeth Oval (Central District), Richmond Oval (West 
Adelaide), Hickinbotham Oval (South Adelaide) and Glenelg Oval (Glenelg) 
all having installed lights, while Woodville-West Torrens will also play 
selected night games at the Thebarton Oval (the former home ground of West 
Torrens) after the ovals six original light towers were replaced with four 
modern ones by the grounds major tenant, the South Australian Amateur Football 
League. The light towers were upgraded at Norwood Oval in 2010. The six 
light towers that had been in place since the 1950s were replaced with 
4 light towers of television standard positioned at the 'corners' of the 
oval. Norwood Oval was also the scene of Norwood's triumph over East Perth 
in the 1977 National Football League grand final. Norwood has also hosted 
Baseball since 1951 with the South Australian Baseball team being tenants 
until 1988. Between 1951 and 1988 Norwood Oval hosted the Claxton Shield 
competition on six occasions (1951, 1956, 1961, 1966, 1971, 1976 and 1981) 
with the winners being NSW (1951), Victoria (1956 and 1981) and SA (1961, 
`66, `71 and `76). The original Australian Baseball League (ABL) started 
in 1989 with Adelaide represented by the Adelaide Giants. The ABL ran from 
1989 until it folded in 1999 with the Giants playing all of their home 
games at Norwood Oval with most being under lights. During their time in 
the ABL the Giants were affiliated, as were every other team in the league, 
with a team from Major League Baseball. In a massive coup the Giants managed 
to get themselves affiliated with the 1988 World Series champions the Los 
Angeles Dodgers with the team receiving 3-4 'import players' a season from 
the Dodgers Minor League system to complement their array of 'local' talent. 
Unfortunately during the ABL the Giants never made the ABL's championship 
series. Following the collapse of the ABL after 1999 and the short lived 
International Baseball League of Australia (IBLA) which ran from 1999-2000 
until the 2002 the Claxton Shield was revived in 2003 with South Australia 
playing their games at the Thebarton Oval before moving back to Norwood 
Oval in 2009. In August 2010 it was announced that there would be a new 
Australian Baseball League and that Coopers Stadium would be the home ground 
of Adelaide Bite, the team representing Adelaide in the ABL.[1] Prior to 
2009, the baseball diamond at Norwood Oval was located closer to the Wood 
Street stand. The third base line ran almost parallel to the stand, with 
the first base line running east towards the outer side of the ground. 
The diamond was then moved to its present position in 2009. As of February 
2012 Norwood Oval's field dimensions for baseball are:[2] Left Field - 
320 feet (98 m) Centre Field - 390 feet (120 m) Right Field - 290 feet
