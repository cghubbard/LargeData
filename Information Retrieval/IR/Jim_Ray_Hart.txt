James "Jim" Ray Hart (October 30, 1941 – May 19, 2016) was a third baseman 
in Major League Baseball. He played for the National League's San Francisco 
Giants from 1963 to 1973 and the American League's New York Yankees in 
1973 and 1974. Hart batted and threw right-handed. In a 12-season career, 
Hart posted a .278 batting average, with 170 home runs and 578 runs batted 
in (RBIs) in 1,125 Major League games played. Hart had some notable achievements 
in baseball, including: tying for second with Rico Carty in NL Rookie of 
the Year award voting in 1964 (they both finished behind Dick Allen); playing 
in the All-Star game for the National League in 1966; being named NL Player 
of the Month in July 1967 (.355, 13 HR, 30 RBI); and hitting for the cycle 
on July 8, 1970. That same day, he also became one of a select few players 
to have six RBIs in one inning. He did this by hitting a three-run triple 
and a three-run home run in the fifth inning of a game against the Atlanta 
Braves. However, Hart had a reputation as a poor defensive player at third 
base. He finished second, first and second among National League third 
basemen in errors in his first three full seasons in the majors (1964–66), 
never again playing as many as 90 games at third in a season after that. 
In The New Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract, Bill James ranked Hart 
as the 74th-best third baseman of all time, writing about him, "A better 
hitter than 59 of the 73 men listed ahead of him at third base. This should 
tell you all you need to know about his defense."[1] Following his release 
from the major leagues in 1974, Hart played in Mexico before retiring from 
baseball in 1976. He later joined the Teamsters as a Warehouseman for Safeway 
Stores in Richmond, California, and later to Tracy, California, when operations 
moved there in 1992. Hart retired from Safeway in 2006. Hart died on May
