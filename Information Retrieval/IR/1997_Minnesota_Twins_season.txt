The 1997 Minnesota Twins will not be remembered as the strongest team the 
Twins ever fielded. Manager Tom Kelly's team consisted of a few solid players, 
but mainly past-their-prime veterans and never-to-be-established prospects. 
One of the few bright spots was pitcher Brad Radke's breakout season. The 
team finished with a 68-94 record, good enough for fourth place in the 
league's weakest division. In 1996, catcher Terry Steinbach had a 35-home 
run, 100-RBI season with the Oakland Athletics in a contract year. Unfortunately 
for the Twins, he followed it up with a 12-home run, 54-RBI season with 
his hometown team. Scott Stahoviak played in half the games at first base 
but batted only .229. Second baseman Chuck Knoblauch, the team's lone all-star, 
had a great year with the Twins, batting .291 and stealing a career-high 
62 bases; he won his second Silver Slugger Award. The contrast between 
his season and his team's season led him to demand a trade, a demand the 
team obliged by sending him to the New York Yankees the following February. 
Ron Coomer had a competent year at third, with 13 home runs. He declined 
to "ride the pines" to protect a .301 batting average, and finished 1 for 
his last 8 to end at .298. Pat Meares hit .276, an above-average season 
for him. The primary outfielders – Marty Cordova, Rich Becker, and Matt 
Lawton – had mediocre seasons. This was disappointing, because Cordova 
and Becker were coming off of the best years in their careers. Designated 
hitter Paul Molitor had a good year, batting .305 with 89 RBI, but it did 
not match his stellar 1996 numbers. Veterans like Roberto Kelly and Greg 
Colbrunn performed reasonably well off the bench. Brad Radke had a breakout 
year, going 20-10 with an ERA of 3.87. His string of twelve consecutive 
wins in twelve consecutive starts had only been matched twice since 1950. 
Bob Tewksbury and Rich Robertson spent most of the year in the starting 
rotation, but both had losing records. In the final two spots, LaTroy Hawkins, 
Scott Aldred, and Frank Rodriguez respectively had 20, 15, and 15 starts. 
Of these three, Rodriguez was the only one with an ERA under 5. Rick Aguilera 
had a good year as the team's closer, earning 26 saves in not very many 
opportunities. Eddie Guardado, Mike Trombley, Greg Swindell, and Todd Ritchie 
had competent seasons in the bullpen. At the end of the season, Dan Serafini 
played well in six games, giving some hope for the future. Steinbach played 
well at catcher, backed up by Greg Myers. Stahoviak played in 81 games 
at first, with Colbrunn in 64. Knoblauch won a Gold Glove at second base 
in a season that gave no indication of his future throwing problems. Coomer 
(third base) and Meares (shortstop) were average at their positions. The 
three outfielders played well in the field. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7]
