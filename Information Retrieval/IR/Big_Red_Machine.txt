The Big Red Machine were the baseball teams of the Cincinnati Reds that 
dominated the National League from 1970 to 1979. The team is widely recognized 
as being among the best teams in baseball history.[1][2] Over that span, 
the team won six National League West Division titles, four National League 
pennants, and two World Series titles.[3] The team's combined record from 
1970-1979 was 953 wins and 657 losses, an average of more than 95 wins 
per season. Additionally, the core of that Reds team actually had the best 
record in the Major Leagues in 1981, but did not make the postseason that 
year because of Bowie Kuhn's split-season playoff format due to the player's 
strike. The nickname was introduced in a July 4, 1969 article by Bob Hertzel 
in The Cincinnati Enquirer,[4] but gained prominence in reference to the 
1970 team,[5][6][7][8] which posted a regular season record of 102-60 and 
won the National League pennant.[9] Rookie and future-Hall of Fame manager 
Sparky Anderson headed the team,[10] which at its peak featured Pete Rose, 
Johnny Bench, Joe Morgan and Tony Pérez, and was supported by Dave Concepción, 
George Foster, César Gerónimo and Ken Griffey, Sr. [11] The eight players 
most frequently referenced as members of the Big Red Machine include baseball's 
all-time hit leader in Rose;[12] three Hall of Fame players in Bench, Pérez 
and Morgan; six National League MVP selections; four National League home 
run leading seasons; three NL Batting Champions; 25 Gold Glove winning 
seasons, and 63 collective All-Star Game appearances.[13] The starting 
lineup of Bench, Rose, Morgan, Pérez, Concepción, Foster, Griffey, and 
Gerónimo (collectively referred to as the "Great Eight") played 88 games 
together during the 1975 and 1976 seasons, losing only 19.[14] The Cincinnati 
Reds of the 1970s garnered more World Series appearances than any other 
team during that decade, with an overall record of 953 wins and 657 losses.[15] 
They are the only National League team during the last 75 years to win 
back-to-back World Championships. Before them, the 1921 and 1922 New York 
Giants are the last NL team to accomplish this feat.[15] Although some 
of the original players departed the team, some extended the Big Red Machine 
nickname for two more years until the departures of Anderson and Rose following 
the 1978 season.[4] The Reds turned around to finish in second place in 
1977[16] and 1978.[17] The Cincinnati Reds won another division title in 
1979,[18] but lost to the Pittsburgh Pirates in the NLCS. The Big Red Machine 
was part of the rivalry with the two Pennsylvania teams. All of the Reds' 
four pennants in the 1970s came against these teams (Pittsburgh Pirates 
in 1970, 1972, and 1975, and Philadelphia Phillies in 1976). In 1979, Pete 
Rose added to the notion of the Big Red Machine being part of the rivalry 
when he signed with the Phillies and helped them win their first World 
Series championship in 1980. Ray Knight replaced Pete Rose at third base 
for Cincinnati in 1979 and the rest of the Reds starting lineup still included 
six of the great eight: Bench, Morgan, Foster, Concepcion, Griffey and 
Geronimo. Dan Driessen took over at first base for Tony Perez in 1977.[18] 
The Big Red Machine had one last great run in 1981 when they finished the 
strike season with the best record in baseball. Only three of the great 
eight remained in the starting lineup: Foster, Griffey and Concepcion. 
Bench had an injury plagued season and was moved from catcher to third 
base. Tom Seaver had a win-loss record of 14-2 and an ERA of 2.54 while 
starting only 23 games in the Reds' strike-shortened 108-game regular season.[19] 
Despite that, the Reds finished second in the National League West in both 
halves of the season, making them ineligible to compete in the postseason
