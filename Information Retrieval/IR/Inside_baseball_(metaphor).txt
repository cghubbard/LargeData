The phrase "inside baseball" is a term used mainly in the United States.[1] 
It usually refers to a detail-oriented approach to the minutiae of a subject, 
which in turn requires such a specific knowledge about what is being discussed 
that the nuances are not understood or appreciated by outsiders.[2] The 
term is typically applied to discussions of science, technology, sports, 
entertainment, business, law, politics, or related subjects of which the 
public has some general knowledge, but whose inner workings do not need 
to be known in order to understand the concept as a whole. For example, 
a film critic may write a movie review using insider jargon, or information 
which regular movie goers would have little knowledge of or even interest 
in (such as citing the director's previous themes expressed in their movies 
in relation to the one being reviewed, because of the director's fascination 
with a particular school of filmmaking, or technical aspects of filmmaking).
