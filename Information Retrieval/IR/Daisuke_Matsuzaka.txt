NPB MLB Japan National Team Other Daisuke Matsuzaka (松坂 大輔, Matsuzaka Daisuke?, 
born September 13, 1980) is a Japanese professional baseball pitcher for 
the Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks. He has played for the Boston Red Sox, New York 
Mets and Cleveland Indians of Major League Baseball (MLB) and the Seibu 
Lions of Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB). Matsuzaka was selected the 
MVP of the inaugural and the second World Baseball Classic, and is an Olympic 
bronze medalist.[1] He is the first player to have won both a World Baseball 
Classic and a World Series and for 6 years the only one until Robinson 
Canó, Octavio Dotel and Santiago Casilla joined him after the 2013 competition 
and 2006 WBC teammate Koji Uehara did with his 2013 World Series win. Matsuzaka 
was born on September 13, 1980, in Aomori, Aomori Prefecture. He was named 
after Japanese high school star pitcher Daisuke Araki.[2] Growing up in 
Koto, Tokyo, he studied kendo from the age of five to nine and began playing 
organized baseball when he was in 3rd grade. After excelling at the Little 
League and junior high level, Daisuke Matsuzaka was admitted into Yokohama 
High School, a baseball powerhouse, in the spring of 1996. By his second 
of three years, he had developed into the school's ace pitcher. Despite 
his early success, he would experience a setback that summer when he threw 
a go-ahead wild pitch in the semi-final game of the Kanagawa Prefecture 
preliminary round of the National High School Baseball Championship (Summer 
Koshien). During that offseason, his fastballs first began to regularly 
sit around 87 mph (140 km/h). After pitching his school to the championship 
of the National High School Baseball Invitational Tournament (Spring Koshien), 
Matsuzaka set his aim on the 1998 Summer Koshien and eventually led his 
school to the championship. In the quarterfinal of the 1998 Summer Koshien, 
Matsuzaka threw 250 pitches in 17 innings in a win over PL Gakuen.[3] (The 
previous day he had thrown a 148-pitch complete game shutout.) The next 
day, despite trailing 6–0 in the top of the eighth inning, the team miraculously 
won the game after scoring 7 runs in the final two innings (four in the 
eighth and three in the ninth). He started the game in left field, but 
came in as a reliever in the ninth inning to record the win in 15 pitches. 
In the final, he threw a no-hitter,[4] the second ever in a final. This 
performance garnered him the attention of many scouts. After graduating 
from high school, he was taken by the Seibu Lions with the first pick of 
the 1998 draft, although both the Colorado Rockies and Arizona Diamondbacks 
of the North American Major Leagues also recruited him.[5] At first, Matsuzaka 
stated that he wanted to play for the Yokohama BayStars, and, if he could 
not, he would then go to work for a company and after which choose the 
team of his choice through the reverse-draft (gyaku-shimei) system.[6] 
That changed however, when the manager of the Lions, Osamu Higashio, an 
accomplished pitcher in his own right, met with Matsuzaka for dinner. At 
the dinner, Higashio gave Matsuzaka his winning ball for career win number 
200. Matsuzaka accepted it and allowed himself to be drafted by the Lions.[7] 
Matsuzaka won his first official pro game in his first start of the 1999 
season against the Nippon Ham Fighters at the Tokyo Dome. His first career 
strikeout came against Atsushi Kataoka in the first inning on a high fastball 
clocked at 155 km/h (96 mph). He won the game, but he also gave up the 
first home run in the game to Michihiro Ogasawara of the Nippon Ham Fighters.[8] 
On May 16, 1999, when Matsuzaka was in his rookie season at age 18, he 
first faced Ichiro Suzuki, a player for the Orix Bluewave at the time, 
and recorded 3 strikeouts in 3 at-bats with a walk.[9] Matsuzaka states 
that this game was the moment he started to believe that he "belonged" 
in pro baseball. However, Ichiro would get a bit of revenge on Matsuzaka 
by hitting his 100th career home run off him in July of that year. Matsuzaka 
started in the All-Star game as a rookie in 1999. He struck out Takuro 
Ishii and Takanori Suzuki of the Bay Stars before number three hitter Yoshinobu 
Takahashi of the Giants managed to make contact and fly out to left field. 
In his first professional season in 1999, Matsuzaka had 16 wins and 5 losses 
as the team ace, and was voted Rookie of the Year. Another rookie pitcher 
in the rival Central League, Koji Uehara, also won the same honor with 
a 20-win season. Together, they would come to represent their respective 
leagues as dominant starting pitchers for seasons to come. In 2000, Matsuzaka 
had 14 wins and 7 losses. He had 15 wins and 15 losses in his 2001 season 
and won the Eiji Sawamura Award. Matsuzaka spent a considerable portion 
of his 2002 season on the disabled list, which did not count toward his 
service time. He was not able to regain his pitching form in the 2002 Japan 
Series, when the Lions faced the Yomiuri Giants. In Game 1 at Tokyo Dome, 
where the designated hitter rule is not allowed, Matsuzaka batted 7th in 
the lineup to take advantage of his above-average hitting for a pitcher. 
However, not only did Matsuzaka not fare well at the plate in this game, 
but he also helped the Giants to a rout by giving up two key home runs. 
One was to extremely popular Giants first baseman Kazuhiro Kiyohara, who 
hit a middle-of-the-plate Matsuzaka fastball off one of the billboards 
at the back of the left field stands (That footage can be seen in the external 
links section). Matsuzaka would give up another key RBI to Kiyohara in 
game 4 in relief, as the Lions were meekly swept by the Giants in the series. 
In 2003, Matsuzaka logged 16 wins and 7 losses. He easily won the Pacific 
League ERA title with a 2.83 mark. Matsuzaka used to play for Japan's National 
Baseball Team, and pitched against South Korea. He was selected for the 
Nippon Professional Baseball All-Star Game in 1999, 2000, 2001, 2004, 2005, 
2006. He was voted MVP of the 2004 game. On October 25, 2006, Scott Boras 
was announced as Matsuzaka's agent to represent him in any contract dealings 
in the Major Leagues. On November 2, Matsuzaka was officially granted permission 
by the Lions to pursue a career in Major League Baseball via the posting 
system. On November 14, the Boston Red Sox won the bidding rights to Matsuzaka 
with a bid of $51,111,111.11, outbidding the Texas Rangers, New York Mets, 
and New York Yankees.[10][11][12] The enormous figure — two[13][14] to 
three[15] times the Lions' payroll — astounded both Japanese and American 
baseball executives.[15] The Red Sox had 30 days to sign Matsuzaka to a 
contract. If a deal could not be reached, Matsuzaka would have returned 
to the Lions, nullifying the bid. Scott Boras refused to consider the posting 
fee as part of the contract negotiations, while Red Sox general manager 
Theo Epstein recalled, "We tried to come up with a total number, for the 
post and contract, that made sense."[16] On December 11, Epstein, Red Sox 
owner John W. Henry and CEO Larry Lucchino boarded a plane to "[take] the 
fight directly to [Boras]".[17] Nick Cafardo of the Boston Globe asserted 
that Boras, by refusing to negotiate, was using Matsuzaka as a protest 
or "test case of the posting system."[17] On December 13, Matsuzaka and 
Boras joined Red Sox GM Theo Epstein, CEO Larry Lucchino, and Chairman 
Tom Werner on a private plane owned by Red Sox owner John Henry headed 
for Boston. During the flight—which was followed by both the Boston and 
the Japanese media[18]—the group agreed to terms on a contract. Journalist 
Nobuhiro Chiba characterized Japanese reaction to the signing: "I think 
the people are relieved to send Daisuke to the Boston Red Sox."[18] In 
Boston, Matsuzaka passed his physical and signed a six-year, $52 million 
contract, which could have been worth as much as $60 million if he fulfilled 
incentives. The details of the contract included a $2 million signing bonus 
with a $6 million salary in 2007, $8 million in each of the following three 
seasons (2008–2010), and $10 million in each of the final two years (2011–2012).[19] 
He also had a no-trade clause, specially constructed by the Red Sox to 
fit Matsuzaka's contract.[20] The final agreement was announced Thursday, 
December 14 at a 5 p.m. EST news conference at Fenway Park.[21] Afterwards 
some members of the press noted the confusion created by Matsuzaka's translator 
at that announcement. Art Martone of the Providence Journal commented, 
"Matsuzaka's interpreter's command of the English language was shaky, and 
thus the pitcher's translated comments were brief and, occasionally, unintelligible. 
About the only clear statement relayed by the interpreter was when Matsuzaka 
said, 'I’m very happy and excited to be a member of the Boston Red Sox.'"[22] 
Matsuzaka's first major league spring training took place in Fort Myers, 
Florida, with the Red Sox during February and March 2007, wearing number 
18.[23] Matsuzaka pitched well in most of his exhibition starts. He wears 
number 18 because Masumi Kuwata also wears number 18.[24] The number is 
traditionally worn by the ace of a pitching staff in Japan. Matsuzaka made 
his first major league regular season start for the Red Sox on April 5, 
2007 in an afternoon game against the Kansas City Royals at Kauffman Stadium. 
He walked one, recorded 10 strikeouts, and at one point retired 10 consecutive 
batters. He allowed only a solo home run on 6 hits while throwing 108 pitches 
(74 for strikes) over 7 innings and recorded the win as the Red Sox triumphed 
by a score of 4–1. He was, however, beaten 3–0 by Félix Hernández (who 
pitched a one hitter), Ichiro Suzuki, Kenji Johjima, and their Seattle 
Mariners in his Fenway Park debut on April 11, 2007 and defeated again, 
2–1, by the Toronto Blue Jays in his third major league start despite striking 
out 10 Toronto hitters in only 6 innings. Matsuzaka still became the only 
pitcher to strike out 10 or more batters in 2 of his first 3 big-league 
starts since Fernando Valenzuela did so in 1981. In the official press 
conference after the Toronto start, Matsuzaka stated through his interpreter 
that gripping the American baseball—which is slightly larger than the Japanese 
pro ball, with higher seams—had presented some challenges, but that he 
had begun making adjustments and felt they were successful. Matsuzaka pitched 
his first complete game in the major leagues on May 14, 2007, a 7–1 victory 
over the Detroit Tigers; he had pitched well over 60 complete games in 
Japan. Matsuzaka signed a multimillion-dollar exclusive deal with trading 
card company Upper Deck. The terms of the deal were not disclosed.[citation 
needed] On September 28, 2007 Matsuzaka went eight innings and threw 119 
pitches. He allowed six hits and two runs while striking out eight. With 
the win against the Minnesota Twins to secure the Red Sox's place as the 
winner of the Division, he closed out his first Major League season with 
a record of 15–12 and an ERA of 4.40. On October 6, 2007, Matsuzaka made 
his Major League playoff debut in the 2007 ALDS, in front of his home crowd 
in Boston against the visiting Los Angeles Angels. Matsuzaka started the 
game but lasted just 4 and 2/3 innings, giving up 3 earned runs on 7 hits 
before being pulled. Although Matsuzaka did not get the decision, the Red 
Sox eventually beat the Angels 6–3. On October 15, 2007, Matsuzaka started 
in his second playoff game, in game 3 of the 2007 ALCS against the Cleveland 
Indians in Cleveland. Much like his playoff debut, Matsuzaka delivered 
another mediocre outing. Again, Matsuzaka was not able to make it past 
5 innings, lasting 4 and 2/3 innings, giving up 4 earned runs on 6 hits. 
Matsuzaka was pulled after going over the 100-pitch mark. Matsuzaka suffered 
his first career playoff loss as the Indians beat the Red Sox 4–2. Matsuzaka 
fared better in Game 7 of the series, on October 21, 2007, retiring the 
first eight batters he faced. Matsuzaka pitched well for 5 innings, allowing 
2 runs. The Red Sox won 11–2, to advance to the 2007 World Series against 
the Colorado Rockies. Matsuzaka is the first Japanese pitcher to win an 
MLB playoff game and only the fifth rookie to start a game seven in the 
playoffs. On October 27, 2007, he started and led the Red Sox to a 10–5 
win in Game 3 of the 2007 World Series against the Rockies, his first World 
Series appearance, giving up 2 runs on 3 hits and 3 walks, with 5 strikeouts. 
In the game, he also recorded his first major league hit: a two-out 2-run 
single off Josh Fogg, making Matsuzaka the third pitcher in Red Sox history 
to record two RBIs in a World Series game; the others were Babe Ruth (in 
Game 4 of the 1918 World Series) and Cy Young. Matsuzaka is also the first 
Japanese pitcher in World Series history to start and win a game.[25] The 
next day, the Red Sox won the Series in Game 4. Matsuzaka also ended the 
year with the Red Sox rookie record for strikeouts in a season. In the 
beginning of 2008 season, Matsuzaka led the Red Sox pitching staff with 
eight consecutive wins without suffering a single loss. However, on May 
27, he left the game against the Seattle Mariners in the bottom of the 
fifth inning due to a "tired shoulder".[26] The game resulted in a 4–3 
loss. The Red Sox placed Matsuzaka on the disabled list May 30, 2008 with 
a mild right rotator cuff strain. He returned on June 21 but was the losing 
pitcher after giving up 7 earned runs in just one inning of work against 
the St. Louis Cardinals.[27][28] Despite a record of 9–1 and a 3.12 ERA 
at the break, Matsuzaka was not selected to the 2008 American League All-Star 
team. On September 15 he won his 17th game of the season, setting a new 
single-season record for Japanese MLB pitchers, passing previous record 
holder Hideo Nomo. Matsuzaka ended the season with an 18–3 record, 2.90 
ERA and held opponents to a .211 batting average (and 6.9 hits-per-9-innings), 
the lowest in the majors.[29] He also led the AL by leaving 80.6 percent 
of the baserunners he allowed stranded.[30] These numbers were enough to 
place him 4th in the American League Cy Young Award race. However, a major 
problem for Matsuzaka was the control of his pitches, which, combined with 
his lack of innings pitched due to his injury, factored into his Cy Young 
voting. He walked 94 batters in 167 and 2/3 innings (a major-league-leading 
13.1% of all batters he faced), even walking an eye-popping eight in one 
game against the Detroit Tigers on May 5.[31] Eight times in the 2008 season, 
Matsuzaka surrendered walks to five or more batters in a game, and 12 times 
he walked three or more in a game. The interesting statistic is that Matsuzaka 
was 11–1 in the 16 starts he walked three or more batters, which was a 
testament to his ability to wiggle out of whatever trouble he got himself 
into. Matsuzaka started Game 2 of the American League Divisional Series 
against the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim and fared well over five-plus 
innings, handing the ball over to fellow countryman Hideki Okajima. However, 
Game 1 of the 2008 American League Championship Series was where Matsuzaka 
had his first solid postseason start. In 7-plus innings, he no-hit the 
Tampa Bay Rays before giving up a hit to Carl Crawford to start the 7th 
and got the win. However, at home in Game 5, Matsuzaka was rocked in four-plus 
innings for five runs on five hits, walking two, striking out two, and 
giving up three home runs to B.J. Upton, Carlos Peña, and Evan Longoria. 
Boston however staged a miracle comeback to win 8–7. The Tampa Bay Rays 
went on to win the 2008 American League Pennant. When Matsuzaka decided 
to pitch in the 2009 World Baseball Classic, the Red Sox were concerned 
with his decision being that it would cause him to miss a majority of spring 
training. Red Sox manager Terry Francona asked Team Japan manager Tatsunori 
Hara to keep him updated on Matsuzaka's condition along with limiting Matsuzaka's 
pitch count. Throughout the WBC, the Red Sox had limited access to Matsuzaka 
and decided not press the issue more with Hara. Matsuzaka went on to lead 
Team Japan to victory earning the MVP award with a 3–0 record and 2.45 
ERA. On March 27, 2009, Matsuzaka reported to Red Sox spring training only 
twelve days before opening day. In Matsuzaka's first start of the regular 
season, he gave up three home runs against the Tampa Bay Rays, ultimately 
losing the game.[32] In his next game against the Oakland Athletics, Matsuzaka 
only lasted one inning, giving up five hits, five runs, two walks, and 
striking out none.[33] Matsuzaka was quickly placed on the DL, while reliever 
Justin Masterson took his spot in the rotation. Matsuzaka made his next 
start on May 22, 2009, against the New York Mets after being activated 
off the DL. He gave up five runs over five innings, receiving another loss.[34] 
Matsuzaka gained his first win of the season against the Detroit Tigers 
on June 2, 2009, but failed to produce any quality starts. After a loss 
against the Atlanta Braves on June 19, 2009, Matsuzaka was once again placed 
on the disabled list. Red Sox manager Terry Francona stated that Matsuzaka 
was placed on the DL due to "weakness" in his throwing arm possibly caused 
by the extensive pitching he did in the World Baseball Classic. Francona 
also made it clear that it would not be a "two-week DL" stating "We're 
going to have to figure this out. We have a lot of work ahead of us trying 
to get him back to being Daisuke."[35] As of his second placement on the 
DL in the 2009 series, Matsuzaka held a 1–5 record with an 8.23 ERA.[36] 
With Matsuzaka's placement on the DL, it left a spot open in the starting 
rotation for John Smoltz to pitch in after being activated off the DL. 
Although it has been suggested[by whom?] that the high number of innings 
pitched early in his career combined with a vigorous personal training 
regimen is a possible cause of Matsuzaka's sustained injury problems in 
2009, Matsuzaka himself has stated publicly that he feels he cannot maintain 
arm strength without extensive training.[37] On September 15, 2009, Matsuzaka 
made his first start since June, 19. He came and pitched his best outing 
of the season, pitching six plus shut out innings, striking out five, walking 
three, and giving up three hits. In October 2009, Matsuzaka revealed that 
he had in fact injured his hip joint but he did not reveal when he got 
the injury, being red-faced with shame.[38] In early January 2010, Matsuzaka 
was interviewed by Japanese magazine Friday. During the interview, Matsuzaka 
revealed that he had in fact injured his right hip while training for the 
'09 WBC. When asked why he concealed the injury from Team Japan trainers 
and coaches, Matsuzaka replied, "I didn't want to be the center of concern 
for people", and also added, "[The Classic] was hard. I relied on my wits 
and my shoulder strength. I had to be creative. I varied the paces between 
the pitches; I used the different kind of slider that I usually don't throw."[39] 
Matsuzaka also apologized to Red Sox fans, saying, "I am very sorry for 
making you worry. I assure you that the [2010] season will be a great season. 
I am going to redeem what I lost in 2009. With my health back, I am confident 
and determined to produce this year. I will [try my best to] become a world 
champion once again."[40] Matsuzaka missed the first month of the season 
due to a neck strain. He returned on May 1 against the Orioles and gave 
up seven runs, six earned, and seven hits in 4 2/3 innings. Matsuzaka would 
improve during the season in 2010, going 9-6 with a 4.69 ERA in 25 starts, 
but fell well below expectations in terms of consistency and efficiency.[41] 
On May 5, 2011, Matsuzaka made his first relief appearance of his MLB career 
picking up the loss in 1 inning against the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim 
after a 2 and a half-hour rain delay. On May 17, 2011, Matsuzaka was placed 
on the 15 Day disabled list. On June 2, it was reported that he will be 
out for the season due to Tommy John surgery.[42] On June 10, Matsuzaka 
was scheduled to have the surgery.[43] On April 23, 2012, Matsuzaka made 
his first rehab start for the Single-A Salem Red Sox. He gave up a home 
run in each of his first two innings, and ended up giving up three earned 
runs in four innings against the Wilmington Blue Rocks, an affiliate of 
the Kansas City Royals.[44] After stints with both the Portland Sea Dogs 
and Pawtucket Red Sox, Matsuzaka was activated to make his first major 
league start of the season on June 9 against the Washington Nationals. 
He became a free agent at the end of the 2012 season. On February 10, 2013, 
Matsuzaka agreed to a minor league deal with the Cleveland Indians, reuniting 
him with former Red Sox manager Terry Francona.[45] He did not make the 
Indians' Opening Day roster, and was subsequently released from his contract, 
only to sign another minor league deal in March.[46] Matsuzaka was released 
from the Indians' organization per his request on August 20.[47] On August 
22, 2013, Matsuzaka agreed to a major league deal with the New York Mets, 
and joined their starting rotation.[48] During his stint with the Mets 
in 2013, Matsuzaka posted a 3–3 record with an ERA of 4.42.[49] Matsuzaka 
agreed to a one-year minor league contract to stay with the Mets for the 
2014 season on January 24, 2014.[50] On April 16, 2014, Matsuzaka had his 
minor league contract purchased by the Mets, replacing pitcher John Lannan 
on the 40-man roster. On April 24, Matsuzaka earned his second career save 
(first was in Japan in 2000) in a 4-1 victory over the St. Louis Cardinals. 
After the game, Mets manager Terry Collins stated that Matsuzaka was the 
back up option to current closer Kyle Farnsworth. On May 14, Farnsworth 
was outrighted to Triple-A by the Mets, leaving the closer role up for 
grabs, and Matsuzaka as one of the candidates for the job. On May 25, Matsuzaka 
was given his first start as a Met after 14 relief appearances. In his 
start, Matsuzaka went 6 innings and gave up only 2 earned runs on only 
3 hits and got the win in a 4-2 victory over the Arizona Diamondbacks. 
Matsuzaka signed a contract with the SoftBank Hawks on December 5, 2014, 
rejoining Nippon Professional Baseball after eight years in Major League 
Baseball.[51] Hampered by injuries, Matsuzaka pitched in just one game 
for the Hawks' farm team in 2015. He participated in the 2004 Olympic Games 
in Athens, Greece. However, he lost the semifinal game to Australia by 
the score of 1–0. His team later defeated Canada, earning the bronze medal 
for Japan. In 2006, Matsuzaka pitched for Japan in the inaugural World 
Baseball Classic. He was crowned the MVP of the first World Baseball Classic 
after Team Japan defeated Team Cuba 10–6 in the finals. Matsuzaka, the 
winner of the finale, threw 4 innings of 1 run baseball before exiting. 
Overall, Matsuzaka pitched a total of 13 innings throughout the tournament 
while finishing with 3 wins and no losses. There had been talk of Matsuzaka 
wanting to go to Major League Baseball before the '06 WBC, and the tournament 
allowed Matsuzaka to show his skills on the worldwide stage. Interest in 
Matsuzaka from MLB teams boomed after his performance throughout the WBC. 
Matsuzaka was a member of the Japanese team at the 2009 World Baseball 
Classic, playing a key role as they successfully defended their title. 
He also won his second World Baseball Classic MVP award, finishing the 
tournament with a 3–0 record and a 2.45 ERA. In all, he pitched 14 2⁄3 
innings, allowing 4 runs on 14 hits with 5 walks and 13 strikeouts. Daisuke 
chose not to play for the Japanese team at the 2013 World Baseball Classic. 
The team advanced to the semifinal round without Matsuzaka, but failed 
to claim their third consecutive championship when they lost to Puerto 
Rico 3-1 in the semifinal round. Matsuzaka is a right-handed pitcher who 
throws from a three-quarter arm slot in a drop-and-drive motion. He throws 
numerous pitches in his repertoire: a four-seam fastball that sits in 90–94 mph 
(topped out at 97 mph in his first few years in Boston[52]), a two-seam 
fastball in low 90s, a cutter in high 80s, a solid slurve in low 80s, and 
a changeup.[53] Matsuzaka was an accomplished hitter in high school and 
he got his first hit in his first career at-bat, a single to center, in 
a game against the Orix Blue Wave when the Lions ran out of bench players 
and had to allow him to hit for himself. The Pacific League employs the 
designated hitter rule. Matsuzaka's first pro home run came in an interleague 
game against Hanshin Tigers pitcher Darwin Cubillán at spacious Koshien 
Stadium on June 9, 2006. That footage can be seen in the external links 
section. Matsuzaka had his first hit with the Red Sox on May 23, 2010 in 
Philadelphia. He also was tremendous in the post-season with his bat. He 
drove in two runs with a single in Game 3 of the 2007 World Series, during 
a six-run third inning, powering the Red Sox to a victory. Matsuzaka is 
married to television journalist Tomoyo Shibata,[54] formerly of Nippon 
TV in Japan, and in 2005 she gave birth to the couple's daughter.[55] He 
also has a son, born on March 15, 2008.[56] Matsuzaka became involved in 
a scandal when he began dating Shibata. On September 13, 2000, he drove 
to her apartment without a valid license. He illegally parked his car and 
it got towed, and then had a team official take the blame to avoid a scandal. 
The truth soon got out and he was fined 195,000 yen by the police and put 
under house arrest for one month by the Lions.[57] Daisuke is nicknamed 
"The Monster of the Heisei Era" (平成の怪物, heisei no kaibutsu?)[58][59] in 
Japan and "Dice-K" in the United States[60] by the Boston Globe[13][61] 
and USA Today.[62] Baseball players who were born in the 1980 academic 
year (from April 2, 1980 to the following April 1, 1981) have been called 
the "Matsuzaka Generation" in Japan.[63] In response to the 2011 Tōhoku 
earthquake and tsunami, Daisuke gave a charitable donation of $1 million 
to the Japanese Red Cross via the Red Sox Foundation. "Our efforts on the 
field are dedicated to all who are suffering from this catastrophe. We 
are in this together, so we must overcome tragedy together." Matsuzaka 
said in a video message. He joined with the 3 other Red Sox pitchers, team 
captain Jason Varitek, and other members of the Red Sox staff to collect 
fan donations at the gates of two spring training games at City of Palms
