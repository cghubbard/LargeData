Plandome Manor is a village in Nassau County, New York in the United States. 
The population was 872 at the 2010 census. The Incorporated Village of 
Plandome Manor is in the Town of North Hempstead. It is served by the Manhasset, 
New York school district. The Inc. Village of Plandome Manor, incorporated 
in 1931, as well as the villages of Plandome and Plandome Heights to its 
south, derives its name from the Latin 'Planus Domus', meaning plain, or 
level home. The manor house of Matthias Nicoll who was an early mayor of 
New York City and among the first generation of the Nicoll family on Long 
Island, was a wood frame home built in the 1670s, and one of the first 
homesteads in this area of Cow Neck, the original name of the Manhasset/Port 
Washington Peninsula. The manor itself was torn down in 1998 and replaced 
with another estate.[1] Author Frances H. Burnett, author of The Secret 
Garden, built her home, Fairseat, in Plandome Park in 1908, and lived there 
until her death in 1924. Her son, Vivian, and his wife Constance, had built 
a home nearby on Bayview Road after their marriage. Frances Burnett's nephew, 
publisher Archer P. Fahnestock moved into Fairseat after her death, but 
the home burned down leaving only the stucco carriage house and garden 
intact. In 1940, Fahnestock sold it to Leroy Grumman. According to the
