Rae Wilson Scarborough (July 23, 1917 – July 1, 1982) was a starting pitcher 
in Major League Baseball who played for the Washington Senators (1942–1943 
and 1946–1950), Chicago White Sox (1950), Boston Red Sox (1951–52), New 
York Yankees (1952–53) and Detroit Tigers (1953). Scarborough batted and 
threw right-handed. He was born in Mount Gilead, North Carolina. In a ten-season 
career, Scarborough posted an 80–85 win-loss record in 318 games, 168 games 
started, 59 complete games, 9 shutouts, 75 games finished, 12 saves, 1,428 
⅔ innings pitched, 1,487 hits allowed, 755 runs allowed, 656 earned runs 
allowed, 88 home runs allowed, 611 walks, 564 strikeouts, 44 hit batsmen, 
30 wild pitches, 6,297 batters faced, 4 balks and a 4.13 ERA. A Wake Forest 
graduate, Scarborough was used sparingly by the Washington Senators before 
World War II. After spending two years in the military service, he developed 
into a reliable starter. His most productive season came in 1948, when 
he had a 15–8 mark and recorded a 2.82 ERA, being only surpassed by Gene 
Bearden (2.43). In 1949 he won 13 games with the Senators, and again won 
13 in 1950 for Washington (3) and the Chicago White Sox (10), a season 
in which he made his only All-Star appearance. On September 28, 1949, Scarborough 
ended Ted Williams' streak of most consecutive games reaching base safely 
at 84 games.[1] After winning 12 games for the Boston Red Sox in 1951, 
Scarborough was purchased by the New York Yankees in the 1952 midseason, 
as he went 5–1 during New York's successful pennant drive en route to the 
1952 World Series. He played for the Yankees and Detroit Tigers in 1953, 
his last major league season. Scarborough often received attention from 
the press in New York and Boston due to his off-season work as a pickle 
salesman for the Mt. Olive Pickle Company in Mount Olive, N.C. One newspaper 
called him the "Pickle Peddling Pitcher", and others ran cartoons showing 
him dunking opposing players in pickle barrels.[2] Following his playing 
career, Scarborough moved to Mount Olive, North Carolina, where he opened 
an oil and supply company. Later he scouted for the Baltimore Orioles, 
California Angels and Milwaukee Brewers organizations, and also helped 
establish a baseball program at Mount Olive College. He spent the first 
part of the 1968 season on the Orioles' MLB coaching staff. Scarborough's 
grandson Garrett Blackwelder played basketball at East Carolina University 
from 1996 to 2000 and holds several shooting records. Scarborough died
