A sports league is a professional body that governs the competition of 
its teams.[clarification needed] They make the rules for competition and 
behavior and disciplines its members as necessary. This is done through 
a structure that varies by league. Some are made up of a board of governors 
that have a Commissioner or President, while others are single entity organizations 
where the league owns the franchises and therefore does not have a board 
of governors.[clarification needed] A list of professional sports leagues: 
This list attempts to show those sports leagues for which all players and 
teams are paid to play. In other words, these players can be considered 
to play their chosen sport as their profession. Some leagues don't pay 
well enough to allow players to use them as their primary or only source 
of income, but because the players are paid, it's still considered professional, 
or semi-professional. As such, some leagues listed here may not be fully 
professional.  England  India  Finland  Russia  Sweden  United States and
