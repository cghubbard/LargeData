The 1976 Pittsburgh Pirates season was the 90th in the National League, 
and the 95th in franchise history. The Pirates compiled a 92-70 record 
during the season, as they finished in second place in the NL East, nine 
games behind their cross-state rivals, the Philadelphia Phillies. As a 
result, their run of five division titles in a six-year span came to an 
end. It was also the final season for Danny Murtaugh as the Pirates' manager.
