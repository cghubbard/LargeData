Ramiro Mendoza (born June 15, 1972), nicknamed "El Brujo" (The Witch Doctor),[1] 
is a former Major League Baseball pitcher. Mendoza played with the New 
York Yankees (1996–2002, 2005) and Boston Red Sox (2003–04). He batted 
and threw right-handed. Although Mendoza made 62 starts in his major league 
career, he was primarily known as a middle relief pitcher. He threw a sinker 
along with a slider, a four-seam fastball and a changeup. In Mendoza's 
ten seasons in the Major Leagues he was a part of five World Series champion 
teams. In a nine-year career, Mendoza compiled a 59–40 record with 463 
strikeouts and a 4.30 earned run average in 797 innings pitched.[2] Mendoza 
was the only player in the last 75 years to win a World Series ring with 
both the New York Yankees (1996, 1998–2000) and Boston Red Sox (2004) before 
Johnny Damon and Eric Hinske joined that club in 2009. Mendoza made his 
major league debut in 1996, going 4-5 with a 6.79 ERA in his rookie season. 
He did not appear on the postseason roster. In 1997, Mendoza went 8-6 with 
a 4.24 ERA, while starting 15 games, as both a starter and a reliever. 
He also appeared in his first two postseason games in 1997, going 1-1 with 
an ERA of 2.45 while throwing 133 and 2/3 innings, a sharp increase from 
the 53 he pitched in 1996.[2] 1998 was statistically Mendoza's best season, 
as he went 10-2 with an ERA of 3.25, both career bests. In the postseason, 
he pitched 4 1/3 scoreless innings against the Cleveland Indians over two 
games of the American League Championship Series. In the 1998 World Series 
against the San Diego Padres, Mendoza pitched one inning of two hit, one 
run, one strikeout ball in Game 3. He earned his second World Series ring 
when the Yankees swept the Padres.[2] The following year, Mendoza struggled 
to a 9-9 record with an ERA of 4.29 in 123 2/3 innings pitched. That year, 
he started only six games and was quickly moved to the bullpen. He gave 
up 68 runs that year, a career worst, and was left off of the roster for 
the 1999 American League Division Series. He rejoined the team for the 
Championship Series, where he pitched 2 1/3 innings and pickup up a save. 
In the World Series, he pitched 1 2/3 innings of relief and surrendered 
3 hits and 2 runs, all earned, however, he still earned the win as the 
Yankees went on to sweep the Braves 4-0.[2] Mendoza's performance improved 
slightly in 2000 as he went 7-4 with a 4.25 ERA in 65 and 2/3 innings pitched, 
including his first complete game since 1998, and last of his career. Despite 
his improved performance, he was left off of the postseason roster. The 
following year, he was 8-4 with a 3.75 ERA, and returned to the postseason. 
In the 2001 American League Division Series, he pitched in relief during 
three games and allowed only two hits with no runs allowed. In the Championship 
Series, he appeared in relief during three games and allowed one home run, 
(his only earned run in that series), pitching 5 1/3 innings to a 1.69 
ERA. In the 2001 World Series, he pitched 2 and 2/3 innings of 1-hit ball 
as the Yankees fell to the Diamondbacks in seven games. In 2002, Mendoza 
pitched in 62 games to an identical 8-4 record with a slightly better ERA 
of 3.44. He pitched 1 and 1/3 innings in the 2002 American League Division 
Series against the Angels, surrendering only two earned runs as the Yankees 
were defeated three games to one.[2] On October 28, 2002 he was released 
by the Yankees. On July 24, 2004, Mendoza pitched two hitless innings to 
pick up the win against his former team, the Yankees. The Red Sox were 
trailing 9–4, before winning 11–10. After recovering from shoulder surgery 
during the 2005 offseason, Mendoza returned to the Yankees after September 
2005 callups, becoming one of three members of the 2004 Red Sox to play 
for the 2005 Yankees, along with Mark Bellhorn and Alan Embree. After the 
2005 season, Mendoza signed a minor league contract with the Yankees. He 
played for Panama in the 2006, 2009, and 2013 World Baseball Classics. 
In February 2009, he signed a minor league contract with the Milwaukee 
Brewers and received an invitation to spring training,[3] but departed 
spring training after failing a physical.[4] Following his release, he 
subsequently retired from major league baseball. He played for a season
