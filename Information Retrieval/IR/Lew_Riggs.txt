Lewis Sidney Riggs (April 22, 1910 – August 12, 1975) born in Caswell County, 
North Carolina was a third baseman for the St. Louis Cardinals (1934), 
Cincinnati Reds (1935–40) and Brooklyn Dodgers (1941–42 and 1946). He helped 
the Cardinals win the 1934 World Series, the Reds win the 1939 National 
League pennant and 1940 World Series and the Dodgers win the 1941 NL pennant. 
He was named to the 1936 National League All-Star team. His eighth-inning 
pinch single off Red Ruffing scored teammate Cookie Lavagetto in the opening 
game of the 1941 World Series, before Ruffing and the New York Yankees 
held on for a 3-2 victory. Riggs never quite achieved the same level in 
his baseball career after leaving the Dodgers in 1942 in order to serve 
his country in the Army Air Force during World War II. In 10 seasons he 
played in 760 Games and had 2,477 At Bats, 298 Runs, 650 Hits, 110 Doubles, 
43 Triples, 28 Home Runs, 271 RBI, 22 Stolen Bases, 181 Walks, .262 Batting 
Average, .317 On-base percentage, .375 Slugging Percentage, 930 Total Bases 
and 37 Sacrifice Hits. He died of cancer in Durham, North Carolina at the 
age of 65. He was survived by his wife of 30 years, Nellie Dace Hornaday
