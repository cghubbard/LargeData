Timothy Paul Stoddard (born January 24, 1953) is a former Major League 
Baseball pitcher. He is one of only two men to have played in both a World 
Series and a Final Four of the NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship, 
along with fellow East Chicago Washington High School alumnus Kenny Lofton. 
A right-handed pitcher, Stoddard pitched for the Chicago White Sox (1975), 
Baltimore Orioles (1978–83), Chicago Cubs (1984), San Diego Padres (1985–86), 
New York Yankees (1986–88) and Cleveland Indians (1989). Currently, he 
is the pitching coach for the baseball team at Northwestern University. 
The 6'7" Stoddard was born in East Chicago, Indiana, and was a member of 
the 1971 East Chicago Washington High School Senators basketball team, 
which went undefeated (29-0) and won the Indiana state high school basketball 
championship. Among his teammates were Pete Trgovich (who played at UCLA) 
and Junior Bridgeman (who played at Louisville and in the NBA). Stoddard 
also lettered in basketball as well as baseball at North Carolina State 
University.[1] He was a starting forward on the 1973-74 Wolfpack’s NCAA 
Basketball champions, which featured future Basketball Hall-of-Famer David 
Thompson. The Wolfpack went 30-1 on the season, the lone loss coming to 
the Bill Walton-led UCLA Bruins. The Wolfpack gained revenge in the NCAA 
Tournament and defeated UCLA in the Final Four, ending UCLA's seven-year 
run as National Champions. In 1975 Stoddard was signed by the Chicago White 
Sox, who released him after two minor league seasons. He reached the majors 
for good in 1979; that year, he pitched in 29 games, winning three and 
saving three others, with a 1.71 earned run average in 58 innings pitched. 
His Orioles won the American League pennant, but lost to the Pittsburgh 
Pirates in the World Series after leading three games to one. In Game Four, 
Stoddard was the winning pitcher and drove in a run with an eighth-inning 
single, becoming the first player to drive in a World Series run in his 
very first at-bat. (At the time, the World Series only used the designated 
hitter in even-number years.) Stoddard became the Orioles’ closer in 1980, 
pitching in a career-high 64 games and finishing fourth in the AL with 
26 saves, which would stand as a single-season franchise record until Don 
Aase broke it with 34 saves in 1986. Over the next three years he shared 
the closer role with left-hander Tippy Martinez, but his 1983 earned run 
average ballooned to 6.09. That year he was a member of the Orioles 1983 
World Series champions. Stoddard did not pitch in the Series, which the 
Orioles won over the Philadelphia Phillies in five games, but he did become 
the only man ever to win a championship ring in both an NCAA basketball 
championship game and a World Series. After the 1983 season Stoddard was 
traded to the Oakland Athletics for third baseman Wayne Gross. In spring 
training (March 26, 1984) he was again traded, this time to the Chicago 
Cubs for two minor league players. During the season, Stoddard pitched 
in 58 games and posted a 10-6 record and seven saves as the Cubs won the 
National League East title—their first postseason appearance since the 
1945 World Series. The Cubs, however, lost to the San Diego Padres in the 
National League Championship Series after leading two games to none. After 
the season Stoddard signed with none other than the Padres as a free agent. 
After pitching for the Padres for a year and a half, Stoddard was traded 
to the New York Yankees, where he pitched well and served mainly as a setup 
man for Dave Righetti. While pitching against the then-California Angels 
(today the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim) on September 5, 1987, Stoddard 
gave up the first-ever "broken bat" home run to Jack Howell.[2] Stoddard 
was released on August 14, 1988 after posting a 6.38 ERA. He pitched his 
final season (1989) with the Cleveland Indians, pitching in 12 games before 
being released on July 12. In his career, Stoddard pitched in 485 games, 
all in relief. He won 41 games against 35 losses, with a 3.95 ERA and 582 
strikeouts in 729⅔ innings pitched. Stoddard is one of only two men to 
play in both an NCAA Basketball Final Four game, and an MLB World Series. 
Stoddard also served as the baseball advisor and played the role of a Dodger
