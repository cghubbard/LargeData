               The Montreal Canadiens[note 1] (French: Les Canadiens de 
Montréal) are a Canadian professional ice hockey team based in Montreal, 
Quebec, that competes in the National Hockey League (NHL). They are members 
of the league's Atlantic Division in the Eastern Conference. The club's 
official name is le Club de hockey Canadien.[2] The team is frequently 
referred to in English and French as the Habs. French nicknames for the 
team include Les Canadiens (or Le Canadien), Le Bleu-Blanc-Rouge, La Sainte-Flanelle,[3] 
Le Tricolore, Les Glorieux (or Nos Glorieux), Les Habitants, Le CH and 
Le Grand Club. Founded in 1909, the Canadiens are the longest continuously 
operating professional ice hockey team worldwide, and the only existing 
NHL club to predate the founding of the NHL. One of the oldest North American 
professional sports franchises, the Canadiens' history predates that of 
every other Canadian franchise outside of football as well as every American 
franchise outside of baseball and the National Football League's Arizona 
Cardinals. The franchise is one of the "Original Six" teams, a description 
used for the teams that made up the NHL from 1942 until the 1967 expansion. 
The team's championship season in 1992–93 was the last time a Canadian 
team won the Stanley Cup.[4] The Canadiens have won the Stanley Cup more 
times than any other franchise. They have won 24 championships, 22 of them 
since 1927, when NHL teams became the only ones to compete for the Stanley 
Cup.[5] On a percentage basis, as of 2014, the franchise has won 25.3% 
of all Stanley Cup championships contested after the Challenge Cup era, 
making it the second most successful professional sports team of the traditional 
four major sports of Canada and the United States, behind only the Boston 
Celtics.[note 2][6][7] Since 1996, the Canadiens have played their home 
games at Centre Bell, originally known as Centre Molson.[8] The team previously 
played at the Montreal Forum which housed the team for seven decades and 
all but their first two Stanley Cup championships.[note 3] The Canadiens 
were founded by J. Ambrose O'Brien on December 4, 1909, as a charter member 
of the National Hockey Association,[9][10] the forerunner to the National 
Hockey League. It was to be the team of the francophone community in Montreal, 
composed of francophone players, and under francophone ownership as soon 
as possible.[11] The team's first season was not a success, as they placed 
last. After the first year, ownership was transferred to George Kennedy 
of Montreal and the team's fortunes improved over the next seasons.[12] 
The team won its first Stanley Cup championship in the 1915–16 season.[13] 
In 1917, with four other NHA teams, the Canadiens formed the NHL,[14] and 
they won their first NHL Stanley Cup during the 1923–24 season, led by 
Howie Morenz.[15] The team moved from the Mount Royal Arena to the Montreal 
Forum for the 1926–27 season.[16] The club began the 1930s decade successfully, 
with Stanley Cup wins in 1930 and 1931. The Canadiens and its then-Montreal 
rival, the Montreal Maroons, declined both on the ice and economically 
during the Great Depression. Losses grew to the point where the team owners 
considering selling the team to interests in Cleveland, Ohio, though local 
investors were ultimately found to finance the Canadiens.[17] The Maroons 
still suspended operations, and several of their players moved to the Canadiens.[18] 
Led by the "Punch Line" of Maurice "Rocket" Richard, Toe Blake and Elmer 
Lach in the 1940s, the Canadiens enjoyed success again atop the NHL. From 
1953 to 1960, the franchise won six Stanley Cups, including a record five 
straight from 1956 to 1960, with a new set of stars coming to prominence: 
Jean Beliveau, Dickie Moore, Doug Harvey, Bernie "Boom Boom" Geoffrion, 
Jacques Plante and Richard's younger brother, Henri.[19] The Canadiens 
added ten more championships in 15 seasons from 1965 to 1979, with another 
dynastic run of four-straight Cups from 1976 to 1979.[20] In the 1976–77 
season, the Canadiens set two still-standing team records — for most points, 
with 132, and fewest losses, by only losing eight games in an 80-game season.[21] 
The next season, 1977–78, the team had a 28-game unbeaten streak, the second-longest 
in NHL history.[22] The next generation of stars included Guy Lafleur, 
Yvan Cournoyer, Ken Dryden, Pete Mahovlich, Jacques Lemaire, Pierre Larouche, 
Steve Shutt, Bob Gainey, Serge Savard, Guy Lapointe and Larry Robinson. 
Scotty Bowman, who would later set a record for most NHL victories by a 
coach, was the team's head coach for its last five Stanley Cup victories 
in the 1970s.[23] The Canadiens won Stanley Cups in 1986, led by rookie 
star goaltender Patrick Roy,[24] and in 1993, continuing their streak of 
winning at least one championship in every decade from the 1910s to the 
1990s (this streak came to an end in the 2000s).[25] In 1996, the Habs 
moved from the Montreal Forum, their home during 70 seasons and 22 Stanley 
Cups, to Centre Molson (now called Centre Bell).[26] Following Roy's departure 
in 1995, the Canadiens fell into an extended stretch of mediocrity,[27] 
missing the playoffs in four of their next ten seasons and failing to advance 
past the second round of the playoffs until 2010.[28] By the late 1990s, 
with both an ailing team and monetary losses exacerbated by a record-low 
value of the Canadian dollar, Montreal fans feared their team would end 
up relocated to the United States. Team owner Molson Brewery sold control 
of the franchise and the Molson Centre to American businessman George N. 
Gillett Jr. in 2001, with the right of first refusal for any future sale 
by Gillett and a condition that the NHL Board of Governors must unanimously 
approve any attempt to move to a new city.[29] Led by president Pierre 
Boivin, the Canadiens returned to being a lucrative enterprise, earning 
additional revenues from broadcasting and arena events. In 2009, Gillett 
sold the franchise to a consortium led by the Molson family which included 
The Woodbridge Company, BCE/Bell, the QFL Solidarity Fund, Michael Andlauer, 
Luc Bertrand and the National Bank Financial Group for $575 million, more 
than double the $275 million he spent on the purchase eight years prior.[30][31] 
During the 2008–09 season, the Canadiens celebrated their 100th anniversary 
with various events,[32] including hosting both the 2009 NHL All-Star Game,[33] 
and the 2009 NHL Entry Draft.[34] Said season also marked the Canadiens 
as the first team in NHL history to reach 3,000 victories, reaching the 
milestone after their 5–2 victory over the Florida Panthers on December 
29, 2008.[35] The Canadiens organization operates in both English and French. 
For many years, public address announcements and press releases have been 
given in both languages, and the team Web site and social media outlets 
are in both languages as well. One of sport's oldest and most recognizable 
logos, the classic 'C' and 'H' of the Montreal Canadiens was first used 
together in the 1917–18 season, when the club changed its name to "Club 
de hockey Canadien" from "Club athlétique Canadien",[36] before evolving 
to its current form in 1952–53. The "H" stands for "hockey", not "Habitants," 
a popular misconception.[37] According to NHL.com, the first man to refer 
to the team as "the Habs" was American Tex Rickard, owner of the Madison 
Square Garden, in 1924. Rickard apparently told a reporter that the "H" 
on the Canadiens' sweaters was for "Habitants".[38] The team's colours 
since 1911 are blue, red, and white. The home sweater is predominantly 
red in colour. There are four blue and white stripes, one across each arm, 
one across the chest and the other across the waistline. The main road 
sweater is mainly white with a red and blue stripe across the waist, red 
at the end of both arm sleeves red shoulder yokes. The basic design has 
been in use since 1914 and took its current form in 1925, generally evolving 
as materials changed.[39] Because of the team's lengthy history and significance 
in Quebec, the sweater has been referred to as 'La Sainte-Flanelle' (the 
holy flannel sweater).[3] The Canadiens used multiple designs prior to 
adopting the aforementioned design in 1914. The original shirt of the 1909–10 
season was blue with a white C. The second season had a red shirt featuring 
a green maple leaf with the C logo, and green pants. Lastly, the season 
before adopting the current look the Canadiens wore a "barber pole" design 
jersey with red, white and blue stripes, and the logo being a white maple 
leaf reading "CAC", "Club athlétique Canadien".[39] All three designs were 
worn during the 2009–10 season as part of the Canadiens centenary.[40] 
The Canadiens' colours are a readily identifiable aspect of French Canadian 
culture. In the short story "The Hockey Sweater", Roch Carrier described 
the influence of the Canadiens and their jersey within rural Quebec communities 
during the 1940s.[41] The story was later made into an animated short, 
The Sweater, narrated by Carrier.[42] A passage from the short story appears 
on the 2002 issue of the Canadian five dollar bill.[43][44] Nos bras meurtris 
vous tendent le flambeau, à vous toujours de le porter bien haut. To you 
from failing hands we throw the torch. Be yours to hold it high. The motto 
is from the poem "In Flanders Fields" by John McCrae which was written 
in 1915, the year the Canadiens won their first Stanley Cup championship. 
The motto appears on the wall of the Canadiens dressing room.[45] Beginning 
in the 2004–05 NHL season, the Canadiens adopted Youppi as their official 
mascot, the first costumed mascot in their long history. Youppi was the 
longtime mascot for the Montreal Expos baseball team, but was dropped from 
the franchise when they moved to Washington, D.C. in 2004 and became the 
Washington Nationals. With the switch, Youppi became the first mascot in 
professional sports to switch leagues.[46] The Canadiens have developed 
strong rivalries with two fellow Original Six franchises, with whom they 
frequently shared divisions and competed in post-season play. The oldest 
is with the Toronto Maple Leafs, who first faced the Canadiens as the Toronto 
Arenas in 1917. The teams met 15 times in the playoffs, including five 
Stanley Cup finals. Featuring the two largest cities in Canada and two 
of the largest fanbases in the league, the rivalry is sometimes dramatized 
as being emblematic of Canada's English and French linguistic divide.[47][48] 
From 1938 to 1970, they were the only two Canadian teams in the league. 
The team's other Original Six rival are the Boston Bruins, who since their 
NHL debut in 1924 have played the Canadiens more than any other team in 
both regular season play and the playoffs combined. The teams have played 
34 playoff series, seven of which were in the finals.[49][50] The Canadiens 
also had an intraprovincial rivalry with the Quebec Nordiques during its 
existence from 1979-1995, nicknamed the "Battle of Quebec." Montreal Canadiens 
games are broadcast locally in both the French and English languages. On 
radio, Canadiens games are broadcast in French by CHMP 98.5,[51] and in 
English by CKGM, TSN Radio 690, who acquired the English broadcast rights 
under a 7-year deal which began in the 2011-12 season.[52] Regional television 
rights in French are currently held by Réseau des sports under a 12-year 
deal, effective as of the 2014–15 NHL season.[53] A sister to the English-language 
network TSN, RDS was the only French-language sports channel in Canada 
until the 2011 launch of TVA Sports,[54] and was also the previous national 
French rightsholder of the NHL; as a result, the Canadiens forewent a separate 
regional contract, and allowed its games to be televised nationally as 
part of RDS's national rights package.[55] With TVA Sports becoming the 
national French rightsholder in the 2014–15 season through a sub-licensing 
agreement with Rogers Communications,[55] RDS parent company Bell Media 
subsequently announced a 12-year deal to maintain regional rights to Canadiens 
games not shown on TVA Sports. As a result, games on RDS are blacked out 
outside of the Canadiens' home market of Quebec, Atlantic Canada and parts 
of Ontario shared with the Ottawa Senators.[53] At least 22 Canadiens games 
per season (primarily through its Saturday night La super soirée LNH), 
including all playoff games, are televised nationally by TVA Sports.[56][57] 
Regional television rights in English are held by Sportsnet East in a 3-year 
deal announced by Rogers on September 2, 2014, with selected games (three 
in its inaugural season) airing on CJNT City Montreal. The remaining games 
are aired nationally through Rogers' aforementioned NHL rights deal (including 
additional games on Sportsnet, City, or on CBC during Hockey Night in Canada), 
thus giving Rogers rights to over all English-language telecasts of the 
Canadiens.[58] Regional Canadiens games on Sportsnet East and City are 
called by John Bartlett and Jason York.[59] TSN previously held regional, 
English-language television rights to the Canadiens from 2010 through 2014. 
They were broadcast on a part-time TSN feed with Dave Randorf on play-by-play; 
these rights were not renewed by Bell Media past the 2013–14 season.[51][60]

the most of any team in the NHL. All of the honourees were born in Canada. 
Howie Morenz was the first honouree, on November 2, 1937.[66] Sixty-two 
people associated with the Canadiens have been inducted into the Hockey 
Hall of Fame. Thirty-six of these players are from three separate notable 
dynasties: 12 from 1955–60, 11 from 1964–69 and 13 from 1975–79. Howie 
Morenz and Georges Vezina were the first Canadiens given the honour in 
1945, while Rogatien Vachon was the most recently inducted, in 2016.[67] 
The following are members of the Hockey Hall of Fame in the Builders category. 
The first inductee was Vice-President William Northy in 1945. The most
