Donald Zackary "Zack" Greinke (/ˈɡrɪŋki/ GRAIN-kee; born October 21, 1983) 
is an American professional baseball pitcher for the Arizona Diamondbacks 
of Major League Baseball (MLB). He previously played for the Kansas City 
Royals, Milwaukee Brewers, Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, and Los Angeles 
Dodgers. The Royals selected Greinke in 2002 MLB draft after he won the 
Gatorade National Player of the Year Award as a high school senior. After 
playing in the minor leagues, he made his MLB debut in 2004. His career 
was almost derailed by his battles with depression and anxiety in 2005–2006, 
and he missed most of the 2006 season. He returned in 2007 as a relief 
pitcher before rejoining the starting rotation in 2008 and developing into 
one of the top pitchers in the game. In 2009, he appeared in the MLB All-Star 
Game, led the major leagues in earned run average, and won the American 
League Cy Young Award. Donald Zackary Greinke was born in Orlando, Florida, 
the son of teachers Donald and Marsha Greinke. He was active in Little 
League and also excelled in tennis and golf tournaments as a youth.[1][2] 
As a teenager, Greinke helped lead his team to the Senior League World 
Series title in 1999. He played shortstop for the team and his coach estimated 
that he hit close to .700 in the tournament.[3] Greinke was primarily a 
shortstop when he started playing baseball at Apopka High School. He hit 
over .400 with 31 home runs in his high school career.[4] He worked as 
a relief pitcher as a sophomore and junior, before becoming a starting 
pitcher as a senior.[4] During his senior season, in 2002, Greinke compiled 
a 9–2 win-loss record, a 0.55 earned run average (ERA), and 118 strikeouts 
in 63 innings. He also held opposing batters to a .107 average.[4] He led 
his team to a 32–2 record and their third straight district title, and 
he was selected as Gatorade National Player of the Year.[5] After the high 
school season ended, he played in the Florida Athletic Coaches Association 
All-Star Classic and impressed pro scouts with his performance against 
some of the best hitters in the country.[6] Greinke was selected in the 
first round of the 2002 Major League Baseball draft by the Kansas City 
Royals,[7] who felt he was a polished player who could move quickly through 
their system.[4] Greinke turned down a scholarship offer from Clemson University[8][9] 
to sign with the Royals for a $2.5 million signing bonus.[10] Greinke pitched 
in six minor league games for the Royals farm teams in 2002: three games 
for the Gulf Coast Royals, two for the Low-A Spokane Indians, and two innings 
for the High-A Wilmington Blue Rocks of the Carolina League. He had a 3.97 
ERA in 11 1⁄3 innings.[11] In 2003, Greinke opened the season with Wilmington, 
where he was 11–1 with a 1.14 ERA in 14 starts.[12] Those numbers earned 
spots on the Carolina League mid-season[13] and post-season all-star teams 
as well as Carolina League Pitcher of the Year award.[14] The Blue Rocks' 
manager, Billy Gardner, Jr., remarked that Greinke was "the best pitcher 
I've ever seen at this level of the minor leagues."[15] He was promoted 
in July to the AA Wichita Wranglers of the Texas League,[15] where in nine 
starts he was 4–3 with a 3.23 ERA.[16] He had a couple of games where he 
struggled at Wichita and gave up a lot of runs. However, he bounced back 
and helped them make the playoffs with a victory in the final game of the 
season.[15] Greinke was named the organization's Minor League Pitcher of 
the Year for 2003.[17] He was promoted by the Royals in 2004 to the Omaha 
Royals of the Pacific Coast League, where he was 1–1 with a 2.51 ERA in 
six starts.[18] Greinke was called up to the major leagues on May 22, 2004, 
and made his major league debut against the Oakland Athletics, allowing 
two runs in five innings. At 20 years old he was the youngest player in 
the majors and came close to picking up the win, but the team's closer, 
Jeremy Affeldt, gave up the lead with two outs in the bottom of the ninth 
inning.[19][20] Greinke recorded his first career win on June 8, when he 
pitched seven scoreless innings against the Montreal Expos.[21] His first 
major league hit was a home run off Arizona Diamondbacks pitcher Russ Ortiz 
in a 12–11 loss on June 10, 2005; however he also allowed 15 hits in that 
game, which tied a club record.[22] Greinke was quiet and sometimes awkward 
in the clubhouse. To alleviate some of his anxiety and solitude, the Royals 
arranged for him to live with Royals Hall of Fame third baseman George 
Brett.[23] Still, Greinke's uneasiness grew. By the 2005–2006 offseason, 
he almost quit baseball. Greinke later remarked that, at the time, he did 
not expect to return to baseball.[24] He left spring training for personal 
reasons in late February 2006.[25] It was later revealed that he was suffering 
from social anxiety disorder and depression.[26] He reported back to the 
Royals' spring training facility in Surprise, Arizona, on April 17, where 
he underwent ongoing pitching sessions. He was placed on the 60-day disabled 
list due to psychological issues and took time away from baseball entirely.[27] 
He began seeing a sports psychologist and taking anti-depressant medication.[23] 
In 2007, Greinke returned to the Royals rotation at the start of the season, 
but was sent to the bullpen in early May.[28] Greinke returned to the rotation 
in 2008 and performed well that season. His 3.47 ERA was the best by a 
full-time Royals starter in 11 years.[29] On January 26, 2009, he agreed 
to a four-year contract with the Royals worth $38 million.[29] After ending 
the 2008 season with 15 scoreless innings, Greinke started off 2009 by 
not allowing a run in his first 24 innings, which meant that for 39 innings 
in a row, he had not given up a run.[30] Greinke was named American League(AL) 
Pitcher of the Month for April, his five wins, 0.50 ERA and 44 strikeouts 
all tops in the Majors.[31] On August 25, Greinke struck out 15 batters, 
breaking Mark Gubicza's team record for strikeouts in a single game.[32] 
On August 30, Greinke had a one-hit complete game against the Seattle Mariners.[33] 
Greinke's record for the 2009 season was 16–8, and he posted an ERA of 
2.16, the lowest in MLB. On October 21, he was named American League Pitcher 
of the Year by Sporting News.[34] On October 28, Greinke was awarded the 
MLBPA Players Choice AL Pitcher of the Year. On November 17, 2009, he won 
the AL Cy Young Award.[35] Greinke credited some of his performance to 
his use of "modern pitching metrics" — statistics on team defense and defense 
independent pitching statistics — to calibrate his own approach to pitching. 
Greinke specifically mentioned FIP (fielding independent pitching), an 
indicator developed by sabermetrician Tom Tango, as his favorite statistic. 
"That's pretty much how I pitch, to try to keep my FIP as low as possible.[36] 
On December 17, 2010, Greinke reportedly asked the Royals to trade him, 
claiming that he was not motivated to play for a rebuilding team.[37] The 
Royals were unlikely to afford signing Greinke to a long-term deal once 
he became a free agent, so they agreed to trade him for some quality prospects.[38] 
On December 19, he was traded to the Milwaukee Brewers with Yuniesky Betancourt 
and $2 million for Alcides Escobar, Lorenzo Cain, Jeremy Jeffress, and 
Jake Odorizzi. He was given the number 13, instead of his preferred number 
23, due to number 23 already being issued to Rickie Weeks.[39] Greinke 
would later admit that he handled the trade request poorly, that he was 
"pretty rude" on the way out,[40] but the deal worked out well for both 
teams.[41] In February 2011, before reporting to his first spring training 
with the Brewers, Greinke suffered a fractured rib while playing basketball.[42] 
He started the 2011 season on the disabled list.[43] Greinke made his Brewers 
debut in the second game of a doubleheader on May 4, 2011.[44] Despite 
missing the first month of the season because of his injury, Greinke finished 
second on the team in wins with a 16–6 record. He also had a 3.83 ERA, 
and 201 strikeouts (7th in the National League (NL)) in 171 innings pitched 
while surrendering 45 walks. Greinke became only the fifth Brewer pitcher 
to strike out 200+ batters in a season. He was fourth in the NL in won-lost 
percentage (.727) and sixth in wins.[45] He went a perfect 11–0 in his 
starts at Miller Park, the Brewers' home stadium.[46] On April 7, 2012, 
the Brewers defeated the Cardinals 6–0 in Greinke's first start of the 
season after he pitched seven scoreless innings while giving up four hits 
and striking out 7.[47] In an oddity, Greinke became the first pitcher 
to start three straight games in the Majors in 95 years. On July 7, he 
was ejected from the game after just 4 pitches for angrily throwing the 
ball into the ground following a close play at first base. The following 
day, Greinke started again, but lasted only until the third inning.[48] 
The All-Star break followed, and Greinke was the Brewers' starter on July 
13, the team's next game. Greinke's third start ended after 5 innings. 
Before this, the most recent pitcher to start three consecutive games was 
Red Faber in the 1917, who started both games of a September 3 doubleheader, 
throwing just six innings in total, followed by a complete game win the 
following day.[49] Greinke never recorded a loss in any of his starts at 
Miller Park.[50] Despite his success with the Brewers, the team was struggling 
and not likely to make a playoff run. When talks on a contract extension 
broke down, the team traded Greinke to the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim 
on July 27 in exchange for top infield prospect Jean Segura and pitchers 
Ariel Peña and Johnny Hellweg. Brewers General Manager Doug Melvin remarked 
that it was one of the tougher decisions he had to make because he was 
very fond of Greinke.[50] Greinke made his first start for the Angels on 
July 29.[51] After a stretch of four unproductive starts from August 3–19 
(1–1, 7.20 ERA in 25 innings), Greinke followed up with four consecutive 
starts of at least seven innings and two or fewer runs — all of them wins. 
In those starts, he produced a 1.88 ERA in 28 1⁄3 innings.[51] Greinke 
became the first pitcher since 1920 to record 13 strikeouts in five innings 
or less in a game against the Seattle Mariners on September 25. He then 
combined with four other Angels pitchers to tie an American League record 
by striking out 20 batters in a nine-inning game.[52] He finished his time 
with the Angels with a 6–2 record and a 3.53 ERA in 13 starts.[51] Greinke 
agreed to a six-year free agent contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers worth 
$147 million, on December 8, 2012. The deal, which was finalized on December 
10, was the largest ever for a right-handed pitcher at the time it was 
signed.[53] It was surpassed a year later by Félix Hernández's seven-year 
$175 million contract extension with the Seattle Mariners.[54] Greinke 
later claimed that he chose the Dodgers over the Texas Rangers, who also 
were pursuing him, primarily because they offered more money.[55] On April 
11, 2013, Greinke fractured his left collarbone in a brawl with Carlos 
Quentin of the San Diego Padres after Quentin was hit by an inside pitch 
and charged the mound.[56] He was placed on the disabled list and it was 
revealed that he would require surgery,[57] which was performed on April 
13.[58] It was estimated that he would miss eight weeks of the season. 
However, he returned to action on May 10 when he pitched in a rehab game 
for the Class-A Rancho Cucamonga Quakes.[59] He returned to the Dodgers 
on May 15.[60] On June 11, 2013, Greinke was hit in the head and neck area 
by Arizona Diamondbacks pitcher Ian Kennedy, leading to a bench-clearing 
brawl. Because Greinke did not participate in the fight, he was not ejected.[61] 
Greinke picked up his 100th career win on August 5, 2013, against the St. 
Louis Cardinals. He was 5–0 with a 1.23 ERA during the month of August 
and was selected as National League Pitcher of the Month.[62] Greinke finished 
his first season with the Dodgers with a 15–4 record and 2.63 ERA in 28 
starts. He also batted .328, the highest batting average for a Dodgers 
pitcher since Orel Hershiser in the 1993 season.[63] He was awarded with 
the Silver Slugger Award as the best hitting pitcher in the National League.[64] 
Greinke began the 2014 season by setting an MLB record with 22 straight 
starts (dating back to July 2013) where he allowed two or fewer earned 
runs.[65][66] He was selected to the National League squad at the 2014 
Major League Baseball All-Star Game[67] and finished the season with a 
17–8 record and a 2.71 ERA in 32 starts, the highest win total in his career.[45] 
He won the Gold Glove Award as the best fielding pitcher in the National 
League.[68] When Justin Upton of the San Diego Padres homered against Greinke 
in the eighth inning on June 13, 2015, it was the last run he surrendered 
until the All-Star break.[69] Greinke was then selected to the All-Star 
Game, his second straight appearance,[70] and subsequently chosen to be 
the starting pitcher for the National League squad. At that point in the 
season, Greinke carried a major league-leading 1.48 ERA with a 7–2 record 
and 35 2⁄3 consecutive scoreless innings.[71] After Greinke retired 28 
consecutive batters over a span of two starts, Nationals outfielder Michael 
Taylor ended the streak in the third inning on July 19.[72] His scoreless 
inning streak lasted until a July 26 start against the New York Mets at 
Citi Field. He shared the NL player of the week honors with his teammate 
Clayton Kershaw for July 13–19.[73] Greinke finished the 2015 season with 
a 19–3 record, 200 strikeouts and a major league best 1.66 ERA.[74] His 
ERA was the second lowest in Dodgers history behind Rube Marquard in 1916, 
and his ERA+ (225) and WHIP (0.844) were the best in franchise history.[75] 
Greinke pitched in two games in the 2015 National League Division Series 
against the New York Mets. He allowed five runs in 13 2⁄3 innings and took 
the loss in the deciding fifth game in the series.[76] At the conclusion 
of the series, it was announced that he would opt out of the last three 
years of his contract with the Dodgers and become a free agent.[77] He 
officially opted out on November 3.[78] After the season, Greinke was selected 
as the Outstanding National League Pitcher at the Players Choice Awards,[79] 
and won his second Gold Glove Award.[80] Greinke finished second in the 
NL Cy Young Award voting to Jake Arrieta.[81] On December 8, 2015, Greinke 
signed a six-year, $206.5 million contract with the Arizona Diamondbacks.[82] 
Greinke started on Opening Day 2016 at Chase Field against the Colorado 
Rockies; he gave up seven runs in four innings, including two home runs 
to rookie shortstop Trevor Story, who was making his MLB debut. The Diamondbacks 
lost the game 10–5.[83] In his second start, on April 9, Greinke matched 
up against Kyle Hendricks and the Chicago Cubs. He allowed three runs in 
the first inning, and struggled through the rest of his outing. The Diamondbacks 
lost the game 4–2. Greinke got his first win as a Diamondback on April 
19, 2016 against the San Francisco Giants, allowing just one run in over 
six innings of work.[84][85] On July 3, 2016, Greinke was placed on the 
15-day disabled list due to a left oblique strain.[86][87] On August 24, 
2016, he recorded his 2000th career strikeout in the Diamondbacks' 10–9 
win over Atlanta Braves.[88] Greinke throws six different pitches: His 
curveball, like Madison Bumgarner, has two speeds with different types 
of movement, though he throws his slow curveball much more frequently than 
does Bumgarner, and will sometimes throw a curve that is more in the middle 
range combining the types of movement. His two-seamer is his most-used 
pitch against right-handed hitters and is used more frequently than against 
lefties, as is his slider. His changeup is only thrown to left-handed hitters. 
Greinke's curveball is typically used early in the count, while his slider 
is his most common 2-strike pitch.[90] Greinke's slider has been one of 
his more effective pitches. Hitters have only a .154 batting average and 
.230 slugging percentage against the pitch. It has produced 51% of his 
strikeouts. Its whiff rate is 42%, and more than half the pitches put in 
play are ground balls.[91] However, he limits the use of the slider in 
order to not put excessive strain on his arm.[92] Greinke has produced 
good strikeout-to-walk ratios throughout his career, finishing in his league's 
top 10 five times[45] and ranking fifth among active pitchers in the category, 
at 3.5:1 as of the start of the 2014 season.[93] Greinke has been described 
as a "scientist as a pitcher" and is known for preparing for each start 
more extensively than most.[94] Greinke is married to Emily Kuchar, whom 
he met while attending Apopka High School. Kuchar is a former Dallas Cowboys 
Cheerleader and was Miss Daytona Beach USA 2008.[95][96] On April 17, 2015, 
Kuchar announced via Twitter that they were expecting their first child. 
Their son, Bode, was born on July 23, 2015.[97] His younger brother, Luke, 
was also a pitcher. Luke played college baseball at Auburn University[98] 
and was drafted by the New York Yankees in the 12th round of the 2008 MLB 
draft,[99] but was out of baseball a year later because of injuries.[100]
