Robert Henry "Bob" Bescher (February 25, 1884 â€“ November 29, 1942) was 
a baseball outfielder who played 11 seasons in the major leagues. Born 
in London, Ohio, he played his best seasons with the Cincinnati Reds, and 
was one of the National League's best base stealers during his time. Bescher 
originally attended the University of Notre Dame, but did not play college 
baseball there. He played college football at Wittenberg University before 
signing his first minor league contract in 1906. In September 1908, he 
joined the Reds for the first time and became the team's regular left fielder 
in 1909. The switch-hitting Bescher played 5 seasons with Cincy, and established 
himself as a dangerous player on the basepaths with the Reds. He led the

81 stolen bases in 1911 set a league record which was not broken for over 
50 years. Outside of stolen bases, he was the NL leader in runs in 1912, 
and was the NL leader in walks in 1913. Also in 1912, he hit a career-best 
.282 and finished 5th in voting for the Chalmers Award, a forerunner to 
the modern MVP award. He played for the New York Giants in 1914, after 
being traded there in exchange for Buck Herzog, and hit .270 in his lone 
year in the Big Apple. Three seasons with the St. Louis Cardinals followed, 
which ended after he was traded to the minor league Milwaukee Brewers, 
the trade coming at a time before minor league teams were affiliated with 
Major League clubs. Bescher eventually returned to the majors in 1918 to 
play 25 games for the Cleveland Indians to end his big league career, although 
he continued to play in the minor leagues into his 40s. He settled back 
down in London after his Major League career to run a local lodge. He later
