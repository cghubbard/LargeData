Sheridan is an 'L' station on the CTA's Red Line. It is an elevated station 
with two island platforms, located at 3940 North Sheridan Road, in the 
Wrigleyville neighborhood of Chicago's Lakeview community area. Sheridan 
is the closest 'L' stop to Graceland Cemetery, which is about one-half 
mile to the west on Irving Park Road. The Sheridan station is one of only 
two remaining 'L' stations that were built on S-curves; Indiana on the 
Green Line is the other. Beginning spring 2007 and lasting through 2009, 
northbound and southbound Purple Line Express trains stop at Sheridan before 
Chicago Cubs weekday night games in order to provide more service to nearby 
Wrigley Field. Previously, trains had stopped at the Addison station to 
the south but that station does not have platform access to the express 
tracks as Sheridan does, which required Purple Line trains to cross over 
to the Red Line tracks. In order to prevent this from adding to delays 
caused by the Brown Line reconstruction, the stop was moved to Sheridan.[3] 
Recently, Inbound Express Purple Line has begun stopping at Sheridan as 
well as Wilson and Addison during the morning rush hour. As part of the 
recommended Red & Purple Modernization Project, the Sheridan station will 
potentially be replaced with a new Irving Park station if the CTA decides 
not to go with the "no action" alternative.[4] Until 2017, AM Loop-bound 
Purple Line express trains will share 95th-bound Red Line tracks, due to 
the Wilson station reconstruction.[5] CTA Although the station has two 
island platforms—potentially giving access to all four tracks that run 
through the station—normally only the Red Line, which runs on the inner 
tracks, stops at the station. The outside tracks are used during weekday 
rush hours by Purple Line Express trains, which typically pass through 
the station without stopping on the express leg of their route between
