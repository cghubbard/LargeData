The 2015 American League Wild Card Game was a play-in game during Major 
League Baseball's (MLB) 2015 postseason played between the American League's 
(AL) two wild card teams, the New York Yankees and the Houston Astros. 
It was held at Yankee Stadium on October 6, 2015.[1] The Yankees clinched 
a wild card berth on October 1,[2] while the Astros clinched a wild card 
berth on October 4, the final day of the regular season.[3] The Yankees 
hosted the game, as they finished the regular season with a better win-loss 
record. This was the Astros' first postseason appearance as an American 
League team, and first overall since 2005, while the Yankees appeared in 
the postseason for the first time since 2012. As such, this was the first 
postseason meeting between the Astros and the Yankees.[4] It was also the 
Astros' first playoff win since Game 6 of the 2005 National League Championship 
Series. In addition, with the Yankees being the first to be eliminated, 
all four remaining teams in the ALDS were expansion teams. The Astros defeated 
the Yankees, 3–0. Houston's Dallas Keuchel struck out seven batters and 
allowed only three hits in six innings of work, and the Astros' bullpen 
then retired nine of ten Yankee batters for the victory.[5] The Astros 
were paced offensively by leadoff home runs by Colby Rasmus in the second 
inning and Carlos Gómez in the fourth, as New York starter Masahiro Tanaka 
struggled to find command of his pitches.[6] Tanaka lasted five innings, 
striking out three.[7] Houston's Jose Altuve scored Jonathan Villar from 
second base in the seventh inning against Yankee reliever Dellin Betances,
