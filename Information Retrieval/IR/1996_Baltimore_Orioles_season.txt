The 1996 Baltimore Orioles season in which the Orioles finishing 2nd in 
the American League East with a record of 88 wins and 74 losses and qualifying 
for the post-season as the Wild Card team. The Orioles broke the all-time 
record for most home runs hit by a team (set at 240 by the 1961 New York 
Yankees) with 257. During the season, four Orioles scored at least 100 
runs, four drove in at least 100 runs and seven hit at least 20 home runs. 
The Orioles pitching staff allowed 209 home runs, 1,604 hits and had an 
ERA of 5.15. The Orioles defeated the Cleveland Indians in the ALDS and

Orioles re-acquired longtime Oriole Eddie Murray from the Cleveland Indians 
in exchange for pitcher Kent Mercker.[32] Murray, a member of the 1983 
World Series Champion Baltimore Orioles, would subsequently hit his 500th 
career home run later in the season. As a commemoration of this event, 
an orange seat was installed in the outfield stands where Murray's 500th 
home run landed. The Orioles had a record of 49 wins and 46 losses before 
the trade, and 39â€“28 after the trade, not including the playoffs. During 
the 1996 playoffs, Eddie Murray hit .333 and hit HR while producing 3 home 
runs. The trade for Eddie Murray sparked the Orioles to have a better record 
after his arrival, than before. One can attribute that to his great leadership, 
which is well documented, as a Sporting News correspondent, Michael P. 
Geffner said, "To think of Murray as anything other than a great player 
these days is not to have a dissenting opinion anymore but to be dead wrong, 
blind not only to the inner game but to an understanding of what truly 
raises baseball to something classic and beautiful--when the game is executed 
purely and seamlessly. Which is Eddie Murray to a T.".[33] The Orioles 
success after the trade can also be attributed to the theory of "Power, 
worth, and recognition,[34] " which Thomas S. Parish who is an associate 
professor of psychology at Upper Iowa University, Fayette, Iowa describes 
as a type of motivation where athletes attempt to out do or "show off" 
to each other, which leads to better statistics, and more wins. In Eddie 
Murray's last at-bat with the Orioles he hit a home run off of New York 
Yankee pitcher, Andy Pettitte. Oriole Park at Camden Yards, Baltimore,

New York Yankees shortstop Derek Jeter hit a deep fly ball to right field. 
Orioles outfielder Tony Tarasco appeared to camp under the ball and prepared 
to make a catch. However, a 12-year-old boy seated in the first row of 
the bleachers named Jeffrey Maier reached over the wall and caught the 
ball just above Tarrasco, costing the Orioles an out. Although it appeared 
to be fan interference, the umpire ruled the ball to be a home run. While 
Maier became a hero to Yankees fans, he immediately became a "symbol of 
the Orioles futility."[35] The Orioles would go on to lose the series in
