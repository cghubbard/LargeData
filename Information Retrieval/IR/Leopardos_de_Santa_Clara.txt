The Leopardos de Santa Clara (English: Santa Clara Leopards) were a Cuban 
professional baseball team based in Santa Clara, Cuba. Founded in 1922, 
they played in the Cuban League from 1922 to 1925, from 1929 to 1930, and 
from 1935 to 1941. Although they competed for only 11 seasons, they won 
league championships in four regular seasons and in one "special season." 
According to Cuban League historian Jorge S. Figueredo, the 1923/24 team, 
which went 36–11 and won the championship by 11 1⁄2 games, is "considered 
as the most dominant team in the history of Cuban baseball."[1] During 
their existence, the Leopardos featured several of the biggest stars of 
Negro league baseball, including Oscar Charleston, Satchel Paige, and Josh 
Gibson.[2] In addition, the team featured outstanding performances from 
Cuba's own baseball stars including Alejandro Oms and Martín Dihigo.[3] 
In the fall of 1921, with a depressed economy and political instability, 
the Cuban League fielded only two teams, Almendares and Habana, and played 
a shortened schedule.[4] Abel Linares controlled the league, owning both 
franchises. For the 1922/23 season, he set out to expand the league to 
four teams by establishing new teams in Marianao, a suburb of Havana, and 
in Santa Clara, the capital of Las Villas Province in the center of the 
island.[5] Santa Clara was the first Cuban League team to be located outside 
of metropolitan Havana since the Matanzas club folded in 1909.[6] Linares 
assigned his long-time associate, Tinti Molina, to organize and manage 
the team. As manager of the Cuban Stars (West), he had contacts he could 
use to recruit top Negro league players from the United States. The team 
would play at La Boulanger Park, a small stadium with a capacity of fewer 
than 3,000 people. In an effort to draw from a regional fan base, they 
scheduled all of the team's home games on weekends.[5] The team recruited 
several local players—Alejandro Oms, a Santa Clara native, Pablo Mesa of 
nearby Caibarién, and Julio Rojo of neighboring Sagua la Grande. From the 
United States, Molina recruited a number of top Negro league players—pitchers 
Bill Holland and Dave Brown, infielders Frank Warfield and Oliver Marcelle, 
and superstar outfielder Oscar Charleston. Filling out the roster were 
pitcher Eustaquio Pedroso, infielders Manuel Parrado, Ramón González, and 
Matías Ríos, and outfielder Felipe Sierra.[5][7] The 1922/23 season began 
on November 25. By January, the Leopardos were in the lead of a tight race, 
with only 2 1⁄2 separating them from the fourth-place team. Then, with 
the season half over, a dispute took place when the league refused to count 
Sunday games, taking away one of Santa Clara's wins. Santa Clara withdrew 
from the league in protest and forfeited their remaining games. Their record 
stood at 14–13, but dropped to 14–40 after deducting 27 losses by forfeit. 
Charleston hit .446, but had too few at bats for the batting title. Oms 
also had an outstanding performance, hitting .436.[8] For 1923/24, the 
Leopardos loaded up with American Negro league talent. Linares and Molina 
brought back pitchers Holland, Brown, and Pedroso and added Americans Rube 
Currie and Merven Ryan, as well as Cuban legend José Méndez, and Pedro 
Dibut, who had just been signed by the Cincinnati Reds. In the infield, 
first basemen Oscar Johnson and Eddie Douglass and shortstop Dobie Moore 
joined the returning second baseman, Warfield, and third baseman, Marcelle. 
The regular outfielders, Charleston, Oms, and Mesa, were the same as in 
the previous season, and Esteban Montalvo was the backup outfielder.[9] 
The other teams in the league appeared to be competitive. Almendares featured 
Nip Winters on the mound, Dick Lundy at shortstop, Bernardo Baró and Valentín 
Dreke in the outfield, a young Martín Dihigo, and former or future major 
leaguers Armando Marsans, Manuel Cueto, José Rodríguez, and Ramón Herrera. 
Habana featured pitchers Adolfo Luque, coming off his 27-win season with 
the Cincinnati Reds, and Andy Cooper, shortstop John Henry Lloyd, and outfielders 
Cristóbal Torriente and Jacinto Calvo. The Marianao roster included former 
and future major leaguers Emilio Palmero, José Acosta, Merito Acosta, Charlie 
Dressen, Freddie Fitzsimmons, and Hank Schreiber.[10] The season began 
on October 20, and the Leopardos won their first five games. They kept 
on winning; by December 14, they were 21 and 7, and at the end of the year, 
they were 29 and 10. By January 16, they had won their last six games and 
were 36 and 11 (a .766 winning percentage) and 11 1⁄2 games ahead of second 
place Habana. They were winning by big scores, scoring 10 or more runs 
in 10 games and 15 or more runs three times. With attendance dropping as 
the championship fell out of reach for the other teams, the league officials 
stopped the season early and declared Santa Clara the champions. They would 
reorganize the teams and hold a second, special season called Gran Premio 
to try to renew fan interest.[11] Santa Clara players led the league in 
several statistical categories: Marcelle led in batting average, hitting 
.393; Charleston led in runs scored with 59 and in stolen bases with 31; 
Moore led in hits with 71 and tied for the lead in triples with his teammate, 
Warfield, with six. Moore hit .386, Oms .381, Charleston .375; all of the 
team's regulars hit above .300 except for Warfield, who hit .296. The team 
batting average was .331, a Cuban League record. In pitching, Holland led 
the league in wins with 10, and in winning percentage with .833 (10–2). 
The other regular pitchers were not far behind—Currie had an 8–2 record, 
Brown 7–3, Ryan 5–0, and Méndez 3–1.[12] For the special season, the league 
dropped the Marianao club and reassigned its better players to Habana and 
Almendares, while Santa Clara retained its players. All games took place 
in Havana at Almendares Park. The special season ran from January 19 through 
March 6, with each team playing 25 or 26 games. The reconfigured teams 
were more competitive and closely fought. Santa Clara won the championship 
by a very slim margin, with a 13–12 record that was just a half game ahead 
of Habana and one game ahead of Almendares.[13] For the 1924/25 season, 
most of the pitching staff from the previous season returned—Holland, Brown, 
Ryan, and Méndez—with Currie replaced by Sam Streeter. In the infield, 
Warfield and Marcelle returned to second base and third base, but Manuel 
Parrado replaced Douglass and Johnson at first, and Charlie Williams replaced 
Moore at shortstop. In the outfield, Oms was back, but Charleston moved 
to Almendares and Mesa didn't play; their places were taken by Montalvo 
and Jelly Gardner, with Turkey Stearnes appearing for part of the season. 
By January, Almendares—which, in addition to Charleston, featured Bullet 
Rogan, Luque, Biz Mackey, Lloyd, and Lundy—had taken an 8 1⁄2 game lead. 
Attendance in Santa Clara was flagging. The league cut its losses and on 
January 11 moved the team to Matanzas for the remainder of the season. 
The Santa Clara/Matanzas team finished in third place with a 20–28 record, 
12 1⁄2 game out. Oms led the league in batting average, hitting .393, and 
Montalvo led in home runs with 5.[14] After four seasons of absence, the 
league restored the Santa Clara franchise in the 1929/30 season. Tinti 
Molina returned as manager, Warfield was back at second base, and Oms also 
returned to his hometown. The pitching staff featured the 23-year-old Satchel 
Paige and Ramón Bragaña, and slugger Mule Suttles took over first base. 
Paige went 6–5 before leaving the team early under mysterious circumstances,[15] 
Oms won the batting title again, hitting .380, and Suttles hit seven home 
runs, setting a Cuban League record. The team finished in second place 
with a 21–21 record, 6 1⁄2 games behind Cienfuegos.[16] The 1930/31 regular 
season lasted less than a week, and only five games were played. A new 
stadium, La Tropical Stadium, had been built in Marianao near Havana, and 
the season was suspended when a dispute broke out between the league and 
the stadium's management. Santa Clara's record was 0–1, leaving them tied 
for third, 1 1⁄2 games behind Almendares. The league reorganized for a 
special season held at the old stadium, Almendares Park, but the Santa 
Clara team was replaced by one from Marianao.[17] During the early 1930s, 
the Cuban economy was depressed and its political situation in turmoil. 
The Cuban League played shortened seasons the winters of 1931/32, 1932/33, 
and 1934/35 with no American players, while failing to finish the 1932/33 
season and skipping the 1933/34 season altogether. In 1935/36, the situation 
had finally improved enough to allow the teams to hire American players 
again. The league also expanded from three teams to four, restoring the 
Leopardos de Santa Clara under new owner Emilio de Armas.[18] In 1935/36, 
Martín Dihigo returned to the Cuban League after several years playing 
elsewhere, and Emilio de Armas signed him to serve not only the Leopardos' 
manager, but also as their pitching ace, and as a slugging outfielder when 
he wasn't pitching. Long-time Santa Clara star, Alejandro Oms, returned 
to the team. The team signed American Negro leaguers Bill Perkins as catcher 
and Willie Wells as shortstop, and Dominican Horacio Martínez as second 
baseman. Dihigo produced a memorable season, leading the league in many 
batting and pitching categories—batting average (.358), runs scored (42), 
hits (63, tied with Wells), triples (8), RBI (38, tied with Perkins), pitching 
winning percentage (11–2, .846), complete games (13), wins (11), and shutouts 
(4), and also won the Most Valuable Player Award. Wells hit .356 and, in 
addition to tying for the lead in hits, tied for the league lead in home 
runs with five. Perkins hit .323., Oms hit .311, third baseman Rafael Ruíz 
hit .301, and the team batting average was .294. The Leopardos easily won 
the championship with a 34–14 record, six games ahead of second-place Almendares.[19] 
The next season, Dihigo switched to the Marianao team. Rojo replaced him 
as manager, and Santa Clara brought in Negro league pitcher Ray Brown and 
second baseman Harry Williams, as Martínez moved to shortstop and Perkins 
returned as catcher. Oms did not play; the outfield featured Santos Amaro, 
José Vargas, and Tony Castaño, with Brown often playing in the outfield 
when he wasn't pitching. Brown had a dominating season, setting the Cuban 
League all-time record for wins with 21, while leading the league in winning 
percentage (21–4, .840) and complete games (23), and also hit .311. On 
November 17 he pitched a no-hitter against Habana for his first win of 
the season. On December 16, again facing Habana, he pitched complete games 
in both ends of a doubleheader, losing the first game 1–0 against Luis 
Tiant, Sr., in 11 innings, then shutting out Habana in the second game 
on five hits.[20] With three games left to play, Santa Clara had a three-game 
lead over Marianao, whom they faced in the final series at home in La Boulanger 
Park. The visiting Tigres swept the series and forced a playoff, with Dihigo 
pitching for Marianao on consecutive days and winning both games. The three-game 
playoff took place at La Tropical Stadium. Brown faced Dihigo in the first 
game and the Leopardos prevailed, 6 to 1. Marianao won the second game 
4 to 2 behind the pitching of Silvio García. Brown and Dihigo squared off 
again in the finale on two days rest. The Tigres scored 7 runs, while Dihigo 
held the Leopardos scoreless through eight innings before giving up a three-run 
homer to Perkins in the ninth. Brown's extraordinary season was for naught, 
as Marianao won the championship. Santa Clara's final record was 37–32, 
with Brown accounting for more than half of their wins.[20] In 1937/38, 
Emilio de Armas brought in Lázaro Salazar as the new player/manager; Salazar 
played first base and also pitched. Brown, Perkins, Castaño, and Amaro 
were brought back to the Leopardos, and Oms returned to the team after 
a year's absence. The team also added pitcher Bob Griffith and shortstop 
Sam Bankhead from the Negro leagues. Santa Clara won the pennant, going 
44 and 18 (though nine of the victories represented games forfeited by 
Habana, which withdrew early). They led second place Almendares by 4 1⁄2 
games. Brown went 12–5, leading the league in winning percentage, and Griffith 
went 12–6; the two pitchers tied for the league lead in wins. Although 
Dihigo won 11 games, his Marianao team ended in third place, 9 1⁄2 games 
out. Brown led the league in complete games with 14, and Griffith led in 
shutouts, with five. Bankhead led the league in batting average (.366), 
runs scored (47), hits (89), and RBIs (34), and tied with teammate/manager 
Salazar for the lead in triples (5). With four home runs, Brown tied for 
the league lead with Wells and Roberto Estalella, who both played for Almendares. 
Salazar hit .318, went 3–0 as a pitcher, and received the MVP Award. Amaro 
hit .326, and Oms hit .315—his eleventh season hitting .300 or better, 
tying him for the Cuban League all-time record.[21] Santa Clara won the 
pennant again in 1938/39. Catcher Josh Gibson joined the team and shattered 
Suttles' Cuban League home-run record, hitting 11 homers in 163 at bats. 
Brown went 11–7 and led the league in complete games with 16, Manuel (Cocaína) 
García went 11–4, and Salazar went 6–2 while also playing first base and 
hitting .293. Castaño led the league in batting average, hitting .371, 
and his fellow outfielders Amaro and Vargas hit .366 and .333. Meanwhile, 
Dihigo, now pitching for Habana, led the league in wins and winning percentage 
with a 14–2 (.875) record, but his fellow pitchers were less effective. 
Santa Clara, with a 34–20 record, finished five games ahead of second-place 
Habana.[22] Salazar, Brown, Gibson and García did not return to the 1939/40 
Leopardos, and their period of league dominance came to an end. Their pitching 
staff included Roy Partlow (7–4), René Monteagudo (5–7), Hilton Smith (4–2), 
and Armando Torres (3–5). Castaño won the batting championship again, hitting 
.340, and Amaro hit .326. Sam Bankhead returned to the team and hit .321, 
leading the league in runs (41) and hits (67). The pennant race was a close 
one—Almendares won, leading Cienfuegos by two games and Santa Clara, which 
went 24–27, by four games.[23] In 1940/41, Manuel García rejoined the pitching 
staff, while Americans Partlow, Smith, and Bankhead left. Torres went 8–7, 
Monteagudo went 6–4, and García went 4–5. Silvio García took over at second 
base and hit .314, but Castaño hit only .206. The Leopardos went 25–26, 
tied for second place, seven games behind the champion Habana. It was the 
last season in the Cuban League for Santa Clara. The following season,
