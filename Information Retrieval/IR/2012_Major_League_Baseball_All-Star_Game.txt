The 2012 Major League Baseball All-Star Game was the 83rd edition of the 
Major League Baseball All-Star Game. It was held on July 10, 2012, during 
the 2012 Major League Baseball season at Kauffman Stadium in Kansas City, 
Missouri, home of the Kansas City Royals. This marked the third time the 
Mid-summer Classic had been played in Kansas City, with Kauffman Stadium 
(then named Royals Stadium) last hosting the event in 1973, the stadium's 
first year of existence. The event was also held at Municipal Stadium in 
1960, when the Athletics were still based there, one of two played that 
season. The game was televised in the United States by Fox. The National 
League shutout the American League for the sixth time in All-Star Game 
history.[1][2][3] It was the third-largest margin of victory for any Mid-summer 
Classic.[4] The TV ratings fell even further than the 2011 edition, earning 
a 6.8 rating and 12 share on Fox. The total number of viewers who watched 
any portion of the game was up 7 percent from the previous year, however, 
with 27.7 million total viewers.[4] Kauffman Stadium underwent a US $250 
million renovation, funded by a 0.375% sales tax increase by the residents 
of Jackson County, Missouri for the Harry S. Truman Sports Complex, which 
also houses Arrowhead Stadium, the home of the Kansas City Chiefs.[5][6] 
The referendum passed in an election on April 4, 2006.[5] As a result of 
the deal, Major League Baseball commissioner Bud Selig promised the area 
that the team would host a future All-Star Game no later than 2014. On 
June 16, 2010, Selig officially awarded the rights to host the game to 
Kansas City for the 2012 season.[5][7] Fenway Park was also in contention 
for hosting the 2012 All-Star Game to celebrate that park's centennial.[8] 
However Boston had most recently hosted the 1999 All-Star game.[9] Balloting 
for the 2012 All-Star Game starters began online April 20 and continued 
through June 28.[10] Fan voting also took place in each MLB stadium, beginning 
May 8 (at the latest) and ended on June 22.[10] The top vote-getters at 
each position (including the designated hitter for the American League) 
and the top three among outfielders, were named the starters for their 
respective leagues. The results were announced on July 1.[11] A record 
40.2 million votes were cast,[12] beating out the previous record from 
2011 (32.5 million) by a little under eight million. Josh Hamilton was 
the leading vote-getter with 11,073,744 votes, shattering the record that 
José Bautista set last year with 7,454,753 votes.[11] Buster Posey set 
a new NL record for votes this year with 7,621,370 votes. After the rosters 
were revealed, a second ballot of five players per league was created for 
the All-Star Final Vote to determine the 34th and final player of each 
roster. The online balloting was conducted from Sunday afternoon, July 
1, through Thursday afternoon, July 5. The winners of the All-Star Final 
Vote were Yu Darvish of the Texas Rangers (AL) and David Freese of the 
St. Louis Cardinals (NL). Chipper Jones, of the Atlanta Braves, was removed 
from the ballot on July 3 after he replaced Matt Kemp on the roster due 
to injury.[13][14] The only position player able to participate who was 
not used was Adam Dunn. Lance Lynn and Huston Street were the pitchers 
not used by the National League. For the American League, pitchers Yu Darvish, 
Félix Hernández (who threw 114 pitches on July 8),[15] Jake Peavy, and 
Chris Perez did not enter the game. In the first inning, the National League 
scored five runs, highlighted by Pablo Sandoval's three run bases clearing 
triple to the right field corner. The NL also scored three runs in the 
fourth inning. The AL had the bases loaded at one point in the game, but 
failed to drive in any runs and the NL won 8–0. It was the third straight 
season the AL lost in an all star game. With two hits and two RBI, Melky 
Cabrera was named the All Star Game MVP and was the first Giants player 
to be named All Star MVP since Bobby Bonds in the 1973 All Star Game, which 
was also held in Kansas City. Umpires: Home Plate – Gerry Davis (crew chief);
