James Warren Hardin (August 6, 1943 – March 9, 1991) was a professional 
baseball player for the Baltimore Orioles and was a member of one of the 
best pitching staffs of the 1960s and 1970s that included Jim Palmer, Dave 
McNally, Tom Phoebus, and Mike Cuellar. He earned a World Series ring in 
the 1970 World Series and was part of the dominant 1969 American League 
champions who lost that year's World Series to the "Miracle Mets." An 18-game 
winner in 1968, Hardin pitched 4 1⁄2 years with Baltimore, half of one 
season with the New York Yankees and one year with the Atlanta Braves. 
He finished his career with a record of 43–32 and a 3.19 ERA. As a starting 
pitcher he was an iron man, registering 28 complete games in 100 career 
starts — a rate rivaled by few contemporary pitchers and even fewer current 
starters. On July 27, 1969, Hardin starred in the Orioles most dominant 
shut-out victory in their history, routing the White Sox, 17–0. Hardin 
took the win over Chicago's Billy Wynne, allowing just two hits as the 
Birds banged out 20, good for 39 total bases. Hardin tossed a two-hitter 
with five strikeouts and also hit a home run in fourth inning off Gary 
Bell. On May 10, 1969 in a relief appearance, Hardin hit a game-winning 
walk-off home run in the bottom of the ninth inning in Baltimore's Memorial 
Stadium. He pitched a complete game shutout on May 26, 1970 against the 
Cleveland Indians who had only five singles in the game. Three weeks later, 
Hardin pitched ten innings surrendering only six hits with zero walks versus 
the Washington Senators. The Orioles prevailed 3–2 in 13 innings with Pete 
Richert earning the win with three relief innings. In Cleveland on August 
6, 1970 Hardin threw a complete Game five-hitter in the second game of 
a doubleheader against the Indians. Hardin helped himself with a two-run 
triple in the second inning and also picked up another RBI by drawing a 
bases-loaded walk in the eighth inning. As a member of the Atlanta Braves 
on June 28, 1972, he hit a 2-out solo home run in the 4th inning off the 
Padres' Fred Norman in San Diego Stadium. Hardin, a pilot, died on March 
9, 1991 when his Beech 35-C33A crashed in Key West, Florida. Shortly after 
taking off from Key West International Airport the propeller of his aircraft 
failed from fatigue. The aircraft stalled and the plane crashed while Hardin 
attempted to return to the airport to make an emergency landing. It was 
widely reported that, during the plane's descent, Hardin steered the plane 
away from a baseball field filled with young children. The plane came to 
rest in a parking lot of the TGI Fridays restaurant, which was under construction 
at the time. Hardin is one of three Yankees to lose their lives in aviation 
accidents; the other two are catcher Thurman Munson (1979) and Cory Lidle
