Phoenix (/ˈfiːnᵻks/) is the capital and largest city of the U.S. state 
of Arizona. With 1,563,025 people (as of 2015[update]), Phoenix is the 
sixth most populous city nationwide, the most populous state capital in 
the United States, and the only state capital with a population of more 
than 1 million residents.[4][5] Phoenix is the anchor of the Phoenix metropolitan 
area, also known as the Valley of the Sun, which in turn is a part of the 
Salt River Valley. The metropolitan area is the 12th largest by population 
in the United States, with approximately 4.3 million people as of 2010[update].[6][7] 
In addition, Phoenix is the county seat of Maricopa County and is one of 
the largest cities in the United States by land area.[8] Settled in 1867 
as an agricultural community near the confluence of the Salt and Gila Rivers, 
Phoenix incorporated as a city in 1881. Located in the northeastern reaches 
of the Sonoran Desert, Phoenix has a subtropical desert climate. Despite 
this, its canal system led to a thriving farming community, many of the 
original crops remaining important parts of the Phoenix economy for decades, 
such as alfalfa, cotton, citrus, and hay (which was important for the cattle 
industry).[9][10] In fact, the "Five C's" (Cotton, Cattle, Citrus, Climate, 
and Copper), remained the driving forces of Phoenix's economy until after 
World War II, when high-tech industries began to move into the valley and 
air conditioning made residences much more comfortable in the very hot 
summers.[11] The city averaged a 4 percent annual population growth rate 
over a 40-year period from the mid-1960s to the mid-2000s.[12] This growth 
rate slowed during the Great Recession of 2007–09, and has rebounded slowly.[13] 
Phoenix is the cultural center of the Valley of the Sun, as well as the 
entire state.[14] For more than 2,000 years, the Hohokam people occupied 
the land that would become Phoenix.[15][16] The Hohokam created roughly 
135 miles (217 km) of irrigation canals, making the desert land arable. 
Paths of these canals would later become used for the modern Arizona Canal, 
Central Arizona Project Canal, and the Hayden-Rhodes Aqueduct. The Hohokam 
also carried out extensive trade with the nearby Anasazi, Mogollon and 
Sinagua, as well as with the more distant Mesoamerican civilizations.[17] 
It is believed that between 1300 and 1450, periods of drought and severe 
floods led to the Hohokam civilization's abandonment of the area.[18] After 
the departure of the Hohokam, groups of Akimel O'odham (commonly known 
as Pima), Tohono O'odham and Maricopa tribes began to use the area, as 
well as segments of the Yavapai and Apache.[19] The O'odham were offshoots 
of the Sobaipuri tribe, who in turn were thought to be the descendants 
of the formerly urbanized Hohokam.[20][21][22] The Akimel O'odham were 
the major Native American group in the area, and lived in small villages, 
with well-defined irrigation systems, which spread over the entire Gila 
River Valley, from Florence in the east to the Estrellas in the west. Their 
crops included maize, beans and squash for food, while cotton and tobacco 
were also cultivated. Mostly a peaceful group, they did band together with 
the Maricopa for their mutual protection against incursions by both the 
Yuma and Apache tribes.[23] The Maricopa are part of the larger Yuma people; 
however, they migrated east from the lower Colorado and Gila Rivers in 
the early 1800s, when they began to be enemies with their Yuma brethren, 
settling amongst the existing communities of the Akimel O'odham.[24][25][19] 
The Tohono O'odham lived in the region as well, but their main concentration 
was to the south, and stretched all the way to the Mexican border.[26] 
Living in small settlements, the O'odham were seasonal farmers who took 
advantage of the rains, rather than the large-scale irrigation of the Akimel. 
They grew crops such as sweet maize, tapery beans, squash, lentils sugar 
cane and melons, as well as taking advantage of native plants, such as 
saguaro fruits, cholla buds, mesquite tree beans, and mesquite candy (sap 
from the mesquite tree). They also hunted local game such as deer, rabbit 
and javalina for meat.[27][28] When the Mexican–American War ended in 1848, 
Mexico sold its northern zone to the United States and residents became 
U.S. citizens. The Phoenix area became part of the New Mexico Territory.[29] 
In 1863 the mining town of Wickenburg was the first to be established in 
what is now Maricopa County, to the northwest of modern Phoenix. At the 
time Maricopa County had not yet been incorporated: the land was within 
Yavapai County, which included the major town of Prescott to the north 
of Wickenburg. The U.S. Army created Fort McDowell on the Verde River in 
1865 to forestall Native American uprisings.[30] The fort established a 
camp on the south side of the Salt River by 1866, which was the first non-native 
settlement in the valley after the decline of the Hohokam. In later years, 
other nearby settlements would form and merge to become the city of Tempe,[31] 
but this community was incorporated after Phoenix. The history of the city 
of Phoenix begins with Jack Swilling, a Confederate veteran of the Civil 
War. In 1867, while traveling through the Salt River Valley, he saw a potential 
for farming, much like the military had already cultivated further east, 
near Fort McDowell. He formed a small community that same year about 4 miles 
(6 km) east of the present city. Lord Darrell Duppa, one of the original 
settlers in Swilling's party, suggested the name "Phoenix", as it described 
a city born from the ruins of a former civilization.[15] The Board of Supervisors 
in Yavapai County, which at the time encompassed Phoenix, officially recognized 
the new town on May 4, 1868, and the first post office was established 
the following month, with Swilling as the postmaster.[15] On February 12, 
1871, the territorial legislature created Maricopa County, the sixth one 
formed in the Arizona Territory, by dividing Yavapai County. The first 
election for county office was held in 1871, when Tom Barnum was elected 
the first sheriff, running unopposed when the other two candidates, John 
A. Chenowth and Jim Favorite, fought a duel wherein Chenowth killed Favorite, 
and then was forced to withdraw from the race.[15] The town grew during 
the 1870s, and President Ulysses S. Grant issued a land patent for the 
present site of Phoenix on April 10, 1874. By 1875, the town had a telegraph 
office, sixteen saloons, and four dance halls, but the "townsite-commissioner 
form of government" needed an overhaul, so that year an election was held 
in which three village trustees, as well as several other officials, were 
elected.[15] By 1880, the town's population stood at 2,453.[32] By 1881, 
Phoenix's continued growth made the existing village structure with a board 
of trustees obsolete. The Territorial Legislature passed "The Phoenix Charter 
Bill", incorporating Phoenix and providing for a mayor-council government, 
which became official on February 25, 1881 when it was signed by Governor 
John C. Fremont, officially incorporating Phoenix as a city with an approximate 
population of 2,500.[15] In the 1880s, the arrival of the railroad in the 
valley was the first of several key events that altered the economy of 
Phoenix. Phoenix became a trade center, with its products reaching eastern 
and western markets. In response, the Phoenix Chamber of Commerce was organized 
on November 4, 1888.[33] Earlier in 1888 the city offices were moved into 
the new City Hall, at Washington and Central.[15] When the territorial 
capital was moved from Prescott to Phoenix in 1889 the temporary territorial 
offices were also located in City Hall.[34] With the arrival of the Santa 
Fe, Prescott and Phoenix Railroad in 1895, Phoenix was connected to Prescott, 
Flagstaff and other northern state communities. The increased access to 
commerce expedited the city's economic rise. The year 1895 also saw the 
establishment of Phoenix Union High School, with an enrollment of 90.[15] 
On February 25, 1901, Governor Murphy dedicated the permanent Capitol building,[15] 
and the Carnegie Free Library opened seven years later, on February 18, 
1908, dedicated by Benjamin Fowler.[35] The National Reclamation Act was 
signed by President Theodore Roosevelt in 1902, which allowed for dams 
to be built on waterways in the west for reclamation purposes.[36] The 
first dam constructed under the act, the Theodore Roosevelt Dam began in 
1903. It supplied both water and electricity, becoming the first multi-purpose 
dam, and Roosevelt himself attended the official dedication on May 18, 
1911. At the time, it was the largest masonry dam in the world, forming 
Theodore Roosevelt Lake in the mountain east of Phoenix.[37] On February 
14, 1912, under President William Howard Taft, Phoenix became the capital 
of the newly formed state of Arizona.[38] This occurred just six months 
after Taft had vetoed a joint congressional resolution granting statehood 
to Arizona, due to his disapproval of the state constitution's position 
regarding the recall of judges.[39] In 1913 Phoenix adopted a new form 
of government, changing from a mayor-council system to council-manager, 
making it one of the first cities in the United States with this form of 
city government. After statehood, Phoenix's growth started to accelerate, 
and eight years later, its population had reached 29,053. In 1920 Phoenix 
would see its first skyscraper, the Heard Building.[15] In 1929 Sky Harbor 
was officially opened, at the time owned by Scenic Airways. It would later 
be purchased in 1935 by the city, which operates it to this day.[40] On 
March 4, 1930, former U.S. President Calvin Coolidge dedicated a dam on 
the Gila River named in his honor. However, the state had just been through 
a long drought, and the reservoir which was supposed to be behind the dam 
was virtually dry. The humorist Will Rogers, who was also on hand as a 
guest speaker joked, "If that was my lake I'd mow it."[41] Phoenix's population 
had more than doubled during the 1920s, and now stood at 48,118.[15] It 
was also during the 1930s that Phoenix and its surrounding area began to 
be called "The Valley of the Sun", which was an advertising slogan invented 
to boost tourism.[42] During World War II, Phoenix's economy shifted to 
that of a distribution center, transforming into an "embryonic industrial 
city" with the mass production of military supplies.[15] There were three 
air force fields in the area: Luke Field, Williams Field, and Falcon Field, 
as well as two large pilot training camps, Thunderbird Field No. 1 in Glendale 
and Thunderbird Field No. 2 in Scottsdale.[15][43][44] A town that had 
just over sixty-five thousand residents in 1940 became America's sixth 
largest city by 2010, with a population of nearly 1.5 million, and millions 
more in nearby suburbs. When the war ended, many of the men who had undergone 
their training in Arizona returned bringing their new families. Learning 
of this large untapped labor pool enticed many large industries to move 
their operations to the area.[15] In 1948 high-tech industry, which would 
become a staple of the state's economy, arrived in Phoenix when Motorola 
chose Phoenix for the site of its new research and development center for 
military electronics. Seeing the same advantages as Motorola, other high-tech 
companies such as Intel and McDonnell Douglas would also move into the 
valley and open manufacturing operations.[45][46] By 1950, over 105,000 
people resided in the city and thousands more in surrounding communities.[15] 
The 1950s growth was spurred on by advances in air conditioning, which 
allowed both homes and businesses to offset the extreme heat experienced 
in Phoenix and the surrounding areas during its long summers. There was 
more new construction in Phoenix in 1959 alone than during the period of 
more than thirty years from 1914 to 1946.[47] Like many emerging American 
cities at the time, Phoenix's spectacular growth did not occur evenly. 
It largely took place on the city's north side, a region that was nearly 
all Caucasian. In 1962, one local activist testified at a US Commission 
on Civil Rights hearing that of 31,000 homes that had recently sprung up 
in this neighborhood, not a single one had been sold to an African-American.[48] 
Phoenix's African-American and Mexican-American communities remained largely 
sequestered on the town's south side. The color lines were so rigid that 
no one north of Van Buren Street would rent to the African-American baseball 
star Willie Mays, in town for spring training in the 1960s.[49] In 1964, 
a reporter from the New Republic wrote of segregation in these terms: "Apartheid 
is complete. The two cities look at each other across a golf course."[50] 
The continued rapid population growth led more businesses to the valley 
to take advantage of the labor pool,[51] and manufacturing, particularly 
in the electronics sector, continued to grow.[52] The convention and tourism 
industries saw rapid expansion during the 1960s, with tourism becoming 
the third largest industry by the end of the decade.[53] In 1960 the Phoenix 
Corporate Center opened; at the time it was the tallest building in Arizona, 
topping off at 341 feet.[54] The 1960s saw many other buildings constructed 
as the city expanded rapidly, including the Rosenzweig Center (1964), today 
called Phoenix City Square,[55] the landmark Phoenix Financial Center (1964),[56] 
as well as many of Phoenix's residential high-rises. In 1965 the Arizona 
Veterans Memorial Coliseum was opened at the Arizona State Fairgrounds, 
west of downtown. When Phoenix was awarded a NBA franchise in 1968, which 
would be called the Phoenix Suns,[57][58] they played their home games 
at the Coliseum until 1992, after which they moved to Talking Stick Resort 
Arena.[59] In 1968, the Central Arizona Project was approved by President 
Lyndon B. Johnson, assuring future water supplies for Phoenix, Tucson, 
and the agricultural corridor in between.[60][61] The following year, Pope 
Paul VI created the Diocese of Phoenix on December 2, by splitting the 
Archdiocese of Tucson, with Edward A. McCarthy as the first Bishop.[62] 
In the 1970s the downtown area experienced a resurgence, with a level of 
construction activity not seen again until the urban real estate boom of 
the 2000s. By the end of the decade, Phoenix adopted the Phoenix Concept 
2000 plan which split the city into urban villages, each with its own village 
core where greater height and density was permitted, further shaping the 
free-market development culture. Originally, there were 9 villages,[63] 
but this has been expanded to 15 over the years (see Cityscape below). 
This officially turned Phoenix into a city of many nodes, which would later 
be connected by freeways. 1972 would see the opening of the Phoenix Symphony 
Hall,[64] Other major structures which saw construction downtown during 
this decade were the Wells Fargo Plaza, the Chase Tower (the tallest building 
in both Phoenix and Arizona)[65] and the U.S. Bank Center. Nominated by 
President Reagan, on September 25, 1981 Phoenix resident Sandra Day O'Connor 
broke the gender barrier on the U.S. Supreme Court, when she was sworn 
in as the first female judge.[66] 1985 saw the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating 
Station, the nation's largest nuclear power plant, begin electrical production.[67] 
1987 was marked by visits by both Pope John Paul II and Mother Teresa.[68] 
There was an influx of refugees due to low-cost housing in the Sunnyslope 
area in the 1990s, resulting in 43 different languages being spoken in 
local schools by the year 2000.[69] The new 20-story City Hall opened in 
1992,[70] and 1993 saw the creation of "Tent City" by Sheriff Joe Arpaio, 
using inmate labor, to alleviate overcrowding in the Maricopa County Jail 
system, the fourth-largest in the world.[71] Phoenix has maintained a growth 
streak in recent years, growing by 24.2% before 2007. This made it the 
second-fastest-growing metropolitan area in the United States, surpassed 
only by Las Vegas.[72] In 2008, Squaw Peak, the second tallest mountain 
in the city, was renamed Piestewa Peak after Army Specialist Lori Ann Piestewa, 
an Arizonan and the first Native American woman to die in combat while 
serving in the U.S. military, as well as being the first American female 
casualty of the 2003 Iraq War.[73] 2008 also saw Phoenix as one of the 
cities hardest hit by the subprime mortgage crisis, and by early 2009 the 
median home price was $150,000, down from its $262,000 peak in 2007.[74] 
Crime rates in Phoenix have gone down in recent years, and once troubled, 
decaying neighborhoods such as South Mountain, Alhambra, and Maryvale have 
recovered and stabilized. Recently, downtown Phoenix and the central core 
have experienced renewed interest and growth, resulting in numerous restaurants, 
stores, and businesses opening or relocating to central Phoenix.[75] Phoenix 
is in the southwestern United States, in the south-central portion of Arizona; 
about halfway between Tucson to the southeast and Flagstaff to the north. 
By car, the city is approximately 150 miles (242 km) north of the US-Mexico 
border at Sonoyta and 180 miles (290 km) north of the border at Nogales. 
The metropolitan area is known as the "Valley of the Sun", due to its location 
in the Salt River Valley.[42] It lies at a mean elevation of 1,086 feet 
(331 m), in the northern reaches of the Sonoran Desert.[76] Other than 
the mountains in and around the city, the topography of Phoenix is generally 
flat, allowing the city's main streets to run on a precise grid with wide, 
open-spaced roadways. Scattered, low mountain ranges surround the valley: 
McDowell Mountains to the northeast, the White Tank Mountains to the west, 
the Superstition Mountains far to the east, and both South Mountain and 
the Sierra Estrella to the south/southwest. Camelback Mountain, North Mountain, 
Sunnyslope Mountain, and Piestewa Peak are located within the heart of 
the valley. On the outskirts of Phoenix are large fields of irrigated cropland 
and Native American reservation lands.[77] The Salt River runs westward 
through the city of Phoenix, but the riverbed is often dry or contains 
little water due to large irrigation diversions. The community of Ahwatukee 
is separated from the rest of the city by South Mountain. According to 
the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 517.9 square 
miles (1,341 km2). 516.7 square miles (1,338 km2) of it is land, and 1.2 
square miles (0.6 km², or 0.2%) of it is water. Even though it is the 6th 
most populated city, the large area gives it a low density rate of approximately 
2,797 people per square mile.[78] In comparison, Philadelphia, the 5th 
most populous city, has a density of over 11,000.[79] As with most of Arizona, 
Phoenix does not observe daylight saving time. In 1973, Gov. Jack Williams 
argued to the U.S. Congress that due to air conditioning units not being 
used as often in the morning on standard time, energy use would increase 
in the evening should the state observe daylight saving time. He went on 
to say that energy use would also rise early in the day "because there 
would be more lights on in the early morning." Additionally, he said that 
daylight savings time would cause children to go to school in the dark.[80] 
Sunrise occurs at around 7:29am on December 21 and 5:19am on June 21. Sunset 
occurs at around 5:25pm on December 21 and 7:41pm on June 21. Since 1979, 
the City of Phoenix has been divided into urban villages, many of which 
are based upon historically significant neighborhoods and communities that 
have since been annexed into Phoenix.[81] Each village has a planning committee 
that is appointed directly by the city council. According to the village 
planning handbook issued by the city, the purpose of the village planning 
committees is to "work with the city's planning commission to ensure a 
balance of housing and employment in each village, concentrate development 
at identified village cores, and to promote the unique character and identity 
of the villages."[82] There are 15 urban villages: Ahwatukee Foothills, 
Alhambra, Camelback East, Central City, Deer Valley, Desert View, Encanto, 
Estrella, Laveen, Maryvale, North Gateway, North Mountain, Paradise Valley, 
Rio Vista, and South Mountain. The urban village of Paradise Valley is 
different than the nearby town of Paradise Valley. Although the urban village 
is part of Phoenix City, the town is independent. In addition to the above 
urban villages, Phoenix has a variety of commonly referred-to regions and 
districts, such as Downtown, Midtown, Uptown,[83] West Phoenix, North Phoenix, 
South Phoenix, Biltmore, Arcadia, and Sunnyslope. Phoenix has a subtropical 
desert climate (Köppen climate classification BWh), typical of the Sonoran 
Desert. Phoenix has long, extremely hot summers and short, mild to warm 
winters. The city is located within the sunniest region in the world. Measuring 
3,872 hours of bright sunshine annually, Phoenix receives the most sunshine 
of any major city on earth.[84] Average high temperatures in summer are 
the hottest of any major city in the United States.[85] On average, there 
are 107 days annually with a high of at least 100 °F (38 °C)[86] including 
most days from late May through early October. Highs top 110 °F (43 °C) 
an average of 18 days during the year.[87] On June 26, 1990, the temperature 
reached an all-time recorded high of 122 °F (50 °C).[88] Despite the city's 
claim to the most extreme heat in summer, however, it does not have the 
highest average annual temperature in the contiguous United States. In 
that respect, it comes second to Miami, with an average daily temperature 
of 75 °F (24 °C) compared to Miami's 77 °F (25 °C).[85] Unlike most desert 
locations which undergo drastic fluctuations between day and nighttime 
temperatures, Phoenix's diurnal temperature variation is limited by the 
urban heat island effect. As the city has expanded, average summer low 
temps have been steadily rising. The daily heat of the sun is stored in 
pavement, sidewalks, and buildings, and it is radiated back out at night.[89] 
The daily normal low remains at or above 80 °F (27 °C) for an average of 
67 days per summer. On July 15, 2003, Phoenix set its record for the warmest 
daily low temperature, at 96 °F (36 °C).[86] The city averages approximately 
300 days of sunshine, or over 85% of daylight hours per year,[90][91] and 
receives scant rainfall—the average annual total at Phoenix Sky Harbor 
International Airport being 8.03 in (204 mm). Precipitation is sparse during 
most of the year, but the North American Monsoon brings an influx of moisture 
during the summer. Historically, the monsoon officially started when the 
average dew point was 55 °F (13 °C) for three days in a row—typically occurring 
in early July. In order to increase monsoon awareness and promote safety, 
however, the National Weather Service decreed that starting in 2008, June 
15 would be the official "first day" of the monsoon, and it would end on 
September 30.[92] When active, the monsoon raises humidity levels and can 
cause heavy localized precipitation, flash floods, hail, destructive winds, 
and dust storms[93]—which can rise to the level of a haboob in some years.[94] 
July is the wettest month of the year (1.05 in (27 mm)), while June is 
the driest (0.02 in (0.51 mm)). On September 8, 2014, the city of Phoenix 
recorded its single highest rainfall total by the National Weather Service 
with 3.30 in (84 mm) breaking a 75-year-old previous record of 2.91 in 
(74 mm), set back on September 4, 1939.[95] The September 2014 storm was 
created from the remnants of Hurricane Norbert which had moved up from 
the Gulf of California and flooded the city's major interstates and low-lying 
roadways, stranding hundreds of motorists.[96] On average, dew points range 
from 26.0 °F (−3 °C) in December to 62 °F (17 °C) in August.[97] Generally 
speaking, Phoenix only has one day per year where the low temperature drops 
to or below 32 °F (0 °C).[86] However, outlying portions of the greater 
Phoenix metropolitan area frequently see frost in the winter. The earliest 
freeze on record occurred on November 4, 1956, and the latest occurred 
on March 31, 1987.[a] The all-time lowest recorded temperature in Phoenix 
was 16 °F (−9 °C) on January 7, 1913, while the coldest daily high temperature 
ever recorded was 36 °F (2 °C) on December 10, 1898. The longest continuous 
stretch without a day of frost in Phoenix was over 5 years, from November 
23, 1979, to January 31, 1985.[98][99] Snow is a very rare occurrence for 
the city of Phoenix. Snowfall was first officially recorded in 1898, and 
since then, accumulations of 0.1 inches (0.25 cm) or greater have occurred 
only eight times. The heaviest snowstorm on record dates to January 21–22, 
1937, when 1 to 4 inches (2.5 to 10.2 cm) fell in parts of the city and 
did not melt entirely for three days. The most recent significant snowfall 
occurred on December 6, 1998, across the northwest portions of the greater 
metro area. During the 1998 event, Sky Harbor reported a dusting of snow.[100] 
On December 30, 2010 and February 20, 2013, graupel fell across much of 
the city; although, it was widely believed to be snow.[101] While some 
of the native flora and fauna of the Sonoran Desert can be found within 
Phoenix city limits, most are found in the suburbs and the undeveloped 
desert areas surrounding the city. Native mammal species include coyote, 
javelina, bobcat, mountain lion, desert cottontail rabbit, jackrabbit, 
antelope ground squirrel, mule deer, ringtail, coati, and multiple species 
of bats, such as the Mexican free-tailed bat and western pipistrelle, that 
roost in and around the city. There are many species of native birds, including 
Costa's hummingbird, Anna's hummingbird, Gambel's quail, Gila woodpecker, 
mourning dove, white-winged dove, the roadrunner, the cactus wren, and 
many species of raptors, including falcons, hawks, owls, vultures (such 
as the turkey vulture and black vulture), and eagles, including the golden 
and the bald eagle.[105][106] The area is also home to a plethora of native 
reptile species including the Western diamondback rattlesnake, Sonoran 
sidewinder, several other types of rattlesnakes, Sonoran coral snake, dozens 
of species of non-venomous snakes (including the Sonoran gopher snake and 
the California kingsnake), the gila monster, desert spiny lizard, several 
types of whiptail lizards, the chuckwalla, desert horned lizard, Western 
banded gecko, Sonora mud turtle, and the desert tortoise. Native amphibian 
species include the Couch's spadefoot toad, Chiricahua leopard frog, and 
the Sonoran desert toad.[107] Phoenix and the surrounding areas are also 
home to a wide variety of native invertebrates including the Arizona bark 
scorpion, giant desert hairy scorpion, Arizona blond tarantula, Sonoran 
Desert centipede, tarantula hawk wasp, camel spider, and tailless whip 
scorpion. Of great concern is the presence of Africanized bees which can 
be extremely dangerous—even lethal—when provoked. The Arizona Upland subdivision 
of the Sonoran Desert (of which Phoenix is a part) has "the most structurally 
diverse flora in the United States." One of the most well-known types of 
succulents, the giant saguaro cactus, is found throughout the city and 
its neighboring environs. Other native species are the organpipe, barrel, 
fishhook, senita, prickly pear and cholla cacti; ocotillo; Palo Verde trees 
and foothill and blue paloverde; California fan palm; agaves; soaptree 
yucca, Spanish bayonet, desert spoon, and red yucca; ironwood; mesquite; 
and the creosote bush.[108][109] Many non-native plants also thrive in 
Phoenix including, but not limited to, the date palm, Mexican fan palm, 
pineapple palm, Afghan pine, Canary Island pine, Mexican fencepost cactus, 
cardon cactus, acacia, eucalyptus, aloe, bougainvillea, oleander, lantana, 
bottlebrush, olive, citrus, and red bird of paradise. The greater Phoenix 
region is home to the only thriving feral population of rosy-faced lovebirds 
in the U.S. This bird is a popular birdcage pet, native to southwestern 
Africa. Feral birds were first observed living outdoors in 1987, probably 
escaped or released pets, and by 2010 the Greater Phoenix population had 
grown to about 950 birds. These lovebirds prefer older neighborhoods where 
they nest under untrimmed, dead palm tree fronds.[110][111] Phoenix is 
the sixth most populous city in the United States according to the 2010 
United States Census, with a population of 1,445,632, making it the most 
populous state capital in the United States.[114] Phoenix's ranking as 
the sixth most populous city was a drop from the number five position it 
had held since the U. S. Census Bureau released population estimates on 
June 28, 2007. Those statistics used data from 2006, which showed Phoenix's 
population at 1,512,986, which put it just ahead of Philadelphia.[114] 
After leading the nation in population growth for over a decade, the sub-prime 
mortgage crisis, followed by the recession, led to a slowing in the growth 
of Phoenix. There were approximately 77,000 people added to the population 
of the Phoenix metropolitan area in 2009, which was down significantly 
from its peak in 2006 of 162,000.[115][116] Despite this slowing, Phoenix's 
population grew by 9.4% since the 2000 census (a total of 124,000 people), 
while the entire Phoenix metropolitan area grew by 28.9% during the same 
period. This compares with an overall growth rate nationally during the 
same time frame of 9.7%.[117][118] Not since 1940–50, when the city had 
a population of 107,000, had the city gained less than 124,000 in a decade. 
Phoenix's recent growth rate of 9.4% from the 2010 census is the first 
time it has recorded a growth rate under 24% in a census decade.[119] The 
Phoenix Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) (officially known as the Phoenix-Mesa-Glendale 
MSA), is one of 10 MSAs in Arizona, and was the 14th largest in the United 
States, with a total population of 4,192,887 as of the 2010 Census. Consisting 
of parts of both Pinal and Maricopa counties, the MSA accounts for 65.5% 
of the total population of the state of Arizona.[117][118] Phoenix only 
contributed 13% to the total growth rate of the MSA, down significantly 
from its 33% share during the prior decade.[119] Phoenix is also part of 
the Arizona Sun Corridor megaregion (MR), which is the 10th most populous 
of the 11 MRs, and the 8th largest by area. It had the 2nd largest growth 
by percentage of the MRs (behind only the Gulf Coast MR) between 2000 and 
2010.[120] The population is almost equally split between men and women, 
with men making up 50.2% of city's citizens. The population density is 
2,797.8 people per square mile, and the median age of the city is 32.2 
years, with only 10.9 of the population being over 62. 98.5% of Phoenix's 
population lives in households with an average household size of 2.77 people. 
There were 514,806 total households, with 64.2% of those households consisting 
of families: 42.3% married couples, 7% with an unmarried male as head of 
household, and 14.9% with an unmarried female as head of household. 33.6% 
of those households have children below the age of 18. Of the 35.8% of 
non-family households, 27.1% of them have a householder living alone, almost 
evenly split between men and women, with women having 13.7% and men occupying 
13.5%. Phoenix has 590,149 housing units, with an occupancy rate of 87.2%. 
The largest segment of vacancies is in the rental market, where the vacancy 
rate is 14.9%, and 51% of all vacancies are in rentals. Vacant houses for 
sale only make up 17.7% of the vacancies, with the rest being split among 
vacation properties and other various reasons.[121] The median income for 
a household in the city was $47,866, and the median income for a family 
was $54,804. Males had a median income of $32,820 versus $27,466 for females. 
The per capita income for the city was $24,110. 21.8% of the population 
and 17.1% of families were below the poverty line. Out of the total population, 
31.4% of those under the age of 18 and 10.5% of those 65 and older were 
living below the poverty line.[122] According to the 2010 Census, the racial 
breakdown of Phoenix was as follows:[123] Phoenix's population has historically 
been predominantly white. From 1890 to 1970, over 90% of the citizens were 
white. In recent years, this percentage has dropped, reaching 65% In 2010. 
However, a significant portion of this decrease can be attributed to new 
guidelines put out by the U.S. Census Bureau in 1980, when a question regarding 
Hispanic origin was added to the census questionnaire. This has led to 
an increasing tendency for some groups to no longer self-identify as white, 
and instead categorize themselves as "other races".[125] 20.6% of the population 
of the city was foreign born in 2010. Of the 1,342,803 residents over 5 
years of age, 63.5% spoke only English, 30.6% spoke Spanish at home, 2.5% 
spoke another Indo-European language, 2.1% spoke Asian or Islander languages, 
with the remaining 1.4% speaking other languages. About 15.7% of non-English 
speakers reported speaking English less than "very well". The largest national 
ancestries reported were Mexican (35.9%), German (15.3%), Irish (10.3%), 
English (9.4%), Black (6.5%), Italian (4.5%), French (2.7%), Polish (2.5%), 
American Indian (2.2%), and Scottish (2.0%).[126] Hispanics or Latinos 
of any race make up 40.8% of the population. Of these the largest groups 
are at 35.9% Mexican, 0.6% Puerto Rican, 0.5% Guatemalan, 0.3% Salvadoran, 
0.3% Cuban. According to a 2014 study by the Pew Research Center, 66% of 
the population of the city identified themselves as Christians,[127][128] 
while 26% claimed no religious affiliation. The same study says that other 
religions (including Judaism, Buddhism, Islam, and Hinduism) collectively 
make up about 7% of the population. In 2010, according to the Association 
of Religion Data Archives, which conducts religious census each ten years, 
39% of those polled in Maricopa county considered themselves a member of 
a religious group. Of those who expressed a religious affiliation, the 
area's religious composition was reported as 35% Catholic, 22% to Evangelical 
Protestant denominations, 16% Latter-Day Saints (LDS), 14% to nondenominational 
congregations, 7% to Mainline Protestant denominations, and 2% Hindu. The 
remaining 4% belong to other religions, such as Buddhism, and Judaism. 
While there was an overall increase in the number of religious adherents 
over the decade of 103,000, that did not keep pace with the overall population 
increase in the country during the same period, which increased by almost 
three-quarters of million individuals, resulting in the percentage drop. 
The largest aggregate increases were in the LDS (a 58% increase) and Evangelical 
Protestant churches (14% increase), while all other categories saw their 
numbers drop slightly, or remain static. Overall, the Catholic Church had 
an 8% drop, while Mainline Protestant groups saw a 28% decline.[129] The 
early economy of Phoenix was focused primarily on agriculture and natural 
resources, dependent on the "5Cs" of copper, cattle, climate, cotton, and 
citrus.[11] With the establishment of the Southern Pacific rail line in 
1926, the opening of the Union Station in 1923, and the creation of Sky 
Harbor airport by the end of the decade, the city became more easily accessible.[130] 
The Great Depression affected Phoenix, but Phoenix had a diverse economy 
and by 1934 the recovery was underway.[131][132] At the conclusion of World 
War II, the valley's economy surged, as many men who had undergone their 
military training at the various bases in and around Phoenix returned with 
their families. The construction industry, spurred on by the city's growth, 
further expanded with the development of Sun City. It became the template 
for suburban development in post-WWII America,[133] and Sun City became 
the template for retirement communities when it opened in 1960.[134][135] 
The city averaged a 4 percent annual growth rate over a 40-year period 
from the mid-1960s to the mid-2000s.[12] As the national financial crisis 
of 2007–10 began, construction in Phoenix collapsed and housing prices 
plunged.[136] Arizona jobs declined by 11.8% from peak to trough; in 2007 
Phoenix had 1,918,100 employed individuals, by 2010 that number had shrunk 
by 226,500 to 1,691,600.[137] By the end of 2015, the employment number 
in Phoenix had risen to 1.97 million, finally regaining its pre-recession 
levels,[138] with job growth occurring across the board.[139] As of 2014[update], 
the Phoenix MSA had a Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of just over $215 billion. 
The top five industries were: real estate ($35.5B), Finance and insurance 
($18.8B), manufacturing ($18.2B), Retail trade ($16.6B), and health care 
($16.6B). Government, if it had been a private industry, would have been 
ranked third on the list, generating $18.9 billion.[140] In Phoenix, real 
estate developers face few constraints when planning and developing new 
projects. Accordingly, the city is prone to overbuilding during times of 
economic prosperity. This explains the city's higher-than-average vacancy 
rates.[141] As of 2010[update], the top five employment categories were 
office and administrative support (17.8%), sales (11.6%), food preparation 
and serving (9%), transportation and material moving (6.1%), and management 
(5.8%). The single largest occupation is retail salespersons, which account 
for 3.7% of the workforce.[142] As of January 2016, 10.5% of the workforce 
were government employees, a high number because the city is both the county 
seat and state capitol. The civilian labor force was 2,200,900, and the 
unemployment rate stood at 4.6%.[139] Phoenix is currently home to four 
Fortune 500 companies: electronics corporation Avnet,[143] mining company 
Freeport-McMoRan,[144] retailer PetSmart,[145] and waste hauler Republic 
Services.[146] Honeywell's Aerospace division is headquartered in Phoenix, 
and the valley hosts many of their avionics and mechanical facilities.[147] 
Intel has one of their largest sites in the area, employing about 12,000 
employees, the second largest Intel location in the country.[148] The city 
is also home to: the headquarters of U-HAUL International; Best Western; 
and Apollo Group, parent of the University of Phoenix. US Air/American 
Airlines is the largest carrier at Sky Harbor International Airport in 
Phoenix. Mesa Air Group, a regional airline group, is headquartered in 
Phoenix.[149] The military has a significant presence in Phoenix, with 
Luke Air Force Base located in the western suburbs. The city was severely 
impacted by the effects of the sub-prime mortgage crash. However, Phoenix 
has recovered 83% of the jobs lost due to the recession.[141] The city 
has numerous performing arts venues, most of which are located in and around 
downtown Phoenix or Scottsdale. The Phoenix Symphony Hall is home to the 
Phoenix Symphony Orchestra, the Arizona Opera and Ballet Arizona.[150] 
The Arizona Opera company also has intimate performances at its new Arizona 
Opera Center, which opened in March 2013.[151] Another venue is the Orpheum 
Theatre, which is home to the Phoenix Opera.[152] Ballet Arizona, in addition 
to the Symphony Hall, also has performances at the Orpheum Theatre as well 
at the Dorrance Theater. Concerts also regularly make stops in the area. 
The largest downtown performing art venue is the Herberger Theater Center, 
which houses three performance spaces and is home to two resident companies, 
the Arizona Theatre Company and the Centre Dance Ensemble. Three other 
groups also use the facility: Valley Youth Theatre, iTheatre Collaborative[153] 
and Actors Theater.[154] Concerts can be attended at Talking Stick Resort 
Arena and Comerica Theatre in downtown Phoenix, Ak-Chin Pavilion in Maryvale, 
Gila River Arena in Glendale, and Gammage Auditorium in Tempe (the last 
public building designed by Frank Lloyd Wright).[155] Several smaller theaters 
including Trunk Space, the Mesa Arts Center, the Crescent Ballroom, Celebrity 
Theatre, and Modified Arts support regular independent musical and theater 
performances. Music can also be seen in some of the venues usually reserved 
for sports, such as the Wells Fargo Arena and the University of Phoenix 
Stadium.[156] Several television series have been set in Phoenix, including 
Alice (1976–85), the 2000s paranormal drama Medium, the 1960–61 syndicated 
crime drama The Brothers Brannagan, and The New Dick Van Dyke Show from 
1971 to 1974. Dozens of museums exist throughout the valley. They include 
the Phoenix Art Museum, Arizona Capitol Museum, Arizona Military Museum, 
Hall of Flame Firefighting Museum, the Pueblo Grande Museum and Cultural 
Park, Children's Museum of Phoenix, Arizona Science Center, and the Heard 
Museum. In 2010 the Musical Instrument Museum opened their doors, featuring 
the biggest musical instrument collection in the world.[157] Designed by 
Alden B. Dow, a student of Frank Lloyd Wright, the Phoenix Art Museum was 
constructed in a single year, opening in November 1959.[158] The Phoenix 
Art Museum has the southwest's largest collection of visual art, containing 
more than 17,000 works of contemporary and modern art from around the world.[159][160][161] 
Interactive exhibits can be found in nearby Peoria's Challenger Space Center, 
where individuals learn about space, renewable energies, and meet astronauts.[162] 
The Heard Museum has over 130,000 square feet (12,000 m²) of gallery, classroom 
and performance space. Some of the signature exhibits include a full Navajo 
hogan, the Mareen Allen Nichols Collection containing 260 pieces of contemporary 
jewelry, the Barry Goldwater Collection of 437 historic Hopi kachina dolls, 
and an exhibit on the 19th-century boarding school experiences of Native 
Americans. The Heard Museum attracts about 250,000 visitors a year.[163] 
The downtown Phoenix art scene has developed in the past decade. The Artlink 
organization and the galleries downtown have successfully launched a First 
Friday cross-Phoenix gallery opening. In April 2009, artist Janet Echelman 
inaugurated her monumental sculpture, Her Secret Is Patience, a civic icon 
suspended above the new Phoenix Civic Space Park, a two-city-block park 
in the middle of downtown. This netted sculpture makes the invisible patterns 
of desert wind visible to the human eye. During the day, the 100-foot (30 m)-tall 
sculpture hovers high above heads, treetops, and buildings, the sculpture 
creates what the artist calls "shadow drawings", which she says are inspired 
by Phoenix's cloud shadows. At night, the illumination changes color gradually 
through the seasons. Author Prof. Patrick Frank writes of the sculpture 
that "... most Arizonans look on the work with pride: this unique visual 
delight will forever mark the city of Phoenix just as the Eiffel Tower 
marks Paris."[164] Phoenix is the home of a unique architectural tradition 
and community. Frank Lloyd Wright moved to Phoenix in 1937 and built his 
winter home, Taliesin West, and the main campus for The Frank Lloyd Wright 
School of Architecture.[166] Over the years, Phoenix has attracted notable 
architects who have made it their home and have grown successful practices. 
These architectural studios embrace the desert climate, and are unconventional 
in their approach to the practice of design. They include the Paolo Soleri 
(who created Arcosanti),[167] Al Beadle,[168] Will Bruder,[169] Wendell 
Burnette,[170] and Blank Studio architectural design studios.[171] Another 
major force in architectural landscape of the city was Ralph Haver whose 
firm, Haver & Nunn, designed commercial, industrial and residential structures 
throughout the valley. Of particular note was his trademark, "Haver Home", 
which were affordable contemporary-style tract houses.[172] The tourist 
industry is the longest running of today's top industries in Phoenix. Starting 
with promotions back in the 1920s, the industry has grown into one of the 
top 10 in the city.[173] Due to its climate, Phoenix and its neighbors 
have consistently ranked among the nation's top destinations in the number 
of Five Diamond/Five Star resorts.[174] With more than 62,000 hotel rooms 
in over 500 hotels and 40 resorts, greater Phoenix sees over 16 million 
visitors each year, the majority of whom are leisure (as opposed to business) 
travelers. Sky Harbor Airport, which serves the Greater Phoenix area, serves 
about 40 million passengers a year, ranking it among the 10 busiest airports 
in the nation.[175] One of the biggest attractions of the Phoenix area 
is golf, with over 200 golf courses.[174] In addition to the sites of interest 
in the city, there are many attractions near Phoenix, such as: Agua Fria 
National Monument, Arcosanti, Casa Grande Ruins National Monument, Lost 
Dutchman State Park, Montezuma's Castle, Montezuma's Well, and Organ Pipe 
Cactus National Monument. Phoenix also serves as a central point to many 
of the sights around the state of Arizona, such as the Grand Canyon, Lake 
Havasu (where the London Bridge is located), Meteor Crater, the Painted 
Desert, the Petrified Forest, Tombstone, Kartchner Caverns, Sedona and 
Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff. Due to its natural beauty and climate, 
Phoenix has a plethora of outdoor attractions and recreational activities. 
The Phoenix Zoo is the largest privately owned, non-profit zoo in the United 
States. Since opening in 1962, the zoo has developed an international reputation 
for its efforts on animal conservation, including breeding and reintroducing 
endangered species back into the wild.[176] Right next to the zoo, the 
Phoenix Botanical Gardens were opened in 1939, and are acclaimed worldwide 
for their exhibits and educational programs, featuring the largest collection 
of arid plants in the U.S.[177][178][179] South Mountain Park, the largest 
municipal park in the U.S., is also the highest desert mountain preserve 
in the world.[180] Other popular sites in the city are: Japanese Friendship 
Garden, Historic Heritage Square, Phoenix Mountains Park, Pueblo Grande 
Museum, Tovrea Castle, Camelback Mountain, Hole in the Rock, Mystery Castle, 
St. Mary's Basilica, Taliesin West, and the Wrigley Mansion.[181] There 
is long list of annual events in and near Phoenix which celebrate the heritage 
of the city, as well as its diversity. Some of those are: the Scottsdale 
Arabian Horse Show, the largest horse show in the world; Matsuri, a celebration 
of Japanese culture; Pueblo Grande Indian Market, an event highlighting 
Native American arts and crafts; Grand Menorah Lighting, an annual December 
event celebrating Hanukah; ZooLights, an annual December evening event 
at the Phoenix Zoo, featuring millions of lights; the Arizona State Fair, 
begun in 1884, an annual fair; Scottish Gathering & Highland Games, an 
annual event celebrating Scottish heritage; Estrella War, an annual event 
celebrating medieval life; Tohono O'odham Nation Rodeo & Fair, Oldest Indian 
rodeo in Arizona; and the Chinese Week & Culture & Cuisine Festival, an 
annual celebration of Chinese culture.[182][183][184][185] Like many other 
western towns, the earliest restaurants in Phoenix were often steakhouses. 
Today, Phoenix is also renowned for its Mexican food, thanks to both its 
large Hispanic population and its proximity to Mexico. Some of Phoenix's 
restaurants have a long history. The Stockyards steakhouse dates to 1947, 
while Monti's La Casa Vieja (Spanish for "The Old House") was in operation 
as a restaurant since the 1890s, but closed its doors November 17, 2014.[186][187] 
Macayo's (a Mexican restaurant chain) was established in Phoenix in 1946, 
and other major Mexican restaurants include Garcia's (1956) and Manuel's 
(1964).[188] The recent population boom has brought people from all over 
the nation, and to a lesser extent from other countries, and has since 
influenced the local cuisine. Phoenix currently boasts cuisines from all 
over the world, such as Korean, barbecue, Cajun/Creole, Greek, Hawaiian, 
Irish, Japanese, sushi, Italian, fusion, Persian, Indian, Spanish, Thai, 
Chinese, southwestern, Tex-Mex, Vietnamese, Brazilian, and French.[189] 
The first McDonald's franchise was sold by the McDonald brothers to a Phoenix 
entrepreneur in 1952. Neil Fox paid $1,000 for the rights to open an establishment 
based on the McDonald brothers' restaurant.[190] The hamburger stand opened 
in 1953 on the southwest corner of Central Avenue and Indian School Road 
on the growing north side of Phoenix, and was the first location to sport 
the now internationally known "golden arches", which were initially twice 
the height of the building. Three other franchise locations opened that 
year, a full two years before Kroc purchased McDonald's and opened his 
first franchise in Illinois.[190] Phoenix is home to several professional 
sports franchises, and is one of only 13 U.S. cities to have representatives 
of all four major professional sports leagues, although only one of these 
teams actually carry the city name and two of them play within the city 
limits.[191][192] The Phoenix Suns were the first major sports team in 
Phoenix, being granted a National Basketball Association (NBA) franchise 
in 1968.[193] They had originally played at the Arizona Veterans Memorial 
Coliseum before moving to America West Arena (now Talking Stick Resort 
Arena) in 1992.[194] The year following their move to the new arena, the 
Suns made it to the NBA finals for the second time in franchise history, 
losing to Michael Jordan's Chicago Bulls, 4 games to 2.[195] The U.S. Airways 
Center hosted both the 1995 and the 2009 NBA All-Star Games.[196] In 1997, 
the Phoenix Mercury were one of the original eight teams to launch the 
Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA).[197] They also play at 
Talking Stick Resorts Arena. They have won the WNBA championship three 
times: first in 2007 when they defeated the Detroit Shock,[198] again in 
2009 when they defeated the Indiana Fever,[199] and in 2014 when they swept 
the Chicago Sky.[200] The Arizona Diamondbacks of Major League Baseball 
began play as an expansion team in 1998. The team has played all of its 
home games in the same downtown park, now known as Chase Field.[201][202] 
It is the second highest stadium in the U.S. (after Coors Field in Denver), 
and is known for its swimming pool beyond the outfield fence.[203] In 2001, 
the Diamondbacks defeated the New York Yankees 4 games to 3 in the World 
Series,[204] becoming the city's first professional sports franchise to 
win a national championship while located in Arizona. The win was also 
the fastest an expansion team had ever won the World Series, surpassing 
the old mark of the Florida Marlins of 5 years, set in 1997.[205] The Arizona 
Cardinals are the oldest continuously run professional football franchise 
in the nation. Founded in 1898 in Chicago, they moved to Phoenix from St. 
Louis in 1988 and currently play in the Western Division of the National 
Football League's National Football Conference. Upon their move to Phoenix, 
the Cardinals originally played their home games at Sun Devil Stadium on 
the campus of Arizona State University in nearby Tempe. In 2006 they moved 
to the newly constructed University of Phoenix Stadium in suburban Glendale.[206] 
Since moving to Phoenix, the Cardinals have made one championship appearance, 
Super Bowl XLIII in 2009, where they lost 27–23 to the Pittsburgh Steelers.[207] 
Sun Devil Stadium held Super Bowl XXX in 1996. The University of Phoenix 
Stadium hosted Super Bowl XLII in 2008, and Super Bowl XLIX in 2015.[208] 
The Arizona Coyotes of the National Hockey League moved to the area in 
1996,[209] formerly known as the Winnipeg Jets. They originally played 
their home games at America West Arena in downtown Phoenix before moving 
in December 2003 to the Jobing.com Arena (now named the Gila River Arena) 
in Glendale.[210] *Note: The Cardinals won 2 of their championships while 
in Chicago, pre-modern era. The Phoenix area hosts two annual college football 
bowl games: the Fiesta Bowl, played at the University of Phoenix Stadium,[211] 
and the Motel 6 Cactus Bowl, which is held at Chase Field.[212] Phoenix 
has an indoor football team, the Arizona Rattlers of the Indoor Football 
League. Their games are also played at Talking Stick Resort Arena. They 
played in the Arena Football League from 1992 to 2016 and had won five 
AFL championships before leaving the league.[213] The Greater Phoenix area 
is home to the Cactus League, one of two spring training leagues for Major 
League Baseball. With the move by the Colorado Rockies and the Arizona 
Diamondbacks to their new facility in Scottsdale, the league is entirely 
based in the Greater Phoenix area. With the Cincinnati Reds' move to Goodyear, 
fifteen of MLB's thirty teams are now included in the Cactus League.[214] 
The Phoenix International Raceway was built in 1964 with a one-mile oval, 
with a one-of-a-kind design, as well as a 2.5-mile road course.[215] It 
currently hosts several NASCAR events per season, and the annual Fall NASCAR 
weekend, which includes events from four different NASCAR classes, is a 
huge event.[216][217] After thirty years of hosting various events, especially 
NHRA drag racing events, Firebird International Raceway (FIR) closed operations 
in 2013,[218] but the NHRA re-opened the venue to NHRA events in 2014 under 
the new name, "Wild Horse Pass Motorsports Park".[219] The city is also 
host to several major professional golf events, including the LPGA's Founder's 
Cup[220] and, since 1932, The Phoenix Open of the PGA.[221] The Phoenix 
Marathon is a new addition to the city's sports scene, and is a qualifier 
for the Boston Marathon.[222] The Rock 'n' Roll Marathon series has held 
an event in Phoenix every January since 2004.[223] Phoenix is home to a 
large number of parks and recreation areas. The city of Phoenix includes 
national parks, county (Maricopa County) parks and city parks. Tonto National 
Forest forms part of the northeast boundary of the city, while the county 
has the largest park system in the country.[224] The city park system was 
established to preserve the desert landscape in areas that would otherwise 
have succumbed to development and includes South Mountain Park, the world's 
largest municipal park with 16,500 acres (67 km2).[225] The city park system 
has 182 parks which contain over 41,900 acres (16,956 ha), making it the 
largest municipal park system in the country.[226] The park system has 
facilities for hiking, camping, swimming, horseback riding, cycling, and 
climbing.[227] Some of the other notable parks in the system are Camelback 
Mountain, Encanto Park (another large urban park) and Sunnyslope Mountain, 
also known as "S" Mountain.[228] Papago Park in east Phoenix is home to 
both the Desert Botanical Garden and the Phoenix Zoo, in addition to several 
golf courses and the Hole-in-the-Rock geological formation. The Desert 
Botanical Garden, which opened in 1939, is one of the few public gardens 
in the country dedicated to desert plants, and displays desert plant life 
from all over the world. The Phoenix Zoo is the largest privately owned 
non-profit zoo in the United States and is internationally known for its 
programs devoted to saving endangered species.[229] In 1913, Phoenix adopted 
a new form of government, switching from the mayor-council system to the 
council-manager system, making it one of the first cities in the United 
States with this form of city government, where a city manager supervises 
all city departments and executes the policies adopted by the Council.[230][231] 
Today, Phoenix represents the largest municipal government of this type 
in the country.[232] The city council consists of a mayor and eight city 
council members. While the mayor is elected in a citywide election, Phoenix 
City Council members are elected by votes only in the districts they represent, 
with both the Mayor and the Council members serving four-year terms.[233] 
The current mayor of Phoenix is Greg Stanton, a Democrat who was elected 
in 2011,[234] and re-elected in 2015.[235] The mayor and city council members 
each have equal voting power in regards to setting city policy and passing 
rules and regulations.[233] The city's website was given a "Sunny Award" 
by Sunshine Review for its transparency efforts.[236] As the capital of 
Arizona, Phoenix houses the state legislature,[237] along with numerous 
state government agencies, many of which are located in the State Capitol 
district immediately west of downtown. The Arizona Department of Juvenile 
Corrections operates the Adobe Mountain and Black Canyon Schools in Phoenix.[238] 
Another major state government facility is the Arizona State Hospital, 
operated by the Arizona Department of Health Services. This is a mental 
health center which is the only medical facility run by the state government.[239] 
The headquarters of numerous Arizona state government agencies are in Phoenix, 
with many located in the State Capitol district. The Federal Bureau of 
Prisons operates the Federal Correctional Institution (FCI) Phoenix which 
is within the city limits, near its northern boundary.[240] The Sandra 
Day O'Connor U.S. Courthouse, the U.S. District Court of Arizona, is located 
on Washington Street downtown. It is named in honor of retired U.S. Supreme 
Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who was raised in Arizona.[241] The 
Federal Building is at the intersection of Van Buren Road and First Avenue 
downtown, and contains various federal field offices and the local division 
of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court.[242] This building formerly housed the U.S. 
District Court offices and courtrooms, but these were moved in 2001 to 
the new Sandra Day O'Connor U.S. Courthouse. Before the construction of 
this building in 1961, federal government offices were housed in the historic 
U.S. Post Office on Central Avenue, completed in the 1930s.[243] By the 
1960s crime was becoming a significant problem in Phoenix, and by the 1970s 
crime continued to increase in the city at a faster rate than almost anywhere 
else in the country.[244] It was during this time frame when an incident 
occurred in Phoenix which would have national implications. On March 16, 
1963, Ernesto Miranda was arrested and charged with rape.[245] The subsequent 
Supreme Court ruling on June 13, 1966, Miranda v. Arizona, has led to practice 
in the United States of issuing a Miranda Warning to all suspected criminals.[246] 
With Phoenix's rapid growth, one of the prime areas of criminal activity 
was land fraud. The practice became so widespread that newspapers would 
refer to Phoenix as the Tainted Desert.[247] These land frauds led to one 
of the more infamous murders in the history of the valley, when Arizona 
Republic writer Don Bolles was murdered by a car bomb in 1976.[248][249] 
It was believed that his investigative reporting on organized crime and 
land fraud in Phoenix made him a target.[250][251][252] Bolles was the 
only reporter from a major U.S. newspaper to be murdered on U.S. soil due 
to his coverage of a story.[250] Max Dunlap was convicted of first-degree 
murder in the case.[252] Street gangs and the drug trade had turned into 
public safety issues by the 1980s, and the crime rate in Phoenix continued 
to grow.[253] After seeing a peak in the early and mid-1990s, the city 
has seen a general decrease in crime rates. The Maricopa County Jail system 
is the fourth-largest in the world.[114] The violent crime rate peaked 
in 1993 at 1146 crimes per 100,000 people, while the property crime rate 
peaked a few years earlier, in 1989, at 9,966 crimes per 100,000.[254] 
In the most recent numbers from the FBI (2012), those rates currently stand 
at 637 and 4091, respectively. Since their peak in 2003, murders have dropped 
from 241 to 114 in 2014.[254][255] In 2001 and 2002 Phoenix ranked first 
in the nation in vehicle thefts, with over 22,000 and 25,000 cars stolen 
each year respectively.[256] It has declined every year since then, stood 
at 7200 in 2014, a drop of almost 70% during that timeframe.[255] The Phoenix 
MSA has dropped to 70th in the nation in terms of car thefts in 2012.[257] 
As the first decade of the new century came to a close, Arizona had become 
the gateway to the U.S. for drug trafficking.[258] Another crime issue 
related to the drug trade are kidnappings. In the late 2000s, Phoenix earned 
the title "Kidnapping capital of the USA".[259] The majority of the kidnapped 
are believed to be victims of human smuggling, or related to illegal drug 
trade, while the kidnappers are believed to be part of Mexican drug cartels.[258] 
Public education in the Phoenix area is provided by 33 school districts. 
There are 21 elementary school districts, which contain over 215 elementary 
schools, and they are paired with 4 high school districts, which have a 
total of 31 high schools serving Phoenix. Three of the high school districts 
(Glendale Union, Tempe Union and Tolleson Union) only partially serve Phoenix. 
With over 27,000 students, and spread over 220 square miles, The Phoenix 
Union High School District is one of the largest high school districts 
in the country, containing 16 schools and nearly 3,000 employees.[260] 
In addition, there are 4 unified districts, which cover grades K-12, which 
add an additional 58 elementary schools and 4 high schools to Phoenix's 
educational system. Of those four, only the Paradise Valley district completely 
serves Phoenix.[261] Phoenix is also served by an expanding number of charter 
schools, with well over 100 currently operating in the city.[262] Arizona 
State University is the main institution of higher education in the region. 
Its main campus is in Tempe. ASU also has campuses in northwest Phoenix 
(ASU West Campus), downtown Phoenix (ASU Downtown Campus), Mesa (ASU Polytechnic 
Campus), and Glendale (Thunderbird School of Global Management).[263] ASU 
is one of the largest public universities in the U.S., with a 2012 student 
enrollment of 72,254.[264] A branch of the University of Arizona College 
of Medicine is located near ASU's downtown Phoenix campus.[265] There is 
also a small satellite campus for Northern Arizona University (based in 
Flagstaff) located in Phoenix.[266] The Maricopa County Community College 
District includes ten community colleges and two skills centers throughout 
Maricopa County, providing adult education and job training. Phoenix College, 
part of the district, was founded in 1920 and is the oldest community college 
in Arizona and one of the oldest in the country.[267] The city is also 
home to numerous other institutions of higher learning. Notable institutions 
include: Barrow Neurological Institute, the world's largest neurological 
disease treatment and research institution;[268] Grand Canyon University, 
a private Christian university initially founded in 1949 as a non-profit 
school,[269] it now operates as a for-profit institution;[270] the University 
of Phoenix is the nation's largest for-profit university with over 300,000 
students at campuses throughout North America, as well as online;[264] 
and the Arizona Summit Law School, a private, for-profit law school located 
in downtown Phoenix.[271] The first newspaper in Phoenix was the weekly 
Salt River Valley Herald, established in 1878, which would change its name 
the following year to the Phoenix Herald. The paper would go through several 
additional name changes in its early years before finally settling on the 
Phoenix Herald, which still exists today in an on-line form.[272] Today, 
the city is served by two major daily newspapers: The Arizona Republic, 
which along with its online entity, azcentral.com, serves the greater metropolitan 
area; and the East Valley Tribune, which primarily serves the cities of 
the East Valley.[273][274] The Jewish News of Greater Phoenix is an independent 
weekly newspaper established in 1948. In addition, the city is also served 
by numerous free neighborhood papers and weeklies such as the Phoenix New 
Times, and Arizona State University's The State Press.[275] The Phoenix 
metro area is served by many local television stations and is the largest 
designated market area (DMA) in the Southwest, and the 12th largest in 
the U.S., with over 1.8 million homes (1.6% of the total U.S.).[276] The 
major network television affiliates are KNXV 15 (ABC), KPHO 5 (CBS), KPNX 
12 (NBC), KSAZ 10 (Fox), KASW 61 (The CW), KUTP 45 (MyNetworkTV), and KAET 
8 (PBS, operated by Arizona State University). Other network television 
affiliates operating in the area include KPAZ 21 (TBN), KTVW-DT 33 (Univision), 
KFPH-DT (UniMás), KTAZ 39 (Telemundo), KDPH 48 (Daystar), and KPPX-TV 51 
(ION). KTVK 3 (3TV) and KAZT 7 (AZ-TV) are independent television stations 
operating in the metro area. KSAZ-TV, KUTP, KPAZ-TV, KTVW-DT, KFPH-DT, 
KTAZ, KDPH-LP, and KPPX-TV are network owned-and-operated stations. Many 
major feature films and television programs have been filmed in the city. 
From the opening sequences in Psycho,[277] to the night attack by the aliens 
in 1953's The War of the Worlds,[278] to freeway scenes in Little Miss 
Sunshine,[277] Phoenix has been the location for numerous major feature 
films. Other notable pictures filmed at least partially in Phoenix include 
Raising Arizona, A Home at the End of the World,[278] Bill & Ted's Excellent 
Adventure, Days of Thunder, The Gauntlet, The Grifters, Waiting to Exhale 
and Bus Stop.[279] The radio airwaves in Phoenix cater to a wide variety 
of musical and talk radio interests. Stations include classic rock formats 
of KOOL-FM and KSLX-FM, to pop stations like KYOT-FM and alternative stations 
like KDKB-FM, to the talk radio of KFYI-AM, the Christian programming of 
KZZP-FM and KALV-FM, and the country sounds of KMLE-FM. With its large 
Hispanic population there are numerous Spanish stations, such as KNAI-FM, 
KHOT-FM, and KOMR-FM.[280] Phoenix is served by Phoenix Sky Harbor International 
Airport (IATA: PHX, ICAO: KPHX), one of the ten busiest airports in the 
United States, serving over 110,000 people on over 1000 flights per day.[281] 
The airport is centrally located in the metro area near several major freeway 
interchanges east of downtown Phoenix. The airport serves more than 100 
cities with non-stop flights.[282] Aeroméxico, Air Canada, British Airways, 
and WestJet are among several international carriers as well as American 
carrier American Airlines (which maintains a hub at the airport) providing 
flights to destinations such as Canada, Costa Rica, Mexico, and London.[283] 
The Phoenix-Mesa Gateway Airport (IATA: AZA, ICAO: KIWA) in neighboring 
Mesa also serves the area's commercial air traffic. It was converted from 
Williams Air Force Base, which closed in 1993. The airport has recently 
received substantial commercial service with Allegiant Air opening a hub 
operation at the airport with non-stop service to over a dozen destinations.[284] 
Smaller airports that primarily handle private and corporate jets include 
Phoenix Deer Valley Airport, located in the Deer Valley district of north 
Phoenix, and Scottsdale Airport, located just east of the Phoenix/Scottsdale 
border. There are also other municipal airports including Glendale Municipal 
Airport, Falcon Field Airport in Mesa, and Phoenix Goodyear Airport. Amtrak 
served Phoenix Union Station until 1996 when the Union Pacific Railroad 
(UP) threatened to abandon the route between Yuma, Arizona and Phoenix.[285] 
Amtrak rerouted trains to Maricopa, 30 miles south of downtown Phoenix, 
where passengers can board the Texas Eagle (Los Angeles-San Antonio-Chicago) 
and Sunset Limited (Los Angeles-New Orleans).[286][287] Though UP ultimately 
retained the trackage, Amtrak did not return, although the station remains. 
Amtrak Thruway buses connect Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport to 
Flagstaff, Arizona for connection with the Los Angeles-Chicago Southwest 
Chief.[288] Phoenix is also served by Greyhound bus service, which stops 
at 24th Street near the airport.[289] Valley Metro provides public transportation 
throughout the metropolitan area, with its trains, buses, and a ride-share 
program. 3.38% of workers commute by public transit. Valley Metro's 20-mile 
(32 km) light rail project, called Valley Metro Rail, through north-central 
Phoenix, downtown, and eastward through Tempe and Mesa, opened December 
27, 2008. Future rail segments of more than 30 miles (48 km) are planned 
to open by 2030.[290] Phoenix auto traffic depends on both surface streets 
and freeways. Freeways fall under the auspices of the Arizona Department 
of Transportation (ADOT). Phoenix ranks first in the nation in the quality 
of its urban freeways, and the state as a whole ranks first in the nation 
in the quality of bridges.[291] While being the sixth most populous city 
in the nation, Phoenix's freeways do not suffer from the same type of congestion 
seen in other large cities. In fact, in a recent study, there is not a 
single stretch of freeway in Phoenix ranked in the 100 worst freeways for 
either congestion or unreliability.[292] Part of the reason for this is 
the extensive freeway system in the city, due to the majority of that system 
being funded by local, rather than federal funds, through a ½ cent general 
sales tax measure approved by voters in 1985.[293] Another offshoot of 
this local funding is that Phoenix is the largest city in the United States 
to have two Interstate Highways and no 3-digit interstates.[294] As of 
2005[update], the metropolitan area of Phoenix contains one of the nation's 
largest and fastest growing freeway systems, consisting of over 1,405 lane 
miles.[295] The freeway system is a mix of Interstate, U.S., and State 
highways which include Interstate 10, Interstate 17, US 60, Loop 101, Loop 
202, SR 51, SR 143, and SR 30. There are still major additions to routes 
101, 202 and 303 underway, as well as several other smaller projects around 
the valley.[296] State Routes 30, 87, 85, and 74 connect Phoenix with other 
areas of the Valley and Arizona.[297] The street system in Phoenix (and 
some of its suburbs) is laid out in a grid system, with most roads oriented 
either north-south or east-west, and the zero point of the grid being the 
intersection of Central Avenue and Washington Street.[297] The original 
plan was for the east-west streets to be named after presidents, with the 
north-south streets named after Indians, however the north-south streets 
were quickly changed to numbers, with avenues running to the west of Central, 
and streets to its east.[15] Major arterial streets are spaced one mile 
(1.6 km) apart, divided into smaller blocks approximately every ⅛ of a 
mile. For example, Scottsdale Road, being the 7200 block, lies 9 miles 
to the east of Central Avenue (72 / 8).[297] Freeways and state highways 
in Phoenix:[297] The Maricopa Association of Governments has a bicycle 
advisory committee working to improve conditions for bicycling on city 
streets and off-road paths.[298] Bicycling Magazine ranked Phoenix the 
15th most bicycle friendly city of fifty cities in the United States with 
a population greater than 100,000.[299] Being located in the desert, Phoenix 
relies on a water supply delivered to the city via a system of canals which 
divert water from the region's rivers and lakes, with the largest portion 
of the city's water coming from the Colorado River through the Central 
Arizona Project's canal.[300] The city's electrical needs are served primarily 
by Arizona Public Service, although some customers receive their electricity 
from the Salt River Project (SRP). The main sources of electrical generation 
are nuclear, and coal power plants. Arizona is home to the Palo Verde Nuclear 
Power Station, the largest nuclear-generating facility in the United States. 
SRP is also the largest water provider in Phoenix.[301] In 2011 (the last 
year for which information is available), Phoenix had a slightly younger 
population than the country as a whole. While the United States had 13.3% 
of its population over the age of 65, Phoenix's percentage stood significantly 
lower, at 8.1%. Phoenix's percentage of 18.8% in the next age group, 45–64 
was also a great deal lower than the national average of 26.6%. This results 
in 73% of Phoenix's population being 44 or younger, as compared to the 
national percentage of 60.[302] In 2010 (the last year for nationally reported 
figures), Phoenix was at or below national levels for most reportable diseases, 
with the exception of both hepatitis A and B, where they were slightly 
over the national average (0.8 and 1.8 to 0.5 and 1.1%, respectively).[303] 
In most major categories, Phoenix had a lower incidence of death than the 
rest of the nation. Only deaths due to Alzheimer's (29.7 to 27.2 deaths 
per 100,000) and pre-natal conditions (5.3 to 3.8 deaths per 100,000) were 
slightly above the national average. Deaths due to HIV and liver disease 
were exactly at the national average of 2.5 and 10.8 respectively. However, 
in several major categories, Phoenix had significantly lower indices of 
death: deaths by cancer stood at only 57% (106) of the national average 
of 184.6 deaths per 100,000; deaths due to heart disease, 56.1% of the 
national rate of 249.8 per 100,000.[304] Cancer and heart disease were 
the two top causes of death in the country.[305] Low-weight births (7.5%) 
were below the national average of 8.1%, yet infant mortality (7.2%) was 
higher than the rest of the U.S. (6.1%). Births to teen mothers were significantly 
higher than the rest of the country, sitting at 12.2% as compared to 8.4% 
nationally.[302] The Phoenix metropolitan area is serviced by 56 hospitals 
and medical centers.[306] The Mayo Clinic, a not-for-profit medical practice 
and medical research group based in Rochester, Minnesota. Phoenix is one 
of two other locations with Mayo Clinics (the other being Jacksonville, 
Florida).[307] It is the first and largest integrated not-for-profit medical 
group practice in the world; Mayo Clinic has been near or at the top of 
the U.S. News & World Report List of "Best Hospitals" for more than 20 
years.[308] St. Joseph's Hospital and Medical Center is part of Dignity 
Health (formerly Catholic Healthcare West), one of the largest healthcare 
systems in the western United States. St. Joseph's is a not-for-profit 
hospital with special advocacy for the poor and underserved. John C. Lincoln 
North Mountain Hospital is a general medical and surgical hospital, which 
performed nearly at the level of nationally ranked U.S. News Best Hospitals 
in 4 adult specialties.[309] Phoenix Children's Hospital in Phoenix, AZ 
is nationally ranked in 5 pediatric specialties according to U.S. News 
& World Report. It is a 425-bed children's teaching hospital.[310] Arizona 
Heart Institute, opened in 1971, is known internationally as one of the 
first freestanding outpatient clinics dedicated exclusively to cardiovascular 
health.[311] Banner Health is a non-profit health system in the United 
States, based in Phoenix. It operates 23 hospitals as well as specialized 
facilities. The health system is the 2nd largest employer in Arizona, behind 
Walmart, employing more than 35,000.[312] Banner Health was created in 
1999 through a merger of Lutheran Health Systems, based in North Dakota, 
and Samaritan Health System, based in Phoenix. Of the top 10 rated hospitals 
in the city (top 12 in the state), 4 are Banner hospitals.[313] Barrow 
Neurological Institute (BNI) at St. Joseph's Hospital and Medical Center 
is the world's largest dedicated neurosurgical center and a leader in neurosurgical 
training, research, and patient care.[314] More operative neurosurgical 
procedures take place at BNI than at any other institution in the United 
States.[314] With the creation of the Phoenix Sister Cities (PSC) organization 
in 1972, Phoenix became a member of the international Sister City movement. 
It would take the organization several years to become official, not filing 
for Articles of Incorporation until 1975, and not entering into their first 
Sister City agreement until 1976, with Hermosillo, Mexico.[315] The organization's 
mission statement states their purpose is to "create people-to-people relationships 
between the residents of Phoenix and its sister cities through commercial, 
educational, cultural and artistic exchange programs and events that create 
and sustain global, long-term, international partnerships and business 
opportunities for the citizens of Phoenix."[316] Currently, Phoenix has 
ten sister cities, as designated by the Phoenix Sister Cities Commission 
and Sister Cities International, shown in the table below.[317] Phoenix 
and Prague have shared a Capital Cities relationship since May 1991, which 
was expanded to Sister City Status in 2013.[318] Nation: States: Territories:
