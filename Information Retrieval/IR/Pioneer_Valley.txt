The Pioneer Valley is the colloquial name for the portion of the Connecticut 
River Valley that is in Massachusetts in United States. The Pioneer Valley 
includes part of three counties. The lower Pioneer Valley corresponds to 
the Springfield, Massachusetts metropolitan area, the region's urban center, 
and the seat of Hampden County. The upper Pioneer Valley region includes 
the smaller cities of Northampton and Greenfield, the county seats of Hampshire 
and Franklin counties. Many of the cities and towns include areas of forests, 
and Springfield itself, which in the early 1900s was nicknamed "The City 
in a Forest," features nature within its city limits and over 12% parkland.[1] 
The Pioneer Valley is known[by whom?] for its scenery and as a vacation 
destination. The Holyoke Range, Mount Tom Range, and numerous rolling hills, 
bluffs, and meadows feature extravagant homes from the Gilded Age, many 
of which surround New England's longest and largest river, the Connecticut 
River, which flows through the region.[2][3][4] The Pioneer Valley is a 
popular, year-round tourist destination—a role that it has played historically, 
prior to its deindustrialization (from approximately 1970-2000).[3][4] 
Travelers are drawn to the Pioneer Valley by its lively college towns, 
such as Northampton and Amherst; the resurgent city of Springfield; its 
unspoiled nature, numerous parks, and recreational facilities, including 
New England's largest and most popular amusement park, Six Flags New England 
in Agawam; its cultural and historical sites, such as the Emily Dickinson 
House in Amherst, the Springfield Armory National Historical Site, and 
the Basketball Hall of Fame on Springfield's riverfront. The region features 
alpine skiing at resorts such as Berkshire East and Blandford Ski Resort 
and seasonal festivals that draw millions of visitors, such as The Big 
E—all six New England states' collective, annual state fair in West Springfield—and 
Bright Nights at Springfield's Forest Park—an elaborate, high-tech lighting 
display during the holiday season. The Pioneer Valley includes approximately 
half of the southern Connecticut River Valley—an ancient rift valley created 
by the breakup of the supercontinent Pangea along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge 
during the Triassic and Jurassic periods of the Mesozoic Era. The Connecticut 
River has been flowing through the valley for millions of years and was 
naturally dammed to form glacial lake Hitchcock during the last ice age. 
According to King's Handbook of Springfield, by Moses King, the Pioneer 
Valley "is not an ordinary river channel; it is, in fact, a trough between 
two systems of mountains. To the west lie the worn-down remnants of the 
once lofty Berkshire Mountains; on the east, the yet more degraded ridges 
which constitute what we may call the Eastern Massachusetts set of mountain 
ridges... These rocks now form many sharp hills and mountains in the Valley, 
lending it much of its picturesque beauty... During the Triassic time, 
Massachusetts's portion of the Connecticut River Valley formed a shallow 
arm of the sea," leaving deposits that enriched the Pioneer Valley's inordinately 
fertile soil.[3][4] Geologically interesting parts of the Valley are the 
basalt flows and dinosaur tracks in South Hadley and Holyoke, Massachusetts, 
a chain of basaltic traprock ridges known as Metacomet Ridge along the 
ancient tectonic rift including the Mount Holyoke and Mount Tom ranges, 
layers of rock deposit laid down by the river, and varves and deltas deposited 
by Lake Hitchcock during the Pleistocene. The region known as the Pioneer 
Valley constitutes Massachusetts's portion of the fertile Connecticut River 
Valley and the picturesque hill and mountain towns to its east and west. 
The following three counties—from north to south, and each with a different 
character—encompass the Pioneer Valley: Franklin County is the most rural 
county in Massachusetts and thus reminiscent of southern Vermont, which 
it borders. Greenfield is its largest municipality, a small city frequently 
used as a gateway to the region's many outdoor pursuits. The county offers 
downhill skiing at resorts such as Berkshire East, white-water rafting, 
zip-lining, hiking, kayaking, and other outdoor pursuits. In addition, 
Franklin County contains many rustic, former mill towns. Many of these 
have become quaint and scenic since the decline of the mills, (e.g., Turners 
Falls.) Massachusetts's Routes 2 and 2A, which run through Franklin County, 
feature many antique stores.[5] Hampshire County is the home to five prominent 
universities that cooperate with each other and are known collectively 
as the Five Colleges. They are UMass Amherst, Amherst, Mount Holyoke, Smith, 
and Hampshire. Each of these highly regarded liberal arts colleges and 
universities contribute to Hampshire County's college town atmosphere, 
particularly in the significant college towns of Northampton and Amherst. 
Much of Hampshire County's cultural activity, frequently flamboyant nightlife, 
and musical venues are concentrated in these two small but lively cities 
that are separated by a mere 7 miles. While the college towns in Hampshire 
County are known for their liberal political values and their embrace of 
alternative cultures and lifestyles, many of the county's outlying towns 
preserve their traditional, bucolic characters. In terms of political demographics, 
Hampshire County is one of the most liberal areas in the United States 
in both voter registration and election returns. Hampden County is the 
most highly urbanized county in Western Massachusetts; however, its environs 
have long been described as rus in urbe—cities amidst forests.[6] Springfield, 
Massachusetts—the "shire town" for which Hampden County was initially carved 
out of Hampshire County in 1814—is located in southern Hampden County, 
at a natural crossroads where three significant rivers flow into Connecticut 
River, (the Westfield, the Chicopee, and the Mill.) Springfield's history 
is long, illustrious, and well-chronicled. It was one of the United States's 
most important precision manufacturing and defense centers until its relatively 
recent deindustrialization, which was catalyzed by the government's controversial 
closure of the Springfield Armory during the Vietnam War. (In 1777, General 
George Washington and Henry Knox personally selected that site for the 
United States's Federal Arsenal.)[7] After nearly 30 years of decline, 
Springfield has since about 2006 experienced a cultural and economic resurgence, 
catalyzed by billions of dollars in private and public investment, including 
the funded construction of the United States's first high-speed bullet-train, 
known as the Knowledge Corridor intercity rail line as well as a sharp 
decreases in crime and new festivals that have renewed the city's traditionally 
robust civic pride. Springfield itself features international tourist attractions 
like the Basketball Hall of Fame and the Springfield Armory National Historic 
Site; it also features the Dr. Seuss Memorial, Augustus Saint Gaudens's 
outdoor masterpiece, "The Puritan," and five world-class art, science, 
and history museums at the Quadrangle. Forest Park, a city park of 745 
acres (3,010,000 m2) designed following the principles of Frederick Law 
Olmsted, who is most famous for designing New York City's Central Park, 
is comparably diverse and ornate. The city's economic base is diverse, 
featuring Massachusetts's wealthiest Fortune 100 company, MassMutual Insurance, 
as well as numerous universities and hospitals. Springfield features thousands 
of Victorian era Painted Lady mansions (like San Francisco's,) e.g., in 
the McKnight Historic District. In addition to the Connecticut River, Springfield 
features Watershops Pond, Porter Lake, and the Mill River. Less than two 
miles south of Springfield, Six Flags New England amusement park is located 
in suburban Agawam; and one mile west of Springfield, The Big E—the collective 
state fairgrounds of all six New England States—is located in West Springfield. 
North of Springfield, the U.S. Westover Air Force Base is located in the 
resurgent, former industrial city of Chicopee. The City of Chicopee features 
the confluence of the fast-moving Chicopee River and the meandering Connecticut 
River. The Chicopee River, although only 18.0 miles long, has the largest 
water basin in Massachusetts—and along the Connecticut River—at 741 square 
miles. Across from Chicopee, on the west side of the Connecticut River, 
the Holyoke Mall at Ingleside is one of the largest malls in New England. 
In addition to the mall, Holyoke is home to the Mount Tom Range of mountains, 
the Holyoke Canal System, and the Volleyball Hall of Fame. (The sport of 
Volleyball was invented in Holyoke in 1895.) The city of Westfield features 
Westfield State University, founded by renowned education reformer Horace 
Mann. Near to Westfield—approximately 15 miles west of Springfield—numerous 
outdoor opportunities are available, such as alpine skiing at Blandford 
Ski Area and the United States's oldest white-water rafting races on the 
78.1 mile Westfield River, the longest Connecticut River tributary in Massachusetts.[8] 
The international airport that serves Hampden County, and the Pioneer Valley 
in general, is Bradley International Airport, which is located 12 miles 
south of Springfield in the town of Windsor Locks, Connecticut, land that 
formerly belonged to Springfield. Currently, the Pioneer Valley's ethnic 
and racial diversity varies greatly from city to town. Predominantly British 
until the 19th Century, and then European-American in the late 19th and 
20th centuries, as of the 2010 Census, the region features a rapidly growing 
Hispanic population in nearly all urban areas. This influx includes large 
numbers of Puerto Ricans. Among the European-American community, the Pioneer 
Valley's population reflects the British Isles background of its original 
settlers and the immigrant populations that settled it during the late-19th 
century, including large numbers of residents with Irish, Italian, Polish, 
Portuguese, French Canadian, and Greek backgrounds. As of 2011, Springfield 
is home to a particularly large number of Vietnamese immigrants. Also, 
as of 2011, Russian and Ukrainian immigrants are increasing in Springfield, 
West Springfield, Westfield, and other communities. According to the 2010 
Census, the Pioneer Valley features one of the highest per capita lesbian, 
gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) populations in the United States. 
Indeed, according to the U.S. Census Bureau's 2010 Census statistics, Springfield 
was ranked one of the Top 10 gay cities in the United States. The 2010 
Census figures indicate the number of same-sex households per thousand. 
Springfield ranked #10, with 5.69 same-sex couples per thousand. (Boston 
ranked #4 with 6.9 same-sex couples per thousand; and San Francisco ranked 
#1, with 12.4 same-sex couples per thousand – nearly double all other U.S. 
cities.)[9] In January 2010, the national LGBT magazine The Advocate rated 
Springfield #13 among its new "15 Gayest Secondary Cities in America," 
ahead of San Diego, California and Albuquerque, New Mexico.[10] Springfield 
was the only Massachusetts city included on The Advocate's list. The cities 
of Northampton and Springfield, in particular, feature vibrant LGBT communities. 
Unlike in other communities across the United States, LGBT residents have 
largely integrated into Northampton and Springfield, i.e. neither city 
features a gay ghetto. Generally, in the Pioneer Valley, LGBT people and 
straight people co-mingle in various bars, nightclubs, and cultural institutions. 
Still, both cities feature a robust and active LGBT nightlife - especially 
Northampton for lesbians, and Springfield for gay men.[11][12] The college 
towns of Amherst and South Hadley also feature significant LGBT populations. 
Native American history in the Pioneer Valley stretches back thousands 
of years; its recorded history begins in 1635, when Roxbury magistrate 
William Pynchon commissioned land scouts John Cable and John Woodcock to 
look for the Connecticut River Valley's best site for both conducting trade 
and farming.[citation needed] The first 16 years of the history of the 
European settlement of the Pioneer Valley, before 1652, when Northampton, 
Massachusetts was established, are coterminous with the history of Springfield, 
Massachusetts, as it was Pioneer Valley's only settlement. From 1633-1635, 
there had been three English settlements in the Connecticut River Valley: 
Wethersfield, Connecticut; Windsor, Connecticut; and the best situated 
of the three (because of its two rivers:) Hartford, Connecticut. Cable 
and Woodcock continued northward until they came upon a spot that they 
agreed was the best situated of them all: modern-day Springfield, Massachusetts.[citation 
needed] Springfield sits at a natural crossroads, at the confluence of 
four rivers: to the west, the 78.1 mile Westfield River, (the Connecticut 
River's longest tributary river in Massachusetts;) in the middle, the 418.0 
mile Connecticut River, then known as "The Great River;" and to the east 
two smaller rivers: the 18.0 mile Chicopee River, which featured the fast 
moving and the Connecticut River's largest water basin; and also, the Mill 
River, which would become very important approximately 150 years later 
after George Washington's foundation of the U.S. Armory at Springfield. 
At that time, on the western bank of the Connecticut River, the explorers 
found the Pocomtuc (or perhaps Nipmuck) Indian village of Agawam. Just 
south of the Westfield River, the colonists constructed a pre-fabricated 
house in what is present-day Agawam, Massachusetts.[14] In 1636, Pynchon 
led a settlement expedition with a larger group, including Henry Smith 
(Pynchon's son-in-law), Jehu Burr, William Blake, Matthew Mitchell, Edmund 
Wood, Thomas Ufford, and John Cable.[15] Springfield was Massachusetts' 
first settlement for non-religious reasons, although many of its settlers 
were very religious, as indicated by their first article of incorporation, 
"Wee intend by God's grace, as soon as we can, with all convenient speede 
to procure some Godly and faithfull minister we purpose to joyne in church 
covenant, to walk in all the ways of Christ"[3] In scouting Springfield, 
Cable, Woodcock, and Pynchon selected a spot just north of Enfield Falls, 
the first spot on the Connecticut River where all travelers must stop to 
negotiate a waterfall, 32 feet (9.8 m) in height, and then transship their 
cargoes from ocean-going vessels to smaller shallops. Pynchon's party purchased 
land on both sides of Connecticut River from 18 tribesman who lived at 
a palisade fort at the current site of Springfield's Longhill Street. The 
price paid was 18 hoes, 18 fathoms of wampum, 18 coats, 18 hatchets and 
18 knives.[16][17] Originally, in 1636, the English settlement was named 
Agawam Plantation. By founding "Agawam" in its particular location, Pynchon 
essentially forced all northerly river trade to move through his town. 
After warnings from the Natives about the Connecticut River's west side 
being prone to flooding,[18] most Springfield settlers moved to the east 
side of the river, which was slightly less advantageous for farming because 
of its prominent bluffs and hills. The initial land grants to English families 
were made there in what is today Springfield's Metro Center, along what 
is today Main Street.[19] Long, narrow plots of farmland were created, 
extending outward from the river. In addition, more distant forested "wood 
lots" were offered. The original, main profit-generating industry for Springfield 
was trade with the Indians for beaver skins, which were then exported around 
the colonial world.[20] In 1640 and 1641, two events took place that forever 
changed the political boundaries of the Connecticut River Valley. From 
its founding until that time, Springfield had been administered by Connecticut, 
along with Connecticut's three other settlements - at Wethersfield, Hartford, 
and Windsor. In the spring of 1640, grain was very scarce; cattle were 
dying of starvation. The nearby Connecticut Colony settlements gave power 
to William Pynchon to buy corn for all four English settlements, (Springfield's 
natives were, by far, the most congenial to the English.) If the Natives 
would not sell their corn at market prices, then Pynchon was authorized 
to offer more money. The Natives refused to sell their corn at market prices, 
and then later refused to sell it at "reasonable" prices. Pynchon refused 
to buy it, believing it best not to broadcast the English colonists' weaknesses, 
and also wanting to keep market values steady.[21] Leading citizens of 
(what would become) Hartford were furious with Pynchon for not purchasing 
any grain. With Windsor's and Wethersfield's consent, the three southerly 
settlements commissioned the famed Native American-conqueror Captain John 
Mason to travel to Springfield with "money in one hand and a sword in the 
other."[22] On reaching (what would become) Springfield, Mason intimidated 
the local Natives with war if they did not sell their corn at a "reasonable 
price." The Natives capitulated and ultimately sold the colonists corn. 
Pynchon, an avowed "man of peace," believed in negotiation with the Natives 
(and thus, quickly made a fortune), whereas Mason – a hero of the Pequot 
Wars and conqueror of Connecticut – believed in subduing Natives by force 
if necessary. This philosophical difference led to Mason using "hard words" 
against Pynchon. Pynchon's settlement, however, agreed with him, and his 
philosophy, and that same year, voted to separate from the Connecticut 
Colony and be annexed by the Massachusetts Bay Colony. When the dust finally 
settled, William Pynchon was named magistrate of Agawam by the Massachusetts 
Bay Colony and, in honor of him, the settlement was renamed Springfield 
after the village of Springfield near Chelmsford, Essex in England, where 
Pynchon was born and raised.[21] For decades, Springfield - which, at the 
time, included modern-day Westfield - was the westernmost settlement in 
Massachusetts. In 1645, 46 years before the Salem witch trials, Springfield 
experienced America's first accusations of witchcraft when Mary Parsons 
accused a widow named Marshfield, who had moved from Windsor to Springfield, 
with witchcraft - an offense then punishable by death.[19] For this, Mary 
Parsons was found guilty of slander. In 1651, Mary Parsons was accused 
of witchcraft - specifically "divers devilish practices by witchcraft, 
to the hurt of Martha and Rebeckah Moxon," two daughters of Springfield's 
first minister - and also of murdering her own child.[19] In turn, Mary 
Parsons then accused her own husband, Hugh Parsons, of witchcraft. At America's 
first witch trial, both Mary and Hugh Parsons were found not guilty of 
witchcraft for want of satisfactory evidence; however, Mary was found guilty 
of murdering her own child. For this, she was sentenced to death, but died 
in prison in 1651, before receiving her death sentence.[16] In 1650, William 
Pynchon became infamous for writing the New World's first banned book.[19] 
In 1649, Pynchon found time to write a book, The Meritous Price of Our 
Redemption, a theological study that was published in London in 1650. Several 
copies made it back to the Massachusetts Bay Colony and its capital, Boston, 
which, this time reacted with rage to Pynchon rather than with support. 
For his critical attitude toward Massachusetts' Calvinist Puritanism, Pynchon 
was accused of heresy, and his book was burned on the Boston Common. Only 
4 copies survived.[23] By declaration of the Massachusetts General Court, 
in 1650, The Meritous Price of Our Redemption became the first-ever banned 
book in the New World.[24] In 1651, Pynchon was accused of heresy by the 
Massachusetts General Court (at the same meeting of the Court where Springfielder 
Mary Parsons was sentenced to death in America's first witch trial).[23] 
Thus he is the first author to have his work "banned in Boston". Standing 
to lose all of his land-holdings – the largest in the Connecticut River 
Valley – William Pynchon transferred ownership to his son, John, and then, 
in 1652, moved back to England with his friend, the Reverend Moxon.[23][25] 
William's son, John Pynchon, and his brother-in-law, Elizur Holyoke, quickly 
took on the settlement's leadership roles. They began moving Springfield 
away from the diminishing fur trade into agricultural pursuits, and also 
founded several new towns, including Northampton, Massachusetts. The area 
now called Northampton was once known as Norwottuck, or Nonotuck, meaning 
"the midst of the river"[26] by its original Pocumtuc inhabitants. According 
to various accounts, Northampton was named by John King (1629–1703), one 
of its original settlers, or possibly in his honor, since it is supposed 
that he came to Massachusetts from Northampton, England (Allen 9, Dwight 
10, Leach 124). The Pocumtuc confederacy occupied the Connecticut River 
Valley, from what is now southern Vermont and New Hampshire into northern 
Connecticut. The Pocumtuc tribes were Algonquian, and traditionally allied 
with the Mahican confederacy to the west. By 1606, an ongoing struggle 
between the Mahican and Iroquois confederacies led to direct attacks on 
the Pocumtuc by the Iroquoian Mohawk nation.[27] The Mahican confederacy 
had been defeated by 1628, limiting Pocumtuc access to trade routes to 
the west. The area suffered a major smallpox epidemic in the 1630s, following 
the arrival of Dutch traders in the Hudson Valley and English settlers 
in the Massachusetts Bay Colony during the previous two decades. It was 
in this context that the land making up the bulk of modern Northampton 
was sold to settlers from Springfield, Massachusetts in 1653, and settled 
the following year.[28][29] The situation in the region further deteriorated 
when the Mohawk escalated hostilities against the Pocumtuc confederacy 
and other Algonquian tribes after 1655, forcing many of the plague-devastated 
Algonquian groups into defensive mergers.[27] This coincided with a souring 
of relations between the Wampanoag and the Massachusetts Bay colonists, 
eventually leading to the expanded Algonquian alliance which took part 
in King Philip's War. Northampton's territory would be enlarged beyond 
the original settlement, but later portions would be carved up into separate 
cities, towns, and municipalities. Southampton, for example, was incorporated 
in 1775, and included parts of the territories of modern Montgomery (which 
was itself incorporated in 1780) and Easthampton.[30] Westhampton was incorporated 
in 1778, and Easthampton in 1809.[31] Formerly, a section of Northampton 
called Smith's Ferry was separated from the rest of the town by the boundaries 
of Easthampton. The shortest path to downtown was on a road near the Connecticut 
River oxbow, which was subject to frequent flooding. Smith's Ferry was 
ceded to Holyoke, Massachusetts in 1909.[32] Deerfield was the northwesternmost 
outpost of New England settlement for several decades during the late seventeenth 
and early eighteenth centuries. It occupies a fertile portion of the Connecticut 
River Valley and was vulnerable to attack because of its position near 
the Berkshire Mountains. For these reasons it became the site of several 
Anglo-French and Indian skirmishes during its early history, as well as 
intertribal warfare.[33] At the time of the English colonists' arrival, 
the Deerfield area was inhabited by the Algonquian-speaking Pocumtuck nation, 
with a major village by the same name. First settled by English colonists 
in 1673, Deerfield was incorporated in 1677. Settlement was the result 
of a court case in which the government in Boston agreed to return some 
of the land of the town of Dedham to Native American control, and allowed 
some of Dedham's residents to acquire land in the new township of Pocumtuck. 
To obtain this land, their agent John Plympton signed a treaty with some 
Pocumtuck men, including one named Chaulk. He had no authority to deed 
the land to the colonists, and appeared to have only a rough idea of what 
he was signing. Native Americans and English had quite differing ideas 
about property and land use, which contributed to their conflicts, along 
with competition for resources. The settlers expelled the Pocumtuck tribe 
by force, who in turn sought French protection from colonists in Canada. 
At the Battle of Bloody Brook on September 18, 1675, the dispossessed Indians 
destroyed a small force under the command of Captain Thomas Lathrop before 
being driven off by reinforcements. Colonial casualties numbered about 
sixty. In retaliation, at dawn on May 19, 1676, Captain William Turner 
led an army of settlers in a surprise attack on Peskeompskut, in present-day 
Montague, then a traditional native gathering place. They killed 200 natives, 
mostly women and children. When the men of the tribe returned, they routed 
Turner, who died of a mortal wound at Green River. On February 29, 1704, 
during Queen Anne's War, joint French and Indian forces attacked the town 
in what has become known as the 1704 Raid on Deerfield. Under the command 
of Jean-Baptiste Hertel de Rouville were 47 Canadiens and 200 Abenaki, 
Kanienkehaka and Wyandot, as well as a few Pocumtuck. They struck at dawn, 
razing Deerfield and killing 56 colonists, including 22 men, 9 women, and 
25 children. They took as captives 109 survivors, including women and children, 
and "carried" them away on a months-long trek to Quebec. Many died along 
the way or were killed when they could not keep up. Deerfield and other 
communities collected funds to ransom the captives, and negotiations were 
conducted between colonial governments. When New England released the French 
pirate, Canada arranged redemption of numerous Deerfield people, among 
them the minister John Williams. He wrote a captivity narrative about his 
experience, which was published in 1707 and became well known. Because 
of losses to war and disease, the Mohawk and other tribes often adopted 
younger captives into their tribes. Such was the case with Williams' daughter 
Eunice, eight years old when captured. She became thoroughly assimilated, 
at age 16 marrying a Mohawk man. Most of the Deerfield captives eventually 
returned to New England. During this period, other captives remained by 
choice in French and Native communities such as Kahnawake for the rest 
of their lives. As the frontier moved north, Deerfield became another colonial 
town with an unquiet early history. In 1753 Greenfield was set off and 
incorporated. During the early nineteenth century, Deerfield's role in 
agricultural production of the Northeast declined. It was overtaken by 
the rapid development of the Midwestern United States into the nation's 
breadbasket, with transportation to eastern markets and New York City enhanced 
by construction of the Erie Canal. During the Colonial Revival movement 
of the late nineteenth century, Deerfield citizens rediscovered the town's 
past. Residents founded the Pocumtuck Valley Memorial Association in 1870, 
and erected monuments to commemorate various events, including the Bloody 
Brook and 1704 attacks. In 1890, Charlotte Alice Baker returned to Deerfield 
to restore her family home, the Frary House.[34] Assisted by the Boston 
architectural firm of Shepley, Rutan & Coolidge, her project was one of 
the first in historic preservation in western Massachusetts. Today, tourism 
is the town's principal industry. Historic Deerfield, a National Historic 
Landmark district with eleven house museums and a regional museum and visitors' 
center, and the Yankee Candle Company are major attractions. An account 
of the town's early history was written by local historian George Sheldon 
and published in the late nineteenth century.[35] By this time, South Deerfield 
and other New England villages were already absorbing a new wave of Eastern 
European immigration, particularly from Poland. The new people influenced 
Deerfield's demographics and culture. They were mostly Catholic peasants, 
who built their own churches and first worked as laborers, forming a community 
later known as Old Polonia. Later twentieth-century immigrants from Poland 
tended to be more educated, but settled in the larger cities. Immigrants 
in smaller communities followed different paths, and their descendants 
often moved to cities for more opportunities.[36] Pocumtuck Indians first 
settled and originally inhabited the Greenfield area. Native American artifacts 
found in the area have been dated as originating between 7,000 and 9,000 
years BC.[37] The Pocumtucks planted field crops and fished the rivers, 
but were wiped out as a tribe by the Mohawks in 1664.[38] Thereafter, the 
newly unoccupied area - being the eastern terminus of the Mohawk Trail, 
a principal route for Native American trade traveling west into New York 
- was colonized by the English in 1686 as part of Deerfield. In 1753, Greenfield 
was set off from Deerfield and incorporated as a separate town, named for 
the Green River. In 1795, the South Hadley Canal opened, allowing boats 
to bypass the South Hadley falls and reach Greenfield via the Connecticut 
River. Located at the confluence of the Deerfield and Green rivers, and 
not far from where they merge into the Connecticut River, Greenfield developed 
into a trade center. It was designated county seat when Franklin County 
was created from Hampshire County in 1811. Falls provided water power for 
industry, and Greenfield grew into a prosperous mill town. The Pioneer 
Valley is sometimes known to its collegiate inhabitants as "Happy Valley", 
but more typically full-time residents refer to it simply as "the Valley". 
Residents benefit from a rich cultural array of fine arts, performances, 
notable architecture and sidewalks of strolling scientists and literary 
VIPs - mostly in the college towns and in Springfield. According to the 
2010 Census, per capita, Northampton has the highest concentration of lesbians 
in the United States, and perhaps the world.[39] Hampshire County is certainly 
the "Valley full o' Pioneer... in the sleepy west of the woody east", of 
which the Pixies sang in the song "U-Mass". Springfield's cultural contributions 
to the United States and world at large have been so numerous that here, 
only brief descriptions of very important national and international cultural 
milestones will be mentioned. As of 2011, Springfield's most famous cultural 
contribution worldwide is basketball, currently the world's 2nd most popular 
sport. That said, the "City of Progress" produced three other innovations, 
not nearly as well publicized, but which have proven to have proven to 
be just as significant, if not more so, to the world at large. In 1892-93, 
the first, functional, American gasoline-powered car was produced at the 
Stacy Building in Springfield by the Duryea Brothers. The Duryea's car 
also won the world's first automobile race in 1895 in Chicago. In 1901, 
the first motorcycle company in the world was "Indian", produced in Springfield; 
in 1905, the first modern fire engines in the world were produced by Knox 
Automobile, (which made Springfield's fire department the first modern 
fire department in the world;) and lastly, the first commercial radio station 
in the U.S. was broadcast from Springfield's luxurious Hotel Kimball in 
1921.[40] Of national importance, Springfield featured the United States' 
first witch trial in 1646 - decades before the Salem Witch Trials; and 
a few years later in 1650, a Springfielder wrote the New World's first 
banned book, The Meritous Price of Our Redemption by William Pynchon. Pynchon 
was the founder of the city of Springfield. His book, expressing views 
contrary to Puritan Calvinist doctrine, caused him to be brought before 
the high court in Boston and accused of heresy. He later to return to England.[40] 
In Springfield, in 1860, Milton Bradley invented and produced his popular 
parlor games, including the still popular The Game of Life. Also in Springfield, 
Dr. Seuss grew up, and wrote several of the works for which he is now best 
known, (e.g. And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street.)[40] Psychiatrist 
and LSD activist Timothy Leary - the man who influenced a generations to 
"turn on, tune in, drop out" - was born and educated in Springfield. Earlier, 
from 1846–1850, John Brown, the famed abolitionist, lived in Springfield, 
where he met, for the first time the national leaders of the abolition 
movement like Frederick Douglass and Sojourner Truth. In Springfield, in 
response to the Fugitive Slave Act, John Brown founded his first militant 
anti-slavery organization, The League of Gileadites. Brown's years in Springfield 
have often been called his "transformative years."[41] To the extent that 
military history adds to a place's culture, Springfield's history is notably 
rich, beginning with the 1675 Attack on Springfield during King Philip's 
War. Later, events such as George Washington's and Henry Knox's founding 
of the Springfield Armory atop a bluff in the town made Springfield one 
of the U.S. military's most important sites for centuries. Shays's Rebellion, 
which led directly to the U.S. Constitution, occurred at the Armory ten 
years after Washington's founding of it - and also forced him to come out 
of retirement.[40] As regards literary works, the world's first American-English 
dictionary was published in Springfield in 1806, and is still published 
in the city by Merriam Webster. Also, the first comprehensive, major United 
States history book was written by Springfielder George Bancroft in 1830.[40] 
To the extent that cultural contributions comprise invention, innovation, 
and progress, Springfield has been, historically, one of the nation's most 
innovative cities. In 1819, inventor Thomas Blanchard invented the lathe 
in Springfield, which would catalyze manufacturing developments now known 
the world over as interchangeable parts and the assembly line. In 1825, 
Blanchard also built the first American car, a "horseless carriage," which 
was powered by steam. In 1844, inventor Charles Goodyear perfected and 
patented his process for making vulcanized rubber in Springfield - as of 
2011, as it has been for many years previous, Goodyear's name is known 
the world over for rubber production.[40] Other major cultural contributions 
from Springfield include the first U.S. postcard in 1873; the first American, 
national horse show in 1853; the first American dog show - and even the 
first American friction match in 1834.[40] Valley residents also have a 
love of arts, both visual and performing, as demonstrated by numerous art 
galleries, countless theaters and performances, the residencies of children's 
authors Dr. Seuss, Eric Carle in the valley, and the Eric Carle Museum 
of Picture Book Art in Amherst.[40] Springfield's Quadrangle features an 
extraordinary grouping of five museums, including two art museums, two 
history museums, and one science museum. Springfield's Science Museum features 
the United States' first planetarium.[40] Interspersed among the five museums 
is the sculptural Dr. Seuss Memorial garden, which recreates the Springfield 
author's whimsical characters in bronze. In Springfield, Springfield Symphony 
Hall serves as the major focal point for classical music, Broadway tours, 
concerts and stand-up comedy shows in the Valley. Symphony Hall was built 
in 1911-13, and its ornamentation is a spectacle in itself. The major playhouse 
in Springfield is CityStage, which features an eclectic mix of entertainment. 
Both venues are managed by Springfield Performing Arts Development Corporation. 
While this charming pocket of the state, known as the Pioneer Valley, may 
be wild turkey country, as well as the approach to Vermont ski country, 
it's also used-book country. Our three-day visit was dedicated to browsing 
and buying amid the valley's rich and collegial network of bookshops and 
private dealers. More members of the Massachusetts and Rhode Island Antiquarian 
Booksellers (36) are to be found in this area than in bookish Greater Boston 
(25). With an independent bookstore in almost every town, several small 
publishers, and countless local authors, the Valley could well be counted 
as a reader's paradise. Amherst has at least four bookstores (including 
Amherst Books and Food for Thought Bookstore), South Hadley has at least 
one notable bookstore (The Odyssey Bookshop). Since the late 1980s, Montague 
has had The Bookmill, and the World Eye Bookshop is in its 40th year in 
Greenfield. John Doe, Jr. used books and records opened in Greenfield the 
summer of 2009. Federal Street Books is another used bookstore in Greenfield. 
Northampton has least four independent bookstores (including Broadside 
Bookshop). One of the more popular, Raven Used Books, features a wide variety 
of titles and subjects. South Deerfield has New England Auctions, specializing 
in rare and antiquarian books. The Pioneer Valley is home to a multitude 
of professional, amateur, and collegiate sports teams, as well as a rich 
athletic history. The Springfield Falcons and Springfield Armor are the 
region's two professional sports teams, competing in the American Hockey 
League and NBA D-League, respectively. Historically, the city has had professional 
hockey dating back to the 1930s with the seven-time Calder Cup champion 
Springfield Indians as well as several minor-league baseball teams. On 
the collegiate level, the only school in the region to be a full member 
of the NCAA's Division I is the University of Massachusetts, although the 
ice hockey team at American International College competes in the Atlantic 
Hockey Association, a hockey-only DI conference. There are a multitude 
of well-known Division III schools as well, including Amherst College. 
The most notable amateur team in the region is the Holyoke Blue Sox, members 
of the New England Collegiate Baseball League. The region has had many 
notable professional athletes see significant portions of their careers 
in the region. Eddie Shore played for and later became the owner of the 
very successful Springfield Indians franchise; his number 2 remains retired 
by the Falcons. Julius Erving, one of the top basketball players of all 
time, played at UMass Amherst. Wrestler John Cena graduated from Springfield 
College prior to joining the WWE. The most notable athlete to be born in 
the region is hockey player Bill Guerin, a Stanley Cup champion and Olympic 
Silver Medalist, who is from Wilbraham. The region features a lot of independent 
professional wrestling shows, most notably Pioneer Valley Pro Wrestling, 
the former New Age Old Tyme Wrestling and The Way Wrestling Was Promotions. 
Aside from monthly shows, PVP Wrestling also runs charity shows for different 
benefits. The region is also credited as being the home of both basketball 
(invented at Springfield College) and volleyball (invented in Holyoke), 
as created in the late 1890s; the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of 
Fame and the Volleyball Hall of Fame are located in those cities. The Pioneer 
Valley has a broad and varied economic base, featuring more than 16 universities 
and liberal arts colleges, (many of which are considered among the United 
States' best, e.g. Amherst College); numerous hospitals and healthcare 
organizations, (e.g. Baystate Health, Massachusetts' third largest employer) 
and numerous financial service organizations, (e.g. the Fortune 100 MassMutual.) 
Manufacturing remains a part of the Pioneer Valley's economy (e.g. Smith 
& Wesson), although its manufacturing base has dwindled since 1968, when 
the Springfield Armory was controversially shut-down. The Pioneer Valley 
is considered to have a "mature economy", which means that its economic 
base is sufficiently varied so as not to be completely dependent on market 
fluctuations, like many places in the United States. This was illustrated 
during the Great Recession, when Springfield, Massachusetts and the Pioneer 
Valley performed within the Top 10 of all U.S. regional economies.[42] 
Of all Franklin County in the north serves as a significant agricultural 
region despite its size, due to the rich topsoil found in the area. The 
valley's sweet corn and asparagus are cash crops. Cow Corn, potatoes, and 
shade-grown tobacco are also major crops. Fields of all sort, particularly 
corn and tobacco fields, as well as numerous farmhouses and tobacco barns 
dot the landscape. Light industry is concentrated in the town of South 
Deerfield and the city of Greenfield, while service industries exist throughout 
the county. Increasingly Franklin County is becoming a place of bedroom 
communities, with the major transportation routes of Interstate 91, Route 
2, and U.S. Route 5 facilitating a boom in residential building that has 
not kept pace with commercial development in many of the county's towns. 
The Hallmark Institute of Photography is located in Turners Falls. Two 
major corporations, Channing Bete and Yankee Candle, are headquartered 
in South Deerfield and Greenfield. Both communities have been had controversial 
zoning issues surrounding permitting variances to build big box stores 
such as Wal-Mart. Greenfield received national attention when its decision 
prevented Wal-Mart from building a store in town. The county also garners 
tourism due to such attractions as Historic Deerfield (which hosts a craft 
fair in the summer and an even larger and more popular fall craft fair), 
and a Butterfly Garden located in South Deerfield. The annual arrival of 
thousands of American and foreign tourists to observe the area's spectacular 
autumn foliage is a welcome boost to revenue. With the Five Colleges, Hampshire 
County has a significant part of its economy devoted to serving university 
and liberal arts college students, including numerous independent bookstores 
and stationery shops. Hampshire County is also one of the most politically 
liberal counties in the United States, due in large part to Northampton, 
Amherst, and a large LGBT community centered on the Five College area. 
The area is also home to many restaurants, ranging in character from sports 
bars to steakhouses. Northampton (also known to some as "Hamp" and others 
as "Noho") is - along with Springfield - the culinary capital of Western 
Massachusetts as well as a lesbian mecca, featuring the highest number 
of lesbians per capita according to the United States' 2000 Census. Hampden 
County is centered on the region's major economic and cultural center, 
Springfield, Massachusetts. Springfield is a major transportation hub, 
lying equidistant to the Ports of Boston and Albany, New York, and also 
near to New York City and Montreal. Many of the projects that have catalyzed 
Springfield's recent economic resurgence have been related to transportation, 
e.g. the $1 billion-plus Knowledge Corridor intercity rail line and the 
Springfield-Northampton-Brattleboro intercity commuter line. Springfield 
is also a medical, government, and higher education center. Baystate Health's 
$300 million "Hospital of the Future" is scheduled for completion in 2012. 
Massachusetts $110 million high-tech data center - an adaptive re-use of 
the city's original Technical High School - will also be completed in 2012. 
Regarding higher education: in 2011, Western New England University and 
Springfield College each added $45 million-plus additions to their respective 
campuses in Springfield. Remnants of a manufacturing economy remain in 
Springfield despite a dramatic de-industrialization in last quarter of 
the 20th century; for example, in 2011, Smith & Wesson relocated 225 new 
jobs to its Springfield headquarters, bringing its total manufacturing 
workforce in Springfield to over 1150. Chicopee's growth continues to be 
catalyzed by the growth of Westover Air Force Base, especially around Memorial 
Avenue. As of 2011, Holyoke continues to see rapid growth in its high-tech 
sector, featuring new enterprises that capitalize on Holyoke's abundance 
of green energy, e..g. water power from the Holyoke Canal System, the nearby 
Falls, and a proposed wind farm. All three formerly industrialized cities 
- Springfield, Chicopee, and Holyoke - continue to face typical urban problems, 
such as gang activity and the drug trade in increasingly isolated parts 
of each city; however, these activities have lessened significantly during 
the pst 20 yeats and a spirit of revitalization now pervades each city. 
Westfield's formerly moribund town center is in the midst of receiving 
a dramatic makeover, replete with 60 foot clock tower - scheduled to be 
completed in 2012. Nearly all other towns and villages in Hampden County 
are either wealthy suburbs (e.g. Longmeadow, Massachusetts, Wilbraham, 
Massachusetts), or rural exurbs, (e.g. Palmer, Massachusetts and Brimfield, 
Massachusetts.) Hampden County also features numerous natural retreats 
like the Mount Tom Range and Mount Holyoke Range. In this Hampden County, 
tourism is very popular. Six Flags New England features the #1 roller-coaster 
in the world (The "Bizarro") and draws tourists from all over. Similarly, 
the Basketball Hall of Fame, a shrine to the world's 2nd most popular sport, 
invented in Springfield, draws hundreds of thousands of visitors per year. 
Other major tourist attractions include Western Massachusetts' only national 
park, the Springfield Armory National Historic Site. The Quadrangle in 
Springfield features five museums of varying themes, including the United 
States' first planetarium, gathered around the whimsical Dr. Seuss National 
Memorial Sculpture Garden. Forest Park (Springfield) designed by Frederick 
Law Olmsted (of NYC's Central Park fame) is one of the largest urban parks 
in the United States at 735 acres (2,970,000 m2). During the holiday season 
it features a nationally renowned light display called "Bright Nights. 
The New England States' collective state fair, The Big E, is held each 
September–October and generally draws millions of visitors. Springfield's 
"Parade of Big Balloons" takes place on November 1 each year, borrowing 
many of the balloons from Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade and attracting 
100,000 spectators. Each July, the Hoops City Jazz Festival draws tens 
of thousands to Metro Center to hear famous jazz musicians. In 2011, the 
Vintage Sports Car Club of America moved its famous, annual Grand Prix 
from Pittsburgh to Springfield—the Springfield Grand Prix will take place 
in 2012, on a 1.6 mile track through the center of the city. Outlying Hampden 
County towns such as Tolland are sparsely populated and close to the Berkshires 
- outdoor activities such as camping make up a large part of their economy. 
Politically, Hampden County leans liberal; however, it features several 
notably conservative cities and towns, such as Holyoke, Westfield, Agawam, 
Monson, and Palmer. Hampden County's largest city, Springfield, while historically 
moderate, politically, has become nearly as liberal as Hampshire County 
in recent years, according to voter registration and election results. 
Appreciation of the natural environs has, historically, been a large part 
of the Pioneer Valley life. It features numerous non-profit nature sanctuaries, 
such as Friends of Wissatinnewag, Inc]. 43 acres (170,000 m2) a sacred 
Native American burial grounds where the Turners Falls massacre occurred 
in 1676, as well as historic parks like King Phillip's Stockade in Springfield, 
the 735 acres (2,970,000 m2) Forest Park, designed by Frederick Law Olmsted, 
and Western Massachusetts' only national park, the Springfield Armory National 
Historic Site. In addition to these, there are hundreds of state and municipal 
parks and forests. Due to the considerable natural and cultural resources 
in the Pioneer Valley, environmental agencies have made a substantial investments 
in protecting unspoiled nature in the region, particularly along the Connecticut 
River, and in many of the Pioneer Valley's rural "hilltowns." Government 
conservation efforts have targeted wildlife and rare plant habitats, recreational 
sites and corridors including the Metacomet-Monadnock Trail, and the rich 
agricultural soils in farming towns such as Hadley, Massachusetts. Efforts 
have been augmented and assisted by local and regional conservation land 
trusts and statewide and national conservation organizations. Many of these 
organizations protect additional land through direct ownership of conservation 
areas and land held under conservation easement. Many municipalities in 
the area also have conservation holdings, usually under the aegis of the 
community's 'conservation commission', the appointed body which also applies 
local and state environmental regulations. One notable area consists of 
Mount Tom State Reservation, Mount Holyoke Range State Park, and Skinner 
State Park, which, joined with the 600-acre (2.4 km2) Arcadia Wildlife 
Sanctuary held by the Massachusetts Audubon Society, form a long wildlife 
corridor stretching across the Connecticut River. Recently, there has been 
a notable grassroots effort to reclaim Springfield's once easily accessible 
and pedestrian-friendly waterfront, which is now separated from the city 
by 8-lane, elevated highway known as Interstate 91. In 2010, the Urban 
Land Institute presented a plan that suggested how Springfield could reunite 
with its greatest natural resource, the Connecticut River.[43][44] Coordinates:
