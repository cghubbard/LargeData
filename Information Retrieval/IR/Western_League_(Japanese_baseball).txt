The Western League (ウエスタン・リーグ?) is one of the two minor leagues ("ni-gun")[1] 
of Japanese professional baseball. The league is owned and managed by the 
Pacific League of Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB). Teams in the Western 
League generally play an 80-game schedule every year. The league was created 
in 1952 as the Kansai Farm League,[1] and was initially completely separate 
from the workings of the Nippon Professional Baseball. It featured the 
minor league teams of the six professional teams that had their homefields 
in the western region of Japan, as well one independent team not affiliated 
with an NPB franchise. The initial complement of teams:[1] The Sanyo Crowns 
were dissolved after the 1952 season. The Shochiku Robins merged with the 
Taiyo Whales in 1953, but the Kintetsu Pearls' farm team joined the league 
that year, keeping the number of teams at six.[1] In 1954 the six teams 
of Nippon Professional Baseball's Central League decided to form their 
own minor league, called the New Japan League.[1] With the Chunichi Dragons 
and Hanshin Tigers affiliates dropping out to join the new minor league, 
only four teams remained in the Kansai Farm League.[1] Both minor league 
decided to join forces with NPB in 1955, and the 14 farm teams of the Central 
League and Pacific League were split up to create the Western League and 
Eastern League, each with seven teams.[1] 1955 Western League lineup (minor 
league homefield shown in parentheses): The Lions moved their franchise 
to Saitama in 1979 to join the Eastern League, leaving six teams, and in 
2005 the Orix BlueWave and Osaka Kintetsu Buffaloes merged to become the 
Orix Buffaloes, leaving five teams in the Western League. Most of the Japanese 
minor league teams carry the same name, and use the same uniforms, as their 
parent team. The Western League contains the minor league affiliates of 
five Japanese professional teams (minor league homefield shown in parentheses):
