Frederick Charles Brayton (October 20, 1925 – March 28, 2015), usually 
known as Chuck Brayton or Bobo Brayton, was an American college baseball 
head coach; he led the Washington State Cougars for 33 seasons, from 1962 
to 1994.[1] He is the winningest coach in school history, with a record 
of 1,162 wins, 523 losses and eight ties—the fourth-best total in NCAA 
history at the time he retired.[2] His Cougar teams won 21 conference titles 
(two Northern Division and 19 Pac-8/10), including 11 in a row from 1970 
to 1980. He led the Cougars to the College World Series in 1965 and 1976, 
and was the fifth baseball head coach in NCAA history to exceed a thousand 
wins.[3] Win number 1,000 came in 1990 in his 29th season, at home on April 
11,[4][5] and he coached four more years.[6] Brayton was a three-sport 
varsity athlete at Washington State and played shortstop in 1944 for interim 
coach Jack Friel and from 1946 to 1948 for Buck Bailey;[1] he was named 
the school's first baseball All-American in 1947.[7] As an incoming freshman 
in September 1943, Brayton hitchhiked across the state to Pullman from 
Skagit County in northwestern Washington.[8][9] After his freshman year, 
he served in the Army Air Forces.[1][10] His #14 jersey was retired by 
the school in 2003,[11][12][13][14] and he was inducted into the National 
College Baseball Hall of Fame in 2007.[2][15] Bailey–Brayton Field, the 
Cougars' home stadium since 1980, is named for Brayton and his predecessor, 
Buck Bailey (1896–1964).[16] When the old field was displaced by the new 
Mooberry track, Brayton constructed the new stadium on a budget, using 
items salvaged from Sick's Stadium in Seattle, as well as donated materials 
and volunteer labor.[8][9] Formerly "Buck Bailey Field," Brayton's name 
joined his mentor's in January 2000.[17] Prior to coaching at WSU, Brayton 
was the head coach for over a decade at Yakima Valley Junior College,[18][19] 
and also its head football coach for five seasons.[20][21] He had a record 
of 251–68 (.787) in 11 seasons at Yakima and won ten championships.[9] 
A line drive nearly killed him and he was hospitalized for a month; he 
wore a helmet the rest of his coaching career.[1][22] In declining health 
in his later years, Brayton died at age 89 at his Pullman home on March 
28, 2015.[23][24][25]       National champion         Postseason invitational
