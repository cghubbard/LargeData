The UC San Diego Tritons are the athletic sports teams for the University 
of California, San Diego. UC San Diego has 23 varsity sports teams and 
offers student participation in a wide range of sports including swimming, 
water polo, soccer, volleyball, crew, track and field, fencing, basketball, 
golf, cross country, softball, baseball, and tennis. UC San Diego participates 
at the NCAA's Division I (DI) level in the California Collegiate Athletic 
Association (CCAA), although water polo, fencing, and men's volleyball 
compete at the Division I level. Since their move to Division II starting 
in the 2000–01 season, UCSD has placed in the top 5 in the Division II 
NACDA Directors' Cup standings five times, including two 2nd-place finishes. 
NCSA Athletic Recruiting has ranked the Tritons as the nation's top Division 
II program for eight consecutive years.[2] In May 2016, UCSD students voted 
to transition all sports teams to the NCAA Division I level. UC San Diego 
recognizes two external organizations of athletic boosters: the Triton 
Athletic Associates is a booster group of parents, alumni and friends who 
have each donated between US$50 and $2,500; and the UCSD Athletic Board 
is made up of donors who have given US$10,000 or more to athletic programs.[3] 
On campus, booster groups comprise the UCSD Pep Band, Tritons Rising, the 
Triton Tide (a student booster club), the UCSD Cheerleaders, the Triton 
Twirl Flag Squad and the UCSD Dance Team. King Triton occasionally appears 
as a costumed character mascot. Further opportunities for athletic involvement 
are available to students interested in team staffing and management.[4][5] 
In 2011, UCSD considered elevating its athletics to NCAA Division I for 
all sports. They were looking to join the Big West Conference. However, 
there were several problems. After the Big West added the University of 
Hawaii in 2010, they would have 10 teams, meaning any extra member would 
require more conference games in basketball, upsetting the current schedule 
balance. In addition, in order to meet the minimum Division I scholarship 
requirements, the student body would need to vote for a fee increase sometime 
during the 2011–2012 academic year. After the Big West elected not to invite 
UCSD in May 2011, plans were put on hold and UCSD remained a Division II 
team.[6] However, a student-led movement resulted in a vote on a fee increase 
for UCSD students in the hopes to enhance the school's chances of becoming 
a Division I school.[7] In March 2012, the UCSD student body rejected an 
increase in activity fees to support the move to Division I. The vote fell 
11,407 to 6,470 (51% of the student body voted). In January 2016, Associated 
Students UC San Diego unanimously approved the wording of a new Division 
I referendum.[8] In May, UCSD undergraduates voted to increase athletic 
fees by $480 per year and transition UCSD athletics to Division I.[9] The 
fee increase will fund the athletic scholarships required for NCAA Division 
I schools.[10] UCSD's move remains contingent upon an invitation to join 
the Big West Conference.[11] In a separate move by the Big West Conference 
to sponsor Men's Volleyball, Big West teams from the MPSF will split to 
join their own conferences that will include UC San Diego as an affiliate 
member starting in the 2017–18 school year (2018 season). The Tritons joining 
the Big West as an affiliate for Men's Volleyball was not an indicator 
that the Tritons will be accepted as a full member yet since UC San Diego 
had long played the sport in the MPSF at a Division I level and was part 
of the original coalition talks with the Big West to split from the MPSF. 
UC San Diego athletes have won a total of 138 individual NCAA championships 
at the Division I, II and III levels. Individual Division II champions 
are listed below: From 2000–2016, UC San Diego teams competed primarily 
in the California Collegiate Athletic Association. The school was awarded 
the Hiegert Commissioner's Trophy (awarded to the CCAA school with the 
highest aggregate ranking in eight sports) six times—five consecutive years 
from 2006–2010 and again in 2016.[14] The UC San Diego baseball team plays 
its home games at Triton Ballpark, which was renovated in 2014. In 2005, 
the Tritons were the CCAA league champions. In 2007 and 2008, they reached 
to the NCAA West Regionals. In 2009, after winning the CCAA league and 
CCAA tournament, they advanced to the NCAA Division II College World Series 
under the leadership of Dan O'Brien and infielder Vance Albitz, where they 
placed fourth. In 2010, they were the College World Series runners-up and 
the CCAA league and tournament champions. In 2011 and 2012, they repeated 
as CCAA league and tournament champions, again reaching the NCAA West Regionals. 
Their most recent CCAA championship came in 2014.[16] The UC San Diego 
men's basketball team plays its home games at RIMAC Arena. At the end of 
the 2007–08 season, they won the CCAA Tournament and advanced to the first 
round of the NCAA West Regionals. In 2015–16, they were NCAA West runners-up. 
The UC San Diego women's basketball team plays its home games at RIMAC 
Arena. It has won the CCAA four times, during the 2006–07, 2008–09, 2009–10, 
and 2012–13 seasons. The Tritons advanced to the NCAA West Regional 1st 
Round in 2003–04, 2005–06, and 2009–10, and reached the 2nd Round in 2007–08

In 2006–07, they reached the NCAA Final Four. The UC San Diego men's and 
women's fencing squads compete at Main Gym and RIMAC Arena.[20] They compete 
in the Intercollegiate Fencing Conference of Southern California at the 
NCAA Division I level. The Tritons won this league's championship every 
year between 2005 and 2016.[21] The UC San Diego men's soccer team hosts 
its opponents at the Triton Soccer Stadium at RIMAC Field. In 2003, 2013, 
and 2014, it advanced to the first round of the NCAA West Regional. In 
2013, they were the CCAA tournament runners-up.[22] The UC San Diego women's 
soccer team plays its home matches at the Triton Soccer Stadium at RIMAC 
Field. In its first two seasons of Division II play, 2000 and 2001, the 
team was crowned CCAA Champions and NCAA National Champions. The Tritons 
again won the CCAA in 2002, 2003, 2005, 2006, 2008, 2011, 2012, and 2015, 
reaching the NCAA Final Four in 2003 and being named NCAA Runners-Up in 
2010 and 2012. They reached the NCAA West Regional 2nd Round in 2005, 2008, 
and 2009, but were eliminated in the first round in 2002, 2007, 2011, and 
2015. Since its promotion to Division II in 2000, the team has failed to 
reach the NCAA playoffs only three times, in 2004, 2013, and 2014. The 
UC San Diego softball team plays its home games at Triton Softball Stadium, 
adjacent to RIMAC Arena.[24] The Tritons advanced to the NCAA West Regionals

CCAA. In 2012, they won the CCAA tournament and repeated as NCAA West Region 
Champions, and were eventually crowned the NCAA National Runners-Up. They 
won their second CCAA tournament in 2016. The UC San Diego men's tennis 
team competes in the Intercollegiate Tennis Association and plays its home 
games at the Northview Tennis Courts. The team advanced to the NCAA Division 
II National Championships each year between 2001 and 2007, and returned 
there in 2010, 2011, 2013, and 2014. The team's best finish at the NCAA 
tournament came in 2013, when it was eliminated in the quarterfinal round. 
The UC San Diego women's tennis team competes in the Intercollegiate Tennis

They were the NCAA National Runners-Up in 2000.[26] UC San Diego has not 
fielded a football team except in Fall 1968 when a newly formed pigskin 
organization turned in a winless season and then folded for lack of interest.[27] 
Since then, the subject of bringing NCAA football back to UC San Diego 
has been a recurring topic. Tom Ham, a local restaurateur and a supporter 
of UCSD football since the 1960s, has said that UCSD would have no future 
in San Diego without "big-time" football.[28] Proponents of a major football 
team have projected benefits that include greater school spirit and a more 
well-rounded school experience for students as well as enhancing the school's 
national profile.[29] Opposition to "big-time" football comes from a wide 
range of school faculty and administrators such Daniel Wulbert, Revelle 
College provost, who says that any boost to school spirit wouldn't be worth 
the sacrifice, and that he wants UC San Diego to "have a life for reasons 
other than watching hired athletes come and play."[30] Both sides acknowledge 
that adding an 80- to 100-man[31] football team would not only cost some 
US$1–1.5M annually, but that the initial outlay in equipment and facilities 
would be in the tens of millions.[32] Furthermore, in order to comply with 
Title IX's requirement for equal sports opportunities for both sexes, some 
three women's teams (80–100 athletes) would have to be added, or three 
existing men's teams disbanded.[32] Without the expense of football, UC 
San Diego has been characterized as having "the best all-around program,
