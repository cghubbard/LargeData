State Championship. He also led his football team as the quarterback to 
a state championship, winning the Tri-Valley League and a Superbowl in 
1985. Sweeney was signed to play quarterback for the University of Maine 
in Orono. There, he decided to play baseball full-time. He went on to become 
a Golden Spikes Finalist, playing outfield, and breaking many of the school's 
offensive records. As a senior in 1991, he hit .384 with 23 home runs, 
80 RBI and 22 stolen bases in 65 games; his strong season earned him the 
America East Player of the Year award. Sweeney was drafted by the California 
Angels in the 9th round of the 1991 Major League Baseball Draft. He made 
his professional debut in 1991 with the Boise Hawks in Single-A, batting

the Angels to the St. Louis Cardinals for John Habyan. After playing in 
22 games for the Triple-A Louisville Redbirds his contract was purchased 
by the Cardinals on August 4. Sweeney made his major league debut on August 
4, 1995, as the starting first baseman for the St. Louis Cardinals against 
the Chicago Cubs. He was hitless in four at-bats on his debut. He collected 
his first major league hit the next day against Cubs starter Jim Bullinger. 
He hit his first home run on August 10 against the Los Angeles Dodgers'

the San Diego Padres, along with Danny Jackson and Rich Batchelor, for 
Fernando Valenzuela, Phil Plantier and Scott Livingstone. He went 2 for

New York Yankees, making the last out of the Series by grounding out to 
third base. After the season, he was traded by the Padres, along with Greg 
Vaughn, to the Cincinnati Reds for Josh Harris, Reggie Sanders, and Damian 
Jackson. Sweeney spent one season with the Reds organization, much of which 
was spent with the Triple-A Indianapolis Indians. The Reds traded him on 
January 14, 2000, to the Milwaukee Brewers, along with Gene Altman, for 
Alex Ochoa. He spent the next two seasons with the Brewers shuttling between 
the Majors and Triple-A while battling through an assortment of injuries 
and trips to the disabled list. In 2002, he was traded by the Brewers with 
Lou Collier, Jeromy Burnitz, Jeff D'Amico, and cash to the New York Mets 
for Glendon Rusch, Lenny Harris, and Alex Ochoa. He failed to make the

and designated hitter. In 1,218 career games, he is a lifetime .254 hitter, 
with 42 home runs, 250 runs batted in, and 16 stolen bases. According to 
the New York Daily News in a story that broke in January 2007, Barry Bonds 
blamed a positive amphetamine test result during the 2006 season on a substance 
he took from Sweeney's locker. Sweeney's agent denied the claim that Bonds 
had gotten such a substance from Sweeney.[2] Bonds would later clear Sweeney 
of any involvement in his positive amphetamine test.[3] On July 27, 2007, 
against the Florida Marlins, he moved into a tie for 2nd place (150 hits) 
on the all-time pinch hits list with Manny Mota with a pinch hit single. 
On July 29, 2007, he moved into sole possession of 2nd place behind Lenny 
Harris on the all-time pinch hits list with a game-tying, pinch hit double 
to deep right field in the 9th inning that scored Dave Roberts. On August 
9, 2007, Sweeney was traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers for second baseman 
Travis Denker. The trade was the first between the Giants and the Dodgers 
since 1985.[4] He remained with the Dodgers, primarily as a pinch hitter 
through the 2008 season. In May 2008, Sweeney surrendered his jersey number,
