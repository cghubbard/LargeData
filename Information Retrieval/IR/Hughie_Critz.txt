Hugh Melville Critz (September 17, 1900 â€“ January 10, 1980) was an American 
second baseman in Major League Baseball for the Cincinnati Reds in the 
1920s and the New York Giants in the 1930s. Critz was born in Starkville, 
Mississippi, and attended college in his home town at Mississippi State 
University, where his father, Professor Colonel Critz, was a respected 
instructor. In his first major league game, he had two hits off Hall-of-Fame 
pitcher Grover Cleveland Alexander, and went on to hit .322 in 102 games, 
with 19 stolen bases, as a rookie. Through the 1920s, he was an extremely 
solid, speedy, good-hitting second baseman for many decent Reds teams although 
the team began to decline in the late 1920s, finishing seventh in the eight-team 
National League in 1929 and 1930. In the Reds' best year with Critz on 
the team, 1926, they finished second in the league two games behind the 
champion St. Louis Cardinals. Alongside the Reds' success that year, he 
also had what could easily be considered[by whom?] his best season, batting 
.270, with 3 homers and 79 RBIs. He tied his career high for triples with 
14 and had his next-best career high in RBIs with 79. He finished second 
in MVP voting, behind only Bob O'Farrell. Although his speed numbers only 
decreased from his rookie season, when he stole 19 bases, he still averaged 
11 stolen bases per season for his career. In 1930, his career took a sudden 
turn when he was traded to the Giants for pitcher Larry Benton. With them, 
he won a World Series in 1933, had more quality years and retired on September 
27, 1935. In a 12-season career, he batted .268 with 38 home runs and 531 
RBIs in 1478 games. He had 97 career stolen bases, 832 runs scored, 195 
doubles and 95 triples, accumulating 1591 hits in 5930 at bats. He made 
the Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame in 1962, and died in Greenwood, Mississippi
