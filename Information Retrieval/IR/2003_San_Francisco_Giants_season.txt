The 2003 San Francisco Giants season was the Giants' 121st year in Major 
League Baseball, their 46th year in San Francisco since their move from 
New York following the 1957 season, and their fourth at Pacific Bell Park. 
The Giants finished in first place in the National League West with a record 
of 100 wins and 61 losses. They lost the National League Division Series 
in four games to the Florida Marlins. The Giants only played 161 games. 
One game (at New York Mets) was postponed due to the Northeast Blackout 
of 2003 and was not rescheduled as it had no playoff implications. Infielders
