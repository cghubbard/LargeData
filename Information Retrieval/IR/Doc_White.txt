Guy Harris "Doc" White (April 9, 1879 – February 19, 1969) was an American 
left-handed pitcher in Major League Baseball. He played for two teams, 
the Philadelphia Phillies and the Chicago White Sox, during his career 
which lasted from 1901 to 1913. Born in Washington, D.C., "Doc" White was 
a graduate of the Georgetown University School of Dentistry.[1] He started 
his professional baseball career in 1901 with the Phillies. In 1903, he 
jumped to the White Sox of the new American League. From 1903 to 1906, 
White won at least 16 games each year; his earned run average was in the 
league's top four each year, as well. He led the league in ERA in 1906 
with a 1.52 mark and went 18–6. That year, the White Sox won the pennant 
and their first World Series. In Game 5, White recorded the first save 
in Series history. The following season, White set a career-high in wins 
with 27. He pitched effectively for Chicago until 1912, had an off-year 
in 1913, and then went to the Pacific Coast League from 1914 to 1915.[2] 
White also gained some recognition as a composer, publishing at least four 
songs (such as bestseller "Little Puff of Smoke, Good Night" in 1910) with 
his co-writer Ring Lardner, who was a sportswriter in Chicago during that 
period.[1] White died at age 89 in Silver Spring, Maryland, just eight 
months after witnessing Don Drysdale surpass his record of 45 consecutive
