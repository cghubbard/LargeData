-60.652557 Trinidad and Tobago (i/ˈtrɪnᵻˌdæd ən təˈbeɪɡoʊ/, /-toʊˈ-/),[8] 
officially the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago, is a twin island country 
situated off the northern edge of the South American mainland, lying just 
11 kilometres (6.8 miles) off the coast of northeastern Venezuela and 130 
kilometres (81 miles) south of Grenada. Bordering the Caribbean to the 
north, it shares maritime boundaries with other nations including Barbados 
to the northeast, Grenada to the northwest, Guyana to the southeast, and 
Venezuela to the south and west.[9][10] The island of Trinidad was a Spanish 
colony from the arrival of Christopher Columbus in 1498 to the capitulation 
of the Spanish Governor, Don José María Chacón, on the arrival of a British 
fleet of 18 warships on 18 February 1797.[11] During the same period, the 
island of Tobago changed hands among Spanish, British, French, Dutch and 
Courlander colonizers, more times than any other island in the Caribbean. 
Trinidad and Tobago (remaining separate until 1889) were ceded to Britain 
in 1802 under the Treaty of Amiens.[12] The country Trinidad and Tobago 
obtained independence in 1962, becoming a republic in 1976. Trinidad and 
Tobago is the third richest country by GDP (PPP) per capita in the Americas 
after the United States and Canada. Furthermore, it is recognised as a 
high-income economy by the World Bank. Unlike most of the English-speaking 
Caribbean, the country's economy is primarily industrial,[13] with an emphasis 
on petroleum and petrochemicals. The country's wealth is attributed to 
its large reserves and exploitation of oil and natural gas.[14][15] Trinidad 
and Tobago is known for its Carnival and is the birthplace of steelpan, 
limbo, and the music styles of calypso, soca, parang, chutney, chutney 
soca, chut-kai-pang, cariso, extempo, kaiso, parang soca, pichakaree, and 
rapso. Historian E. L. Joseph claimed that Trinidad's Amerindian name was 
Iere or "Land of the Humming Bird", derived from the Arawak name for hummingbird, 
ierèttê or yerettê. However, Boomert claims that neither cairi nor caeri 
means hummingbird and tukusi or tucuchi does.[clarification needed][16] 
Others have reported that kairi and iere simply mean island.[citation needed] 
Christopher Columbus renamed it "La Isla de la Trinidad" ("The Island of 
the Trinity"), fulfilling a vow made before setting out on his third voyage 
of exploration.[17] Tobago's cigar-like shape may have given it its Spanish 
name (cabaco, tavaco, tobacco) and possibly its Amerindian names of Aloubaéra 
(black conch) and Urupaina (big snail),[16] although the English pronunciation 
is /təˈbeɪɡoʊ/, rhyming with lumbago, sago, and "may go".[citation needed] 
Trinidad and Tobago are islands situated between 10° 2' and 11° 12' N latitude 
and 60° 30' and 61° 56' W longitude. At the closest point, Trinidad is 
just 11 kilometres (6.8 mi) from Venezuelan territory. Covering an area 
of 5,128 km2 (1,980 sq mi),[18] the country consists of the two main islands, 
Trinidad and Tobago, and numerous smaller landforms, including Chacachacare, 
Monos, Huevos, Gaspar Grande (or Gasparee), Little Tobago, and St. Giles 
Island. Trinidad is 4,768 km2 (1,841 sq mi) in area (comprising 93.0% of 
the country's total area) with an average length of 80 km (50 mi) and an 
average width of 59 kilometres (37 mi). Tobago has an area of about 300 km2 
(120 sq mi), or 5.8% of the country's area, is 41 km (25 mi) long and 12 km 
(7.5 mi) at its greatest width. Trinidad and Tobago lie on the continental 
shelf of South America, and are thus geologically considered to lie entirely 
in South America.[19] The terrain of the islands is a mixture of mountains 
and plains. The highest point in the country is found on the Northern Range 
at El Cerro del Aripo, which is 940 metres (3,080 ft) above sea level. 
As the majority of the population live in the island of Trinidad, this 
is the location of most major towns and cities. There are four major municipalities 
in Trinidad: Port of Spain, the capital, San Fernando, Arima and Chaguanas. 
The main town in Tobago is Scarborough. Trinidad is made up of a variety 
of soil types, the majority being fine sands and heavy clays. The alluvial 
valleys of the Northern Range and the soils of the East-West Corridor are 
the most fertile.[citation needed] The Northern Range consists mainly of 
Upper Jurassic and Cretaceous metamorphic rocks. The Northern Lowlands 
(East-West Corridor and Caroni Plains) consist of younger shallow marine 
clastic sediments. South of this, the Central Range fold and thrust belt 
consists of Cretaceous and Eocene sedimentary rocks, with Miocene formations 
along the southern and eastern flanks. The Naparima Plains and the Nariva 
Swamp form the southern shoulder of this uplift. The Southern Lowlands 
consist of Miocene and Pliocene sands, clays, and gravels. These overlie 
oil and natural gas deposits, especially north of the Los Bajos Fault. 
The Southern Range forms the third anticlinal uplift. It consists of several 
chains of hills, most famous being the Trinity Hills. The rocks consist 
of sandstones, shales, siltstones and clays formed in the Miocene and uplifted 
in the Pleistocene. Oil sands and mud volcanoes are especially common in 
this area. The climate is tropical. There are two seasons annually: the 
dry season for the first five months of the year, and the rainy season 
in the remaining seven of the year. Winds are predominantly from the northeast 
and are dominated by the northeast trade winds. Unlike most of the other 
Caribbean islands, both Trinidad and Tobago have frequently escaped the 
wrath of major devastating hurricanes, including Hurricane Ivan, the most 
powerful storm to have passed close to the islands in recent history, in 
September 2004. In the Northern Range, the climate is often different in 
contrast to the sweltering heat of the plains below. With constant cloud 
and mist cover, and heavy rains in the mountains, the temperature is much 
cooler. Record temperatures for Trinidad and Tobago are 39 °C (102 °F)[20] 
for the high in Port of Spain, and a low of 12 °C (54 °F).[21] Because 
Trinidad and Tobago lie on the continental shelf of South America, their 
biological diversity is unlike that of most other Caribbean islands, and 
has much in common with that of Venezuela. The main ecosystems are: coastal 
and marine (coral reefs, mangrove swamps, open ocean and seagrass beds); 
forest; freshwater (rivers and streams); karst; man-made ecosystems (agricultural 
land, freshwater dams, secondary forest); and savanna. On 1 August 1996, 
Trinidad and Tobago ratified the 1992 Rio Convention on Biological Diversity, 
and it has produced a biodiversity action plan and four reports describing 
the country's contribution to biodiversity conservation. The reports formally 
acknowledged the importance of biodiversity to the well-being of the country's 
people through provision of ecosystem services.[22] Information about vertebrates 
is good, with 472 bird species (2 endemics), about 100 mammals, about 90 
reptiles (a few endemics), about 30 amphibians (a few endemics), 50 freshwater 
fish and at least 950 marine fish.[23] Information about invertebrates 
is dispersed and very incomplete. About 650 butterflies,[23] at least 672 
beetles (from Tobago alone)[24] and 40 corals[23] have been recorded.[23] 
Although the list is far from complete, 1647 species of fungi, including 
lichens, have been recorded.[25][26][27] The true total number of fungi 
is likely to be far higher, given the generally accepted estimate that 
only about 7% of all fungi worldwide have so far been discovered.[28] A 
first effort to estimate the number of endemic fungi tentatively listed 
407 species.[29] Information about micro-organisms is dispersed and very 
incomplete. Nearly 200 species of marine algae have been recorded.[23] 
The true total number of micro-organism species must be much higher. Thanks 
to a recently published checklist, plant diversity in Trinidad and Tobago 
is well documented with about 3,300 species (59 endemic) recorded.[23] 
Columbus reported seeing Tobago on the distant horizon in 1498, naming 
it Bellaforma, but did not land on the island.[30] The present name of 
Tobago is thought to be a corruption of its old name, "Tobaco".[17] The 
Dutch and the Courlanders (people from the small duchy of Courland and 
Semigallia in modern-day Latvia) established themselves in Tobago in the 
16th and 17th centuries and produced tobacco and cotton. Over the centuries, 
Tobago changed hands between Spanish, British, French, Dutch and Courlander 
colonizers. Britain consolidated its hold on both islands during the Napoleonic 
Wars, and they were combined into the colony of Trinidad and Tobago in 
1889.[31] As a result of these colonial struggles, Amerindian, Spanish, 
French and English place names are all common in the country. African slaves 
and Chinese, Indian, Tamil and free African indentured labourers, as well 
as Portuguese from Madeira, arrived to supply labour in the 19th and early 
20th centuries. Emigration from Barbados and the other Lesser Antilles, 
Venezuela, Syria and Lebanon also impacted on the ethnic make-up of the 
country. Both Trinidad and Tobago were originally settled by Amerindians 
of South American origin. Trinidad was first settled by pre-agricultural 
Archaic people at least 7,000 years ago, making it the earliest settled 
part of the Caribbean. Ceramic-using agriculturalists settled Trinidad 
around 250 BC, and then moved further up the Lesser Antillean chain. At 
the time of European contact, Trinidad was occupied by various Arawakan-speaking 
groups including the Nepoya and Suppoya, and Cariban-speaking groups such 
as the Yao, while Tobago was occupied by the Island Caribs and Galibi. 
Christopher Columbus encountered the island of Trinidad on 31 July 1498. 
In the 1530s, Antonio de Sedeño, a Spanish soldier intent on conquering 
the island of Trinidad, landed on its southwest coast with a small army 
of men. He intended to subdue the Orinoco and the Warao, the two major 
Amerindian peoples of the island, and rule over them in the name of the 
Spanish king. Sedeño and his men fought the native Carib Indians on many 
occasions, and subsequently built a fort. The next few decades were generally 
spent in warfare with the natives, until in 1592, the 'Cacique' (native 
chief) Wannawanare (also known as Guanaguanare) granted the area later 
known as "St. Josephs" to Domingo de Vera e Ibargüen, and withdrew to another 
part of the island.[16] The settlement of San José de Oruña (St. Joseph) 
was established by Antonio de Berrío on this land. Only a couple of years 
later, Sir Walter Raleigh arrived in Trinidad on 22 March 1595. He was 
in search of the long-rumoured "City of Gold" supposedly located in South 
America. He soon attacked San José, captured and interrogated Antonio de 
Berrío, and obtained much information from him and from the Cacique Topiawari. 
Raleigh then went on his way, and the Spanish authority was restored. The 
next century (the 1600s) passed without major incident, but sustained attempts 
by the Spaniards to control and rule over the Amerindians, and especially 
the exertions of the missionaries, were preparing grounds for an outburst. 
In 1687, the Catholic Catalan Capuchin friars were given responsibility 
for the conversions of the indigenous people of Trinidad and the Guianas. 
After 1687, they founded several missions in Trinidad, supported and richly 
funded by the state, which also granted encomienda over the native people 
to them. One such mission was Santa Rosa de Arima, established in 1789, 
when Amerindians from the former encomiendas of Tacarigua and Arauca (Arouca) 
were relocated further west. The missions aimed at conversion and cultural 
deracination, which were naturally unwelcome to the target population. 
Finally, something snapped and the Arena Massacre or Arena Uprising took 
place on 1 December 1699. On that day, Amerindians bound to the Church's 
encomienda at the mission at Arena/Arima revolted, killing the priests 
and desecrating the church. They then ambushed the governor and his party, 
who were on their way to visit the church. The uprising resulted in the 
death of several hundred Amerindians, of the Roman Catholic priests connected 
with the mission of San Francisco de los Arenales, of the Spanish Governor 
José de León y Echales and of all but one member of his party. Among those 
killed in the governor's party was Fr. Juan Mazien de Sotomayor, O.P., 
missionary priest to the Nepuyo villages of Cuara, Tacarigua and Arauca. 
Order was eventually restored and the Spanish authority was re-established. 
Another century passed, and during the 1700s, Trinidad was an island province 
belonging to the Viceroyalty of New Spain, together with Central America, 
present-day Mexico and the Southwestern United States.[32] However, Trinidad 
in this period was still mostly forest, populated by a few Spaniards with 
their handful of slaves and a few thousand Amerindians.[32] Indeed, the 
population in 1777 was only 1400, and Spanish colonisation in Trinidad 
remained tenuous. Since Trinidad was considered underpopulated, Roume de 
St. Laurent, a Frenchman living in Grenada, was able to obtain a Cédula 
de Población from the Spanish king Charles III on 4 November 1783. A Cédula 
de Población had previously been granted in 1776 by the king, but had not 
shown results, and therefore the new Cédula was more generous. It granted 
free land and tax exemption for 10 years to Roman Catholic foreign settlers 
who were willing to swear allegiance to the King of Spain.[33] The land 
grant was 30 fanegas (13 hectares/32 acres) for each free man, woman and 
child and half of that for each slave that they brought with them. It was 
fortuitous that the Cédula was issued only a few years before the French 
Revolution. During that period of upheaval, French planters with their 
slaves, free coloureds and mulattos from the neighbouring islands of Martinique, 
Saint Lucia, Grenada, Guadeloupe and Dominica migrated to Trinidad, where 
they established an agriculture-based economy (sugar and cocoa).[32] These 
new immigrants established local communities in Blanchisseuse, Champs Fleurs, 
Paramin,[34] Cascade, Carenage and Laventille. Trinidad's population jumped 
to over 15,000 by the end of 1789, from just under 1,400 in 1777. By 1797, 
the population of Port of Spain had increased from under 3,000 to 10,422 
in five years, and consisted of people of mixed race, Spaniards, Africans, 
French republican soldiers, retired pirates and French nobility.[32] The 
total population of Trinidad was 17,718, of which 2,151 were of European 
ancestry, 4,476 were "free blacks and people of colour", 10,009 were slaves 
and 1,082 Amerindians. The sparse settlement and slow rate of population 
increase during Spanish rule (and even during British rule) made Trinidad 
one of the less populated colonies of the West Indies, with the least developed 
plantation infrastructure.[35] In 1797, a British force led by General 
Sir Ralph Abercromby launched the invasion of Trinidad. His squadron sailed 
through the Bocas and anchored off the coast of Chaguaramas. The Spanish 
Governor Chacón decided to capitulate without fighting. Trinidad thus became 
a British crown colony, with a French-speaking population and Spanish laws.[32] 
British rule was formalized under the Treaty of Amiens (1802). British 
rule led to an influx of settlers from the United Kingdom and the British 
colonies of the Eastern Caribbean. English, Scots, Irish, German and Italian 
families arrived. Under British rule, new estates were created and the 
import of slaves did increase, but this was the period of abolitionism 
in England and the slave trade was under attack.[35][36] Slavery was abolished 
in 1833, after which former slaves served an "apprenticeship" period which 
ended on 1 August 1838 with full emancipation. An overview of the populations 
statistics in 1838, however, clearly reveals the contrast between Trinidad 
and its neighbouring islands: upon emancipation of the slaves in 1838, 
Trinidad had only 17,439 slaves, with 80% of slave owners having less than 
10 slaves each.[36]:84–85 In contrast, at twice the size of Trinidad, Jamaica 
had roughly 360,000 slaves.[37] After slaves were emancipated, plantation 
owners were in severe need of labour. The British authorities filled this 
need by instituting a system of indentureship. Various nationalities were 
contracted under this system, including Indians, Chinese and Portuguese. 
Of these, the Indians were imported in the largest numbers, starting from 
1 May 1845, when 225 Indians were brought in the first shipment to Trinidad 
on the Fatel Rozack, a Muslim-owned vessel.[38] Indentureship of the Indians 
lasted from 1845 to 1917, during which more than 147,000 Indians were brought 
to Trinidad to work on sugarcane plantations.[39] They added what was initially 
the second-largest population grouping to the young nation, and their labour 
developed previously underdeveloped plantation lands. The indentureship 
contract was exploitative, such that historians including Hugh Tinker were 
to call it "a new system of slavery". People were contracted for a period 
of five years, with a daily wage as low as 25 cents in the early 20th century, 
and they were guaranteed return passage to India at the end of their contract 
period. However, Coercive means were often used to retain labourers, and 
the indentureship contracts were soon extended to 10 years after the planters 
complained that they were losing their labour too early.[35] In lieu of 
the return passage, the British authorities soon began offering portions 
of land to encourage settlement; however, the numbers of people who did 
receive land grants is unclear.[40] Indians entering the colony were also 
subject to particular crown laws which segregated them from the rest of 
Trinidad's population, such as the requirement that they carry a pass with 
them once off the plantations, and that if freed, they carry their "Free 
Papers" or certificate indicating completion of the indenture period.[41] 
The ex-Indentureds came to constitute a vital and significant section of 
the population, as did the ex-slaves. Alongside sugarcane, the cacao (cocoa) 
crop also contributed greatly to economic earnings in the late nineteenth 
and early twentieth centuries. In the 1920–1930 period, the collapse of 
the sugarcane industry concomitant with the failure of the cocoa industry 
resulted in widespread depression among the rural and agricultural workers 
in Trinidad, and encouraged the rise of the Labour movement. This movement 
was led by Tubal Uriah "Buzz" Butler, who, in combination with his Indian 
partners (notably Adrian Cola Rienzi), aimed to unite the working class 
and agricultural labour class to achieve a better standard of living for 
them, as well as to hasten the departure of the British. This effort was 
severely undermined by the British Home Office and by the British-educated 
Trinidadian elite, many of whom were descended from the plantocracy themselves. 
They instigated a vicious race politicking in Trinidad aimed at dividing 
the class-based movement on race-based lines, and they succeeded, especially 
since Butler's support had collapsed from the top down. Petroleum had been 
discovered in 1857, but became economically significant only in the 1930s 
and afterwards,[31] as a result of the collapse of sugarcane and cocoa, 
and increasing industrialization. By the 1950s, petroleum had become a 
staple in Trinidad's export market, and was responsible for a growing middle 
class among all sections of the Trinidad population. The collapse of Trinidad's 
major agricultural commodities, followed by the Depression, and the rise 
of the oil economy, led to major changes in the country's social structure. 
Trinidad and Tobago gained its independence from the United Kingdom on 
31 August 1962.[31] Elizabeth II remained head of state as Queen of Trinidad 
and Tobago. Eric Williams, a noted Caribbean historian, widely regarded 
as "The Father of The Nation," was the first Prime Minister; he served 
from 1956, before independence, until his death in 1981. The presence of 
American military bases in Chaguaramas and Cumuto in Trinidad during World 
War II profoundly changed the character of society. In the post-war period, 
the wave of decolonisation that swept the British Empire led to the formation 
of the West Indies Federation in 1958 as a vehicle for independence. Chaguaramas 
was the proposed site for the federal capital. The Federation dissolved 
after the withdrawal of Jamaica, and the government chose to seek independence 
on its own.[42] In 1976, the country became a republic within the Commonwealth, 
though it retained the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council as its final 
Court of Appeal. Between the years 1972 and 1983, the republic profited 
greatly from the rising price of oil, as the oil-rich country increased 
its living standards greatly. In 1990, 114 members of the Jamaat al Muslimeen, 
led by Yasin Abu Bakr, formerly known as Lennox Phillip, stormed the Red 
House (the seat of Parliament), and Trinidad and Tobago Television, the 
only television station in the country at the time, and held the country's 
government hostage for six days before surrendering.[43] Since 2003, the 
country has entered a second oil boom, a driving force which the government 
hopes to use to turn the country's main export back to sugar and agriculture.[citation 
needed] Great concern was raised in August 2007 when it was predicted that 
this boom would last only until 2018. Petroleum, petrochemicals and natural 
gas continue to be the backbone of the economy. Tourism and the public 
service are the mainstay of the economy of Tobago, though authorities have 
begun to diversify the island.[44] The bulk of tourist arrivals on the 
islands are from the United States.[45] The country is also a recognised 
transhipment point for illegal narcotics, with the cocaine distribution 
from the South American continent to the United States Eastern seaboard. 
With the most recent seizure of $100 million US dollar shipment by United 
States Authorities on 17 January 2014.[46] Trinidad and Tobago is a republic 
with a two-party system and a bicameral parliamentary system based on the 
Westminster System. The head of state of Trinidad and Tobago is the President, 
currently Anthony Carmona. The head of government is the Prime Minister, 
currently Keith Rowley. The President is elected by an Electoral college 
consisting of the full membership of both houses of Parliament. The Prime 
Minister is elected from the results of a general election which takes 
place every five years. The President is required to appoint the leader 
of the party who in his opinion has the most support of the members of 
the House of Representatives to this post; this has generally been the 
leader of the party which won the most seats in the previous election (except 
in the case of the 2001 General Elections). Tobago also has its own elections, 
separate from the general elections. In these elections, members are elected 
and serve in the Tobago House of Assembly. Parliament consists of the Senate 
(31 seats) and the House of Representatives (41 seats).[47] The members 
of the Senate are appointed by the president. Sixteen Government Senators 
are appointed on the advice of the Prime Minister, six Opposition Senators 
are appointed on the advice of the Leader of the Opposition and nine Independent 
Senators are appointed by the President to represent other sectors of civil 
society. The 41 members of the House of Representatives are elected by 
the people for a maximum term of five years in a "first past the post" 
system. From 24 December 2001 to 24 May 2010, the governing party has been 
the People's National Movement (PNM) led by Patrick Manning; the Opposition 
party was the United National Congress (UNC) led by Basdeo Panday. Another 
recent party was the Congress of the People, or COP, led by Winston Dookeran. 
Support for these parties appears to fall along ethnic lines with the PNM 
consistently obtaining a majority of Afro-Trinidadian vote, and the UNC 
gaining a majority of Indo-Trinidadian support. COP gained 23% of the votes 
in the 2007 general elections but failed to win a seat. Prior to 24 May 
2010, the PNM held 26 seats in the House of Representatives and the UNC 
Alliance (UNC-A) held 15 seats, following elections held on 5 November 
2007. After two and a half years, Prime Minister Patrick Manning dissolved 
Parliament in April 2010, and called a general election on 24 May 2010. 
After these general elections, the new governing coalition is the People's 
Partnership led by Kamla Persad-Bissessar. Persad-Bissessar and "the People's 
Partnership" wrested power from the Patrick Manning-led PNM, taking home 
29 seats to the PNM's 12 seats, based on preliminary results. It is estimated 
that 20% – 30% of measured GDP represents the hidden economy.[48] Within 
the Trinidadian and Tobagonian business structure illicit activities and 
licit activities work side by side, with many business and political organisations 
being funded by institutionalised drug smugglers. Within Trinidad and Tobago 
there are two main drug cartels, the Syrian/Lebanese drug cartels and the 
Indo Trinidadian drug cartels. The Syrian Lebanese drug cartels are the 
longest tenured drug cartel on the islands, having ridden the wave of cocaine 
exportation from the 1970s to the current day. The Syrian Drug Cartels 
control the vast sway of financing and business interest on the island 
and exhibit monopolistic tendencies which limit free market policies in 
insurance, health, finance, heavy and light manufacturing, and land distribution.[49] 
Modern Trinidad and Tobago maintains close relations with its Caribbean 
neighbours and major North American and European trading partners. As the 
most industrialised and second-largest country in the English-speaking 
Caribbean, Trinidad and Tobago has taken a leading role in the Caribbean 
Community (CARICOM), and strongly supports CARICOM economic integration 
efforts. It also is active in the Summit of the Americas process and supports 
the establishment of the Free Trade Area of the Americas, lobbying other 
nations for seating the Secretariat in Port of Spain. As a member of CARICOM, 
Trinidad and Tobago strongly backed efforts by the United States to bring 
political stability to Haiti, contributing personnel to the Multinational 
Force in 1994. After its 1962 independence, Trinidad and Tobago joined 
the United Nations and Commonwealth of Nations. In 1967, it became the 
first Commonwealth country to join the Organization of American States 
(OAS). In 1995, Trinidad played host to the inaugural meeting of the Association 
of Caribbean States and has become the seat of this 35-member grouping, 
which seeks to further economic progress and integration among its states. 
In international forums, Trinidad and Tobago has defined itself as having 
an independent voting record, but often supports US and EU positions. The 
Trinidad and Tobago Defence Force (TTDF) is the military organisation responsible 
for the defence of the twin island Republic of Trinidad and Tobago. It 
consists of the Regiment, the Coast Guard, the Air Guard and the Defence 
Force Reserves. Established in 1962 after Trinidad and Tobago's independence 
from the United Kingdom, the TTDF is one of the largest military forces 
in the English-speaking Caribbean.[citation needed] Its mission statement 
is to "defend the sovereign good of The Republic of Trinidad and Tobago, 
contribute to the development of the national community and support the 
State in the fulfillment of its national and international objectives". 
The Defence Force has been engaged in domestic incidents, such as the 1990 
Coup Attempt, and international missions, such as the United Nations Mission 
in Haiti between 1993 and 1996. Trinidad is split into 14 regional corporations 
and municipalities, consisting of 9 regions and 5 municipalities, which 
have a limited level of autonomy. The various councils are made up of a 
mixture of elected and appointed members. Elections are due to be held 
every three years, but have not been held since 2003, four extensions having 
been sought by the government. The island of Tobago is governed by the 
Tobago House of Assembly: Trinidad and Tobago is one of the wealthiest 
and most developed nations in the Caribbean and is listed in the top 40 
(2010 information) of the 70 High Income countries in the world. Its GNI 
per capita of US$20,070[50] (2014 GNI at Atlas Method) is one of the highest 
in the Caribbean.[51] In November 2011, the OECD removed Trinidad and Tobago 
from its list of Developing Countries.[52] Trinidad's economy is strongly 
influenced by the petroleum industry. Tourism and manufacturing are also 
important to the local economy. Tourism is a growing sector, although not 
as proportionately important as in many other Caribbean islands. Agricultural 
products include citrus and cocoa. Recent growth has been fuelled by investments 
in liquefied natural gas (LNG), petrochemicals, and steel. Additional petrochemical, 
aluminium, and plastics projects are in various stages of planning. Trinidad 
and Tobago is the leading Caribbean producer of oil and gas, and its economy 
is heavily dependent upon these resources but it also supplies manufactured 
goods, notably food, beverages, and cement, to the Caribbean region. Oil 
and gas account for about 40% of GDP and 80% of exports, but only 5% of 
employment. The country is also a regional financial centre, and the economy 
has a growing trade surplus.[18] The expansion of Atlantic LNG over the 
past six years created the largest single-sustained phase of economic growth 
in Trinidad and Tobago. It has become the leading exporter of LNG to the 
United States, and now supplies some 70% of US LNG imports.[53] Trinidad 
and Tobago has transitioned from an oil-based economy to a natural gas 
based economy. In 2007, natural gas production averaged 4 billion cubic 
feet per day (110,000,000 m3/d), compared with 3.2×10 ^6 cu ft/d (91,000 m3/d) 
in 2005. In December 2005, the Atlantic LNG's fourth production module 
or "train" for liquefied natural gas (LNG) began production. Train 4 has 
increased Atlantic LNG's overall output capacity by almost 50% and is the 
largest LNG train in the world at 5.2 million tons/year of LNG. Trinidad 
and Tobago, in an effort to undergo economic transformation though diversification 
formed InvesTT in 2012 to serve as the country's sole investment promotion 
agency. This agency is aligned to the Ministry of Trade and Industry and 
is to the be the key agent in growing the country's non-oil and gas sectors 
significantly and sustainably.[54] Trinidad and Tobago's infrastructure 
is good by regional standards.[original research?] The international airport 
in Trinidad was expanded in 2001. There is an extensive network of paved 
roads with several good four and six lane highways including one controlled 
access expressway. The Ministry of Works estimates that an average Trinidadian 
spends about four hours in traffic per day.[citation needed] Emergency 
services are reliable, but may suffer delays in rural districts.[citation 
needed] Private hospitals are available and reliable.[citation needed] 
Utilities are fairly reliable in the cities.[citation needed] Some areas, 
however, especially rural districts, still suffer from water shortages.[citation 
needed] Trinidad and Tobago has a well developed communications sector. 
The Telecommunications and Broadcasting sectors generated an estimated 
TT$5.63 billion(US$0.88 billion) in 2014, which as a percentage of GDP 
equates to 3.1 percent. This represented a 1.9 percent increase in total 
revenues generated by this industry compared to last year. Of total telecommunications 
and broadcasting revenues, mobile voice services accounted for the majority 
of revenues with TT$2.20 billion (39.2 percent). This was followed by Internet 
services which contributed TT$1.18 billion or 21.1 percent. The next highest 
revenue earners for the industry were Fixed Voice services and Pay TV services 
whose contributions totalled TT$0.76 billion and TT$0.70 billion respectively 
(13.4 percent and 12.4 percent). International voice services was next 
in line, generating, TT$0.27 billion 4.7 percent) in revenues. Free-to 
Air radio and television services contributed TT$0.18 billion and TT$0.13 
billion respectively (3.2 percent and 2.4 percent). Finally, other contributors 
included “other revenues”and “leased line services” with earnings of TT$0.16 
billion and TT$0.05 billion respectively, with 2.8 percent and 0.9 percent.[55] 
There are several providers for each segment of the telecommunications 
market. Fixed Lines Telephone service is provided by TSTT and Cable & Wireless 
Communications operating as FLOW; cellular service is provided by TSTT 
(operating as bmobile) and Digicel whilst internet service is provided 
by TSTT, FLOW, Digicel, Green Dot and Lisa Communications. The transport 
system in Trinidad and Tobago consists of a dense network of highways and 
roads across both major islands, ferries connecting Port of Spain with 
Scarborough and San Fernando, and international airports on both islands. 
The Uriah Butler Highway and Churchill Roosevelt Highway links the nation 
together. Public transportation options on land are public buses, private 
taxis and minibuses. By sea, the options are inter-island ferries and inter-city 
water taxis.[56] The island of Trinidad is served by Piarco International 
Airport located in Piarco. It was opened on 8 January 1931. Elevated at 
17.4 metres (57 ft) above sea level it comprises an area of 680 hectares 
(1,700 acres) and has a runway of 3,200 metres (10,500 ft). The airport 
consists of two terminals, the North Terminal and the South Terminal. The 
older South Terminal underwent renovations in 2009 for use as a VIP entrance 
point during the 5th Summit of the Americas. The North Terminal was completed 
in 2001, and consists of[57] 14 second-level aircraft gates with jetways 
for international flights, two ground-level domestic gates and 82 ticket 
counter positions. Piarco International Airport was voted the Caribbean's 
leading airport for customer satisfaction and operational efficiency at 
the prestigious World Travel Awards (WTA),[58] held in the Turks and Caicos 
in 2006.[59] In 2008 the passenger throughput at Piarco International Airport 
was approximately 2.6 million. Piarco International Airport is the seventh 
busiest airport in the Caribbean and the third busiest in the English-speaking 
Caribbean, after Sangster International Airport and Lynden Pindling International 
Airport. As of December 2006, nineteen international airlines operated 
out of Piarco and offered flights to twenty-seven international destinations. 
Caribbean Airlines, the national airline, operates its main hub at the 
Piarco International Airport and services the Caribbean, the United States, 
Canada and South America. The airline is wholly owned by the Government 
of Trinidad and Tobago. After an additional cash injection of US$50 million, 
the Trinidad and Tobago government acquired the Jamaican airline Air Jamaica 
on 1 May 2010, with a 6–12 month transition period to follow.[60] Caribbean 
Airlines, the national and state-owned airline of Trinidad and Tobago, 
is the largest in the Caribbean. After the acquisition of the now defunct 
Air Jamaica, it became the largest airline and was voted as the Caribbean's 
leading airline. The Island of Tobago is served by the A.N.R. Robinson 
International Airport in Crown Point Tobago. This airport has regular services 
to North America and Europe. There are regular flights between the two 
islands, with fares being heavily subsidised by the Government The ethnic 
composition of Trinidad and Tobago reflects a history of conquest and immigration.[61] 
While the earliest inhabitants were of Amerindian heritage, since the 20th 
century the two dominant groups in the country were those of South Asian 
and of African heritage. Indo-Trinidadians make up the country's largest 
ethnic group (approximately 37.6%). They are primarily descendants from 
indentured workers from India, brought to replace freed African slaves 
who refused to continue working on the sugar plantations. Through cultural 
preservation some residents of Indian descent continue to maintain traditions 
from their ancestral homelands. Afro-Trinidadian and Tobagonians make up 
the country's second largest ethnic group, with approximately 36.3% of 
the population identifying as being of African descent. People of African 
background were brought to the island as slaves as early as the 16th century. 
24.4% of the population identified in the 2011 census as being of "mixed" 
ethnic heritage. There are small but significant minorities of people of 
European, Chinese, and Levantine (Syrian/Lebanese) descent. English is 
the country's official language (the local variety of standard English 
is Trinidadian English or more properly, Trinidad and Tobago Standard English, 
abbreviated as "TTSE"), but the main spoken language is either of two English-based 
creole languages (Trinidadian Creole or Tobagonian Creole), which reflects 
the Amerindian, European, African, and Asian heritage of the nation. Both 
creoles contain elements from a variety of African languages; Trinidadian 
English Creole, however, is also influenced by French and French Creole 
(Patois).[62] Spanish is estimated to be spoken by around 5% of the population[63] 
and has been promoted by recent governments as a "first foreign language". 
Some of the early Indian arrivals to the island spoke Trinidadian Hindustani 
(a form of the Bhojpuri dialect of Hindustani), though native speakers 
of the language decreased over time. Currently few residents of Indian 
background continue to speak languages from their ancestral homelands. 
Attempts are being made to preserve the Trinidaian Hindustani language 
in the country, including the promotion of Indo-Trinidadian musical forms 
called Pichakaree and Chutney, which is typically sung in a mixture of 
English and Trinidadian Hindustani. The indigenous languages were Yao on 
Trinidad and Karina on Tobago, both Cariban, and Shebaya on Trinidad, which 
was Arawakan. Many different religions are practised in Trinidad and Tobago. 
According to the 2011 census,[65] Roman Catholics were the largest religious 
group in Trinidad and Tobago with 21.60% of the total population. Hindus 
were the second largest group with 18.15%, while the Pentecostal/Evangelical/Full 
Gospel denominations were the third largest group with 12.02% of the population. 
Significantly, respondents who did not state a religious affiliation represented 
11.1% of the population. The remaining population is made of Spiritual 
Shouter Baptists (5.67%), Anglicans (5.67%), Muslims (4.97%), Seventh-day 
Adventists (4.09%), Presbyterians or Congregationalists (2.49%), Irreligious 
(2.18%), Jehovah's Witnesses (1.47%), other Baptists (1.21%), Trinidad 
Orisha believers (0.9%), Methodists (0.65%), Rastafarians (0.27%) and the 
Moravian Church (0.27%). Two African syncretic faiths, the Shouter or Spiritual 
Baptists and the Orisha faith (formerly called Shangos, a less than complimentary 
term)[citation needed] are among the fastest growing religious groups. 
Similarly, there is a noticeable increase in numbers of Evangelical Protestant 
and Fundamentalist churches usually lumped as "Pentecostal" by most Trinidadians, 
although this designation is often inaccurate. A small Jewish community 
exists on the islands, and several eastern religions such as Buddhism and 
Taoism are followed by the Chinese community. There is also a small Baha'i 
community. Children generally start pre-school at two and a half years 
but this is not mandatory. They are however, expected to have basic reading 
and writing skills when they commence primary school. Students proceed 
to a primary school at the age of five years. Seven years are spent in 
primary school. The seven classes of primary school consists of First Year 
and Second Year, followed by Standard One through Standard Five. During 
the final year of primary school, students prepare for and sit the Secondary 
Entrance Assessment (SEA) which determines the secondary school the child 
will attend. Students attend secondary school for a minimum of five years, 
leading to the CSEC (Caribbean Secondary Education Certificate) examinations, 
which is the equivalent of the British GCSE O levels. Children with satisfactory 
grades may opt to continue high school for a further two-year period, leading 
to the Caribbean Advanced Proficiency Examinations (CAPE), the equivalent 
of GCE A levels. Both CSEC and CAPE examinations are held by the Caribbean 
Examinations Council (CXC). Public Primary and Secondary education is free 
for all, although private and religious schooling is available for a fee. 
Tertiary education for tuition costs are provided for via GATE (The Government 
Assistance for Tuition Expenses), up to the level of the bachelor's degree, 
at the University of the West Indies (UWI), the University of Trinidad 
and Tobago (UTT), the University of the Southern Caribbean (USC), the College 
of Science, Technology and Applied Arts of Trinidad and Tobago (COSTAATT) 
and certain other local accredited institutions. Government also currently 
subsidizes some Masters programmes. Both the Government and the private 
sector also provide financial assistance in the form of academic scholarships 
to gifted or needy students for study at local, regional or international 
universities. Trinidad and Tobago claims two Nobel Prize-winning authors, 
V. S. Naipaul and St Lucian-born Derek Walcott (who founded the Trinidad 
Theatre Workshop, working and raising a family in Trinidad for much of 
his career). Designer Peter Minshall is renowned not only for his Carnival 
costumes but also for his role in opening ceremonies of the Barcelona Olympics, 
the 1994 Football World Cup, the 1996 Summer Olympics, and the 2002 Winter 
Olympics, for which he won an Emmy Award. Geoffrey Holder (brother of Boscoe 
Holder) and Heather Headley are two Trinidad-born artists who have won 
Tony Awards for theatre. Holder also has a distinguished film career, and 
Headley has won a Grammy Award as well. Recording artists Billy Ocean and 
Nicki Minaj are also Trinidadian. Interestingly, three actors who appeared 
on Will Smith's sitcom The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air are of Trinidadian descent: 
Tatyana Ali and Alfonso Ribeiro were series regulars as Will's cousins 
Ashley and Carlton, respectively, while Nia Long played Will's girlfriend 
Lisa. Foxy Brown, Dean Marshall, Sommore, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Gabrielle 
Reece, pop singer Haddaway, Tracy Quan, Mike Bibby, Lauryn Williams, Fresh 
Kid Ice, and Roy Hibbert are all of Trinidadian descent.[66] Trinidad and 
Tobago also has the distinction of being the smallest country to have two 
Miss Universe titleholders and the first black woman ever to win: Janelle 
Commissiong in 1977, followed by Wendy Fitzwilliam in 1998; the country 
has also had one Miss World titleholder, Giselle LaRonde. Trinidad and 
Tobago is the birthplace of calypso music and the steelpan, which is widely 
claimed in Trinidad and Tobago to be the only acoustic musical instrument 
invented during the 20th century.[67][68][69] Trinidad is also the birthplace 
of Soca music, Chutney music, Parang, and Carnival (in the form that has 
been widely copied in the Caribbean and around the world). The diverse 
cultural and religious background also allows for many festivities and 
ceremonies throughout the year such as Carnival, Diwali, and Eid festivities.[70] 
Hasely Crawford won the first Olympic gold medal for Trinidad and Tobago 
in the men's 100 metre dash in the 1976 Summer Olympics. Nine different 
athletes from Trinidad and Tobago have won twelve medals at the Olympics, 
beginning with a silver medal in weightlifting, won by Rodney Wilkes in 
1948,[71] and most recently, a gold medal by Keshorn Walcott in the men's 
javelin throw in 2012. Ato Boldon has won the most Olympic and World Championship 
medals for Trinidad and Tobago in athletics, with eight in total – four 
from the Olympics and four from the World Championships. Boldon is the 
only world champion Trinidad and Tobago has produced to date in athletics. 
He won the 1997 200 m sprint World Championship in Athens. Swimmer George 
Bovell III won a bronze medal in the men's 200 m IM in 2004. Also in 2012 
Lalonde Gordon competed in the XXX Summer Olympics where he won a Bronze 
Medal in the 400 meters, being surpassed by Luguelin Santos of the Dominican 
Republic and Kirani James of Grenada. Keshorn Walcott (as stated above) 
came first in javelin and earned a gold medal, making him the second Trinidadian 
in the country's history to receive one. This also makes him the first 
Western[clarification needed] athlete in 40 years to receive a gold medal 
in the javelin sport, and the first athlete from Trinidad and Tobago to 
win a gold medal in a field event in the Olympics. Sprinter Richard Thompson 
is also from Trinidad and Tobago. He came second place to Usain Bolt in 
the Beijing Olympics in the 100m with a time of 9.89s. Cricket is one of 
the most popular sports of Trinidad and Tobago, with intense inter-island 
rivalry with its Caribbean neighbours. Trinidad and Tobago is represented 
at Test cricket, One Day International as well as Twenty20 cricket level 
as a member of the West Indies team. The national team plays at the first-class 
level in regional competitions. Trinidad and Tobago along with other islands 
from the Caribbean co-hosted the 2007 Cricket World Cup. Brian Lara, world 
record holder for the most runs scored both in a Test and in a First Class 
innings and other records, was born in a small town of Santa Cruz, Trinidad 
and Tobago and is often referred to as the Prince of Port of Spain or simply 
the Prince. This legendary West Indian batsman is widely regarded as one 
of the best batsmen ever to have played the game, and is one of the most 
famous sporting icons in the country. Association football is the most 
popular sport in Trinidad and Tobago. The men's national football team 
qualified for the 2006 FIFA World Cup for the first time by beating Bahrain 
in Manama on 16 November 2005, making them the smallest country ever (in 
terms of population) to qualify. The team, coached by Dutchman Leo Beenhakker, 
and led by Tobagonian-born captain Dwight Yorke, drew their first group 
game – against Sweden in Dortmund, 0–0, but lost the second game to England 
on late goals, 0–2. They were eliminated after losing 2–0 to Paraguay in 
the last game of the Group Stage. Prior to the 2006 World Cup qualification, 
Trinidad and Tobago came agonisingly close in a controversial qualification 
campaign for the 1974 FIFA World Cup. Following the match, the referee 
of their critical game against Haiti was awarded a lifetime ban for his 
actions.[72] Trinidad and Tobago again fell just short of qualifying for 
the World Cup in 1990, needing only a draw at home against the United States 
but losing 1–0.[73] Trinidad and Tobago hosted the 2001 FIFA U-17 World 
Championship, and hosted the 2010 FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup. The TT Pro 
League is the country's primary football competition and is the top level 
of the Trinidad and Tobago football league system. The Pro League serves 
as a league for professional football clubs in Trinidad and Tobago. The 
league began in 1999 as part of a need for a professional league to strengthen 
the country's national team and improve the development of domestic players. 
The first season took place in the same year beginning with eight teams. 
Basketball is commonly played in Trinidad and Tobago in colleges, universities 
and throughout various urban basketball courts. Its national team is one 
of the most successful teams in the Caribbean. At the Caribbean Basketball 
Championship it won four straight gold medals from 1986–1990. Netball has 
long been a popular sport in Trinidad and Tobago, although it has declined 
in popularity in recent years. At the Netball World Championships they 
co-won the event in 1979, were runners up in 1987, and second runners up 
in 1983. Rugby is played in Trinidad and Tobago and continues to be a popular 
sport, and horse racing is regularly followed in the country. There is 
also the Trinidad and Tobago national baseball team which is controlled 
by the Baseball/Softball Association of Trinidad and Tobago, and represents 
the nation in international competitions. The team is a provisional member 
of the Pan American Baseball Confederation. There are a number of 9 and 
18-hole golf courses on Trinidad and Tobago. The most established is the 
St Andrews Golf Club, Maraval in Trinidad (commonly referred to as Moka), 
and there is a newer course at Trincity, near Piarco Airport called Millennium 
Lakes. There are 18-hole courses at Chaguramas and Point-a-Pierre and 9-hole 
courses at Couva and St Madeline. Tobago has two 18-hole courses. The older 
of the two is at Mount Irvine, with the Magdalena Hotel & Golf Club (formerly 
Tobago Plantations) being built more recently. Although a minor sport, 
bodybuilding is of growing interest in Trinidad and Tobago. Heavyweight 
female bodybuilder Kashma Maharaj is of Trinidadian descent. The flag was 
chosen by the Independence committee in 1962. Red, black and white symbolise 
the warmth of the people, the earth and water respectively.[74][75] The 
coat of arms was designed by the Independence committee, and features the 
scarlet ibis (native to Trinidad), the cocrico (native to Tobago) and hummingbird. 
The shield bears three ships, representing both the Trinity, and the three 
ships that Columbus sailed.[74] There are five categories and thirteen 
classes of National Awards:[76] The National Anthem of the twin-island 
state is "Forged From The Love of Liberty".[77][78] Other national songs 
include 'God Bless Our Nation'[79] and "Our Nation's Dawning".[80] The 
national birds for Trinidad and Tobago are the scarlet ibis and the cocrico. 
The Scarlet Ibis is kept safe by the government by living in the Caroni 
Bird Sanctuary which was set up by the government for the protection of 
these birds. While the Cocrico is more indigenous to the island of Tobago 
and are more likely to be seen in the forest.[81] The national instrument 
of Trinidad and Tobago is the Steelpan which was created in Trinidad and
