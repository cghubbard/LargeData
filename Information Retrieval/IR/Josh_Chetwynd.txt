songs, words, characters and offerings that spread the love and does so 
with wit and intelligence."[23] How the Hot Dog Found its Bun: Accidental 
Discoveries and Unexpected Inspiration That Shape What We Eat and Drink

Courier-Journal said: "You'll be delighted by the author's splendidly told 
tales of [these] creations ... These are engrossing essays that are sure 
to steal a few hours of your time."[24] The Midwest Book Review wrote the 
book was "a 'must' for any general lending library seeing popularity in 
either trivia books, cookbooks, or both ... A fun, compelling read for 
a wide audience spiced with illustrations throughout by David Cole Wheeler,
