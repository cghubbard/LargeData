The Atlanta Braves have completed 146 years of professional baseball, the 
most in Major League Baseball. Through 2015, the Braves have played 20,994 
regular season games in the National League and previously the National 
Association of Professional Base Ball Players, winning 10,595 games and 
losing 10,399 games, for a winning percentage of .505. In all MLB play, 
the team has a record of 10,677–10,483 through the 2015 season.[1] The 
team was founded in 1871 as the Boston Red Stockings and was one of the 
nine charter members of National Association of Professional Base Ball 
Players. The team changed its name to the Boston Red Caps in 1876 when 
it joined the National League. The team changed its name a few more times 
in the late 1800s and early 1900s before settling on the Braves name in 
1912. In 1953, the team moved to Milwaukee. After 13 seasons in Milwaukee, 
the Braves moved again to their current city, Atlanta.[2] The team has 
played in their current stadium Turner Field since 1997.[3] The Braves 
have experienced several periods of success. The team was very dominant 
in the late nineteenth century, when it was known as the Boston Beaneaters, 
winning four of the five National Association of Professional Base Ball 
Players championships and eight National League pennants. In Milwaukee, 
the team never had a losing season. From 1991 until 2005 the Braves were 
one of the most successful franchises in baseball, winning fourteen consecutive 
division titles (omitting the strike-shortened 1994 season in which there 
were no official division champions) and five National League pennants.[1] 
In the 2011 season, the Braves became the third team to win 10,000 MLB 
games.[4] The franchise has won three World Series – one in Boston, one 
in Milwaukee and one in Atlanta.[1] In addition, the Braves have experienced 
periods of futility. The team had eleven straight losing seasons from 1903 
through 1913, during six of which they lost over 100 games. After a short 
period of prominence, the Braves between 1917 and 1945 experienced only 
three winning records and five 100-loss seasons, including having the fourth 
worst record in MLB history in the 1935 season.[1] Between 1970 and 1990, 
the Braves achieved just one postseason appearance and suffered seventeen 
losing seasons out of twenty-one. During the 2011 season, the Braves became 
the second franchise to lose 10,000 MLB games.[5] This article lists the 
results of every season of the franchise, including years based in Boston 
and Milwaukee. These statistics are current at the conclusion of the 2016 
Major League Baseball season. The following table describes the Braves' 
MLB win–loss record by decade. These statistics are from Baseball-Reference.com's 
Atlanta Braves History & Encyclopedia,[1] and are current as of October
