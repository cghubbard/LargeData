In baseball, a breaking ball is a pitch that does not travel straight as 
it approaches the batter; it will have sideways or downward motion on it, 
sometimes both (see slider). A breaking ball is not a specific pitch by 
that name, but is any pitch that "breaks", such as a curveball, slider, 
or cutterâ€”also known as a cut fastball. A pitcher who primarily uses breaking 
ball pitches is often referred to as a junkballer. A breaking ball is more 
difficult than a straight pitch for a catcher to receive as breaking pitches 
sometimes hit the ground (whether intentionally, or not) before making 
it to the plate. A curveball does not curve side to side; it drops as it 
reaches the strike zone. And blocking a breaking ball requires thought 
and preparation by the catcher. The pitcher then, must have confidence 
in the catcher, and the catcher in himself, to block any ball in the dirt; 
if there are runners on base, they will likely advance if the ball gets 
away from the catcher. (Whether the pitcher is right-handed or left-handed 
will dictate which direction the catcher must turn his body to adjust for 
the spin of an upcoming breaking ball. This necessary movement must not 
telegraph the next pitch to the batter, so an experienced catcher must 
fake or mask his intentions of preparing for the pitch.) If a breaking 
ball fails to break, it is called a "hanging" breaking ball, or specifically, 
a "hanging" curve. The "hanger" presents a high, slow pitch that is easy 
for the batter to see, and often results in an extra-base hit or a home 
run. Don Mattingly wrote in Don Mattingly's Hitting Is Simple: The ABC's 
of Batting .300 that "hitting a breaking ball is one of the toughest things 
you'll have to learn" due to the ball's very brief window in the strike
