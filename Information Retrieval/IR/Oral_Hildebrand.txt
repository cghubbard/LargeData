Oral Clyde Hildebrand (April 7, 1907 – September 8, 1977) was a pitcher 
in Major League Baseball from 1931 to 1940. He played for the Cleveland 
Indians, St. Louis Browns, and New York Yankees. Hildebrand was born in 
Indianapolis, Indiana. He attended Butler University and was the starting 
center for the basketball team.[1] He led Butler to the 1929 national collegiate 
championship,[2] was the captain of the 1930 squad,[3] and is in the Butler 
Hall of Fame.[4] Hildebrand started his professional baseball career in 
1930 with the American Association's Indianapolis Indians. In two seasons, 
he went just 14–18[5] but made it to the major leagues in late 1931. Hildebrand 
broke into the Cleveland Indians' starting rotation in 1933. That season, 
he went 16–11, led the American League in shutouts with six, and was selected 
to the All-Star team.[6] He pitched a one-hitter on April 26.[7] From 1934 
to 1936, he continued to pitch effectively for the Indians, going 30–28 
in those years. Hildebrand also had several public disputes with manager 
Walter Johnson, which ended when Johnson was fired in 1935.[8] In 1937, 
Hildebrand was traded to the Browns in a blockbuster deal. He struggled 
in two seasons with St. Louis and was then traded again, to the Yankees. 
In 1939, he went 10–4 with a career-low 3.06 earned run average, helping 
the Yankees win the AL pennant. He started game 4 of the World Series and 
pitched four shutout innings, as the Yankees clinched the title.[6] Hildebrand 
went back to the minor leagues in 1941[5] and retired the following year. 
After his baseball career was over, Hildebrand became a tool and die maker 
for the Link-Belt Division of FMC Corporation. He retired in 1972.[9] Hildebrand 
died on September 7, 1977, at the age of 70. He was survived by his wife 
Frances and five children[1] and was buried in the Forest Lawn Memory Gardens.
