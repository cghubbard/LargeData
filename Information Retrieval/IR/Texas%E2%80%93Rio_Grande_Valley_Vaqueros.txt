The Texas–Rio Grande Valley Vaqueros (often referred to as the UTRGV Vaqueros) 
is a collegiate athletic program that represents the University of Texas 
Rio Grande Valley (UTRGV).[2] The Vaqueros inherited the NCAA Division 
I status of the Texas–Pan American Broncs and compete in the Western Athletic 
Conference.[3] A member of the Western Athletic Conference, UTRGV sponsors 
teams in eight men's and eight women's NCAA sanctioned sports:[4] Men's 
Intercollegiate Sports Women's Intercollegiate Sports UTPA, then Pan American 
College, won the 1963 NAIA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament under 
Coach Sam Williams. Lucious Jackson a/k/a Luscious "Luke" Jackson was one 
of the players on that championship team. Jackson was selected 4th overall 
during the 1964 NBA draft. He was selected to the 1964–65 NBA All-Rookie 
Team and played in the NBA All-Star Game that same year. He played his 
entire career with the Philadelphia 76ers. The basketball program, during 
the mid-1970s was coached by Abe Lemons. Under Lemons, the program had 
very successful seasons but, lamentably, failed to get invited to any NCAA 
tournaments. Coach Lemons was later hired away by the University of Texas 
at Austin. Upon Lemons' departure to the University of Texas at Austin, 
Bill White was named the head basketball coach. While at Pan American, 
Coach White led the Broncs to their first post-season tournament play at 
the Division I level. During the 1980–81 season, Pan American earned a 
berth to the 1981 National Invitation Tournament. The Broncs lost to the 
1981 NIT champs, the University of Tulsa Golden Hurricane. The basketball 
program was also later coached by Lon Kruger, who later went on to coach 
at Kansas State, Florida, Illinois, UNLV, and Oklahoma. He also coached 
the Atlanta Hawks of the NBA. The UTPA baseball squad placed 4th in the 
1971 College World Series under Coach Al Ogletree. The UTPA Tennis program 
won several doubles NAIA championships from 1959 through 1962 under Coach 
Don Russell, who himself captured several championships while playing and 
coaching the team. After becoming a four-year college in 1952, the Broncs 
were members of the NAIA until the 1962-63 season. The Broncs were an independent 
in the first year of NAIA membership. From the 1953-54 season to the 1961-62 
season, the teams were members of the Big State Conference. In 1962-63, 
the team had a dual membership in the NAIA and NCAA Division II. The Broncs 
began transitioning to NCAA Division I in 1965-66 with the tennis team. 
The men's basketball began its transition in 1968-69. Broncs men's basketball 
participated as an Independent until the 1979-80 season when the team was 
a member of the Trans-America Athletic Conference and returned to independent 
status until 1986-87. UTPA joined the American South Conference as a charter 
member in 1987 and remained a member until the American South Conference 
merged with the Sun Belt Conference in 1991. The Broncs left the Sun Belt 
Conference at the end of the 1997-98 season and returned to independent 
status.[8] In 2008 it was announced that the Broncs would be charter members 
of the previously football-only Great West Conference when it began all-sports 
play in 2008. During the fall of 2008, the UTPA Cross Country team was 
the first to win a Great West Conference team title.[9] UTPA exited Great 
West Conference after the 2012–2013 season. The UTPA Broncs were one of 
the newest members of the Western Athletic Conference (WAC). Women's soccer 
returned to the athletic program in 2014, and men's soccer started in 2015.
