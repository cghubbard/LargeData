The Chicago White Sox are an American professional baseball team based 
in Chicago, Illinois. The White Sox compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) 
as a member club of the American League (AL) Central division. The White 
Sox play their home games at Guaranteed Rate Field, located on the city's 
South Side. They are one of two major league clubs in Chicago; the other 
is the Chicago Cubs, who are a member of the National League (NL) Central 
division. The team is currently owned by Jerry Reinsdorf. One of the American 
League's eight charter franchises, the Chicago team was established as 
a major league baseball club in 1900. The club was originally called the 
Chicago White Stockings, but this was soon shortened to Chicago White Sox. 
The team played home games at South Side Park before, in 1910, moving to 
Comiskey Park for the next eight decades. The White Sox won the 1906 World 
Series with a defense-oriented team dubbed "the Hitless Wonders", and the 
1917 World Series led by Eddie Cicotte, Eddie Collins, and Shoeless Joe 
Jackson. The 1919 World Series was marred by the Black Sox Scandal, in 
which several members of the White Sox were accused of conspiring with 
gamblers to fix games. In response, Major League Baseball's new Commissioner 
Kenesaw Mountain Landis banned the players from Major League Baseball for 
life. In 1959, led by Early Wynn, Nellie Fox, Luis Aparicio and manager 
Al Lopez, the White Sox won the American League pennant. They won the AL 
pennant in 2005, and went on to win the World Series. The White Sox originated 
as the Sioux City Cornhuskers of the Western League, a minor league under 
the parameters of the National Agreement with the National League. In 1894, 
Charles Comiskey bought the Cornhuskers and moved them to St. Paul, Minnesota, 
where they became the St. Paul Saints. In 1900, with the approval of Western 
League president Ban Johnson, Charles Comiskey moved the Saints into his 
hometown neighborhood of Armour Square, Chicago, where they became known 
as the White Stockings, the former name of Chicago's National League team, 
the Orphans (now the Chicago Cubs).[1] In 1901, the Western League broke 
the National Agreement and became the new major league American League. 
The very first season in the American League ended with a White Stockings 
championship.[2] However, that would be the end of the season as the World 
Series did not begin until 1903.[3] The franchise, now known as the Chicago 
White Sox, made its first World Series appearance in 1906, beating the 
crosstown Cubs in six games.[4] The White Sox would win a third pennant 
and second World Series in 1917, beating the New York Giants in six games 
with help from stars Eddie Cicotte and "Shoeless" Joe Jackson.[5] The Sox 
were heavily favored in the 1919 World Series, but lost to the Cincinnati 
Reds in 8 games. Huge bets on the Reds fueled speculation that the series 
had been fixed. A criminal investigation went on in the 1920 season, and 
though all players were acquitted, commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis 
banned six of the White Sox players for life, in what was known as the 
Black Sox Scandal.[6] This set the franchise back, as they did not win 
another pennant for 40 years. The White Sox did not finish in the upper 
half of the American League again until after club founder Charles Comiskey 
died and passed ownership of the club to his son, J. Louis Comiskey.[7] 
They finished in the upper half most years between 1936–1946 under the 
leadership of manager Jimmy Dykes, with star shortstop Luke Appling, known 
as Ol' Aches and Pains, and pitcher Ted Lyons. Appling and Lyons have their 
numbers 4 and 16 retired.[8] After J. Louis Comiskey died in 1939, ownership 
of the club was passed down to his widow, Grace Comiskey. The club was 
later passed down to Grace's children Dorothy and Chuck in 1956, with Dorothy 
selling a majority share to a group led by Bill Veeck after the 1958 season.[9] 
Veeck was notorious for his promotional stunts, attracting fans to Comiskey 
Park with the new "exploding scoreboard" and outfield shower. In 1961, 
Arthur Allyn, Jr. briefly owned the club before selling to his brother 
John Allyn. From 1951–1967, the White Sox had their longest period of sustained 
success, scoring a winning record for 17 straight seasons. Known as the 
"Go-Go White Sox" for their tendency to focus on speed and getting on base 
versus power hitting, they featured stars such as Minnie Miñoso,[10] Nellie 
Fox,[11] Luis Aparicio,[12] Billy Pierce,[13] and Sherm Lollar.[14] From 
1957–1965, the Sox were managed by Al Lopez. The Sox finished in the upper 
half of the American League in eight of his nine seasons, including six 
years in the top two of the league.[15] In 1959, the White Sox ended the 
New York Yankees dominance over the American League, and won their first 
pennant since the ill-fated 1919 campaign.[16] Despite winning game one 
of the 1959 World Series 11-0, they fell to the Los Angeles Dodgers in 
six games.[17] The late 1960s and 70s were a tumultuous time for the Sox, 
as they struggled to win games and attract fans. Allyn and Bud Selig agreed 
to a handshake deal that would give Selig control of the club and move 
them to Milwaukee; however, this was blocked by the American League.[18] 
Selig instead bought the Seattle Pilots and moved them to Milwaukee, putting 
enormous pressure on the American League to place a team in Seattle. A 
plan was in place for the Sox to move to Seattle and for Charlie Finley 
to move his Oakland A's to Chicago. However, Chicago had a renewed interest 
in the Sox after the 1972 season, and the American League instead added 
the expansion Seattle Mariners. The 1972 White Sox were one of the lone 
successful season of this era, as Dick Allen wound up winning the American 
League MVP award.[19] Some have said that Dick Allen is responsible for 
saving the White Sox in Chicago. Bill Veeck returned as owner of the Sox 
in 1975, and despite not having much money, they managed to win 90 games 
in 1977, a team known as the South Side Hitmen. However, the team's fortunes 
plummeted after the 1977 season, plagued by 90-loss teams and scarred by 
the notorious Disco Demolition Night promotion in 1979.[20] Bill Veeck 
was forced to sell the team. He rejected offers from ownership groups intent 
on moving the club to Denver, eventually agreeing to sell the club to Ed 
DeBartolo, who was the only prospective owner who promised to keep the 
Sox in Chicago. However, DeBartolo was rejected by the owners, and the 
club was then sold to a group headed by Jerry Reinsdorf and Eddie Einhorn. 
The Reinsdorf era started off well, as the Sox won their first division 
title in 1983, led by manager Tony La Russa[21] and stars Carlton Fisk, 
Tom Paciorek, Ron Kittle, Harold Baines, and LaMarr Hoyt.[22] During the 
1986 season, La Russa was fired by announcer-turned-GM Ken Harrelson. La 
Russa went on to manage in six World Series (winning 3) with the Oakland 
A's and St. Louis Cardinals, ending up in the Hall of Fame as the third-winningest 
manager of all time.[23] The White Sox struggled for the rest of the 1980s, 
as Chicago fought to keep the Sox in town. Reinsdorf wanted to replace 
the aging Comiskey Park, and sought public funds to do so. When talks stalled, 
there was a strong offer to move the team to the Tampa, Florida area.[24] 
Funding for a new ballpark was approved in an 11th hour deal by the Illinois 
State Legislature on June 30, 1988, with the stipulation that new park 
had to be built on the corner of 35th and Shields, across the street from 
the old ballpark, as opposed to the suburban ballpark the owners had designed.[18] 
Architects offered to redesign the ballpark to a more "retro" feel that 
would fit in the city blocks around Comiskey Park; however, the ownership 
group was set on a 1991 open date, and so they kept the old design.[25] 
In 1991, the new Comiskey Park opened. However, it would be rendered obsolete 
a year later with the opening of the retro-inspired Oriole Park at Camden 
Yards. The park, now known as Guaranteed Rate Field, underwent many renovations 
in the early 2000s to give it a more retro feel. The White Sox were fairly 
successful in the 1990s and early 2000s, with 12 winning seasons between 
1990–2005. First Baseman Frank Thomas became the face of the franchise, 
ending his career as the White Sox' all-time leader in runs, doubles, home 
runs, total bases and walks.[26] Other major players included Robin Ventura, 
Ozzie Guillén, Jack McDowell, and Bobby Thigpen.[27] The Sox would win 
the West division in 1993, and were in first place in 1994 when the season 
was cancelled due to the 1994 MLB Strike. In 2004, Ozzie Guillén was hired 
as manager of his former team.[28] After finishing second in 2004, the 
Sox won 99 games and the Central Division title in 2005 behind the work 
of stars Paul Konerko, Mark Buehrle, A. J. Pierzynski, Joe Crede, and Orlando 
Hernandez.[29] They started the playoffs by sweeping the defending champion 
Boston Red Sox in the ALDS, and then beat the Angels in 5 games to win 
their first pennant in 46 years, thanks to 4 complete games by the White 
Sox rotation.[30] The White Sox went on to sweep the Houston Astros in 
the 2005 World Series, giving the Sox their first World Championship in 
88 years.[31] Guillen had marginal success during the rest of his tenure, 
with the Sox winning the Central Division title in 2008 after a one game 
playoff with the Minnesota Twins.[32] However, Guillen left the White Sox 
after the 2011 season, and was replaced by former teammate Robin Ventura. 
The White Sox finished the 2015 season, their 115th in Chicago, with a 
76-86 record, a 3-game improvement over 2014.[33] Ventura is expected to 
return in 2016, with a young core featuring Jose Abreu, Adam Eaton, José 
Quintana, and Chris Sale.[34] The White Sox recorded their 9000th win in 
franchise history against the home team Detroit by the score of 3-2 on 
Monday, September 21, 2015. In the late 1980s, the franchise threatened 
to relocate to Tampa Bay (as did the San Francisco Giants), but frantic[35] 
lobbying on the part of the Illinois governor James R. Thompson and state 
legislature resulted in approval (by one vote) of public funding for a 
new stadium. Although designed primarily as a baseball stadium (as opposed 
to a "multipurpose" stadium) New Comiskey Park (redubbed U.S. Cellular 
Field in 2003 and Guaranteed Rate Field in 2016) was built in a 1960s style 
similar to Dodger Stadium and Kauffman Stadium. It opened in 1991 to positive 
reviews; many praised its wide open concourses, excellent sight lines, 
and natural grass (unlike other stadiums of the era such as Rogers Centre 
in Toronto). However, it was quickly overshadowed in the public imagination 
by the wave of "nostalgia" or "retro" ballparks, beginning with Oriole 
Park at Camden Yards. The park's inaugural season drew 2,934,154 fans — 
at the time, an all-time attendance record for any Chicago baseball team. 
Despite a number of innovations in its original construction — including 
a lower deck concourse that circumscribes the entire stadium, allowing 
a view of the game from any location — the park was often criticized for 
its sterile appearance and steep upper deck. In recent years, money accrued 
from the sale of naming rights to U.S. Cellular has been allocated for 
renovations to make the park more aesthetically appealing and fan friendly. 
Notable renovations of early phases included: re-orientation of the bullpens 
parallel to the field of play (thus decreasing slightly the formerly symmetrical 
dimensions of the outfield); filling seats in up to and shortening the 
outfield wall; ballooning foul-line seat sections out toward the field 
of play; creating a new multi-tiered batter's eye, allowing fans to see 
out through one-way screens from the center-field vantage point, and complete 
with concession stand and bar-style seating on its 'fan deck'; renovating 
all concourse areas with brick, historic murals, and new concession stand 
ornaments to establish a more friendly feel. The stadium's steel and concrete 
was repainted dark gray and black. The scoreboard Jumbotron was also replaced 
with a new Mitsubishi Diamondvision HDTV giant screen. More recently, the 
top quarter of the upper deck was removed in 2004 and a black wrought metal 
roof was placed over it, covering all but the first eight rows of seats. 
This decreased seating capacity from 47,098 to 40,615. 2005 also saw the 
introduction of the Scout Seats, redesignating (and re-upholstering) 200 
lower deck seats behind home plate as an exclusive area, with seat-side 
waitstaff and a complete restaurant located underneath the concourse. The 
most significant structural addition besides the new roof was 2005's FUNdamentals 
Deck, a multi-tiered structure on the left field concourse containing batting 
cages, a small Tee Ball field, speed pitch, and several other child-themed 
activities intended to entertain and educate young fans with the help of 
coaching staff from the Chicago Bulls/Sox Training Academy. This structure 
was used during the 2005 playoffs by ESPN and Fox Broadcasting Company 
as a broadcasting platform. Designed as a 7-phase plan, the renovations 
were completed before the 2007 season with the 7th and final phase. The 
most visible renovation in this final phase was replacing the original 
blue seats with green seats. The upper deck already had new green seats, 
put in before the beginning of the 2006 season. Beginning with the 2007 
season a new luxury seating section was added in the former press box. 
This section has amenities similar to those of the Scout Seats section. 
After the 2007 season the ballpark continued renovation projects despite 
that the 7-phase plan was complete. The St. Paul Saints first played their 
games at Lexington Park.[36] When they moved to Chicago's Armour Square 
neighborhood, they began play at the South Side Park. Previously a cricket 
ground, the park was located on the north side of 39th Street (now called 
Pershing Road) between South Wentworth and South Princeton Avenues.[37] 
Its massive dimensions yielded few home runs, which was to the advantage 
of the White Sox' Hitless Wonders teams of the early 20th century.[38] 
After the 1909 season, the Sox moved 5 blocks to the north to play in the 
new Comiskey Park, while the 39th Street grounds became the home of the 
Chicago American Giants. Billed as the Baseball Palace of the World, it 
originally held 28,000 seats and eventually grew to hold over 50,000.[39] 
It became known for its many odd features, such as the outdoor shower and 
the exploding scoreboard. When it closed after the 1990 season, it was 
the oldest ballpark still in Major League Baseball. The White Sox have 
held spring training in Excelsior Springs, Missouri (1901–1902); Mobile 
(1903); Marlin Springs, Texas (1904); New Orleans, Louisiana (1905–1906); 
Mexico City (1907); Los Angeles (1908); San Francisco (1909–1910); Mineral 
Wells, Texas (1911, 1916–1919); Waco, Texas (1912, 1920); Paso Robles, 
California (1913–1915); Waxahachie, Texas (1921); Seguin, Texas (1922–1923); 
Winter Haven, Florida. (1924); Shreveport, Louisiana (1925–1928); Dallas, 
Texas (1929); San Antonio, Texas (1930–1932); Pasadena, California (1933–1942, 
1946–1950); French Lick, Indiana (1943–1944); Terre Haute, Indiana (1945); 
Palm Springs, California (1951); El Centro, California (1952–1953); Tampa 
(1954–1959); and Sarasota (1960–1997). (1998–2007) the White Sox and Arizona 
Diamondbacks shared Tucson Electric Park in Tucson, Arizona for Spring 
Training in the Cactus League.[40] On November 19, 2007, the cities of 
Glendale, Arizona and Phoenix, Arizona broke ground on the Cactus League's 
newest Spring Training facility. Camelback Ranch, the $76 million two-team 
facility will be the new home of both the White Sox and the Los Angeles 
Dodgers for their Spring Training programs. Aside from state-of-the-art 
baseball facilities at the 10,000-seat stadium the location includes residential, 
restaurant and retail development, a 4-star hotel and 18-hole golf course. 
Other amenities include 118,000 sq ft (11,000 m2) of Major and minor league 
clubhouses for the two teams, four Major League practice fields and eight 
minor league practice fields, two practice infields and parking to accommodate 
5,000 vehicles.[41] Over the years the White Sox have become noted for 
many of their uniform innovations and changes. In 1960, the White Sox became 
the first team in the major sports to put players' last names on jerseys. 
In 1912 the White Sox debuted one of the most enduring and famous logos 
in baseball—a large "S" in a Roman-style font, with a small "O" inside 
the top loop of the "S" and a small "X" inside the bottom loop. This is 
the logo associated with the 1917 World Series championship team and the 
1919 Black Sox. With a couple of brief interruptions, the dark-blue logo 
with the large "S" lasted through 1938 (but continued in a modified block 
style into the 1940s). Through the 1940s, the White Sox team colors were 
primarily navy blue trimmed with red. The White Sox logo in the 1950s and 
1960s (actually beginning in the 1949 season) was the word "SOX" in an 
Old English font, diagonally arranged, with the "S" larger than the other 
two letters. From 1949 through 1963, the primary color was black (trimmed 
with red after 1951). The Old English "SOX" in black lettering is the logo 
associated with the Go-Go Sox era. In 1964, the primary color went back 
to navy blue, and the road uniforms changed from gray to pale blue. In 
1971, the team's primary color changed from royal blue to red, with the 
color of their pinstripes and caps changing to red. The 1971–1975 uniform 
included red socks. In 1976 the team's uniforms changed again. The team's 
primary color changed back from red to navy. The team based their uniforms 
on a style worn in the early days of the franchise, with white jerseys 
worn at home, blue on the road. The team brought back white socks for the 
last time in team history. The socks featured a different stripe pattern 
every year. The team also had the option to wear blue or white pants with 
either jersey. Additionally the teams "SOX" logo was changed to a modern-looking 
"SOX" in a bold font, with 'CHICAGO' written across the jersey. Finally, 
the team's logo featured a silhouette of a batter over the words "SOX". 
The new uniforms also featured collars and were designed to be worn untucked — 
both unprecedented. Yet by far the most unusual wrinkle was the option 
to wear shorts, which the White Sox did for the first game of a doubleheader 
against the Kansas City Royals in 1976. The Hollywood Stars of the Pacific 
Coast League had previously tried the same concept, it was also poorly 
received. Apart from aesthetic issues, as a practical matter shorts are 
not conducive to sliding, due to the likelihood of significant abrasions. 
Upon taking over the team in 1980 new owners Eddie Einhorn and Jerry Reinsdorf 
announced a contest where fans were invited to create new uniforms for 
the White Sox. The winning entry was submitted by a fan where the word 
"SOX" was written across the front of the jersey, in the same font as a 
cap, inside of a large blue stripe trimmed with red. The red and blue stripes 
were also on the sleeves, and the road jerseys were gray to the home whites. 
In those jerseys the White Sox won 99 games and the AL West championship 
in 1983, the best record in the majors. After five years those uniforms 
were retired and replaced with a more basic uniform which had "White Sox" 
written across the front in script, with "Chicago" on the front of the 
road jersey. The cap logo was also changed to a cursive "C", although the 
batter logo was retained for several years. For a mid-season 1990 game 
at Comiskey Park the White Sox appeared once in a uniform based on that 
of the 1917 White Sox. The White Sox then switched their regular uniform 
style once more. In September, for the final series at Old Comiskey Park, 
the old English "SOX" logo (a slightly simplified version of the 1949–63 
logo) was restored, and the new uniform also had the black pinstripes restored. 
The team's primary color changed back to black, this time with silver trim. 
The team also introduced a new sock logo—a white silhouette of a sock centered 
inside a white outline of a baseball diamond—which appeared as a sleeve 
patch on the away and alternate uniforms until 2011 when the patch was 
switched with the primary logo on the away uniform. With minor modifications 
(i.e., occasionally wearing vests, black game jerseys) the White Sox have 
used this style ever since. During the 2012 and 2013 seasons, the White 
Sox wore their throwback uniforms at home every Sunday, starting with the 
1972 red-pinstriped throwback jerseys worn during the 2012 season, followed 
by the 1981–86 uniforms the next season. In the 2014 season, the "Winning 
Ugly" throwbacks were promoted to full-time alternate status, and is now 
worn at home on select dates. In one game during the 2014 season, the White 
Sox paired their throwbacks with a cap featuring the batter logo instead 
of the wordmark "SOX"; this is currently their batting practice cap prior 
to games in the throwback uniforms. The White Sox were originally known 
as the White Stockings, a reference to the original name of the Chicago 
Cubs.[42] To fit the name in headlines, local newspapers such as the Chicago 
Tribune abbreviated the name alternatively to Stox and Sox.[43] Charles 
Comiskey would officially adopt the White Sox nickname in the club's first 
years, making them the first team to officially use the "Sox" name. The 
Chicago White Sox are most prominently nicknamed "the South Siders", based 
on their particular district within Chicago. Other nicknames include the 
synonymous "Pale Hose";[44] "the ChiSox", a combination of "Chicago" and 
"Sox", used mostly by the national media to differentiate them between 
the Boston Red Sox (BoSox); and "the Good Guys", a reference to the team's 
one-time motto "Good guys wear black", coined by broadcaster Ken Harrelson. 
Most fans and Chicago media refer to the team as simply "the Sox". The 
Spanish language media sometimes refer to the team as Medias Blancas for 
"White Socks." Several White Sox teams have received nicknames over the 
years: From 1961 until 1991, lifelong Chicago resident Andrew Rozdilsky 
performed as the unofficial yet popular mascot "Andy the Clown" for the 
White Sox at the original Comiskey Park. Known for his elongated "Come 
on you White Sox" battle cry, Andy got his start after a group of friends 
invited him to a Sox game in 1960, where he decided to wear his clown costume 
and entertain fans in his section. That response was so positive that when 
he won free 1961 season tickets, he decided to wear his costume to all 
games.[48] Comiskey Park ushers eventually offered free admission to Rozdilsky.[49] 
Starting in 1981, the new ownership group led by Jerry Reinsdorf introduced 
a twosome, called Ribbie and Roobarb, as the official team mascots, and 
banned Rozdilsky from performing in the lower seating level. Ribbie and 
Roobarb were very unpopular, as they were seen as an attempt to get rid 
of the beloved Andy the Clown.[50] In 1988, the Sox got rid of Ribbie and 
Roobarb, and Andy The Clown was not permitted to perform in new Comiskey 
Park when it opened in 1991. In the early 1990s the White Sox had a cartoon 
mascot named, 'Waldo The White Sox Wolf' that advertised the 'Silver and 
Black Pack', the team kid's club at the time. The team's current mascot, 
SouthPaw, was introduced in 2004 to attract young fans.[51] Nancy Faust 
became the White Sox organist in 1970, a position she would hold for 40 
years.[52] She was one of the first ballpark organists to play pop music, 
and became known for her songs playing on the names of opposing players 
(such as Iron Butterfly's "In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida" for Pete Incaviglia).[53] 
Her many years with the White Sox established her as one of the last great 
stadium organists. Since 2011, Lori Moreland has served as the White Sox 
organist.[54] Similar to the Boston Red Sox with "Sweet Caroline" (and 
two songs named "Tessie"), and the New York Yankees with "Theme from New 
York, New York", several songs have become associated with the White Sox 
over the years. They include: The Chicago Cubs are the crosstown rivals 
of the White Sox, a rivalry that some made fun of prior to the White Sox's 
2005 title because both of them had extremely long championship droughts. 
The nature of the rivalry is unique; with the exception of the 1906 World 
Series, in which the White Sox upset the favored Cubs, the teams never 
met in an official game until 1997, when interleague play was introduced. 
In the intervening time, the two teams sometimes met for exhibition games. 
The White Sox currently lead the regular season series 48–39, winning the 
last 4 seasons in a row. The BP Crosstown Cup was introduced in 2010 and 
the White Sox have won the trophy each time. There have been seven series 
sweeps since interleague play began: four by the Cubs in 1998, 2004, 2007, 
and 2008, and three by the White Sox in 1999, 2008 and 2012, with 1999 
and 2012 occurring in Wrigley Field. An example of this volatile rivalry 
is the game played between the White Sox and the Chicago Cubs at U.S. Cellular 
Field on May 20, 2006. White Sox catcher A. J. Pierzynski was running home 
on a sacrifice fly by center fielder Brian Anderson and smashed into Cubs 
catcher Michael Barrett, who was blocking home plate. Pierzynski lost his 
helmet in the collision, and slapped the plate as he rose. Barrett stopped 
him and, after exchanging a few words, punched Pierzynski in the face, 
causing a melee to ensue. Brian Anderson and Cubs first baseman John Mabry 
got involved in a separate confrontation, although it was later determined 
that Mabry was attempting to be a peacemaker. After 10 minutes of conferring 
following the fight, the umpires ejected Pierzynski, Barrett, Anderson, 
and Mabry. As Pierzynski entered his dugout, he pumped his arms, causing 
the soldout crowd at U.S. Cellular Field to erupt in cheers. When play 
resumed, White Sox second baseman Tadahito Iguchi blasted a grand slam 
to put the White Sox up 5–0 on their way to a 7–0 win over their crosstown 
rivals. While there are other major league cities and metropolitan areas 
in which two teams co-exist, all of the others feature at least one team 
which began playing there in 1961 or later, whereas the White Sox and Cubs 
have been competing for their city's fans since 1901. The White Sox enjoy 
healthy divisional rivalries. The Detroit Tigers are one of Chicago's primary 
rivals, and the cities of Chicago and Detroit share rivalries in other 
sports as well, such as the Bulls–Pistons rivalry, Blackhawks–Red Wings 
rivalry and the Bears–Lions rivalry. The rivalry has had its fair share 
of fights as well. The two teams are separated by a small under 5 hour 
drive. The Minnesota Twins are high-profile rivals as well, with fans of 
both teams showing up to US Cellular Field and Target Field in healthy 
numbers. The White Sox and Twins also played in a one-game playoff in 2008, 
the White Sox would win the game 1–0 and the division. Chicago has another 
rivalry with the Cleveland Indians. The rivalry first started upon the 
creation of the AL Central in 1994. On July 15, 1994 an umpire confiscated 
Albert Belle's bat, presuming that it was corked. They put it in the umpire's 
room at Comiskey Park. However, Indians pitcher Jason Grimsley climbed 
through the ceiling from the visitor's clubhouse and stole the bat. The 
theft was discovered and Belle was suspended; Grimsley later owned up to 
the theft. Belle further inflamed matters by spurning the Indians and signing 
a large free agent contract with the White Sox in 1997. A historical regional 
rival was the St. Louis Browns. Through the 1953 season, the two teams 
were located fairly close to each other (including the 1901 season when 
the Browns were the Milwaukee Brewers), and could have been seen as the 
American League equivalent of the Cardinals–Cubs rivalry, being that Chicago 
and St. Louis have for years been connected by the same highway (U.S. Route 
66 and now Interstate 55). The rivalry has been somewhat revived at times 
in the past, involving the Browns' current identity, the Baltimore Orioles, 
most notably in 1983. The current Milwaukee Brewers franchise was also 
a primary White Sox rival, due to the proximity of the two cities, and 
with the teams competing in the same division for the 1970 and 1971 seasons, 
and then again from 1994 to 1997. The rivalry died down however, when the 
Brewers moved to the National League in 1998. The White Sox did not sell 
exclusive rights for radio broadcasts from radio's inception until 1944, 
instead having local stations share rights for games.[57] The White Sox 
first granted exclusive rights in 1944, and would bounce between stations 
until 1952, when the White Sox started having all games broadcast on 1000 
AM WCFL.[58] Throughout this period of instability, one thing remained 
constant: the White Sox play-by-play announcer, Bob Elson. Known as the 
"Commander", Elson was the voice of the Sox from 1929 until his departure 
from the club in 1970.[59] In 1979, he was the recipient of the Ford Frick 
Award, and his profile is permanently on display in the National Baseball 
Hall of Fame. After the 1966 season, radio rights shifted from 1000 AM 
to 670 AM, WMAQ. An NBC owned & operated station, it was the home of the 
Sox until the 1996 season (with the exception of brief stints on 1300 AM 
WTAQ and 780 AM WBBM). After Elson's retirement in 1970, Harry Caray began 
his tenure as the voice of the White Sox, on radio as well as on television. 
Although best remembered as a broadcaster for the rival Cubs, Caray was 
very popular with White Sox fans, pining for a "cold one" during broadcasts.[60] 
Caray would often broadcast from the stands, sitting at a table set up 
amidst the bleachers. It became a badge of honor among Sox fans to "Buy 
Harry a beer..." By game's end you'd see a large stack of empty beer cups 
beside his microphone. This only endeared him to fans that much more. In 
fact, it was with the Sox that he started his tradition of leading the 
fans in the singing of Take Me Out To The Ballgame.[61] Caray, alongside 
color analyst Jimmy Piersall, was never afraid to criticize the Sox, which 
angered numerous Sox managers and players, notably Bill Melton and Chuck 
Tanner. He left to succeed Jack Brickhouse as the voice of the Cubs in 
1981, where he became a national icon. The White Sox shifted through several 
announcers in the 1980s, before hiring John Rooney as play-by-play announcer 
in 1989. In 1992, he was paired with color announcer Ed Farmer. In 14 seasons 
together, the duo became a highly celebrated announcing team, even being 
ranked by USA Today as the top broadcasting team in the American League.[62] 
Starting with Rooney and Farmer's fifth season together, Sox games returned 
to the 1000 AM frequency for the first time in 30 years (now the ESPN owned 
& operated station WMVP). The last game on WMVP was Game 4 of the 2005 
World Series, with the White Sox clinching their first World Series title 
in 88 years. That also was Rooney's last game with the Sox, as he left 
to join the radio broadcast team of the St. Louis Cardinals. In 2006, radio 
broadcasts returned to 670 AM, now the CBS-Owned all-sports station WSCR, 
branded as 670 the Score. Ed Farmer became the play-by-play man after Rooney 
left, joined in the booth by Chris Singleton from 2006–07 and then Steve 
Stone in 2008. In 2009, Darrin Jackson became the color announcer for White 
Sox radio, where he remains today.[63] Farmer and Jackson are joined by 
Chris Rogney, who hosts pregame and postgame shows on WSCR. The Chicago 
White Sox Radio Network currently has 18 affiliates in 3 states, and the 
White Sox are on contract with 670 the Score through the 2015 season.[64] 
As of recently, White Sox games are also broadcast in Spanish with play-by-play 
announcer Hector Molina joined in the booth by Billy Russo.[65] Formerly 
broadcasting on ESPN Deportes Radio via WNUA, games will begin to be broadcast 
on 1200 AM WRTO during the 2015 season.[66] Beginning with the 2016 season, 
the White Sox radio broadcasts will shift to 890 WLS AM. White Sox games 
appeared sporadically on television throughout the first half of the 20th 
century, most commonly announced by Jack Brickhouse on Channel 9, WGN-TV. 
Starting in 1968, Jack Drees took play-by-play duties as the Sox were broadcast 
on channel 32, WFLD.[67] After 1972, Harry Caray (joined by Jimmy Piersall 
in 1977) began double duty as a TV and Radio announcer for the Sox, as 
broadcasts were moved to channel 44, WSNS-TV, from 1972–1980, followed 
by one year on WGN-TV. Don Drysdale became the play-by-play announcer in 
1982, as the White Sox began splitting their broadcasts between WFLD and 
the new Pay-TV channel, Sportsvision. Ahead of its time, Sportsvision had 
a chance to gain huge profits for the Sox. However, few people would subscribe 
to the channel after being used to free-to-air broadcasts for many years, 
resulting in the franchise losing around $300,000 a month.[68] While this 
was going on, every Cubs game was on WGN, with Harry Caray becoming the 
national icon he never was with the White Sox. The relatively easy access 
to Cubs games versus Sox games in this era, combined with the popularity 
of Caray and the Cubs being owned by the Tribune Company, is said by some 
to be the main cause of the Cubs advantage in popularity over the Sox. 
Three major changes to White Sox broadcasting happened each year from 1989 
to 1991: in 1989, Sportsvision was replaced by the cable TV channel SportsChannel 
Chicago. In 1990, over-the-air broadcasts shifted back to WGN. And in 1991, 
Ken Harrelson became the play by play announcer of the White Sox.[69] One 
of the most polarizing figures in baseball, "Hawk" has been both adored 
and scorned for his emotive announcing style. His history of calling out 
umpires has earned him reprimands from the Commissioner's office, and he 
has been said to be the most biased announcer in baseball.[70] However, 
Harrelson has said that he is proud of being "the biggest homer in baseball", 
saying that he is a White Sox fan like his viewers.[71] Currently, White 
Sox local television broadcasts are split between three channels: the majority 
of games are broadcast on cable by the regional sports network Comcast 
SportsNet Chicago (which the club has a 20% stake in), and remaining games 
are produced by WGN Sports and are broadcast locally on either WGN-TV or 
WPWR-TV. WGN and WPWR games are also occasionally picked up by local stations 
in Illinois, Iowa, and Indiana. In the past, WGN games were broadcast nationally 
on the WGN America superstation, but those broadcasts ended after the 2014 
season as WGN America began its transition to a standard cable station.[72] 
WGN Sports-produced White Sox games not carried by WGN-TV were carried 
by WCIU-TV until the 2015 season, when they moved to MyNetworkTV station 
WPWR-TV.[73] The announcers are the same no matter where the games are 
broadcast: Harrelson provides play-by-play, and Steve Stone has provided 
color analysis since 2009.[74] Games that are broadcast on CSN Chicago 
feature pregame and postgame shows, hosted by Chuck Garfein with analysis 
from Bill Melton and occasionally Frank Thomas. In 2016 the team announced 
an official split of the play-by-play duties, with either Harrelson or 
Chuck Swirsky calling road games and Cubs home games and Jason Benetti 
calling home games.[75] Pitchers Catchers Infielders Outfielders Manager
