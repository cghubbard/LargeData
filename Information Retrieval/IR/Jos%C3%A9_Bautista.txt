José Antonio Bautista Santos[1] (born October 19, 1980) is a Dominican 
professional baseball right fielder who is a free agent. He has played 
in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Baltimore Orioles, Tampa Bay Devil 
Rays, Kansas City Royals, Pittsburgh Pirates and Toronto Blue Jays. His 
professional career began when the Pittsburgh Pirates selected him in the 
20th round of the 2000 first year player draft. In 2010, Bautista became 
the 26th member of the 50 home run club while leading the major leagues 
in home runs for the first of two consecutive seasons, and, from 2010–15, 
has hit more home runs than any player in the major leagues. An MLB All-Star 
selection six consecutive times, he has won three Silver Slugger Awards 
and two Hank Aaron Awards. In addition, he has received the American League 
Player of the Month Award five times and the Player of the Week four times. 
Before being traded to the Blue Jays, Bautista primarily played third base. 
Although major league scouts initially noted Bautista while in junior college 
for his batting skills – including power hitting potential – and a strong 
throwing arm, his career took detours until realizing his potential in 
2010. He made his MLB debut with the Baltimore Orioles in 2004, and, that 
year, became the first player ever to appear on five MLB rosters in one 
season. The last of those clubs were the Pirates, where he played at five 
different positions as a utility player[2] until being traded to the Blue 
Jays in 2008.[3] After making adjustments to his swing, Bautista broke 
through with ten home runs in September 2009. He has since been voted in 
the top ten in the AL Most Valuable Player Award four times and is a leader 
or among the top ten in numerous offensive single-season and career categories 
in Blue Jays' franchise history.[4] Since 2010, Bautista has hit at least 
20 home runs each year, and in four of those seasons, has hit at least 
35 home runs, has both scored and driven in at least 100 runs, and has 
drawn at least 100 bases on balls, including twice leading the AL. In 2015, 
while playing in the playoffs for the first time, his bat flip in the American 
League Division Series caused a sensation that became a symbol of Toronto's 
first playoff appearance in 22 years. In 2011, he set up a program that 
assists athletes from the Dominican Republic to attend universities in 
the United States. Coming from a middle-class family in the Dominican Republic 
that stressed education, Bautista began his study of English at age eight. 
His mother was an accountant and financial planner, and his father, who 
had earned a master's degree in agricultural engineering from Hungary, 
ran poultry farms. Bautista attended a private high school, De La Salle 
High School, in Santo Domingo. He was aided by the Latin Athletes Education 
Fund,[5] designed for players from Spanish-speaking countries aspiring 
to play college baseball in the United States. Although he invested much 
time in pursuing professional baseball, Bautista studied business at Mother 
and Teacher Pontifical Catholic University in case a career in baseball 
did not materialize.[6] After working out with various Major League Baseball 
(MLB) clubs, he turned down offers of $5,000 from the New York Yankees 
and $42,000 from the Arizona Diamondbacks. The Cincinnati Reds offered 
him $300,000, which Bautista accepted. However, before the contract could 
become official, the team changed ownership and subsequently rescinded 
the offer. Bautista then created a highlight tape of himself using a camcorder 
and sent it to various colleges in the United States. There was no response 
until he received a call from Oscar Pérez, who he had known from the Quique 
Cruz League, a league in the Dominican Republic. Pérez informed him of 
the Latin Athletes Education Fund, designed for players from Spanish-speaking 
countries aspiring to play college baseball in the United States. He connected 
Bautista with Don Odermann, a businessman in the San Francisco Bay Area. 
Odermann, who assisted baseball players from Latin America desiring to 
play baseball in the US, knew that Chipola College, a junior college in 
Marianna, Florida, was seeking an everyday player. There, Bautista played 
for two years until being drafted.[6][7] The Pittsburgh Pirates drafted 
José Bautista in the 20th round of the 2000 Major League Baseball draft 
from Chipola College. After playing in Minor League Baseball in the Pirates 
organization through 2003, the Baltimore Orioles selected him in the Rule 
5 draft and carried him on their Opening Day roster. He made his MLB debut 
with Baltimore on April 4, 2004. The Tampa Bay Devil Rays claimed him off 
waivers on June 3. Twenty-five days later, the Kansas City Royals purchased 
him from Tampa Bay. The Royals then traded him to the New York Mets on 
July 30 for Justin Huber, who then traded him minutes later to Pittsburgh 
with Ty Wigginton and minor leaguer Matt Peterson for Kris Benson and Jeff 
Keppinger.[8] This series of transactions made him the first and only player 
to appear on five different Major League rosters in one season.[9] Bautista 
played in 11 games for the Pirates in 2005. In 2006, his first full season 
in the major leagues, Bautista hit .235 with 16 home runs (HR) and 51 runs 
batted in (RBI). The following season in 2007, he posted similar numbers 
in 142 games, finishing the season with a batting average of .254, 15 home 
runs and 63 RBI. That same year, he became the starting third baseman for 
the Pittsburgh Pirates. He took over for reigning National League batting 
champion Freddy Sanchez, who moved to second base. Bautista was to be the 
Pirates' starting third baseman and backup outfielder in 2008. From June 
14 to 24, he hit five home runs in a span of nine games against interleague 
opponents Baltimore, Chicago White Sox, Toronto Blue Jays, and the New 
York Yankees. However, he struggled offensively for most of the year, and 
after the 2008 trade deadline Bautista lost his starting job to the newly 
acquired Andy LaRoche. Bautista was optioned to the Triple-A Indianapolis 
Indians on August 13. After performing well there, on August 21, the Pirates 
traded him to the Blue Jays for a player to be named later, who eventually 
was Robinzon Díaz.[9][10] Starting the 2009 season on the bench, manager 
Cito Gaston assigned Bautista to back up third baseman Scott Rolen and 
outfielders Alex Ríos and Adam Lind. Bautista started the season with a 
.317 batting average, .404 on-base percentage (OBP) and .463 slugging percentage 
(SLG) in 49 plate appearances in April. However, his numbers fell off, 
as he batted between .167 and .231 each month from May through August with 
two total home runs. At times he showed marked plate discipline; in the 
month of May, he walked 14 times for a .403 OBP despite batting just .231.[1] 
Eventually, the Chicago White Sox claimed Rios off waivers, the Blue Jays 
assigned Lind to the role of designated hitter, and an injury to Marco 
Scutaro led to an increase in Bautista's playing time and making him the 
leadoff hitter.[11][12] As the season drew to a close, the Blue Jays made 
changes to their coaching staff. One was to move first base coach Dwayne 
Murphy to replace the retiring Gene Tenace as hitting coach. Formerly a 
Blue Jays' minor league roving hitting instructor and hitting coach, Murphy 
had already spent nearly one year working with Bautista, teaching him to 
leverage his pull power by starting his swing with his now-familiar high 
leg kick.[9] In September, he finally broke through, hitting 10 home runs 
with 21 RBI, a .257 batting average and a .606 slugging percentage (SLG).[1] 
He hit 13 total HR in 2009 with 40 RBI, a batting average of .235, and 
79 hits in 113 games. Originally considered to be a non-tender candidate, 
he re-signed with the Blue Jays on a one-year $2.4 million US contract 
for the 2010 season.[13][14] Bautista began the 2010 campaign as the starting 
right fielder and leadoff hitter. On May 17, he was named AL Player of 
the Week after hitting .444 (8-for-18) with 20 total bases, four home runs, 
eight RBI, eight runs scored, a .565 OBP, and an MLB-best 1.111 SLG.[15] 
Bautista hit his 20th home run as part of a two-home run night against 
the St. Louis Cardinals on June 22, setting a new career high for a single 
season in just two months.[16] Bautista was selected as a reserve for the 
2010 Major League Baseball All-Star Game.[17] Bautista entered the game 
as a pinch runner for Josh Hamilton and finished the game 0–for-1.[18] 
For the month of July, Bautista batted .347, with 11 home runs, 29 RBI, 
and an AL-leading .765 slugging percentage, sharing American League Player 
of the Month honors with Twins outfielder Delmon Young.[19] Bautista was 
also named Blue Jays' Player of the Month, which is selected through voting 
by the Toronto chapter of the Baseball Writers' Association of America.[20][21] 
With his 12 home runs in May and 11 in July, Bautista became only the third 
Blue Jay player in franchise history to have two months with at least 10 
home runs.[20] Bautista was named co-winner of the American League Player 
of the Week award for the period ending August 1. Bautista hit .545 with 
five homers and 13 RBI during that span.[22] On August 26, Bautista hit 
his 100th career home run against the Detroit Tigers.[23] Bautista was 
again named player of the week for the week ending August 29; in seven 
games that week, Bautista led the American League with a .500 batting average 
(10-for-20) and hit four home runs.[24] Bautista became the only Blue Jays 
player to ever win the award three times in one season.[citation needed] 
Bautista won AL Player of the Month for the month of August, in which he 
hit he led the AL in home runs (12), RBI (24), slugging percentage (.724) 
and total bases (72), while tying for the lead in extra-base hits (18). 
He finished tied for second with 23 runs and was third with 23 walks.[25] 
He also won the Honda Player of the Month Award, his second such award 
in as many months.[26] On September 17, Bautista set the new Blue Jays 
single-season home run record with his 48th home run, breaking the record 
set by George Bell.[27] On September 23, Bautista became the 26th player 
in Major League Baseball history to reach the 50 home run club in one season, 
and the first Toronto Blue Jay player to do so.[28] His 52nd home run set 
a new MLB record for the largest single-season increase in home runs, eclipsing 
Davey Johnson's 38 home run increase from 1972 to 1973.[29] Bautista finished 
the 2010 season with an MLB-leading 54 home runs, the highest total since 
Alex Rodriguez hit 54 in 2007. Bautista won the AL Hank Aaron and a Silver 
Slugger Awards for his offensive performance.[30][31] and finished fourth 
in the AL Most Valuable Player Award (MVP) voting, behind Hamilton, Miguel 
Cabrera and Robinson Canó.[32] The Toronto chapter of the BBWAA named Bautista 
the Blue Jays' Most Valuable Player, the Blue Jays' Most Improved Player, 
and presented him the John Cerutti Award for displaying "goodwill, cooperation 
and character".[33] Bautista agreed to a five-year contract extension worth 
US$64 million before the 2011 season.[34] He began the season as the starting 
right fielder for the Blue Jays, with Edwin Encarnación playing third base.[35] 
Bautista walked 28 times in the month of April, breaking a club record 
that was set when Carlos Delgado collected 26 bases on balls in April 2001. 
Bautista was unanimously selected for the Blue Jays' Player of the Month 
award, and was also named the AL Player of the Month for the month of April 
(his third such award in four months, dating back to the 2010 season).[36][37] 
On May 15, Bautista hit three home runs against the Minnesota Twins, the 
first three-home run game of his career.[38] On May 28, in a home game 
against the Chicago White Sox, Bautista hit his 20th home run, a three-run 
shot to left field, becoming the first player to reach 20 home runs in 
2011 as well as the fastest player to reach 20 home runs (44 games) in 
Blue Jays franchise history.[39] Bautista won the AL Player of the Month 
award for May, his fourth such award in five months. He also became the 
first player to have the highest number of home runs in a single month 
for five consecutive months since Jimmie Foxx did so from June 1933 to 
April 1934.[40] Bautista also won the Blue Jays' Player of the Month award 
for the second consecutive month.[41] On June 23, the Blue Jays shifted 
Bautista to third base and recalled Eric Thames to play the outfield.[42] 
Bautista was selected for the 2011 MLB All-Star Game, receiving a record 
7,454,753 votes.[43] At the time of his selection, he led the MLB in home 
runs (26), walks (70), OBP (.471), slugging percentage (.679), OPS (1.150), 
times on base (160) and was also in second place for runs scored (64), 
total bases (182) and extra base hits (41). He became the first Blue Jay 
in history to lead the league in All-Star voting. He was also the first 
Blue Jay to be voted into the All-Star game as a starter since Carlos Delgado 
in 2003.[44] Bautista participated in the Home Run Derby; he hit four home 
runs and was eliminated in the first round.[45] On August 5, with the debut 
of prospect Brett Lawrie to play third base, Bautista returned to right 
field. In a game against the Oakland Athletics on August 20, Bautista walked 
three times, which brought his season total to 102 walks in 113 games, 
the fastest a player reached 100 walks since Barry Bonds in 2007.[46] During 
a game against the New York Yankees on September 5, Bautista hit his 40th 
home run of the season, a solo homer off reliever Rafael Soriano. He became 
the second player in franchise history with back-to-back 40 home run seasons.[47] 
Two games later on September 7, against the Boston Red Sox, Bautista stole 
home plate on a double steal in which Lawrie took second base, becoming 
the first 40 home run hitter to steal home plate since Adam Dunn in 2004.[48] 
After leading the major leagues in home runs for the second consecutive 
season with 43, Bautista became the first player to do so since Mark McGwire 
in 1998 and 1999.[49] Baustista also led the majors in slugging percentage 
(.608), OPS (1.056) and walks (132) and the AL in intentional walks (24). 
He placed second in OBP (.447)[50] behind Cabrera. He batted .302 and also 
placed in the top ten in the league in runs scored (105), total bases (312) 
and times on base (293). Defensively, he led AL right fielders with five 
double plays turned and placed fourth in assists with 13 and fifth with 
six errors.[50] His walk total was the highest in the league since Jason 
Giambi collected 137 in 2000,[51] while setting a new Blue Jays franchise 
record, which Delgado previously held with 123, also in 2000. He also set 
new Blue Jays' single-season records with 8.1 total Wins Above Replacement 
(WAR) and 8.3 offensive WAR according to Baseball-Reference.com, edging 
John Olerud's 7.7 total in 1993, and Delgado's 8.1 offensive WAR in 2000. 
Bautista held the record for total WAR until Josh Donaldson rated at 8.8 
in 2015; however, as of 2015, Bautista still holds the record for offensive 
WAR.[4] He was the American League winner of the Hank Aaron Award for the 
second consecutive season,[52] becoming just the third player in the award's 
history, after Rodriguez and Barry Bonds, to win the award in back-to-back 
years. Bautista also received his second consecutive Silver Slugger Award.[53] 
On January 30, Bautista was announced as the cover athlete for the Canadian 
edition of MLB 12: The Show.[54] In an interleague game against the Milwaukee 
Brewers on June 19, 2012, Bautista hit the second of three straight solo 
home runs by the Blue Jays, between Colby Rasmus and Edwin Encarnación, 
the first time since 2005 that the Jays went back-to-back-to-back with 
home runs.[55] Bautista also took over the MLB lead in home runs for 2012, 
hitting his 25th on June 27 against the Boston Red Sox, which broke the 
Blue Jays club record for home runs in a month, with 13. He went on to 
finish the month with 14 home runs, one short of the American League record 
for June.[citation needed] Bautista was voted an American League starter 
in the All-Star Game for the second consecutive year and his third overall 
All-Star selection. Hamilton surpassed Bautista's record vote total of 
the prior year.[56] On July 2, Bautista was named American League Player 
of the Month for June. It was his fifth time receiving the honor in his 
career. He batted .274 with 14 home runs and 30 RBI in the month of June. 
His 14 home runs in June set a new Blue Jays franchise record for home 
runs in a month.[57] Bautista competed in the Home Run Derby. At the time 
of his selection, he led all major league players with 26 home runs.[58] 
Bautista finished second to Prince Fielder.[59] Bautista was placed on 
the 15-day disabled list on July 17 with inflammation in his wrist.[60] 
He had started in all previous 90 games, and the Blue Jays called up prospect 
Anthony Gose to take his place after the game.[60] Bautista was activated 
on August 24, but returned to the disabled list on August 26 after he re-aggravated 
the injury to his left wrist. On August 28, the Jays announced that he 
would undergo season-ending surgery on the wrist.[61][62] In 2012, Bautista 
batted .241 with 27 home runs and 65 RBI in 92 games.[1] On January 21, 
2013, it was announced that Bautista would once again be the cover athlete 
of the Canadian edition of MLB 13: The Show.[63] Bautista hit his 200th 
career home run in a game against the Boston Red Sox on June 29. On July 
6, he was elected to his fourth consecutive All-Star Game, and his third 
as the starting right fielder for the American League. At the time of his 
selection, he batted .264 with 20 HR and 52 RBI.[64] In the All-Star Game, 
he recorded the game-winning RBI on a sacrifice fly in the fourth inning 
as the American League won 3–0.[65] Playing against the Oakland Athletics 
on July 30, Bautista hit his 25th home run of the season. In doing so, 
he became the fourth player in Blue Jays franchise history to hit at least 
25 home runs in four consecutive seasons, joining Bell (1984–1987), Carter 
(1991–1996), and Delgado (1996–2004).[66] His season ended prematurely 
for the second consecutive time on September 4, when it was announced that 
he would be shutdown with a left hip bone bruise. Bautista finished 2013 
with a .259 batting average, 28 home runs, and 73 RBI.[67] Bautista opened 
the 2014 season with a streak of 37 games in which he reached base safely. 
His streak, the longest to open a season in Blue Jays franchise history, 
came to an end on May 11, when he went 0–4.[68] On June 18, he recorded 
his 1,000 career hit in a game against the New York Yankees.[69] Bautista 
was named as the American League Captain for the 2014 Major League Baseball 
Home Run Derby on June 23.[70] On July 6, it was announced that not only 
was he elected to his fifth consecutive All-Star Game, but, for the second 
time, received the highest number of votes in the Majors, with 5,859,019.[71] 
On August 10, Bautista ended the longest game in franchise history by hitting 
an opposite field single to drive in Munenori Kawasaki in the 19th inning, 
and give the Jays the 6–5 win over the Detroit Tigers.[72] On August 26, 
Bautista hit his 25th home run of the season, and in doing so, joined Carter 
and Delgado as the only Blue Jays players in franchise history to hit at 
least 25 in five or more consecutive seasons.[73] Four days later, Bautista 
hit his 100th career home run at Rogers Centre, a two-run shot off Yankees 
starter Michael Pineda, and his fourth straight game with a home run which 
tied a career-high.[74] He would go on to hit a home run on August 31, 
extending his home run streak to five games and establishing a new career-high.[75] 
In a home game against the Chicago Cubs on September 8, Bautista hit his 
200th home run as a Blue Jay, joining Bell, Delgado, Carter, and Vernon 
Wells as the only players with 200 or more home runs in franchise history.[76] 
Bautista finished 2014 with a .286 batting average, 35 home runs, and 103 
RBI. He won his third Silver Slugger Award for his efforts. In early 2015, 
Bautista earned 10-and-5 rights by having at least 10 years of service 
time in the big-leagues, with the last 5 being on the same team. These 
rights give Bautista the ability to veto any trade he would be involved 
in.[77] In a home game against the Orioles on April 21, Bautista hit his 
250th career home run.[78] He injured his right shoulder during that game, 
attempting to throw out Delmon Young at first base. He was held out of 
the lineup for several days before returning, exclusively as the designated 
hitter. Bautista received a cortisone shot on May 24 and returned to the 
outfield on June 2, against the Washington Nationals.[79] On July 6, Bautista 
was named to his sixth-consecutive All-Star team, as a reserve outfielder 
in Cincinnati.[80] However, on July 11 it was announced that he would sit 
out the game due to a shoulder injury.[81] Bautista tied Vernon Wells for 
second place on the Blue Jays' all-time home run list on July 21, when 
he hit his 223rd home run for Toronto in a 7–1 win over the Athletics.[82] 
He surpassed Wells on July 24 in a 5–2 loss to the Seattle Mariners.[83] 
On September 30, Bautista surpassed the 40 home run mark for the third 
time in his career, hitting a solo shot in the ninth inning against the 
Baltimore Orioles to extend the Blue Jays lead to 11–1. The Blue Jays would 
win the game, 15–2, and clinch the American League East.[84] Bautista finished 
the 2015 regular season with a .250 batting average, 40 home runs, and 
114 RBI. He also walked more than he struck out for the second consecutive 
year, totaling 110 walks to 106 strikeouts. From 2010–15, he batted .268 
with 153 doubles, 227 home runs, 582 RBI, 574 BB, 576 SO, .390 OBP, .555 
SLG, .945 OPS, and 156 OPS+.[1] In that span, he hit home runs than any 
other major leaguer – 28 ahead of second-place Miguel Cabrera[85] – was 
second in slugging percentage[86] and walks,[87] third in OPS[88] and OPS+[89] 
and fifth in OBP.[90] On October 8, 2015, with just over 1,400 career games 
played, Bautista made his postseason debut against the Texas Rangers in 
the American League Division Series (ALDS). In the fifth and final game 
of the series on October 14, Bautista hit a three-run home run off Sam 
Dyson that gave the Jays a 6–3 lead that they would not relinquish, sending 
Toronto to the American League Championship Series (ALCS).[91] Bautista 
watched the home run and flipped his bat high into the air before running 
the bases, a celebratory gesture that was applauded by Jays fans and media 
outlets,[92] while drawing the ire of Rangers players as unsportsmanlike, 
in the midst of a 53-minute seventh inning laden with controversy.[93] 
A vital symbol of Toronto's first postseason appearance since 1993,[94] 
the bat flip was voted Esurance's MLB Award for Best Play on Offense for 
2015.[95] In the five games of the ALDS, Bautista batted .273 with two 
home runs and five RBI.[1] In Game 3 of the ALCS against the Kansas City 
Royals, Bautista had one hit and two walks, joining Keith Hernandez as 
the only players in MLB postseason history to reach base three times on 
their birthday. The Blue Jays would win the game, 11–8.[96] In Game 6, 
Bautista hit two home runs, including a two-run game-tying homer at the 
top of the eighth inning to tie the game at 3–3; however Kansas City would 
win 4–3 to take the pennant.[97] On November 3, 2015, Toronto exercised 
Bautista's $14 million option for 2016.[98] During his final regular season 
plate appearance against the Texas Rangers on May 15, 2016, Bautista was 
hit by a pitch from Matt Bush, which many believed to be retaliation by 
the Rangers organization for Bautista's bat flip in the 2015 ALDS. Two 
batters later, Bautista, intending to break-up a double play, made an illegal 
slide into second base and made contact with Rougned Odor. Odor retaliated 
by shoving Bautista and punching him in the face, which ignited a bench-clearing 
brawl.[99] Bautista was handed a one-game suspension by the league for 
his part in the melee, which he appealed.[100] On May 27, MLB announced 
that they had upheld the suspension.[101] During the day of his suspension, 
Bautista served as the public address announcer at Rogers Centre.[102] 
On June 17, 2016, he was placed on the 15-day disabled list due to an injury 
to his left big toe.[103] He returned from the disabled list near the end 
of July. On August 2, Bautista hit his 300th career home run, a solo shot 
off Houston Astros starter Lance McCullers Jr..[104] On November 7, the 
Blue Jays extended a $17.2 million qualifying offer to Bautista.[105] Bautista's 
nickname is "Joey Bats".[92] Bautista and his girlfriend Neisha Croyle 
had their first daughter together, Estela, born April 2011.[106][107] His 
second daughter, Ava, was born in November 2012.[108] In 2011 Bautista 
set up a program to aid athletes to have the same opportunity he had to 
attend American universities. Initially focused on the Dominican Republic,
