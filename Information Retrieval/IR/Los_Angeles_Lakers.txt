The Los Angeles Lakers are an American professional basketball team based 
in Los Angeles. The Lakers compete in the National Basketball Association 
(NBA), as a member club of the league's Western Conference Pacific Division. 
The Lakers play their home games at Staples Center, an arena shared with 
the NBA's Los Angeles Clippers, the Los Angeles Sparks of the Women's National 
Basketball Association, and the Los Angeles Kings of the National Hockey 
League.[4] The Lakers are one of the most successful teams in the history 
of the NBA, and have won 16 NBA championships, their last being in 2010. 
As of 2015, the Lakers are the second most valuable franchise in the NBA 
according to Forbes, having an estimated value of $2.7 billion.[5] The 
franchise began with the 1947 purchase of a disbanded team, the Detroit 
Gems of the National Basketball League (NBL). The new team began playing 
in Minneapolis, calling themselves the Minneapolis Lakers in honor of the 
state's nickname, "Land of 10,000 Lakes".[6] Initially a member of the 
NBL, the Lakers won the 1948 NBL championship before joining the rival 
Basketball Association of America and winning five of the next six BAA 
and NBA championships in Minneapolis after the NBA formed in 1949. The 
team was propelled by center George Mikan, who is described by the NBA's 
official website as the league's "first superstar".[7] After struggling 
financially in the late 1950s following Mikan's retirement, they relocated 
to Los Angeles before the 1960–61 season. Led by Hall of Famers Elgin Baylor 
and Jerry West, Los Angeles made the NBA Finals six times in the 1960s, 
but lost each series to the Boston Celtics, beginning their long and storied 
rivalry. In 1968, the Lakers acquired four-time NBA Most Valuable Player 
(MVP) Wilt Chamberlain to play center, and after losing in the Finals in 
1969 and 1970, they won their sixth NBA title—and first in Los Angeles—in 
1972, led by new head coach Bill Sharman. After the retirement of West 
and Chamberlain, the team acquired another center, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, 
who had won multiple MVP awards, but was unable to make the Finals in the 
late 1970s. The 1980s Lakers were nicknamed "Showtime" due to their Magic 
Johnson-led fast break-offense, and won five championships in a 9-year 
span, including their first ever Finals championship against the Celtics 
in 1985. This team featured Hall of Famers in Johnson, Abdul-Jabbar, and 
James Worthy, and a Hall of Fame coach, Pat Riley. After Abdul-Jabbar and 
Johnson's retirement, the team struggled in the early 1990s before acquiring 
Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant in 1996. Led by O'Neal, Bryant, and another 
Hall of Fame coach, Phil Jackson, Los Angeles won three consecutive titles 
between 2000 to 2002, securing the franchise its second "three-peat". After 
losing both the 2004 and 2008 NBA Finals, the Lakers won two more championships 
by defeating the Orlando Magic in 2009 and Boston in 2010. The Lakers hold 
the record for NBA's longest winning streak, 33 straight games, set during 
the 1971–72 season.[8] 21 Hall of Famers have played for Los Angeles, while 
four have coached the team. Four Lakers—Abdul-Jabbar, Johnson, O'Neal, 
and Bryant—have won the NBA MVP Award for a total of eight awards.[9] The 
Lakers' franchise began in 1947 when Ben Berger and Morris Chalfen of Minnesota 
purchased the recently disbanded Detroit Gems[10] of the National Basketball 
League (NBL) for $15,000 from Gems owner Maury Winston.[11] Minneapolis 
sportswriter Sid Hartman played a key behind the scenes role in helping 
put together the deal and later the team.[12] Inspired by Minnesota's nickname, 
"Land of 10,000 Lakes", the team christened themselves the Lakers.[6][13] 
Hartman helped them hire John Kundla from College of St. Thomas, to be 
their first head coach, by meeting with him and selling him on the team.[14][15] 
The Lakers had a solid roster which featured forward Jim Pollard, playmaker 
Herm Schaefer, and center George Mikan, who became the most dominant player 
in the NBL.[16] In their first season, they led the league with a 43–17 
record.[17] In 1948, the Lakers moved from the NBL to the Basketball Association 
of America (BAA), and Mikan's 28.3 point per game (ppg) scoring average 
set a BAA record. In the 1949 BAA Finals they won the championship, beating 
the Washington Capitols four games to two.[18] The following season, the 
team improved to 51–17, repeating as champions.[19] In the 1950–51 season, 
Mikan won his third straight scoring title at 28.4 ppg and the Lakers went 
44–24 to win their second straight division title.[20] One of those games, 
a 19–18 loss against the Fort Wayne Pistons, became infamous as the lowest 
scoring game in NBA history.[21] In the playoffs, they defeated the Indianapolis 
Olympians in three games but lost to the Rochester Royals in the next round.[16] 
During the 1951–52 season, the Lakers won 40 games, finishing second in 
their division.[22] They faced the New York Knicks in the NBA Finals, which 
they won in seven games.[23] In the 1952–53 season, Mikan led the NBA in 
rebounding, averaging 14.4 rebounds per game (rpg), and was named MVP of 
the 1953 NBA All-Star Game.[20] After a 48–22 regular season, the Lakers 
defeated the Fort Wayne Pistons in the Western playoffs to advance to the 
NBA Finals.[23] They then defeated the New York Knicks to win their second 
straight championship.[24] Though Lakers star George Mikan suffered from 
knee problems throughout the 1953–54 season, he was still able to average 
18 ppg.[25] Clyde Lovellette, who was drafted in 1952, helped the team 
win the Western Division.[25] The team won its third straight championship 
in the 1950s and fifth in six seasons when it defeated the Syracuse Nationals 
in seven games.[24] Following Mikan's retirement in the 1954 off-season, 
the Lakers struggled but still managed to win 40 games. Although they defeated 
the Rochester Royals in the first round of the playoffs, they were defeated 
by the Fort Wayne Pistons in the semifinals.[26] Although they had losing 
records the next two seasons, they made the playoffs each year.[22] Mikan 
came back for the last half of the 1955–56 season, but struggled and retired 
for good after the season.[27] Led by Lovellette's 20.6 points and 13.5 
rebounds, they advanced to the Conference Finals in 1956–57. The Lakers 
had one of the worst seasons in team history in 1957–58 when they won a 
league-low 19 games.[28] They had hired Mikan, who had been the team's 
general manager for the previous two seasons, as head coach to replace 
Kundla. Mikan was fired in January when the team was 9–30, and Kundla was 
rehired.[22][29] The Lakers earned the top pick in the 1958 NBA draft and 
used it to select Elgin Baylor. Baylor, who was named NBA Rookie of the 
Year and co-MVP of the 1959 NBA All-Star Game, averaged 24.9 ppg and 15.0 rpg 
helping the Lakers improve to second in their division despite a 33–39 
record.[30] After upsetting the Hawks in six games in the division finals, 
they returned to the NBA Finals, but were swept by the Celtics, beginning 
their long rivalry.[31] In their last year in Minneapolis, the Lakers went 
25–50. On January 18, 1960, the team was coming off a loss and traveling 
to St. Louis when their plane crash-landed.[34] Snow storms had driven 
the pilot 150 miles off course when he was forced to land in a cornfield. 
No one was hurt.[35] Their record earned them the number two pick in the 
1960 NBA draft. The team selected Jerry West from West Virginia University.[36] 
During the 1960 off-season, the Lakers became the NBA's first West Coast 
team when owner Bob Short decided to move the team to Los Angeles.[37] 
Led by Baylor's 34.8 ppg and 19.8 rpg, Los Angeles won 11 more than the 
year before in West's first season.[38] On November 15 that season, Baylor 
set a new NBA scoring record when he scored 71 points in a victory against 
the New York Knicks while grabbing 25 rebounds.[39] In doing so, Baylor 
broke his own NBA record of 64 points. Despite a losing record, the Lakers 
made the playoffs.[22] They came within two points of the NBA Finals when 
they lost in game seven of their second round series against St. Louis.[40] 
Led by Baylor and West at 38.3 and 30.8 ppg respectively,[41] the Lakers 
improved to 54–26 in 1961–62, and made the finals. In a game five victory, 
Baylor grabbed 22 rebounds and set the still-standing NBA record for points 
in a finals game with 61,[42] despite fouling out of the game.[43] The 
Lakers, however, lost to the Celtics by three points in overtime of game 
seven.[41] Frank Selvy, after making two jumpers in the final 40 seconds 
to tie the game,[44][45] missed a potential game-winning 18 foot jump shot 
in regulation, a miss which he said in June 2010 still haunted him more 
than 40 years later.[45] Los Angeles won 53 games in 1962–63, behind Baylor's 
34.0 ppg and West's 27.1 ppg[46] but lost in the NBA Finals in six games 
to the Celtics.[46] After falling to 42–38 and losing in the first round 
of the 1964 NBA Playoffs to the Hawks, the team won 49 games in 1964–65. 
The Lakers surged past the Baltimore Bullets in the division finals, behind 
West's record-setting 46.3 ppg in the series.[47] They lost again to Celtics 
in the Finals however, this time in five games.[48] Los Angeles lost in 
the finals to Boston in seven games again in 1966, this time by two points.[49] 
Down by 16 entering the fourth quarter, and 10 with a minute and a half 
to go, the Lakers mounted a furious rally in the closing moments which 
fell just short.[50] After dropping to 36 wins and losing in the first 
round of the 1967 NBA Playoffs, they lost in the finals to the Celtics 
again in 1968.[22] Los Angeles moved to a brand-new arena, The Forum, in 
1967, after playing seven seasons at the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena. 
On July 9, 1968, the team acquired Wilt Chamberlain from the Philadelphia 
76ers for Darrell Imhoff, Archie Clark, and Jerry Chambers.[52] In his 
first season as a Laker, Chamberlain set a team record by averaging a league-leading 
21.1 rpg.[53] West, Baylor, and Chamberlain each averaged over 20 points, 
and Los Angeles won their division.[54] The Lakers and Celtics again met 
in the finals, and Los Angeles had home court advantage against Boston 
for the first time in their rivalry. They won the first game behind Jerry 
West's 53 points,[55] and had a 3–2 lead after five.[56] Boston won the 
series in seven games however,[57] and earned their 11th NBA Championship 
in 13 seasons.[58] West was named the first-ever Finals MVP; this remains 
the only time that a member of the losing team has won the award.[59] In 
1970, West won his first scoring title at 31.2 ppg, the team returned to 
the finals, and for the first time in 16 years, they did not have to face 
the Celtics; instead playing the New York Knicks, who defeated them 4–3.[60][61] 
The next season the Lakers were defeated by the Milwaukee Bucks, led by 
future Laker Lew Alcindor (now known as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar) in the Western 
Conference Finals.[62] The 1971–72 season brought several changes. Owner 
Jack Kent Cooke brought in Bill Sharman as head coach,[63] and Elgin Baylor 
announced his retirement early in the season after realizing that his legs 
were not healthy enough.[63] Sharman increased the team's discipline.[64] 
He introduced the concept of the shootaround, where players would arrive 
at the arena early in the morning before a game to practice shots.[65] 
They won 14 straight games in November and all 16 games played in December.[63] 
They won three straight to open the year of 1972 but on January 9, the 
Milwaukee Bucks ended their winning streak by defeating the Lakers, 120–104.[66] 
By winning 33 straight games, Los Angeles set a record for longest winning 
streak of any team in American professional sports.[67] The Lakers won 
69 games that season, which stood as the NBA record for 24 years until 
the Chicago Bulls won 72 games in 1995–96.[68] Chamberlain averaged a career-low 
14.8 points but led the league in rebounding at 19.2 a game.[69] West's 
9.7 assists per game (apg) led the league, he also averaged more than 25 
points, and was named MVP of the 1972 NBA All-Star Game.[69] The team failed 
to score 100 points just once all year,[70] and at the end of the season, 
Bill Sharman was named Coach of the Year.[71] The Lakers went on to reach 
the finals against the New York Knicks where they would avenge their 1970 
finals loss by defeating them 4 games to 1. Chamberlain tallied 24 points 
and 29 rebounds in game five and won the NBA Finals Most Valuable Player 
Award.[72][73] The Lakers won 60 games in the 1972–73 NBA season, and took 
another Pacific Division title.[74] Wilt Chamberlain, playing in his final 
season, again led the league in rebounding and set the still standing NBA 
record for field-goal percentage at 72.7%.[74] The team defeated the Chicago 
Bulls in seven games in the conference semifinals, then the Golden State 
Warriors in five in the Western Division Finals.[74] They played the New 
York Knicks in the 1973 NBA Finals. Los Angeles took the first game by 
three points, but New York won the series in five games.[75] During the 
1973–74 season, the team was hampered by the loss of West, who played only 
31 games before his legs gave out.[76] Goodrich, averaging 25.3 points, 
helped the team to a late-season surge.[76] Trailing the Golden State Warriors 
by three games with seven left to play, the Lakers rallied to finish 47–35 
and win the Pacific Division.[76] They made the playoffs but managed just 
one win against Milwaukee in the conference semifinals. Following the season, 
West retired due to contract disagreements with Cooke, and filed a suit 
for unpaid back wages.[77] After missing the playoffs in the 1974–75 season, 
the Lakers acquired Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, who had won three league MVP's 
by that time.[78] Abdul-Jabbar wanted out of Milwaukee, demanding a trade 
to either New York or Los Angeles.[79] He was traded for Elmore Smith, 
Brian Winters, Junior Bridgeman, and Dave Meyers. Abdul-Jabbar had his 
fourth MVP season in 1975–76, leading the league in rebounding, blocked 
shots, and minutes played.[80] The Los Angeles struggled in January, going 
3–10, and finished out of the playoffs at 40–42.[80] West and Cooke settled 
their differences—and the former Laker's lawsuit—and Cooke hired him to 
replace Sharman as the team's coach.[81] West became upset, however, when 
Cooke refused to spend the money necessary to acquire forward Julius Erving, 
who the Nets were selling.[82] Behind another MVP season from Abdul-Jabbar, 
Los Angeles won the Pacific Division, finishing the 1976–77 season a league-best 
53–29.[83] They defeated the Warriors in a seven-game series to open the 
postseason before being swept by Portland in the Western Conference Finals.[80] 
During the offseason, Los Angeles picked up Jamaal Wilkes from Golden State 
and signed first-round draft pick Norm Nixon. In the first two minutes 
of the first game of the 1977–78 season, Abdul-Jabbar punched Bucks center 
Kent Benson for an overly aggressive elbow and broke his hand.[84] Two 
months later, a healthy Abdul-Jabbar got into an altercation with Houston 
Rockets center Kevin Kunnert after a rebound. The team's starting power 
forward, Kermit Washington, who was averaging 11.5 points and 11.2 rebounds,[85] 
entered the fight, and when Rudy Tomjanovich ran in from the bench to break 
up the action, Washington punched him in the face.[86] Tomjanovich nearly 
died from the punch, suffering a fractured skull and other facial injuries 
which prematurely ended his playing career.[87] Washington, who stated 
that he assumed Tomjanovich was a combatant, was suspended for two months 
by the NBA, and released by the Lakers.[88] The team won 45 games despite 
being down a starter in Washington and not having Abdul-Jabbar for nearly 
two months, but lost in the first round of the playoffs to Seattle.[89] 
During the 1978–79 season, the team posted a 47–35 record but lost to the 
SuperSonics in the semifinal round of the playoffs.[80] In the 1979 NBA 
draft, Los Angeles selected 6-foot, 9-inch point guard Magic Johnson from 
Michigan State with the first overall pick.[90] It took Johnson's teammates 
time to acclimate themselves to his passing ability, as his "no-look" passes 
often caught them unaware. Once they adjusted, his passing became a key 
part of Los Angeles' offense.[91] The Lakers won 60 games in Johnson's 
rookie year, and defeated the Philadelphia 76ers in six games in the 1980 
NBA Finals. Johnson won the series Finals MVP award, after starting at 
center for the injured Abdul-Jabbar in game six, and tallying 42 points, 
15 rebounds, and seven assists.[92] The team fell off in the 1980–81 season, 
though, as the Lakers lost Johnson for most of the season to a knee injury.[93] 
The team turned in a 54–28 record and finished second behind the Phoenix 
Suns in the Pacific Division.[93] The Rockets, led by Moses Malone, defeated 
Los Angeles in the first round of the playoffs.[93] Early in the 1981–82 
season, Johnson complained to the media about head coach Paul Westhead 
and demanded a trade.[94] Westhead was fired shortly after Johnson's criticisms, 
and although Lakers' owner Jerry Buss stated that Johnson's comments did 
not factor into the decision, Johnson was vilified by the national media 
and booed both on the road and at home.[95][96][97] Buss promoted assistant 
coach Pat Riley to "co-head coach" with Jerry West (although West considered 
himself Riley's assistant) on November 19 and the team won 17 of its next 
20 games.[93][98][99] Nicknamed "Showtime" due to the team's new Johnson-led 
fast break-offense, the Lakers won the Pacific Division title and swept 
both the Suns and Spurs.[100] Los Angeles stretched its postseason winning 
streak to nine games by taking the first contest of the NBA Finals from 
the 76ers.[93][101] The team won the Finals 4–2 to finish a 12–2 playoff 
run.[93] On draft night in 1982, the Lakers had the first overall pick 
and selected James Worthy from North Carolina.[102] The Lakers won the 
Pacific Division at 58–24, but Worthy suffered a leg injury in the last 
week of the season and missed the rest of the season however.[103] Nevertheless, 
they advanced to play Philadelphia in the 1983 NBA Finals by defeating 
Portland and San Antonio in the first two rounds.[103] The Sixers, however, 
won the series and the championship in four games.[102] After the season 
West replaced Sharman as the team's GM.[104] In the 1983–84 season Los 
Angeles went 54–28, and played Boston in the Finals for the first time 
since 1969.[105] They won two of the first three games. Kevin McHale's 
hard clothesline foul of Lakers forward Kurt Rambis on a fast break is 
credited as a turning point of the series.[106] Boston won three of the 
next four to win the title and send Los Angeles's record to 0–8 in Finals 
series against the Celtics.[105] Using the past year's Finals defeat as 
motivation, the team won the Pacific Division for the fourth straight year 
and lost just twice in the Western Conference playoffs. In the NBA Finals, 
the Celtics were again the Lakers' final hurdle. Los Angeles lost game 
one of the NBA Finals by a score of 148–114, in what is remembered as the 
"Memorial Day Massacre".[107] The Lakers, behind 38-year-old Finals MVP 
Abdul-Jabbar, recovered to defeat the Celtics in six games.[108] The team 
won the title in the Boston Garden, becoming the only visiting team to 
ever win an NBA championship there.[107] In the 1985–86 season, the Lakers 
started 24–3. They won 62 games, and their fifth straight division title.[110] 
The Rockets, however, defeated the Lakers in five games in the Western 
Conference Finals. Houston won the series when Ralph Sampson hit a 20-foot 
jumper as time expired in game five at The Forum.[110] Prior to the 1986–87 
season, the Lakers moved A. C. Green into the starting lineup, and acquired 
Mychal Thompson from the Spurs.[111] Johnson won his first career MVP Award 
while leading the Lakers to a 65–17 record,[111] and Michael Cooper was 
named NBA Defensive Player of the Year.[111] Before the season Riley had 
made the decision to shift the focus of the offense to Johnson over the 
40-year-old Abdul-Jabbar.[112] The Lakers advanced to the NBA Finals by 
sweeping the Nuggets, defeating the Warriors in five games, and sweeping 
the SuperSonics in the Western Conference Finals.[113] The Lakers defeated 
Boston in the first two games of the Finals, and the teams split the next 
four games, giving Los Angeles their second championship in three seasons.[111] 
The series was highlighted by Johnson's running "baby hook" shot to win 
game four at Boston Garden with two seconds remaining.[114] Johnson was 
named the NBA Finals MVP, in addition to regular-season MVP.[115] At the 
Lakers' championship celebration in Los Angeles, coach Riley brashly declared 
that Los Angeles would repeat as NBA champions,[111] which no team had 
done since the 1968–69 Boston Celtics. During the 1987–88 season, the Lakers 
took their seventh consecutive Pacific Division title, and met the Detroit 
Pistons in the 1988 NBA Finals. Los Angeles took the series in seven games, 
and James Worthy's game seven triple double earned him a Finals MVP award.[116] 
In the 1988–89 season, Los Angeles won 57 games. They swept the playoffs 
up till the NBA Finals, and faced the Detroit Pistons again.[117] The Lakers, 
hampered by injuries to Byron Scott and Johnson, were swept by Detroit.[118] 
On June 28, 1989, after 20 professional seasons, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar announced 
his retirement. A year later, 1987 Defensive Player of the Year winner 
Michael Cooper decided to play in Europe and was waived at his request.[119] 
The Lakers went 63–19 in the 1989–90 season, but lost 4–1 in the second 
round of the playoffs.[120] Riley left the team after the season citing 
burnout,[121] and was replaced by Mike Dunleavy.[122] Riley's departure 
received a mixed reaction from the players. They respected his contributions, 
but some, such as Worthy and Scott, had grown tired of his intense practices 
and felt he tried to take too much credit for the team's successes.[123] 
The team made another Finals appearance in 1991, but lost in five games 
to a Chicago Bulls team led by Michael Jordan.[124] On November 7, 1991, 
Magic Johnson announced he had tested positive for HIV and would retire 
immediately.[125] In their first season without Johnson, the team won 43 
games,[22] but became the first eighth seed to win the opening two games 
on the road against a number one seed when they took a 2–0 lead versus 
Phoenix.[126] They lost the next two games at home however, then game five 
in Phoenix in overtime.[126] Randy Pfund was let go as head coach in March 
1994 and eventually replaced by Johnson, who coached the club with former 
teammate Michael Cooper as his lead assistant.[127] Johnson decided not 
to take the job permanently due to what he felt was a lack of commitment 
from certain players, and Los Angeles ended the season with a 10-game losing 
streak to finish 33–49 and out of the playoffs.[128][129] The next two 
seasons, Los Angeles made the playoffs, but was eliminated in the second 
and first rounds respectively.[130][131] The team was coached by Del Harris 
and led by young guards Nick Van Exel and Eddie Jones.[132] Johnson came 
out of retirement in the 1995–96 season to lead the then 24–18 Lakers to 
a 29–11 finish.[133] After some run-ins with Van Exel, displeasure with 
Harris's strategies, and a first round loss to the Rockets, Johnson decided 
to retire for the final time after the season.[134] During the 1996 off-season, 
the Lakers acquired 17-year-old Kobe Bryant from the Charlotte Hornets 
for Vlade Divac; Bryant was drafted 13th overall out of Lower Merion High 
School in Ardmore, Pennsylvania in that year's draft, by Charlotte. Los 
Angeles also signed free-agent Shaquille O'Neal.[135] Trading for Bryant 
was West's idea, and he was influential in the team's signing of the all-star 
center.[136] "Jerry West is the reason I came to the Lakers", O'Neal later 
said.[137] They used their 24th pick in the draft to select Derek Fisher.[138] 
During the season, the team traded Cedric Ceballos to Phoenix for Robert 
Horry.[139] O'Neal led the team to a 56–26 record, their best effort since 
1990–91, despite missing 31 games due to a knee injury.[140] O'Neal averaged 
26.2 ppg and 12.5 rpg and finished third in the league in blocked shots 
(2.88 bpg) in 51 games.[140][141] The Lakers defeated the Portland Trail 
Blazers in the first round of the 1997 NBA Playoffs. O'Neal scored 46 points 
in Game 1 against the Trail Blazers, marking the highest single-game playoff 
scoring output by a Laker since Jerry West scored 53 against the Celtics 
in 1969.[140] In the next round, the Lakers lost four games to one to the 
Utah Jazz.[140] In the 1997–98 season, O'Neal and the Lakers had the best 
start in franchise history, 11–0.[142] O'Neal missed 20 games due to an 
abdominal injury.[142] Los Angeles battled Seattle for the Pacific Division 
title most of the season. In the final two months, the Lakers won 22 of 
their final 25 games,[142] finishing 61–21, and second to Seattle in the 
standings.[142] The Lakers defeated Portland three games to one in the 
first-round. The following round, they faced Seattle. Although the Sonics 
won the first game, the Lakers responded with four straight wins, taking 
the series,[142] but were swept by the Jazz in the next round.[142] During 
the 1998–99 season, All-Star guard Eddie Jones and center Elden Campbell 
were traded to the Charlotte Hornets.[143] The team also acquired J. R. 
Reid, B. J. Armstrong, and Glen Rice.[144] Harris was fired in February 
after a three-game losing streak and replaced on an interim basis by former 
Laker Kurt Rambis.[145] The team finished 31–19 in the shortened season, 
which was fourth in the Western Conference.[146] Los Angeles defeated Houston 
in the first round of the playoffs, but were swept by San Antonio in the 
next round with game 4 being the last game ever played at the Great Western 
Forum.[147] Before the 1999–2000 season, West was prepared to hire Rambis 
as the team's full-time coach before an outcry from fans and members of 
the organization caused him to seek out a bigger name.[148] Los Angeles 
hired former Chicago Bulls coach Phil Jackson, who had coached that team 
to six championships, and gave him a lucrative $6 million a year contract.[149] 
He brought along assistant Tex Winter and they installed Winter's version 
of the triangle offense.[150] They signed veterans Brian Shaw, John Salley, 
Ron Harper, and A. C. Green, who was a Laker during the "Showtime" era.[139] 
The team also moved to a new arena, the Staples Center.[151] After the 
season, starters Rice and Green left the team,[152] and Los Angeles signed 
Horace Grant.[153] Led by league MVP O'Neal, the Lakers won 31 of their 
first 36 games.[154] Los Angeles finished 67–15, their highest total since 
they won 65 in the 1986–87 season.[154] They eliminated the Sacramento 
Kings and Phoenix in the first two rounds of the playoffs.[155] After the 
Lakers took a three games to one lead in the Western Conference Finals, 
the Trail Blazers won the next two games to force a game seven.[156] The 
Lakers were down by 15 points in the fourth quarter but went on a 19–4 
run to tie the game.[156] They won 89–84 to advance to the NBA Finals.[156] 
They defeated Reggie Miller and the Indiana Pacers 4–2 in the 2000 NBA 
Finals to win their first title since 1988.[157] West retired from his 
spot in the team's front office after the season after a power struggle 
between him and Jackson over control of the team's operations.[158] The 
following season, Los Angeles won 11 fewer regular season games,[159] but 
swept the first three rounds of the playoffs, defeating the Portland, Sacramento, 
and San Antonio.[160] They met Allen Iverson and the Philadelphia 76ers 
in the 2001 NBA Finals. Although the Sixers took game one in overtime,[161] 
the Lakers won the next four games to win their second straight title. 
Their 15–1 postseason record is the best in NBA history.[162] Los Angeles 
won 58 games in 2001–02. In the playoffs, they swept the Portland Trail 
Blazers in the first round, and defeated the Spurs 4–1 in the second.[165] 
They faced the rival Kings in the Western Conference Finals. The series 
has long been cited as one of the greatest playoff matchups in NBA history. 
The series extended to all seven games, and ended in a Lakers victory.[166] 
In game 1, Bryant scored 30 points as the Lakers won, 106-99. The series 
would then shift in Sacramento's favor, with the Kings winning the next 
two games. Facing a 3-1 deficit in game 4, the Lakers had the ball with 
under 20 seconds to play. After misses by both Bryant and O'Neal, Kings 
center Vlade Divac tapped the ball away from the rim in an attempt to wind 
down the clock. It went straight into Robert Horry's hands, who drained 
a game-winning three with under 3 seconds to play. After the Kings won 
game 5 on a buzzer beater by Mike Bibby, the Lakers were faced with a must-win 
game 6. In one of the most controversial playoff games in league history,[167] 
the Lakers won by 4 points. The Lakers won game 7 in overtime, with the 
Kings missing numerous potentially game-saving shots and free throws. The 
Lakers then achieved a three-peat by sweeping Jason Kidd and the New Jersey 
Nets in the NBA Finals.[168] O'Neal won each of the Finals series' MVP 
awards, making him the only player besides Michael Jordan to win three 
consecutive Finals MVPs.[169] The Lakers started the 2002–03 season 11–19.[170] 
They went 39–13 the rest of the way to finish 50–32.[171] They defeated 
the Minnesota Timberwolves in the first round of the 2003 NBA Playoffs, 
but were eliminated by San Antonio in six games in the second.[172] During 
the 2003–04 season, the team was the subject of intense media coverage 
generated by the teaming of four stars and the sexual-assault case involving 
Kobe Bryant.[173][174] Before the season, Los Angeles signed two-time MVP 
Karl Malone formerly of the Jazz, and former Seattle Defensive Player of 
the Year Gary Payton.[175] Three of the "big four", however, struggled 
with injuries: O'Neal suffered from a strained calf, Malone an injured 
knee, and Bryant an injured shoulder.[176][177] The Lakers started 18–3 
and finished 56–26. They won the Pacific Division title, and entered the 
playoffs as the number two seed. They defeated the Rockets, Spurs, and 
Timberwolves in the first three rounds of the 2004 NBA Playoffs, before 
succumbing to Detroit in five games in the 2004 NBA Finals.[178] During 
the 2004 offseason, the team entered a rebuilding phase when O'Neal was 
traded to the Miami Heat for Lamar Odom, Brian Grant, Caron Butler, and 
a first-round draft pick.[179] Bryant and O'Neal had clashed in the past,[180] 
and the media credited their feud as one of the motivating factors for 
the trade.[181] Jackson did not return as head coach, and wrote a book 
about the team's 2003–04 season, in which he heavily criticized Bryant 
and called him "uncoachable".[182][183][184] The Lakers front office said 
that the book contained "several inaccuracies".[185] The Lakers traded 
Rick Fox and Gary Payton to Boston, for Chris Mihm, Marcus Banks, and Chucky 
Atkins before the 2004–05 season.[186] Derek Fisher, frustrated with losing 
playing time, opted out of his contract and signed with the Warriors.[186] 
The team hired Rudy Tomjanovich to replace Jackson.[186] After sitting 
out the first half of the 2004–05 season, Malone announced his retirement 
on February 13, 2005.[187] Tomjanovich coached the team to a 22–19 record 
before resigning due to health problems.[188] Assistant Frank Hamblen was 
named interim head coach to replace Tomjanovich for the remainder of the 
season.[189] Bryant (ankle) and Odom (shoulder) suffered injuries, and 
the Lakers finished 34–48, missing the playoffs for the fifth time in franchise 
history.[22] With the 10th overall pick in the draft, Los Angeles selected 
Andrew Bynum, a center from St. Joseph High School in Metuchen, New Jersey.[190] 
The team also traded Caron Butler and Chucky Atkins to the Washington Wizards 
for Kwame Brown and Laron Profit.[191] Jackson returned to coach the team 
after Rudy Tomjanovich resigned midway through the previous season.[192] 
On January 22, 2006, Bryant scored 81 points against the Toronto Raptors, 
the second-highest total in NBA history.[193] Ending the season 45–37, 
the team made the playoffs after a one season absence.[194] After taking 
a three games to one lead in the first round, the Suns came back to take 
the series in seven games.[195] In the following season, they won 26 of 
their first 39 games,[196] but lost 27 of their last 43—including seven 
in a row at one point—to finish 42–40.[196] They were eliminated in the 
first round by the Suns again, this time 4–1.[196] Frustrated by the team's 
inability to advance in the playoffs, Bryant demanded to be traded in the 
offseason.[197] Buss initially agreed to seek a trade,[198] but also worked 
to try to change Bryant's mind.[199] After re-acquiring Derek Fisher, Los 
Angeles started the 2007–08 season with a 25–11 record, before Andrew Bynum, 
their center who was leading the league in field-goal percentage, went 
out for the year due to a knee injury in mid-January.[200] They acquired 
power forward Pau Gasol from the Memphis Grizzlies in a trade in early 
February and went 22–5 to finish the season.[201] The Lakers' 57–25 record 
earned them the first seed in the Western Conference.[202] Bryant was awarded 
the league's MVP award, becoming the first Laker to win the award since 
O'Neal in 2000.[203][204] In the playoffs, they defeated the Nuggets in 
four games, the Jazz in six, and the defending champion Spurs in five, 
but lost to the Celtics in six games in the NBA Finals.[205] In the 2008–09 
season, the Lakers finished 65–17; the best record in the Western Conference.[206] 
They defeated the Jazz in five games, the Rockets in seven and the Nuggets 
in six, to win the Western Conference title. They then won their 15th NBA 
championship by defeating the Orlando Magic in five games in the NBA finals.[207] 
Bryant was named the NBA Finals MVP for the first time in his career.[208] 
The Lakers, who had added Ron Artest (now Metta World Peace [209]) in place 
of Trevor Ariza in their starting lineup, finished the 2009–10 season with 
the best record in the Western Conference for the third straight time. 
On January 13, 2010, the Lakers became the first team in NBA history to 
win 3,000 regular season games by defeating the Dallas Mavericks 100–95.[210] 
They defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder, the Utah Jazz, and the Phoenix 
Suns in the Western Conference playoffs. In the finals, the Lakers played 
the Boston Celtics for the 12th time. They rallied back from a 3–2 disadvantage 
in the series and erased a 13-point deficit in the fourth quarter of the 
seventh game to defeat the Celtics. This series win gave them their 16th 
NBA title overall and 11th since they moved to Los Angeles.[211] Bryant 
was named Finals MVP for the second year in a row, despite a 6–24 shooting 
performance in game seven.[212] After much speculation, head coach Phil 
Jackson returned for the 2010–11 season.[213] In the playoffs, the Lakers 
defeated the New Orleans Hornets in the first round.[214] But their opportunity 
for a three-peat was denied by the Dallas Mavericks in a four-game sweep 
of the second round. After the season, it was announced that Jackson will 
not be returning to coach the Lakers.[215] After Jackson's retirement, 
former Cleveland Cavaliers head coach Mike Brown was hired as head coach 
on May 25, 2011.[216] Before the start of the shortened 2011–12 season, 
the Lakers traded Lamar Odom to the Dallas Mavericks after Odom requested 
to be traded.[217] On the trade deadline long time Laker Derek Fisher along 
with a first round draft pick were traded to the Houston Rockets for Jordan 
Hill.[218] With a 41–25 regular season record the Lakers entered the playoffs 
as the third seed, the team defeated the Denver Nuggets in the first round 
in seven games but were eliminated by the Oklahoma City Thunder in the 
second round in five games.[219][220] On July 4, 2012, Steve Nash of the 
Phoenix Suns agreed to a sign-and-trade deal that would send him to the 
Lakers in exchange for the Lakers' 2013 and 2015 first round draft picks, 
2013 and 2014 second round draft picks, and $3 million. The trade was made 
official on July 11, 2012, the first day the trade moratorium was lifted.[221] 
On August 10, 2012, in a four-team trade the Lakers traded Andrew Bynum 
and acquired Dwight Howard.[222] On November 9, 2012, Mike Brown was relieved 
of coaching duties after a 1–4 start to the 2012–13 season.[223] Assistant 
Coach Bernie Bickerstaff took over as interim head coach, leading the Lakers 
to a 5–5 record. On November 12, 2012, the Lakers hired Mike D'Antoni as 
head coach.[224] On February 18, 2013, Lakers owner Jerry Buss died from 
cancer at age 80.[225] On the court, D'Antoni coached the Lakers to a 40–32 
record the rest of the way to finish 45–37, their worst record since 2007. 
The Lakers clinched a playoff berth on the final game of the season and 
finished seventh in the Western Conference after beating the Houston Rockets 
on April 16, 2013.[226][227] The Lakers battled injuries all season, the 
most prominent of which is the Achilles tendon rupture to Kobe Bryant that 
ended his season after 78 games. The absence of Bryant was sorely felt 
as the Lakers were swept by the San Antonio Spurs in the first round of 
the 2013 NBA Playoffs.[228] Nevertheless, Bryant passed Lakers legend Wilt 
Chamberlain to become the fourth all-time leading scorer in NBA history 
on March 30, 2013 against the Sacramento Kings.[229] On March 25, 2014, 
the Lakers scored 51 points in the third quarter against the New York Knicks, 
the most points scored in a quarter in the history of the franchise.[230] 
The Lakers went on to miss the NBA playoffs for the first time since 2005, 
for just the second time in the last two decades and for just the sixth 
time in franchise history. On April 30, 2014, Mike D'Antoni resigned from 
his position as head coach after a 27-55 season.[231] After spending the 
majority of the off-season without a head coach, the Lakers named former 
player Byron Scott as the new head coach.[232] After the season, he was 
the frontrunner to become the new Lakers head coach. Scott interviewed 
three times for the position, which had become vacant after Mike D'Antoni's 
resignation.[233] On July 28, 2014, he signed a multi-year contract to 
coach the Lakers.[234] During the first game of the 2014–15 season, the 
7th overall pick in the 2014 NBA draft, Julius Randle went down with a 
broken leg which ended his rookie season. The Lakers began their season 
losing 10 of their first 16 games. After playing only 35 games, Kobe Bryant 
tore a rotator cuff in his shoulder ending his season. Nick Young was also 
forced to end his season with a fractured kneecap, leaving the team with 
a record of 14–41.[235] With 27 games left in the regular season, Byron 
Scott gave rookie Jordan Clarkson more playing time. Clarkson, the 46th 
overall pick in the 2014 draft, finished his rookie season with game stats 
of 11.9 ppg, 3.2 rpg, 3.5 apg, and shooting 44.8% from the field.[236] 
The Lakers' season ended with a record of 21–61, the 4th worst record in 
the league and at the time the worst record in franchise history. The next 
season, the Lakers had the second overall pick of the 2015 NBA draft, which 
they used to select Ohio State freshman point guard D'Angelo Russell.[237] 
On November 30, 2015, Bryant announced he would retire at the end of the 
season after 20 seasons with the team.[238] In Bryant's last season the 
team missed the playoffs for the third straight year with a 17–65 record, 
the worst in franchise history.[239] On April 24, 2016, the Lakers announced 
that they will not to exercise their option on Byron Scott contract for 
the following season.[240] On April 29, the Lakers announced another former 
Laker, Luke Walton, as their new head coach. At the time of his hiring, 
Walton was an assistant coach for the Golden State Warriors, who were in 
the playoffs, so Walton could not officially begin his duties as head coach 
until the Warriors playoff run was over.[241] The rivalry between the Boston 
Celtics and the Lakers involves the two most storied basketball franchises 
in National Basketball Association (NBA) history. It has been called the 
best rivalry in the NBA.[242] The two teams have met a record 12 times 
in the NBA Finals, starting with their first Finals meeting in 1959. They 
would go on to dominate the league in the 1960s and the 1980s, facing each 
other six times in the 60s and three times in the 80s. The rivalry had 
been less intense since the retirements of Magic Johnson and Larry Bird 
in the early 1990s, but in 2008 it was renewed as the Celtics and Lakers 
met in the Finals for the first time since 1987, with the Celtics winning 
the series 4–2. They faced off once again in the 2010 NBA Finals which 
the Lakers won in 7 games. Since 1960, the Lakers are 4-2 against their 
fiercest rival in the Finals. The two teams have won the two highest numbers 
of championships, the Celtics 17, the Lakers 16; together, the 33 championships 
account for almost half of the 67 championships in NBA history. The rivalry 
between the Lakers and the Los Angeles Clippers is unique because they 
are the only two NBA teams to share an arena, the Staples Center. It is 
also one of only two intra-city rivalries in the NBA, the other being the 
new crosstown rivalry between the New York Knicks and Brooklyn Nets. Los 
Angeles fans have historically favored the Lakers.[243][244] Some contend 
that the term rivalry is inaccurate until the Clippers become more successful.[245] 
However, with the addition of Chris Paul and Blake Griffin to the Clippers' 
roster and their emergence as playoff contenders, the rivalry has started 
to develop in earnest, with a recent matchup between the teams garnering 
ESPN its highest ratings ever for a regular season broadcast in Los Angeles.[246] 
The San Antonio Spurs and the Lakers, developed what some would classify 
as a rivalry in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Since 1999, the teams have 
met in the NBA Playoffs five times, with the clubs combining to appear 
in seven consecutive NBA Finals (1999–2005). Additionally, the teams combined 
to win five NBA championships from 1999 to 2003. The Spurs won the NBA 
championship in 1999, 2003, 2005, 2007 and 2014 while the Lakers won the 
championship in 2000, 2001, 2002, 2009 and 2010. From 1999 to 2004 the 
clubs' rivalry was often considered the premier rivalry in the NBA,[247] 
and each time the clubs faced each other in the playoffs the winner advanced 
to the NBA Finals. In 2008 the teams met again in the Western Conference 
Finals where the Spurs were handily defeated only to beat LA when they 
met again in 2013 (though against a Lakers team without an injured Kobe 
Bryant). Berger and Chalfen purchased the NBL's disbanded Detroit Gems 
for $15,000 in 1947, changed their name to the Lakers and relocated them 
to Minnesota. Max Winter bought a third of the club in their early years, 
and sold his share to Mikan in 1954. Berger bought Mikan's share in 1956 
giving him a controlling (⅔) interest.[248] After Mikan retired, attendance 
plummeted and the team lost money for several seasons, leading the ownership 
group to put the team up for sale in 1957.[249] Marty Marion, a retired 
baseball player and manager, and his business partner Milton Fischman attempted 
to purchase the team with the intention of moving the club to Kansas City, 
Missouri.[249][250] Mikan offered to mortgage his home in an attempt to 
buy the team and keep the club in Minnesota.[251] The Lakers were sold 
to a group of investors led by Bob Short however.[248] The team was sold 
to Short's group with the agreement that it would not be relocated to Kansas 
City but kept in Minnesota.[252] Short's ownership group consisted of 117 
Minnesota businesses and private citizens, who amassed a total of $200,000 
for the purchase; $150,000 to buy the team and $50,000 to run it.[248] 
By 1958 Short had become 80% owner of the team by buying out his partners,[248] 
but the team was floundering. Attendance remained poor, and the NBA had 
put the Lakers on "financial probation", notifying them that if they did 
not meet certain ticket sales numbers they could be bought out by the league 
and relocated. Short was forced to move the team to Los Angeles in 1960; 
the club had lost $60,000 in the first half of the 1959–60 season alone.[253] 
The NBA's owners originally voted 7–1 against the move.[254] When Short 
indicated that he might take the team to new rival league that was developing 
however, the owners held another vote that same day and allowed the relocation 
(8–0).[255] Aided by Baylor's drawing power,[256][257] and the new locale, 
the team's finances improved when they arrived in LA.[258][259] Short sold 
the team to Washington Redskins owner and publisher Jack Kent Cooke in 
1965 for a then league record amount of $5,175,000.[260] Short insisted 
the deal be conducted in cash as he was wary of Cooke, so guards transported 
the money in a cart from one New York bank to another.[261] Cooke was a 
more hands-on owner than Short, and overhauled the team's operations.[262] 
He personally financed construction of the Forum in 1967 at a cost of $16.5 million.[263][264] 
He owned the team until 1979 when he sold it, the NHL's Los Angeles Kings, 
the Forum, and some real estate to Jerry Buss for $67 million.[265] Cooke 
was forced to sell the team as he was undergoing a costly divorce.[266][267] 
Buss was a local chemical engineer and former University of Southern California 
professor who had become wealthy in real estate.[264][268] Philip Anschutz 
bought a stake in the team in 1998,[269] and until October 2010 Magic Johnson 
was a minority owner as well.[270] Buss started the trend of allowing sponsors 
to add their name to team's stadiums when he renamed the Forum the Great 
Western Forum in 1988.[271] In 2009 major sponsors included Verizon Wireless, 
Toyota, Anheuser-Busch, American Express, and Carl's Jr., and the team's 
$113 average ticket price was the highest in the league.[269] Fast food 
chain Jack in the Box is another major sponsor, the company gives all fans 
in attendance at home games a coupon for two free tacos if the Lakers hold 
their opponent under 100 points and win. The company also sponsors the 
team's halftime shows on KCAL-TV and Fox Sports West.[272] In 2013, Buss 
died at the age of 80 after being hospitalized for 18 months with cancer.[273][274][275] 
His controlling ownership of the team passed to his six children via a 
trust, with each child receiving an equal vote.[276][277] Buss' succession 
plan had daughter Jeanie Buss assume his title as the Lakers' governor 
as well as its team representative at NBA Board of Governors meetings.[277][278] 
Given the team's proximity to Hollywood, the Lakers fanbase includes numerous 
celebrities, many of whom can be seen at the Staples Center during home 
games.[279] Jack Nicholson, for example, has held season tickets since 
the 1970s, and directors reportedly need to work their shooting schedules 
around Lakers home games.[280] From 2002 and 2007 the team averaged just 
over 18,900 fans, which placed them in the top ten in the NBA in attendance. 
Red Hot Chili Peppers' song "Magic Johnson" from their 1989 album Mother's 
Milk is a tribute to the former point guard, and frontman Anthony Kiedis 
and bassist Michael "Flea" Balzary are frequently seen attending home games. 
The team has sold out every home game since the 2007–08 season.[281] As 
of 2010, the Lakers have the most popular team merchandise among all NBA 
teams, and Bryant the most popular jersey.[282] The Laker nickname came 
from the state of Minnesota being the Land of 10,000 Lakes.[6][283] The 
team's colors are purple, gold and white.[2] The Lakers logo consists of 
the team name, "Los Angeles Lakers" written in purple on top of a gold 
basketball. Purple uniforms are used for road games and gold uniforms are 
used for home games. The team also wears white jerseys for Sunday and holiday 
home games.[284][285] Since the Lakers were established in 1948, the team 
has missed the playoffs just five times.[22] The team has 16 NBA titles 
and has appeared in the NBA Finals 15 other times.[22] These appearances 
include eight NBA Finals appearances in the 80s. The best record posted 
by the team was 69–13, in 1972; the worst record was 17–65, in 2015–16.[22] 
Bryant holds most individual team records for longevity including most 
games played (1333), and most minutes logged (48,298). Johnson holds all 
significant assist records for the club including career assists (10,141), 
assists in a game (24), and highest assist average for a season (13.1). 
Johnson also has the most triple doubles, with his 138 over 100 more than 
the next closest player (Bryant; 17). Elmore Smith holds team records for 
blocks in a game (17), blocks per game for a season (4.85), and career 
blocks per game (3.93). The scoring records are mostly shared by Elgin 
Baylor and Bryant, with Baylor having the highest average for a career 
(27.4) while Bryant has the highest points scored in a single game (81). 
Baylor, Bryant and West hold the top five single season scoring averages, 
with Bryant occupying the numbers one (35.4) and four (31.6) spots, while 
Baylor has the second (34.8), and third (34.0), and West the fifth (31.3).[286][287] 
The Lakers hold several NBA records as a team including most consecutive 
games won overall (33) and most consecutive road games won (16) both of 
which came during the 1971–72 season.[288] Highest field-goal percentage 
for a season at 54.5% (1984–85),[289] and highest road winning percentage 
at 0.816 (1971–72).[51] They also hold records for having (into the 2009–10 
season) the most wins (3,027), the highest winning percentage (61.9%), 
and the most NBA Finals appearances (31).[22][290] The 2000–01 team tied 
the NBA record for best playoff record at 15–1.[288] The 1971–72 team holds 
franchise records in wins (69), most points scored, and largest margin 
of victory; both of the latter came in the team's 63 point win versus Golden 
State (162–99).[291] They also used to hold the record for most wins at 
home in the regular season (going 36-5 in 1971–72, then 37-4 in both 1976–77 
and 1979–1980) before the Boston Celtics set the current record of 40-1 
in the 1985–86 season. The Lakers play their home games at Staples Center, 
located at L.A. Live in Downtown Los Angeles. Staples Center opened in 
fall 1999, and seats up to 18,997 for Lakers games.[292] The Staples Center 
is also home to the Los Angeles Clippers, the WNBA's Los Angeles Sparks, 
and the NHL's Los Angeles Kings.[292] The arena is owned and operated by 
AEG and L.A. Arena Company.[292] Before moving to the Staples Center, for 
32 seasons (1967–1999), the Lakers played their home games at The Forum 
in Inglewood, California, located approximately 10 miles southwest of the 
team's current home at Staples Center.[151] During the 1999 NBA preseason, 
the Lakers played their home games at the Forum before officially moving 
into Staples Center, and once again hosted a preseason game versus the 
Golden State Warriors on October 9, 2009, this time to commemorate the 
team's 50th anniversary season in Los Angeles.[293] In the first seven 
years in Los Angeles, the team played their home games at the Los Angeles 
Memorial Sports Arena, south of Downtown Los Angeles.[294] While the team 
played in Minneapolis, the team played their home games at the Minneapolis 
Auditorium, from 1947 to 1960.[295] Roster • Transactions Last transaction: 
2016–10–12 The Lakers hold the draft rights to the following unsigned draft 
picks who have been playing outside the NBA. A drafted player, either an 
international draftee or a college draftee who isn't signed by the team 
that drafted him, is allowed to sign with any non-NBA teams. In this case, 
the team retains the player's draft rights in the NBA until one year after 
the player's contract with the non-NBA team ends.[296] This list includes 
draft rights that were acquired from trades with other teams. The Lakers 
have had three first overall picks in their history: Elgin Baylor (selected 
in 1958), Magic Johnson (selected in 1979) and James Worthy (selected in 
1982).[298] The Lakers have also had four Lottery picks in their history: 
Eddie Jones (selected 10th overall in 1994), Andrew Bynum (selected 10th 
overall in 2005), Julius Randle (selected 7th overall in 2014) and D'Angelo 
Russell (selected 2nd overall in 2015).[298] Other draft picks include 
Jerry West and Gail Goodrich in the 1960s, Michael Cooper and Norm Nixon 
in the 1970s, A. C. Green and Vlade Divac in the 1980s, Elden Campbell, 
Nick Van Exel, Derek Fisher, and Devean George in the 1990s, and Luke Walton, 
Sasha Vujačić, and Ronny Turiaf in the 2000s.[298] There have been 22 head 
coaches for the Lakers franchise. John Kundla coached the team in Minneapolis 
when they won their first five BAA/NBA championships, from 1949 to 1954.[37] 
Pat Riley is second in franchise history in both regular season and playoff 
games coached and wins.[299] Phil Jackson broke Riley's regular season 
wins record in 2009, and he passed Riley's playoff wins and games coached 
records in 2010.[299] Jackson, Riley, Kundla, and Bill Sharman have all 
been inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame for their coaching careers. 
George Mikan, Jim Pollard, Jerry West, Pat Riley, Magic Johnson, Kurt Rambis 
and Byron Scott have all played and head coached for the Lakers. Jackson, 
who had two stints as head coach, was coach from 2005–2006 until 2010–2011. 
Mike Brown was named his replacement for the 2011–2012 season in May 2011.[300] 
Brown was fired[301] on November 9, 2012, after a 1–4 start. Assistant 
coach Bernie Bickerstaff served as interim head coach for five games before 
the Lakers selected Mike D'Antoni as their new head coach. D'Antoni resigned 
at the end of the 2013–2014 season. In July 2014, Byron Scott was hired 
as head coach.[302] After the 2015–2016 season ended, Scott was fired. 
On April 29, 2016, former Lakers player Luke Walton was named as Scott's 
replacement.[303] The Lakers have 30 Hall of Famers (23 players, 4 head 
coaches, 1 assistant coach, and 2 contributors) who contributed to the 
organization.[304][305][306] The Lakers have retired nine jersey numbers 
and an honorary microphone in honor of their players and broadcaster:[307][308][309] 
In addition, several other players and coaches who were instrumental to 
the franchise's success during its days in Minneapolis were named Honored 
Minneapolis Lakers, although their numbers are not retired by the franchise:[310] 
Chick Hearn was the team's broadcaster for 41 years until his death in 
2002. He broadcast 3,338 consecutive games between November 21, 1965, and 
December 16, 2001.[311] Hearn came up with West's "Mr. Clutch" nickname.[312] 
He was a part of the team's "inner sanctum" when Cooke was owner, and was 
consulted on basketball decisions.[313] Paul Sunderland, who had filled 
in for a couple of games while Hearn recuperated in 2001–02, was named 
the permanent play-by-play announcer. Stu Lantz was retained as the color 
commentator.[314] Sunderland's contract expired in the summer of 2005, 
and the team chose not to renew it.[315] Joel Meyers moved in alongside 
Lantz as the television announcer, while Spero Dedes and former Laker player 
Mychal Thompson on the radio.[316] For the 2011–12 NBA season, Bill Macdonald 
became the new television play-by-play announcer, joining Lantz who remained 
as the color analyst. Meanwhile, John Ireland joined Mychal Thompson to 
call the games on radio.[317] As of the 2009–10 season, Lakers radio broadcasts 
are heard on KSPN (Los Angeles ESPN Radio affiliate) in English and KWKW 
in Spanish.[316][318] KLAC had the team's radio broadcast rights from the 
1976–77 season until the 2008–09 season.[318][319] Until 2011, telecasts 
had been split between KCAL-TV (road games) and Fox Sports West (home games), 
unless they are chosen for national broadcasts on ABC.[320] KCAL had been 
the Lakers' over-the-air television broadcaster since 1977, dating back 
to when the station was the RKO General-owned KHJ-TV, the longest relationship 
between an NBA team and a television station. Prior to KHJ, Laker games 
were televised on KTLA. The Lakers had been on Fox Sports West since 1985, 
dating to when it was the original Prime Ticket and owned by Buss.[321] 
On February 14, 2011, Time Warner Cable and the Lakers announced the formation 
of two new regional sports networks (one in English, one in Spanish) that 
will exclusively televise the team's games and related programming for 
20 years starting with the 2012–13 NBA season.[322] The said networks eventually
