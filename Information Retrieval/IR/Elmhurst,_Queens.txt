Elmhurst (formerly Newtown) is a working/middle class neighborhood in the 
borough of Queens in New York City. It is bounded by Roosevelt Avenue on 
the north; the Long Island Expressway on the south; Junction Boulevard 
on the east; and the New York Connecting Railroad on the west.[3] The neighborhood 
is part of Queens Community Board 4. The village was established in 1652 
by the Dutch as Middenburgh (Middleburgh) and was a suburb of New Amsterdam 
(Nieuw Amsterdam) in New Netherland (Nieuw Nederland). The original European 
settlers of Elmhurst were from the nearby colony of Maspat (now called 
Maspeth), following threats and attacks by local Native Americans.[3][4] 
When the British took over New Netherland in 1664, they renamed Middleburgh 
as New Town (Nieuwe Stad) to maintain the Dutch heritage.[4] This was eventually 
simplified to Newtown. Among the English settlers in the present Elmhurst 
section of Newtown was Gershom Moore, in whose orchard a chance seedling 
produced the Newtown Pippin, Colonial America's most famous apple. The 
village of Newtown was established as the town seat for the township in 
1683,[3] when Queens County was rearranged into a "one county, five towns" 
model. The Town of Newtown, which had a town hall, jail, tax office, and 
town clerk's office, was the center of a municipality that comprised the 
villages that were located north of present-day Forest Park and west of 
Flushing Meadows. [4] Development came when a horsecar line, the Grand 
Street Line, came in 1854; the Long Island Rail Road's Main Line was built 
through Elmhurst in 1876, attracting more residents to the neighborhood.[4] 
Cord Meyer bought land at Broadway and Whitney Avenue in 1896. He proposed 
that the town be renamed "Elmhurst", meaning "a grove of elms"; in 1897, 
one year before Queens County was incorporated in the Greater City of New 
York, the town was renamed.[4] The renaming was done partially to disassociate 
the town from nearby Maspeth and the smelly, polluted Newtown Creek, and 
partially because elm trees (Ulmus americana) abounded in the area.[3][5] 
Elmhurst developed into a fashionable district due to a housing development 
that was built by the Cord Meyer Development Company between 1896 and 1910, 
north of the Port Washington Branch railroad station. They expanded their 
holdings between 1905 and 1930, including Elmhurst Square, Elmhurst South, 
Elmhurst Heights, and New Elmhurst. Elmhurst also became home to the Grand 
Street LIRR station just west of the current Grand Avenue – Newtown subway 
station. The Grand Street LIRR station was served by the Main Line and 
the former Rockaway Beach Branch.[3][5] In 1936, the Independent Subway 
System's Queens Boulevard line was built through the neighborhood, spurring 
economic development but also destroying many old buildings.[4] Prior to 
World War II, Elmhurst was an almost exclusively Jewish and Italian neighborhood. 
Following the war, Elmhurst evolved into what has been considered one of 
the most ethnically diverse neighborhoods in New York City.[6] By the 1980s, 
there were persons from 112 nations in residence in the neighborhood, which 
has continued to further diversify since then.[3] Among the largest ethnic 
groups that have settled in the area are Latinos and Chinese Americans.[7] 
For many years, the Elmhurst gas tanks, a pair of large natural gas storage 
structures built in 1910 and 1921 on 57th Avenue between 74th and 80th 
Streets, were well-known landmarks, standing 200 feet (61 m) high. Because 
the Long Island Expressway frequently became congested in that area, "backup 
at the Elmhurst Gas Tanks" became a familiar phrase in radio traffic reporting. 
The gas storage facilities were removed in 2001, [8][9] and the site was 
redeveloped and opened as the Elmhurst Park in 2011.[10] Based on data 
from the 2010 United States Census, the population of Elmhurst was 88,427, 
an increase of 455 (0.5%) from the 87,972 counted in 2000. Covering an 
area of 750.28 acres (303.63 ha), the neighborhood had a population density 
of 117.9 inhabitants per acre (75,500/sq mi; 29,100/km2).[1] The racial 
makeup of the neighborhood was 6.6% (5,870) White, 1.3% (1,140) African 
American, 0.2% (133) Native American, 43.8% (38,699) Asian, 0.0% (28) Pacific 
Islander, 0.4% (338) from other races, and 1.6% (1,423) from two or more 
races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 46.1% (40,796) of the population.[2] 
Elmhurst's rapidly growing Chinatown (艾浒 唐人街)[11] is the second in Queens, 
the other Chinatown being located in Flushing. Previously a small area 
with Chinese shops on Broadway between 81st Street and Cornish Avenue, 
this newly evolved second Chinatown in Queens has now expanded to 45th 
Avenue and Whitney Avenue and is developing as a satellite of the Flushing 
Chinatown. It is the second largest Chinese enclave in Queens, behind Flushing.[7] 
In Chinese translation, Elmhurst is named 艾浒 (Àihǔ in Standard Chinese). 
There are also many other Southeast Asian businesses and shops in the area, 
including Malaysian Chinese, Singaporean Chinese, Indonesian, Thai, and 
Vietnamese. Hong Kong Supermarket and New York Supermarket serve as the 
largest Chinese supermarkets selling different food varieties to this Elmhurst 
Chinatown.[12][13] So far, the Asia Bank serves as the only Chinese bank 
and the main financial resource business for the growing enclave,[14] though 
HSBC, Chase, and other banks also are located in Elmhurst along Broadway. 
Like Flushing's Chinatown, it is also very highly populated by Mandarin 
speakers, although many also speak other varieties of Chinese. An annexation 
of the Elmhurst Chinatown is the neighborhood of Corona, Queens.[15] Places 
of worship include: Elmhurst has two urban shopping malls:[16] Queens Center[23] 
and the smaller Queens Place Mall.[24] The 150-store Queens Center, bounded 
by Queens Boulevard, 57th and 59th Avenues, and 90th and 94th Streets, 
opened on September 12, 1973, and was renovated and expanded across 92nd 
Street in 2002–4. With a gross leasable area of 1,000,000 square feet (93,000 m2), 
the mall has had retail sales per square foot nearly triple the national 
average.[25] It was built on land previously occupied by a 24-ride children's 
amusement park named Fairyland, which opened in 1949 and closed in 1968.[26] 
The site was also formerly a supermarket and automobile parking. The smaller 
Queens Place, bounded by Queens Boulevard and by Justice, 55th, and 56th 
Avenues, is designed in a cylindrical shape and opened in 1965. Originally 
planned as a traditional rectangular construction designed to replace several 
blocks of residences, the mall had to be redesigned because the owner of 
the corner house at 55th Avenue and Queens Boulevard, Mary Sendek, refused 
to sell what had been her childhood home. The site of the corner home was 
demolished after Sendek died, and that site is now a small collection of 
stores.[16] 57th Avenue was known as the Flushing and Newtown Turnpike.[16] 
Built in 1801, it connected with present-day Flushing Avenue in Maspeth, 
and extended all the way to Williamsburg, Brooklyn.[27] The Elks Lodge's 
name is shared by a local street, Elks Road, a short road in a cluster 
of 2- and 3-story orange and yellow brick buildings located between Grand 
Avenue, 79th Street, and Calamus Avenue, that were built in 1930 by Louis 
Allmendinger for the Matthews Company.[28] Hoffman Drive is a remnant of 
the wide Hoffman Boulevard. Hoffman Boulevard was straightened and renamed 
Queens Boulevard, but a short slip road, Hoffman Drive, leads from 57th 
Avenue to Woodhaven Boulevard.[16] Horace Harding Expressway and Long Island 
Expressway was once a turnpike called Nassau Boulevard, which went from 
Elmhurst to Flushing, Bayside, and Little Neck. It was renamed for Horace 
J. Harding (1863–1929), a finance magnate who directed the New York, New 
Haven and Hartford Railroad and the New York Municipal Railways System; 
Harding encouraged city planner Robert Moses's system of parkways on New 
York, and after Harding died, the boulevard—now the service road of Interstate 
495—was renamed after him.[29] Horse Brook Island is a traffic island at 
the intersection of 90th Street, Justice Avenue, and 56th Avenue. The traffic 
island is reminiscent of the former Horsebrook Creek, a creek that flowed 
to the present-day intersection of Kneeland Avenue and Codwise Place.[16] 
The space was renovated from 1986–94.[5] Justice Avenue, an Elmhurst road 
that has existed since the American colonial period, follows an unusual 
curved path through Elmhurst due to a now-defunct railroad line immediately 
to the south.[16] Queens Boulevard, a wide at-grade highway that stretches 
from Long Island City to Jamaica, was formerly composed of two small dirt 
roads: Old Jamaica Road and Hoffman Boulevard. In the 1910s, it was paved 
and widened to 12 lanes. It is sometimes called the "Boulevard of Death" 
because of the high fatality rate on Queens Boulevard.[16] The majority 
of Whitney Avenue, which stretches from 83rd Street in the west to Roosevelt 
Avenue and 93rd Street to the northeast, is on a tilted street grid, developed 
in the early 20th century. The street grid consists of Broadway; Aske, 
Benham, Case, Denman, Elbertson, Forley, Gleane, Hampton, Ithaca, Judge, 
Ketcham, Layton, Macnish Streets; Ketcham Place; and Baxter, Pettit, Britton, 
Vietor, Elmhurst, Whitney, and Lamont Avenues. Whitney Avenue also has 
the most religious institutions of any street in Elmhurst.[17] Woodhaven 
Boulevard was known as Trotting Course Lane because it was named when horses 
were the main mode of transport. Although it extends to Cross Bay Boulevard 
in the Rockaways, two small parts of the original lane still exist in Forest 
Hills.[30] Elmhurst Park is on 57th Avenue west of 80th Street. There is 
a children's playground with slides, swings, and exercise machines, as 
well as walking paths and a lawn atop a hill. The land for the park was 
formerly occupied by gas tanks. The park itself was opened in 2011.[31] 
Moore Homestead Park is located between Broadway and 45th Avenue. There 
is a children's playground with slides and swings and there are different 
sections where people can play basketball, handball, and chess. The park 
is named after a nearby homestead owned by Clement Clarke Moore, whose 
ancestor John Moore helped negotiate Newtown's land area with the Native 
American population there. The park, originally acquired by the Independent 
Subway System and then turned into a playground, was renovated in the 1990s.[32] 
Frank D. O'Connor Playground is located on Broadway between Woodside Avenue 
and 78th Street. There is also a children playground, basketball and handball 
area. Opened in 1937 and renovated in 1996, the park is named after former 
state senator Frank D. O'Connor.[33] Robert W. Trombino Overlook Park in 
East Elmhurst, also known simply as Overlook Park, is so named because 
it overlooks LaGuardia Airport and Ditmars.[34] It is named after Robert 
W. Trombino, a New York City Parks official who died in 1990.[35] Veterans 
Grove is located on 43rd Avenue by Judge and Ketcham Streets. It is a small 
park mainly for younger children. The park's plaque states that it was 
dedicated "to the memory of those soldiers from Elmhurst who lost their 
lives serving in World War I." The park land was acquired in 1928, and 
the park was originally called the Elmhurst Memorial Park. It was renovated 
in 1994–6.[36] Horsebrook Island is a small triangular green space at the 
junction of 56th Avenue, Justice Avenue and 90th Street that was named 
after a stream that once ran through the Newtown settlement. The creek 
was buried in the first three decades of the twentieth century.[37][38] 
Libra Triangle is a small triangular green space at the junction of Justice 
Avenue and Broadway.[39] Newtown Playground is located on 92nd Avenue and 
56th Street. There are two children's playgrounds, chess tables, swings, 
sprinklers, and a small lawn. The park is named after the original name 
of Elmhurst given by the English. It is one block away from Queens Center 
Mall and Newtown High School's athletic field. An Elmhurst Queens Library 
branch on Broadway, demolished in 2012, is being replaced with a new library, 
which will open by 2017.[40] In the meantime, the library moved to a temporary 
location on 51st Avenue.[41] Elmhurst is part of New York City's Department 
of Education Region 4. Schools in Elmhurst include: New York City Subway 
stations include Jackson Heights – Roosevelt Avenue, Woodhaven Boulevard, 
Grand Avenue – Newtown, and Elmhurst Avenue, all served by the E M R trains 
of the IND Queens Boulevard Line. In addition, the IRT Flushing Line, served 
by the 7 <7> trains, runs along Roosevelt Avenue, the north border of Elmhurst, 
with stations at 74th Street – Broadway, 82nd Street – Jackson Heights 
and 90th Street – Elmhurst Avenue.[53] Buses include the Q11, Q21, Q29, 
Q38, Q52, Q53, Q58, Q59, Q60, Q72, Q88.[54] Elmhurst is bounded by the 
Long Island Expressway to the south and by the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway 
to the west. Queens Boulevard, Woodhaven Boulevard, Junction Boulevard, 
Roosevelt Avenue, and Broadway are major roads in the community. Elmhurst 
is connected to Manhattan and Jamaica by Queens Boulevard and is connected 
to John F. Kennedy International Airport by Woodhaven Boulevard and to 
LaGuardia Airport by Junction Boulevard.[55] McDowell's, the fictional 
restaurant depicted in the 1988 film Coming to America, is located in Elmhurst. 
For the week-long shot, the filmmakers cosmetically altered an existing 
Wendy's restaurant, which was closed in May 2013 and was razed by December 
2013 to make way for condominiums.[69] Images of surrounding streets were 
also used in the movie.[70] The CBS show Blue Bloods filmed for its third 
season on the residential streets of Elmhurst in 2012. Part of the Revenge 
of the Green Dragons was filmed in Elmhurst with cameos from locals.[71]
