Game Score is a metric devised by Bill James to determine the strength 
of a pitcher in any particular baseball game. To determine a starting pitcher's 
game score: The maximum possible game score in a nine-inning game while 
allowing no baserunners is 114, possible only if a pitcher goes nine innings 
while striking out every batter he faces and facing three batters per inning. 
The pitcher receives 50 to begin with, and loses no points because there 
are no hits, walks, or runs of any kind. He receives 27 points for the 
27 outs, and 10 points for five innings completed after the fourth inning, 
for a total of 87. In this "perfect score" scenario, the pitcher would 
have to strike out every hitter he faced, netting him an additional 27 
points, for a grand total of 114. The maximum possible score actually involves 
an extremely unlikely scenario in which three base runners reach base each 
inning on wild pitches or passed balls on third strikes. If this were to 
happen such that no one scored, and the pitcher recorded all outs by strikeout, 
a pitcher could theoretically record six strikeouts per inning, and thus 
54 for the game, netting him 54 points in addition to the 87 he would have 
received as described above, for a total of 141. The highest game score 
for a nine-inning game in the history of baseball is Kerry Wood's one-hit, 
no walk, 20-strikeout shutout performance for the Chicago Cubs against 
the Houston Astros on May 6, 1998. His game score was 105 (50 + 27 + 10 
+ 20 – 2). The highest game score for a no-hitter occurred on October 3, 
2015, when Max Scherzer of the Washington Nationals allowed no hits and 
no walks, striking out 17, against the New York Mets. This is also the 
second-highest nine-inning game score in Major League Baseball history 
at 104 (50 + 27 + 10 + 17). The 100th game score[citation needed] of 100 
points or higher was pitched by Matt Cain in June 2012. Of the 100 such 
games, only ten of them were a regulation nine innings. Higher scores have 
been accomplished in extra-inning games. The two highest game scores ever 
recorded both occurred in the same game: the famous 26-inning duel from 
1920, Joe Oeschger scored 153 and Leon Cadore scored 140. Oeschger had 
earlier scored a 102 in a 14-inning game in 1917 against Jeff Pfeffer, 
who scored 114. Oeschger's record in these games was 0-0, because both 
ended in ties and were called by darkness. In all, there have been nine 
games in which both starting pitchers scored 100 points; all required extra 
innings and none has occurred since 1971. Juan Marichal and Warren Spahn 
scored 112 and 97, respectively, during a complete game 16-inning match 
up; Spahn's score fell below 100 because of Willie Mays' game-winning home 
run in the bottom of the 16th. 21 pitchers with 100 or more game score 
points did so in losing games, including Harvey Haddix, who scored a 107 
for the game in which he took a perfect game into the 13th inning. The 
highest-ever losing game score was 118, from Art Nehf, who outlasted the 
opposing starter by six innings but lost in the 21st inning. 17 of the 
100+ game scores came in suspended tie games. Only seven of the 100 highest 
game scores were no-hitters. Walter Johnson and Nolan Ryan had the most 
100-point game scores with four apiece. Johnson had two in 1918, one in 
1919, and a fourth in 1926; Ryan's came in 1972, 1973, 1990 and 1991. Warren 
Spahn had three 100-point game scores, in 1948, 1952 and 1960. Juan Marichal 
had three 100-point game scores, in 1963, 1966 and 1969. Eight pitchers 
had two 100-point game scores: Art Nehf (1917 and 1918), Joe Oeschger (1917 
and 1920), Burleigh Grimes (1918 and 1920), Eric Erickson (1918 and 1921), 
Herb Pennock (1923 and 1925), Jim Maloney (1964 and 1965), Frank Tanana 
(1975 and 1976), and Max Scherzer (both 2015).[1] Corey Kluber's game score 
of 98 in an eight-inning, no-run, one-hit, no-walk, 18-strikeout performance 
against the St. Louis Cardinals on May 13, 2015, is the highest by any 
pitcher in MLB history in a non-complete game. Indians bench coach Brad 
Mills removed him after the eighth inning, and Cody Allen pitched the ninth 
inning to seal a 2-0 win.[2] The previous holder of the record was Matt 
Harvey, who achieved a game score of 97 for a nine-inning non-complete 
game against the Chicago White Sox. (Harvey's New York Mets won in ten 
innings.)[3][4] On June 18, 2014, Clayton Kershaw posted the 2nd highest 
ever game score for a 9-inning, no-hit effort. Kershaw struck out 15 while 
walking none, and the only baserunner was the result of a throwing error. 
His game score of 102 is the third-highest for a 9-inning game in MLB history 
(50 + 27 +10 + 15).[5] The lowest game score in baseball history was Allan 
Travers' 26-hit, 24-run start for the Detroit Tigers on May 18, 1912. His 
game score was a −52. This performance only came about because the regular 
Tiger players staged a strike in protest of Ty Cobb's suspension. To avoid 
a forfeit, local college players (including Travers) were enlisted as impromptu 
fill-ins. The lowest game score since 1957 was Oakland pitcher Mike Oquist's, 
who allowed 16 hits and 14 earned runs in five innings on August 3, 1998, 
for a −21. The game score concept expands on Major League Baseball's official 
definition of a quality start. MLB defines a quality start as six or more 
innings pitched while allowing three or fewer earned runs. The game score 
system defines a quality start as a game score at or above 60 hypothetically 
(50 base + 18 for outs recorded + 4 for the 5th/6th inning - 12 for three 
earned runs), but as it is rare that an earned run occurs with no walks/hits, 
the true game score for a baseline quality start would be somewhere between 
50-60. Furthermore, the game score rewards pitchers for going deeper into 
the game, even if they give up more earned runs. A baseline quality start 
would be lost if, after going into deeper innings than the 6th, a pitcher 
gives up more earned runs. The advantage that the system has over the official 
definition is that it allows a statistician a better view of the degree 
of quality in a pitcher's performance. Game scores can be quantified, and 
a pitcher's performance tracked over time. It is also possible to compare 
different pitchers. If one averages a 60 and another averages 55, presumably 
the first pitcher has had a better season. In terms of high scores, the 
system favors current pitchers. It is difficult to achieve a very high 
score in a game without amassing a substantial number of strikeouts. In 
earlier eras, even for the very best pitchers, strikeouts were less plentiful. 
For instance, Cy Young's two no-hitters earned scores of just 90 and 88 
due to their low strikeout totals (three and two, respectively). However, 
most of the all-time high game scores occurred in baseball's earlier era, 
when starting pitchers were permitted to remain in games longer than today; 
four of the top six all-time game scores were accomplished in stints of 
21 innings or more. Thirteen times in Major League Baseball history, a 
pitcher has achieved a game score of 100 or higher in a 9-inning game.[6] 
The total number of game scores listed for each pitcher are starts in which 
he reached 90 points or higher. The parenthetical totals represent the 
highest score in the pitcher's career, and the number of game scores equal 
to or greater than 100 (if any). This is not a complete list and includes 
only pitchers with five or more games of 90 or higher (through 10/9/2015).[6] 
On December 14, 2014, Tom Tango introduced Game Score Version 2.0[7] in 
an attempt to, as he claims, "fix the gaps" in the original Game Score 
calculation devised by James more than thirty years previously.[8] Key 
changes made by Tango to the original formula included applying a base 
of 40 points to starting pitchers' game scores (instead of 50); equalizing 
the penalty for giving up a walk with that of giving up a hit; and introducing 
home runs given up into the equation.[8] The new 2.0 formula is: Tango 
subsequently published his new formula on April 11, 2016 on FanGraphs.com,[8] 
a well-known and respected baseball analysis and statistics website, which 
at the same time also began including the new measure on their game log 
pages for individual pitchers for whom the building block data are available.
