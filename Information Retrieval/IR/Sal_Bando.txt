Salvatore Leonard Bando (born February 13, 1944) is a former third baseman 
and executive in professional baseball who played for the Kansas City and 
Oakland Athletics (1966–76) and Milwaukee Brewers (1977–81). He played 
college baseball at Arizona State University for coach Bobby Winkles. During 
the A's championship years of 1971-75, he captained the team and led the 
club in runs batted in three times. He was the second American League third 
baseman to hit 200 career home runs, joining Brooks Robinson, and retired 
among the all-time leaders in games (5th, 1896), assists (6th, 3720) and 
double plays (7th, 345) at his position. In a 16-season career, Bando was 
a .254 hitter with 242 home runs and 1039 RBI in 2019 games played. His 
younger brother Chris was a catcher for the Cleveland Indians. Over four 
consecutive American League Championship Series from 1971–74, he hit five 
home runs in 17 games, including two in a 1973 game and a solo shot in 
Game 3 of the 1974 ALCS, a 1-0 victory. Playing almost exclusively at third 
base in Oakland, Bando played every infield position while with the Brewers, 
even making one appearance as a relief pitcher in a 1979 game. After retiring, 
Bando briefly served as a color analyst for NBC (teaming with Bob Costas[1] 
on telecasts), then became a front office executive with the Brewers. He 
was named the team's general manager on October 8, 1991. For a variety 
of reasons (including low payroll, bad free agent signings and poor amateur 
drafts) Bando managed to build only one winning team in seven plus years 
as GM. That team, the 1992 Brewers, was largely composed of players he 
inherited from his predecessor Harry Dalton. They ended the season with 
92 wins and 70 losses under the only manager Bando ever hired in his tenure 
as GM, Phil Garner, his former teammate in Oakland. One of the lowlights 
of his tenure happened after that 1992 season, when the club did not offer 
Paul Molitor salary arbitration until the 11th hour. Molitor signed a free-agent 
deal with the Toronto Blue Jays. At the time, Bando was quoted as disparaging 
Molitor as "only a (designated hitter)". The following season, Molitor 
was named the World Series MVP as the Blue Jays won their second championship. 
This was noted by some as one of the worst public relations blunders in 
Brewers history, although Bando has since claimed that his words were taken 
out of context.[2] Bando held his position as GM until August 12, 1999. 
He was reassigned within the organization and replaced by former Atlanta 
Braves assistant GM Dean Taylor. Bando did a voice cameo in the episode 
of The Simpsons titled "Regarding Margie." Currently, Bando is CEO of Middleton 
Doll Company, a Columbus, Ohio enterprise with multiple other businesses 
associated with it.[3] He is also a Catholic and involved in some Catholic 
organizations.[4][5] Bando's son, Sal Bando, Jr., was the head baseball 
coach at High Point University from 2001 to 2008 and compiled a 144–243
