Home Away The Victoria Aces are an Australian baseball team who compete 
in the Claxton Shield Baseball Championship. One of the founding teams 
of the Claxton Shield in 1934, they competed until 1988. Thereafter the 
Claxton Shield was awarded to the winner of the Australian Baseball League 
until 2002. In 1999 the Victoria Aces accepted an invitation to join the 
International Baseball League of Australia. They competed in the League 
for two seasons (1999â€“2000 and 2002); after this point the Claxton Shield 
reverted to a competition similar to 1988. Baseball Victoria (BV) selects 
the Victoria Aces team to compete in the Claxton Shield. BV also governs 
all levels of baseball in the state of Victoria, and directly runs the 
State League, regarded[by whom?] as the top level of competition in the 
state and the source of the majority of Australian-based players selected 
for the Victoria Aces. Victoria Ace's 19-man roster for 2009 Claxton Shield, 
announced by Baseball Victoria,[1] consisted of: Infielders Outfielders
