In baseball, the vulcan changeup pitch (otherwise known as a vulcan or 
trekkie) is a type of changeup; it closely resembles a forkball and split-finger 
fastball. It is a variation of the circle changeup, and when mastered can 
be extremely effective. Much like a forkball, the vulcan is gripped between 
two fingers on the hand, but rather than the middle and index finger as 
with the forkball or split-finger fastball, it sits in between the middle 
and ring fingers to make a v-shape (Vulcan salute) when releasing to the 
catcher. It is thrown with fastball arm speed but by pronating the hand 
by turning the thumb down, to get good downward movement on it. The pitch 
is uncommon in Major League Baseball. Ian Kennedy throws this style of 
changeup instead of others because he "found it more comfortable and had 
more movement".[1] Among the others who have thrown it are former relievers 
Randy Tomlin[2] and Joe Nelson,[3][4] and most notably former all-star 
closer Éric Gagné, for whom the vulcan changeup was considered one of his 
best pitches.[5] Roy Oswalt adopted this pitch during the 2010 offseason 
and prefers it over the circle changeup.[6] John Gant also uses the vulcan 
changeup.[7] Nelson explained his choice for naming the pitch: "It was 
either going to be Nanu Nanu or the Vulcan. Spock just seemed like a cooler 
character than Mork."[8] The pitch has been nicknamed the "trekkie", because 
of the Vulcan symbol, from the show Star Trek, that appears in the grip
