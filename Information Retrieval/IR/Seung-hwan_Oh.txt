KBO NPB Professional records Oh Seung-hwan (Hangul: 오승환; born July 15, 
1982) is a Korean professional baseball relief pitcher for the St. Louis 
Cardinals of Major League Baseball (MLB). He previously played for the 
Samsung Lions of the KBO League in South Korea and the Hanshin Tigers of 
Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) in Japan. He is known as "Dol-bucheo" 
(Stone Buddha) for being unshaken and maintaining an emotionless face in 
every situation. He is considered to be one of the greatest closers in 
the history of Korean baseball. His prowess as a relief pitcher also earned 
him the nickname, "Kkeut-pan Wang" (Final Boss), in Korea and among Cardinal 
fans.[1] Oh attended Kyunggi High School in Seoul, South Korea. He had 
been a pitcher since he began baseball, but he switched to the outfield 
after getting serious arm injuries in 1999. He joined the 2001 KBO draft 
at the end of his last high school season, but, despite intriguing some 
MLB scouts, went undrafted, and Oh elected to attend college instead. Upon 
graduation from high school, Oh started his collegiate career at Dankook 
University, but missed the entire 2001 and 2002 seasons after undergoing 
Tommy John surgery in 2001. In 2003, he came back to the mound, pitching 
limited innings as a relief pitcher. In 2004, his senior year at Dankook 
University, Oh came back – stronger, dominant, in total command and as 
consistent as ever, sweeping most of the Korean college pitching awards. 
In June, Oh made his first appearance for the South Korea national baseball 
team at the 2004 World University Baseball Championship held in Tainan, 
Taiwan. He led his team to the bronze medal, playing most of the games 
in closer duty. The Samsung Lions selected Oh in the second round (5th 
pick, 12th overall) of the 2005 KBO First Year Players draft. After signing 
with the club, he contributed a strong rookie season as a setup man and 
closer in 2005, going 10–1 with a 1.18 ERA, 16 saves (sixth in the league) 
and 115 strikeouts (fifth in the league) in 99 innings pitched over 61 
games. In the 2005 Korean Series, he pitched seven scoreless innings with 
11 strikeouts, appearing in three games as a closer to lead his team to 
the championship. He was named the Korean Series MVP. After the season, 
Oh was also named KBO Rookie of the Year.[2] Prior to his second season, 
Oh was selected to the roster of the South Korea national baseball team 
for the inaugural World Baseball Classic. That year, he achieved the first 
of two consecutive seasons with 40-plus saves, 2006 and 2007. His 47 saves 
in 2006 set a KBO League record for one season, a total he repeated in 
2011.[3] Recording his 100th save in fewer games than anyone in KBO League 
history, Oh became the KBO League's all-time saves leader with 277.[2] 
He collected his 200th save in his 333rd career appearance, making him 
the fastest player in all of the world's top professional leagues to achieve 
that total, surpassing the mark of 359 forged by Jonathan Papelbon of Major 
League Baseball.[3] A shoulder injury began interfering with Oh's performance 
in 2009 and continued into 2010. He had his second elbow surgery to remove 
bone spurs in 2010 and returned to the playoffs in the same year.[3] While 
Oh was still playing for the Lions, they became KBO League champions four 
more times. The Lions defeated the Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks, the Nippon Professional 
Baseball champions, to earn the Asia Series championship in 2011, and become 
the first non-Japanese team to win. Oh earned his second Korean Series 
MVP Award in 2011.[2] He also posted a stellar 1.69 ERA in 444 games over 
the nine seasons that he played for Samsung Lions.[4] Every season with 
the Lions, Oh turned in an ERA under 2.00, except 2009–10, which were shortened 
by injuries. On November 22, 2013, Oh signed a two-year, 990 million yen 
contract with the Hanshin Tigers, the biggest contract for a Korean baseball 
player in Japan.[4] Tigers' manager Wada Yutaka suggested offering some 
Korean-language classes for his players to better communicate with their 
new teammate, especially the catchers and pitching coaches.[5] All throughout 
the 2014 season, he played the role as the Tiger's top closer. He became 
the second Korean player to break the 300-save mark after Lim Chang-yong 
in a 3–0 defeat Yomiuri Giants on July 22, 2014.[6] On the September 24 
match with the BayStars, he picked up his 36th save of the season and broke 
the NPB record for saves by a foreign pitcher in his first year in the 
NPB.[7] Eddie Gaillard (2000) and Dennis Sarfate (2011) each saved thirty-five 
games in a season.[8] He also now holds the record for the most saves by 
a Korean pitcher in their first year in Japan, beating the previous record 
set by Lim, who had 33 saves in 2008 when he started playing for the Swallows.[9] 
Oh notched a total of 39 saves for the season, breaking the NPB record 
for saves by a Korean pitcher in a single season set by Sun Dong-yeol (38 
saves) with Chunichi in 1997.[10] Oh played an instrumental role in Hanshin's 
advance to the Japan Series in October. After pitching four innings in 
two games against Hiroshima during the Climax Series (first stage), he 
took the mound in all four games against the Yomiuri Giants and successfully 
secured consecutive victories for his team. Including the last five regular-season 
games, he pitched in 11 consecutive games and recorded the save in all 
of them. When the Tigers finally won the series in October 18, Oh received 
the Climax Series MVP award, becoming the first Korean pitcher to do so 
in his first year in NPB. His fast and heavy balls, together with his calm 
and unwavering expression even in crisis situations, earned him a new nickname 
"Stone Guardian" from Japanese baseball fans.[11] With Hanshin in 2015, 
Oh appeared in 54 games, logging 69 1⁄3 innings and striking out 66, walking 
16 and allowing a 2.75 ERA.[12] He saved another 41 games that year, breaking 
his own NPB single-season record for most saves by a Korean pitcher.[2] 
In two seasons while playing in Japan, he had a 2.25 ERA with 80 saves. 
Through eleven total professional seasons in South Korea and Japan, he 
recorded 357 saves, a 1.81 ERA, and 10.7 strikeouts per nine innings in 
646 1⁄3 IP.[13] On January 11, 2016, Oh signed a one-year contract with 
the St. Louis Cardinals of Major League Baseball (MLB),[14] with a club 
option for a second season. The Cardinals had scouted him for seven years 
while he pitched in Asia. During contract negotiations with St. Louis, 
Oh indicated that his goal was to become the first player to appear in 
the Korean Series, the Japan Series, and the World Series.[15] He was initially 
assigned to help set up for incumbent closer Trevor Rosenthal.[13] Oh made 
his Major League debut on Opening Day 2016 against the Pittsburgh Pirates. 
He pitched one inning, walking two batters and striking out two batters, 
while throwing 27 pitches. He earned his first major league win against 
the Atlanta Braves on April 10, pitching a scoreless inning in a 12–6 outcome.[16] 
In May, Oh began to receive attention as a top candidate for the National 
League (NL) Rookie of the Year Award.[17] In his first 31 games and 32 2⁄3 
innings, he had struck out 46 batters – tied for first among NL relievers 
– while walking eight batters and permitting an ERA of 1.65.[12] On June 
25, the Cardinals removed a struggling Rosenthal from the role as closer, 
and determined that Oh, lefty Kevin Siegrist, and righty Jonathan Broxton 
would instead serve in the role by committee.[18] Oh recorded his first 
MLB save on July 2 by pitching a perfect ninth with two strikeouts against 
the Milwaukee Brewers.[19] By saving both games of a doubleheader against 
the San Diego Padres on July 20, Oh was the first Cardinals pitcher to 
do so since Jason Isringhausen in 2004.[20] When Oh finished his 30th game 
on September 9, he triggered the 2017 option, worth $2.75 million.[21] 
A right-handed pitcher, Oh stands 5' 10" (178 cm) and weighs 205 pounds 
(93 kg). His primary pitches include a four-seam fastball – averaging 92–93 
miles per hour (148–150 km/h) and topping out at 96 miles per hour (154 km/h) 
– and a mid-80s slider[22] with a darting motion resembling a cutter.[13] 
Oh's signature pitch is the four-seam fastball, which, due to its hard 
rising movement, earned the nickname "Dol-jikgu" (stone fastball) in Korea. 
By varying the speeds of each pitch, he alters the movement. He also alters 
the delivery of his pitches, creating another factor to change the batter's 
concentration.[23] It was announced in April 2015 that Oh was in a relationship 
with Girls' Generation's Yuri.[24] The couple were confirmed to have broken 
up in October 2015 after six months of dating due to the long distance 
in their relationship.[25] The subject of a Korean investigation related 
to gambling, authorities interrogated Oh about his activities in Macau 
in November 2014 with fellow Korean baseball player Lim Chang-yong. Korean 
law is unusually strict in that it bans, not gambling, but going to casinos 
based outside of the country,[26] even in places where gambling is legal.[27] 
The Seoul Central District Prosecutors Office fined Oh and Lim in January 
2016,[28] and the KBO League suspended Oh for six months.[26] With Japanese 
law toward gambling among athletes similarly restrictive, the Hanshin Tigers 
terminated his contract amid reports he was linked to a Korean crime organization.[29] 
Due to references from fans and media as "The Final Boss" and "Stone Buddha," 
Oh's nickname has frequently drawn comparisons to other notable nicknames 
of MLB players.[30][31][32] Beginning in 2016, Eugene Koo has served as 
Oh's interpreter and de facto personal assistant in assimilating him to
