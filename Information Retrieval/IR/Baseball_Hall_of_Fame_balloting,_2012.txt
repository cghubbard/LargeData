Elections to the Baseball Hall of Fame for 2012 proceeded according to 
rules most recently revised in July 2010. As in the past, the Baseball 
Writers' Association of America voted by mail to select from a ballot of 
recently retired players, with results announced on January 9, 2012. The 
Golden Era Committee, the second of three new era committees established 
by the July 2010 rules change, replacing the Veterans Committee, convened 
early in December 2011 to select from a Golden Era ballot of retired players 
and non-playing personnel who made their greatest contributions to the 
sport between 1947 and 1972, called the "Golden Era" by the Hall of Fame.[1] 
The induction class consists of Ron Santo, elected by the Golden Era Committee,[2] 
and Barry Larkin, elected by the BBWAA.[3] The induction ceremonies were 
held on July 22, 2012 at the Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York.[4] 
On July 21, the Hall presented two awards for media excellence—its own 
Ford C. Frick Award for broadcasters and the BBWAA's J. G. Taylor Spink 
Award for writers.[5] The BBWAA ballot was announced on November 30, 2011. 
The BBWAA was authorized to elect players active in 1992 or later, but 
not after 2006; the ballot included candidates from the 2011 ballot who 
received at least 5% of the vote but were not elected, along with selected 
players, chosen by a screening committee, whose last playing appearance 
was in 2006. All 10-year members of the BBWAA were eligible to vote. The 
ballot consisted of the 14 candidates who received at least 5% of the vote 
in the 2011 election, plus 13 first-time candidates. Voters were instructed 
to cast votes for up to 10 candidates. Under BBWAA rules, write-in votes 
were not permitted. Results of the 2011 election by the BBWAA were announced 
on January 9, 2012.[3] A total of 573 ballots were cast (including nine 
ballots which supported no candidates), with 430 votes required for election. 
A total of 2,921 individual votes were cast, an average of 5.10 per ballot 
- the lowest rate ever. Any candidate who received votes on at least 75% 
of the ballots would be inducted.[3] Those candidates who received less 
than 5% of the vote will not appear on future BBWAA ballots, but may eventually 
be considered by the Veterans Committee.[6] Candidates who were eligible 
for the first time are indicated here with a . The candidate who received 
at least 75% of the vote and was elected is indicated in bold italics; 
candidates selected in subsequent elections, if any, will be indicated 
in italics. The newly eligible candidates included 20 All-Stars, 9 of whom 
were not on the ballot, representing a total of 33 All-Star selections. 
Bernie Williams was the only candidate selected to at least five All-Star 
Games; he was selected exactly five times. The new field of candidates 
featured a pair of four-time Gold-Glove winners (Williams in center, Mike 
Matheny at catcher) and a pair of Rookie-of-the-Year Award winners (Todd 
Hollandsworth and Tim Salmon), neither of whom was ever selected for an 
All-Star Game. The biggest issue surrounding this election, as in elections 
in the recent past, was the controversy over use of performance-enhancing 
drugs (PEDs).[7][8] During the 2012 voting, debate about the influence 
of steroids on the game in the 1990s was widely believed to have affected 
the vote totals for several power hitters on the ballot, including McGwire, 
Bagwell, Walker, Palmeiro, and González, regardless of whether they had 
ever tested positive for steroid use or had even been accused of involvement 
with steroids. Of these players: The field of potential new candidates 
was considered to be weaker than it was in 2011. The most prominent new 
candidates included Bernie Williams, Rubén Sierra, Vinny Castilla, Eric 
Young, Tim Salmon, and Brad Radke. Williams was the only new candidate 
who received enough votes to remain on the ballot in 2013.[3] Players who 
were eligible for the first time who were not included on the ballot were: 
Manny Alexander, Edgardo Alfonzo, Pedro Astacio, David Bell, Giovanni Carrara, 
Mike DeJean, Einar Díaz, Joey Eischen, Scott Erickson, Carl Everett, Jeff 
Fassero, Alex Gonzalez, Danny Graves, Todd Greene, Jason Grimsley, Chris 
Hammond, Rick Helling, Dustin Hermanson, Jose Hernandez, Todd Hollandsworth, 
Damian Jackson, Kevin Jarvis, Steve Karsay, Tim Laker, Matt Lawton, Eli 
Marrero, Mike Matheny, Quinton McCracken, Dan Miceli, Jeff Nelson, Eduardo 
Pérez, Todd Pratt, Curtis Pride, Joe Randa, Mike Remlinger, Félix Rodríguez, 
Michael Tucker, José Vizcaíno, Chris Widger, Tim Worrell and Esteban Yan. 
José Lima last played in 2006, but was eligible for consideration in 2011 
due to his death on May 23, 2010. ESPN.com columnist Jim Caple noted several 
days before the announcement of the 2012 results that the PED issue and 
the BBWAA's limit of 10 votes per ballot was likely to result in a major 
backlog in upcoming elections:[8] In keeping with the restructured Hall 
of Fame voting procedure, the existing BBWAA-appointed Historical Overview 
Committee identified 10 Golden Era candidates who were judged to have made 
their greatest contributions between 1947 and 1972. Along with the 1947–1972 
era, these rules defined the consideration set:[14] Historical Overview 
Committee (11 BBWAA members): Dave Van Dyck (Chicago Tribune); Bob Elliott 
(Toronto Sun); Rick Hummel (St. Louis Post-Dispatch); Steve Hirdt (Elias 
Sports Bureau); Bill Madden (New York Daily News); Ken Nigro (formerly 
Baltimore Sun); Jack O'Connell (BBWAA secretary/treasurer); Glenn Schwarz 
(formerly San Francisco Chronicle); Claire Smith (ESPN); Tracy Ringolsby 
(FSN Rocky Mountain); and Mark Whicker (Orange County Register).[4] The 
Golden Era Ballot for election by the Golden Era Committee on December 
5 was released on November 3, 2011,[15] and the Hall of Fame announced 
the results on December 5, 2011.[2] Kaat, Miñoso, Oliva, and Tiant were 
living when the ballot was announced.[15] Golden Era Committee (16-member 
committee appointed by the Hall's Board of Directors) was announced at 
the same time as the Golden Era ballot:[15] The Committee convened at the 
2011 winter meetings on December 5, 2011 with the standard 75% or 12 of 
16 votes required for election and July 22, 2012 induction.[4] The J. G. 
Taylor Spink Award has been presented by the BBWAA at the annual summer 
induction ceremonies since 1962.[17] Through 2010, it was awarded during 
the main induction ceremony, but is now awarded the previous day at the 
Hall of Fame Awards Presentation. It recognizes a sportswriter "for meritorious 
contributions to baseball writing".[18] The recipients are not members 
of the Hall of Fame but are featured in a permanent exhibit at the National 
Baseball Museum. The three nominees for the 2012 award were selected by 
a three-person BBWAA committee and announced at the BBWAA's annual All-Star 
Game meeting on July 12, 2011 at Chase Field in Phoenix. They were Bob 
Elliott of the Toronto Sun; Paul Hagen, then of the Philadelphia Daily 
News; and Russell Schneider, formerly of The Plain Dealer of Cleveland. 
This was the fourth consecutive year Elliott had been nominated.[19] Under 
BBWAA rules, the winner was to be announced either during the 2011 World 
Series or at the 2011 winter meetings. The winner of the 2012 J. G. Taylor 
Spink Award, announced at the winter meetings, was Elliott, who received 
205 votes from the 455 ballots cast. Hagen received 169 votes and Schneider 
61. Elliott became the first Canadian recipient of the award.[19] This 
is Elliott's second award for writing excellence from a major baseball 
hall of fame. He was the 2010 recipient of the Jack Graney Award, given 
irregularly for excellence in either writing or broadcasting, from the 
Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame.[20] The Ford C. Frick Award, honoring excellence 
in baseball broadcasting, has been presented at the induction ceremonies 
since 1978.[21] Through 2010, it had been presented at the main induction 
ceremony, but is now presented at the Awards Presentation. Recipients are 
not members of the Hall of Fame but are permanently recognized in an exhibit 
at the museum. To be eligible, an active or retired broadcaster must have 
a minimum of 10 years of continuous major league broadcast service with 
a ball club, a network, or a combination of the two. The honor is based 
on four criteria: longevity; continuity with a club; honors, including 
national assignments such as the World Series and All-Star Games; and popularity 
with fans. The recipient was announced during the 2011 winter meetings, 
following a vote by the same committee that selected seven of the finalists 
(below).[22] Ten finalists were announced on October 5, 2011.[22] In accord 
with guidelines established in 2003, seven were chosen by a committee composed 
of the living recipients along with broadcasting historians and columnists. 
Three were selected from a list of candidates by fan voting in September 
2011 at the Hall's Facebook page.[23] Five candidates were living when 
the ballot was announced—the active McCarver, Nadel, and Shannon; and the 
retired Cárdenas and Doucet.[22] On December 7, Tim McCarver, the lead 
analyst for Major League Baseball on Fox since 1996, was named as the recipient. 
A catcher in MLB for 22 years, mostly with the St. Louis Cardinals and 
Philadelphia Phillies, he joined the Phillies' local television broadcast 
team almost immediately after his first retirement as a player in 1979 
(he would briefly return as a player late in the 1980 season). From there, 
he went on to the New York Mets' local broadcast team before moving to 
national network television. McCarver has been an analyst for all four 
of the major U.S. over-the-air broadcast networks during his career.[24] 
McCarver became the second Frick Award winner, after 2009 recipient Tony
