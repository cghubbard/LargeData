Robert Hayes "Bobby" Veach (June 29, 1888 – August 7, 1945) was an American 
baseball player from 1910 to 1930, including 14 seasons in the major leagues. 
He was the starting left fielder for the Detroit Tigers from 1912 to 1923 
and also played for the Boston Red Sox (1924–1925), New York Yankees (1925) 
and Washington Senators (1925). Veach hit for both power and average. He 
compiled a .310 career batting average and finished second to Ty Cobb for 
the 1919 American League batting title with a .355 average. He also led 
the American League in runs batted in (RBIs) three times (1915, 1917, and 
1918) and was among the league leaders 10 times. Nobody in baseball had 
as many RBIs or extra base hits as Veach from 1915 to 1922. Veach was also 
among the best defensive outfielders of his era, regularly ranking among 
the league leaders in putouts, range factor, and fielding percentage. Despite 
being one of the most productive hitters in baseball during his years in 
Detroit, Veach played in the shadows of three Detroit outfielders who won 
16 batting titles and were inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame: Cobb 
in center field and Sam Crawford followed by Harry Heilmann in right field. 
Detroit's 1915 outfield consisting of Veach, Cobb, and Crawford has been 
ranked by baseball historian and statistician Bill James as the greatest 
outfield in history. Veach was born in St. Charles, Kentucky, in 1888. 
His family moved to Madisonville, Kentucky, when he was 12 years old. His 
father was a coal miner, and Veach also began working in the coal mine 
as a boy. In 1915, Veach recalled: "I started in as a miner when I was 
fourteen years old and worked at it in the winters until a couple years 
ago, long after I was earning money as a player."[1] At age 17, Veach moved 
to Herrin, Illinois, where he began playing semi-pro baseball.[1] Veach 
began his professional baseball career in 1910 as a pitcher with the Peoria 
Distillers of the Illinois–Indiana–Iowa League. At the start of the season, 
he was sent to the Kankakee Kays of the Northern Association.[1] He compiled 
a 10-5 record at Kankakee and was recalled to Peoria.[1] In 1911, Veach 
was converted from a pitcher into an outfielder.[1] He appeared in 132 
games for Peoria, compiling a .297 batting average with 40 extra base hits.[2] 
Veach began the 1912 season with Peoria, batting .325 with 24 extra base 
hits in the first 56 games of the season.[2] In July 1912, he was promoted 
to the Indianapolis Indians of the American Association. He remained in 
Indianapolis for only two months and two days before being purchased by 
the Detroit Tigers.[1] In early September, Veach was purchased by Detroit 
from Indianapolis.[1] He was promptly inserted into the Tigers' lineup, 
replacing Davy Jones as the left fielder in an outfield that included future 
Baseball Hall of Famers Ty Cobb and Sam Crawford. Veach made his major 
league debut on September 6, 1912, at age 24. He appeared in 23 games for 
Detroit in 1912, compiling a .342 batting average in 79 at bats.[3] Veach 
remained the Tigers' starting left fielder for 12 years.[3] In 1913, as 
Veach adjusted to playing in the major leagues, his batting average declined 
to .269, but he continued to show power and speed with 22 doubles, 10 triples 
and 22 stolen bases. He also showed patience at the plate, drawing 53 bases 
on balls to boost his on-base percentage to .346.[2] Veach improved steadily 
in 1914, raising his batting average to .275.[3] He also had 14 triples, 
which was the fifth best total in the American League that season, trailing 
teammate Sam Crawford's total of 26 triples, which remains the American 
League record. His 74 RBIs in 1914 also ranked ninth in the league.[4] 
Veach also continued to show patience at the plate, drawing 50 bases on 
balls and ranking fifth in the league with an at bat to strikeout ratio 
of 18.1.[4] He also showed great range in the outfield, ranking fourth 
among the league's outfielders with 282 putouts.[3] In 1915, Veach has 
a breakout season, becoming one of the most dominant batters in the American 
League. His batting average increased by 38 points to .313, and he led 
the American League with 40 doubles (nine more than any other player) and 
112 RBIs (tied with teammate Sam Crawford). He was also among the league 
leaders with 53 extra base hits (2nd), 178 hits (3rd), 247 total bases 
(3rd), .313 batting average (6th), .390 on-base percentage (6th), .434 
slugging percentage (7th), and 68 bases on balls (10th).[5] Veach also 
performed well defensively. His 297 putouts ranked fifth among the league's 
outfielders, and his .975 fielding percentage also ranked fifth.[3] The 
Tigers' 1915 outfield, with Veach in left, Cobb in center, and Crawford 
in right has been ranked by baseball historian Bill James as the greatest 
outfield of all time.[6] During the 1915 season, Baseball Magazine published 
a five-page feature story on Veach, concluding that "with his advent the 
Detroit outfield is one of the most powerful, if not the most powerful, 
ever assembled on a diamond."[1] Though the league average batting average 
in 1915 was .248, Cobb hit .369 with 99 RBIs, Crawford hit .313 and drove 
in 112 runs, and Veach hit .313 with 112 RBIs. The three Detroit outfielders 
ranked #1, #2, and #3 in total bases and RBIs.[5] The 1915 Tigers won 100 
games, but finished in second place, one game behind the Boston Red Sox.[7] 
Veach continued his solid hitting from 1915 to 1923, batting over .306 
in eight of those nine years. Veach finished among the American League 
leaders in hits (8 times), batting average (6 times), doubles (8 times), 
triples (8 times), RBIs (10 times), extra base hits (7 times), and total 
bases (8 times). On June 9, 1916, Veach scored a run to end Babe Ruth's 
scoreless innings streak at 25. Ruth then evened the score with one of 
the longest home runs ever at Navin Field, deep into the right field bleachers. 
Veach had his best year as a batter in 1919 when he led the American League 
in hits (191), doubles (41), and triples (17). Only Babe Ruth and Ty Cobb 
topped him in other offensive categories. His .355 batting average was 
second to Cobb, and his 65 extra base hits, 101 RBIs and 279 total bases 
were second behind Ruth. On September 17, 1920, he became the first Detroit 
Tiger to hit for the cycle with six hits in a 12-inning game. In 1921, 
Veach was the subject of a motivational tactic by new player-manager Cobb. 
Cobb believed that Veach, who came to bat with a smile and engaged in friendly 
conversation with umpires and opposing pitchers, was too easygoing. Tigers 
historian Fred Lieb described Veach as a "happy-go-lucky guy, not too brilliant 
above the ears", who "was as friendly as a Newfoundland pup with opponents 
as well as teammates". (Fred Lieb, "The Detroit Tigers") Hoping to light 
a fire in Veach, Cobb persuaded Harry Heilmann, who followed Veach in the 
batting order, to taunt Veach from the on-deck circle. "I want you to make 
him mad. Real mad. . . . [W]hile you're waiting, call him a yellow belly, 
a quitter and a dog. … Take that smile off his face". The tactic may have 
worked, as Veach had career-highs in RBIs (126) and home runs (16), and 
his batting average jumped from .308 to .338. Cobb had promised to tell 
Veach about the scheme when the season was over, but never did. When Heilmann 
tried to explain, Veach reportedly snarled, "Don't come sucking around 
me with that phony line". Veach never forgave Heilmann. (Al Stump, Cobb: 
The Life and Times of the Meanest Man Who Ever Played Baseball (1994), 
pp. 327–328.) In the eight years from 1915 to 1922, Veach had 852 RBIs 
and 450 extra base hits, more than any other player. The top five in RBI

In addition to his batting skills, Veach's speed and strong arm made him 
a fine left fielder. He led the American League in games played in left 
field seven times (1914–1915, 1917–1918, and 1920–1922).[8] He led the 
American League in putouts by an outfielder in 1921 with 384. He also led 
the league in assists with 26 in 1920.[9] Veach's 206 career assists and 
2.28 range factor are among the top 10 in Major League history for left 
fielders. Though left fielders generally receive fewer fielding chances 
than other outfielders, Veach regularly covered more ground and accepted 
more chances than the league average for all outfielders. His 1921 range 
factor of 2.72 is one of the highest season totals for a left fielder in 
Major League history. His 384 putouts in 1921 and 26 assists in 1920 are 
also among the highest by a left fielder since 1900. Veach's range as an 
outfielder is also shown by a comparison with Ty Cobb, the center fielder 
he played beside for most of his career. In 1914, Veach had 282 putouts 
and 22 assists, compared to 177 and 8 for Cobb.[10] Though center fielders 
typically receive more chances, and Cobb had a reputation as a fine center 
fielder, Veach bested Cobb in chances in seven of the nine years they played 
side by side in the Detroit outfield: 1914 (304–185), 1916 (356–343), 1918 
(291–237), 1919 (352–291), 1920 (383–254), 1921 (405–328), and 1922 (391–344). 
In 1923, Veach continued to hit for average at .321, but his RBI production 
dropped to 39. In January 1924, the Tigers sold Veach to the Boston Red 
Sox. That year, Veach regained his power, hitting 99 RBIs and 49 extra 
base hits. In May 1925, the Red Sox traded Veach to the New York Yankees. 
Veach played 56 games for the Yankees, batting .353 with a .474 slugging 
percentage. On August 9, 1925, in his final season, Veach became the only 
player to pinch hit for Babe Ruth in the years after Babe switched from 
a pitcher to an outfielder. The Chicago Tribune reported the next day: 
"The fans were treated to the unusual spectacle of His Royal Highness being 
yanked for a pinch hitter."[11] The Yankees released Veach less than two 
weeks later, and Veach was picked up by the Washington Senators. This proved 
to be good luck for Veach, as the Senators won the 1925 pennant. On September 
19, 1925, Veach broke up Ted Lyons's bid for a no-hitter with a two-out 
ninth-inning single. The young Goose Goslin got the start for the Senators 
at left field, but Veach got one at bat in the World Series pinch-hitting 
for Muddy Ruel in Game 2. Fittingly, Veach collected an RBI on a sacrifice 
fly in his final Major League at bat.[12] After ending his Major League 
career in 1925, Veach played four seasons with the Toledo Mud Hens of the 
American Association from 1926 to 1929. In 1927, a 39-year-old Veach led 
the Mud Hens (with manager Casey Stengel) to their first American Association 
crown with a 101–67 record. Veach had a .363 batting average and drove 
in a league-leading 145 RBIs. The next year, at age 40, Veach hit .382 
to capture the 1928 American Association batting crown.[13] In December 
1943, Veach underwent an abdominal operation at Grace Hospital in Detroit. 
Veach died in 1945 at his home in Detroit after a long illness at the age 
of 57. Veach was survived by his wife and three sons. Veach was buried 
at White Chapel Memorial Park Cemetery in Troy, Michigan, in the Mausoleum,
