The Luis Aparicio Award is given annually to a Venezuelan player in Major 
League Baseball (MLB) who is judged to have recorded the best individual 
performance in that year. The winner of the award is determined by a vote 
conducted by Venezuelan sports journalists and Spanish-language media around 
the world.[1] It is named after former MLB shortstop Luis Aparicio,[1] 
who is the only player from Venezuela to be inducted into the National 
Baseball Hall of Fame.[2] The award was first presented in 2004, and was 
created in order to honour Aparicio's major league career and to commemorate 
his father, who died thirteen years before his son was elected into the 
Hall of Fame.[3] Johan Santana and Miguel Cabrera are the only players 
to win the Luis Aparicio Award more than once, with the latter having won 
the award five times.[4] Cabrera won the MLB Most Valuable Player (MVP) 
Award and Hank Aaron Award alongside the Luis Aparicio Award in 2012 and 
2013,[5][6] becoming the first and—as of 2013—only Venezuelan to win the 
MLB MVP Award.[7][8] Santana, the 2004 and 2006 recipient, also won the 
Cy Young Award in those two years,[5] winning by a unanimous vote on each 
occasion.[9] Santana (2006) and Cabrera (2012) are the only award winners 
to also earn the pitching and batting Triple Crown respectively in the 
same season.[10] In accomplishing the feat, Cabrera became the first player 
in 45 years to achieve a Triple Crown in batting since Carl Yastrzemski 
in 1967,[11] while Santana became the first pitcher since Dwight Gooden 
in 1985 to secure a "Major League Triple Crown" by leading all of MLB in 
wins, earned run average and strikeouts.[12] Francisco Rodríguez compiled 
a major league record of 62 saves in a single season in 2008 and went on 
to win the Rolaids Relief Man Award in the same year as the Luis Aparicio 
Award.[13][14][15] Three winners—Cabrera, Magglio Ordóñez and Carlos González—were 
batting champions in their respective leagues in the same year they won 
the award.[16] The award is presented annually before a baseball game hosted 
by the local team, Águilas del Zulia, on November 18 in Aparicio's hometown 
of Maracaibo, Zulia.[4] The date marks both the feast of the Virgin of 
Chiquinquirá—the patron saint of Zulia[17]—and the anniversary of Aparicio's 
professional debut.[3] As of 2015[update], the most recent recipient of
