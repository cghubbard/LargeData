As Player: As Manager: As Player: As Manager: Wilbert Robinson (June 29, 
1863 – August 8, 1934), nicknamed "Uncle Robbie", was an American catcher, 
coach and manager in Major League Baseball. He was inducted into the Baseball 
Hall of Fame in 1945. Born in Bolton, Massachusetts, Robinson was a catcher 
in the minor New England League in 1885 and made it to the major leagues 
in 1886 with the Philadelphia Athletics of the American Association, where 
he remained until 1890. He lasted in the majors until 1902, playing much 
of his career with two separate Baltimore Orioles franchises – from 1890 
to 1899 with the Orioles team which folded after the 1899 National League 
season, and in 1901–02 with the American League team which moved to New 
York City in 1903 and became the Yankees. He also spent one season, 1900, 
with the St. Louis Cardinals. Over the course of his career, Robinson played 
1,316 games as a catcher, which prepared him for his second baseball career 
as a manager. The star catcher of the Orioles dynasty which won three straight 
titles from 1894 to 1896, he compiled a career batting average of .273, 
with a peak of .353 in the heavy-hitting season of 1894. Durable behind 
the plate, he caught a triple-header in 1896, followed by a double-header 
the following day. He also was the first catcher to play directly behind 
the batter at all times, as the previous practice had been to play farther 
back when there were fewer than two strikes. A highlight of his career 
was a seven-hit game June 10, 1892. He also batted in 11 runs in that game; 
on September 16, 1924, as manager of the Brooklyn Dodgers, he saw that 
record eclipsed as Jim Bottomley of the St. Louis Cardinals batted in 12 
runs. (Robinson, whose team was in contention for the pennant at the time, 
lamented, "Why did he have to save all those hits for us? Couldn't he have 
made some of them against [ Giants manager] McGraw?") While owners of a 
bowling, billiards and pool hall in Baltimore, Robinson and McGraw introduced 
the sport of duckpin bowling within the city of Baltimore in 1899. Robinson 
and McGraw joined as business partners in the Baltimore Orioles, a team 
that would debut in the new American League in 1901.[1] McGraw served as 
player-manager of the AL Orioles in 1901 and the beginning of the 1902 
season, at which point he departed to the New York Giants. Robinson succeeded 
McGraw as manager of the Orioles. After the season, McGraw enticed Robinson 
to be his pitching coach from 1903 to 1913, during which time the Giants 
won five NL pennants. Robinson would not don the manager's cap again in 
the majors until 1914, when he took over the Brooklyn franchise in the 
National League. The team was known by various nicknames, including Bridegrooms, 
Superbas, and Dodgers, but during Robinson's managerial tenure, which lasted 
until 1931, the club was as often referred to as the "Robins" in honor 
of their manager, who had acquired the nickname "Uncle Robbie". (The frequently 
error-prone Dodger teams of this era were also sometimes derisively known 
as "Uncle Robbie's Daffiness Boys".) In his 18 years at the helm of the 
Brooks, Robinson compiled a record of 1375–1341, including National League 
championships in 1916 and 1920 – Brooklyn's only pennants between 1901 
and 1940. Those two clubs lost in the World Series to the Boston Red Sox 
and Cleveland Indians, respectively. His 1375 NL victories were, at the 
time, the 3rd-highest total in NL history, trailing only the totals of 
McGraw (then with 2652) and Fred Clarke (1602). Robinson was highly regarded 
for his ability to draw outstanding performances from his pitching staffs, 
a result of his many years as a catcher. Among the pitchers he guided to 
success were Joe McGinnity with both Orioles teams and the Giants, Rube 
Marquard with the Giants, and Dazzy Vance and Burleigh Grimes with the 
Dodgers. Another pitcher who would later recall Robinson's excellent advice, 
although they never played together during a regular season, was John Tener, 
who in the 1910s served simultaneously as NL president and Governor of 
Pennsylvania. On March 13, 1915, at spring training in Daytona Beach, Florida, 
Robinson decided to try to set a record of sorts by catching a baseball 
dropped from an airplane being flown 525 feet (160 m) overhead. Ruth Law, 
the aviator, supposedly forgot to bring a baseball and instead dropped 
a grapefruit, which splattered all over the manager. The grapefruit made 
such a mess that Robinson thought he had lost his eye because of the acid 
and the bloodlike splatter that covered him. He quickly realized that it 
was a joke when he saw his teammates burst out in laughter. Outfielder 
Casey Stengel, later a successful manager himself, is generally believed 
to have convinced Law to make the switch. From this point on Robinson referred 
to airplanes as fruit flies. Robinson was manager when Al López started 
out as a catcher in the majors. Robinson watched Lopez' style and finally 
hollered, "Tell that punk he got two hands to catch with! Never mind the 
Fancy Dan stuff." But Lopez went on to eventually surpass Robinson's record 
of games behind the plate. After his retirement from managing, Robinson 
became the president of the Atlanta Crackers minor league team. He died 
in Atlanta at 71 years of age following a brain hemorrhage, and was buried 
in the New Cathedral Cemetery in Baltimore. Robinson's brother, Fred Robinson, 
also played briefly in the majors, appearing in 3 games for the 1884 Cincinnati 
Outlaw Reds of the Union Association. Robinson was elected to the Baseball
