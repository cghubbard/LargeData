As player As coach Clarence Elmer Mitchell (February 22, 1891 â€“ November 
6, 1963) was an American Major League Baseball pitcher. He played in the 
majors from 1911 to 1932 for the Detroit Tigers, Cincinnati Reds, New York 
Giants, Brooklyn Robins, Philadelphia Phillies and St. Louis Cardinals. 
Mitchell was known for throwing the spitball, and he was one of the 17 
pitchers allowed to continue throwing the pitch after it was outlawed in 
1920. On October 10, 1920, in Game 5 of the 1920 World Series, Mitchell 
made history when, with men on first and second and no outs, he hit a rising 
liner that Cleveland Indians second baseman Bill Wambsganss caught. Wambsganss 
was able to double up the lead runner, Pete Kilduff, who was still running 
toward third, then tagged out Otto Miller, who had come down from first 
base. Mitchell is the only player in Major League history to hit into an 
unassisted triple play in a World Series. In his next at bat, Mitchell 
hit into a double play, making him responsible for five outs in two consecutive 
trips to the plate, another World Series record.[1] Mitchell also has the 
distinction of being the last legal lefthanded spitball pitcher. After 
being released from the majors after the 1932 season at age 41, he played 
several more years in the minors, including three years in the Pacific
