The 2003 Detroit Tigers lost more games than any other team in American 
League history and came within one loss of tying the 1962 New York Mets 
for the most losses in modern major league history. The team's record was 
43-119, giving them a .265 winning percentage, and broke the Philadelphia 
Athletics' 1916 American League record of 117 losses. They were outscored 
by 337 runs over the course of the season (928 to 591) and finished 47 
games behind the Minnesota Twins. Blame for the dismal season was shared 
by both the pitching staff, which had an ERA of 5.30, and the batters, 
who finished with a team batting average of .240—19 points below the American 
League's .259 batting average. The season was the Tigers’ 103rd since they 
entered the AL in 1901. The 2003 Tigers seemed like a sure bet to break 
the 1962 Mets' record for most losses when they stood at 38-118 after 156 
games, but they won five of their last six to avoid ignominy. On September 
27, in their next-to-last game, the Tigers came back from an 8-0 deficit 
to beat the Minnesota Twins 9-8.[1] Then the Tigers won the season finale 
to avoid tying the record and received a standing ovation from the crowd. 
Mike Maroth went 9-21 for the 2003 Tigers and became the first pitcher 
to lose 20 games in more than 20 years.[2] Tigers' pitchers Maroth, Jeremy 
Bonderman (6-19), and Nate Cornejo (6-17) were #1, #2, and #3 in the major 
leagues in losses for 2003—the only time in major league history that one 
team has had the top three losers. While the 2003 Tigers rank as the third 
worst team in major league history based on loss total (behind the 1899 
Cleveland Spiders and 1962 Mets), they fare slightly better based on winning 
percentage. As shown in the chart below, the 2003 Tigers rank only as the 
9th worst team in history based on winning percentage. Unlike the 2003 
Tigers, most of the other teams usually described as the worst of all time 
were plagued by significant off-field troubles. The 1899 Spiders and 1916 
A's had essentially been reduced to minor-league status after unloading 
their best players. The 1890 Alleghenys had also been reduced to minor-league 
status after practically their entire roster bolted to the Players' League. 
The 1935 Braves were plagued by underfinanced ownership that didn't even 
finish out the season. The 1962 Mets were a first-year expansion team. 
For this reason, the 2003 Tigers have been described as possibly "the worst 
team of all time without a good excuse."[3] Designated hitter/left fielder 
Dmitri Young was the one member of the 2003 Tigers to have a truly good 
year, with a .297 batting average, 29 home runs, and .537 slugging percentage. 
According to Win Shares, the Tigers would have had about six fewer wins 
without him.[3] On the pitching staff, Jamie Walker stands out as the one 
pitcher who had a good season. Walker appeared in 78 games (2nd most in 
the AL) and had an ERA of 3.32 (Adjusted ERA+ of 130). Some blamed first-year 
manager Alan Trammell for the performance of the 2003 Tigers. However, 
the 2002 team was 55-106 under manager Luis Pujols. Also in Trammell's 
defense, the Tigers did not sign any significant new talent in 2003 and 
actually lost several key players from the 2002 team, including the team's 
best starter, Jeff Weaver, closer Juan Acevedo, second baseman Damion Easley, 
right fielder Robert Fick, and designated hitter Randall Simon. Dean Palmer, 
who had 275 career home runs, tried to resuscitate an injury-plagued career, 
and could not succeed at that; his career came to an end. In short, Trammell 
inherited a team in shambles—an already bad team made worse by the departure 
of its best performers. Even with fellow 1984 teammates Kirk Gibson and 
Lance Parrish on the coaching staff, Trammell could not turn the team around 
in 2003. After the 2003 season, the Tigers acquired Iván Rodríguez, Carlos 
Guillén, Ugueth Urbina, and Rondell White. With the infusion of new talent, 
Trammell was able to lead the turn-around, as the team improved to 72-90 
in 2004, a 29-game improvement over the 2003 season—the largest improvement 
in the American League since Baltimore's 33-game improvement from 1988 
to 1989. Three years after losing 119 games, the Tigers went 95-67 and 
made it to the 2006 World Series. Players common to the 2003 and 2006 Tigers 
teams included Brandon Inge, Ramón Santiago (who spent 2004 and 2005 with 
the Seattle Mariners), Craig Monroe, Dmitri Young (released in September 
2006), Omar Infante, Mike Maroth, Jeremy Bonderman, Nate Robertson, Jamie 
Walker, Wilfredo Ledezma, and Fernando Rodney. The improvement from 2003 
to 2004 was actually more substantial than the 24-game improvement from 
2005 (71-91) to 2006 (95-67). [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10]
