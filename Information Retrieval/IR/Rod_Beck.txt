Rodney Roy "Rod" Beck (August 3, 1968 – June 23, 2007[1]), nicknamed "Shooter", 
was a relief pitcher in Major League Baseball who played for the San Francisco 
Giants (1991–1997), Chicago Cubs (1998–1999), Boston Red Sox (1999–2001) 
and San Diego Padres (2003–2004). He batted and threw right-handed.[2] 
The Oakland Athletics drafted Beck as a starting pitcher in the 13th round 
(327th pick) of the 1986 Major League Baseball Draft.[3] Prior to the 1988 
season, he was traded to the San Francisco Giants organization.[2] In 1989, 
while with the San Jose Giants of the California League, he posted a record 
of 11–2 between opening day and June 14, when he was promoted to the Shreveport 
Captains of the Double A Texas League.[4][5] Beck made his Major League 
debut on May 6, 1991,[2] against the Montreal Expos. His performance was 
forgettable (2.0 IP, 3 H, 2 ER),[6] but his season numbers were more impressive. 
He had a 3.78 ERA, pitched 52 1⁄3 innings in 31 games, and struck out 38 
while walking 13.[2] In 1992, Beck took over as the regular closer from 
Dave Righetti and posted a record of 3–3 with 17 saves and a 1.76 ERA. 
He pitched 92 innings over 65 games and struck out 87 while walking only 
15.[7] In 1993 he recorded 48 saves, including 24 consecutive. At the time, 
both marks were Giants franchise records.[8] Beck found success using a 
sinker, slider, and splitter.[9] On September 17 and 18, 1997, the Los 
Angeles Dodgers came to San Francisco to play a two-game series at Candlestick 
Park.[10] The Dodgers were leading the National League West with a record 
of 84–67. The Giants were in 2nd place with a record of 82–69; 2 games 
behind.[11] The Giants won the first game 2–1 behind lefty Kirk Rueter. 
In that contest, Barry Bonds hit a two-run homer in the first inning for 
the Giants, while Raúl Mondesí hit a solo shot in the fifth for the Dodgers. 
Beck did not pitch in the game.[12] On September 18, he came into the game 
in the top of the 10th with the score tied 5–5.[13] As the season had progressed, 
Beck had lost his closer's job to Roberto Hernández.[14] In fact, Beck 
had blown a save three days earlier in Atlanta while trying to close that 
game. He had given up 4 earned runs in just 2⁄3 of an inning.[15] Beck 
got into trouble immediately by giving up consecutive singles to Mike Piazza, 
Eric Karros, and Raúl Mondesí.[16] With the bases loaded, nobody out and 
the crowd booing loudly, manager Dusty Baker came out to talk to Beck, 
who was obviously struggling. Baker told Beck, "You're the guy."[17] Baker 
left Beck in, and Beck proceeded to strike out Todd Zeile looking at an 
inside-corner fastball. When he got pinch hitter Eddie Murray to bounce 
a splitter into an inning-ending double play, the crowd of 52,188 went 
crazy. Two innings later, Giants reserve catcher Brian Johnson led off 
with a home run to left field, giving Beck a 6–5 win. The Giants, now tied 
with the Dodgers for the division lead,[13] would go on to win the Western 
Division crown.[14] After the 1997 season, the Giants felt Beck's best 
years were behind him, and allowed him to leave as a free agent to sign 
with the Chicago Cubs, replacing him with Robb Nen.[18] Beck set a career 
high in saves in 1998, his first season with the Cubs, converting 51 of 
58 chances.[2] However, in the 1999 season, Beck battled injury, and was 
traded by Chicago to the Boston Red Sox in exchange for reliever Mark Guthrie 
and a player to be named later,[19] who turned out to be Cole Liniak.[20] 
Beck pitched well for the surging Red Sox, although he struggled in the 
postseason (giving up a Bernie Williams walk-off home run in Game One of 
the 1999 ALCS)[21] and was not as good in his two full seasons with the 
team as he had been in the past.[2] After the 2001 season, Beck had Tommy 
John surgery.[22] Beck successfully recovered from Tommy John surgery and 
floated around in the minors before being signed by the Cubs.[22] While 
pitching for the team's AAA affiliate Iowa Cubs during his comeback, Beck 
gained national attention for living in a mobile home behind the team's 
Sec Taylor Stadium (now Principal Park) in Des Moines. Beck warmly welcomed 
fans to drop by and visit, signed autographs and offered free beer.[23] 
He was later traded to the San Diego Padres.[2] In 2003, Beck returned 
to the Major Leagues with the Padres,[2] filling in for the injured Trevor 
Hoffman.[24] He converted 20 saves in 20 chances, while posting a 1.78 
ERA.[2] His statistics earned him the National League Comeback Player of 
the Year award.[25] In 2004, Beck dealt with personal problems during Spring 
Training[26] and struggled in a seventh inning role for the Padres. Beck 
was released by San Diego in August.[2] On June 23, 2007, Beck died alone 
at his home in Phoenix, Arizona.[1][27] The Maricopa County medical examiner 
has not publicly disclosed the cause of death and the Phoenix police did 
not suspect foul play.[1] Beck's ex-wife stated she believed Beck's death 
to be drug related.[28] Cocaine and heroin were found in his home and bedroom.[29] 
Beck was buried in Phoenix wearing his Chicago Cubs uniform despite pitching 
only two seasons for the team.[30] He was added to the 2008 ballot for 
the Baseball Hall of Fame, earlier than the typical retirement rule due
