The 1993 Atlanta Braves season was the Braves' 128th in existence and their 
28th since moving to Atlanta. The Braves were looking to improve on their 
98-64 record from 1992 and win the National League pennant for a third 
consecutive year. The Braves finished the season with a 104-58 record to 
win the National League West for the third consecutive year after trailing 
the San Francisco Giants, who finished in second place by one game, for 
most of the season in what is generally regarded as last real pennant race 
before playoff expansion.[1] 1993 was also the last year that the team 
competed in the National League West, as they would shift to the National 
League East for 1994. Despite their excellent regular season, the Braves' 
streak of National League pennants ended at two as they fell to the underdog 
Philadelphia Phillies in six games in the National League Championship 
Series. By a twist of fate, the Braves beat the Pittsburgh Pirates, the 
Phillies in-state rivals, in back-to-back NLCS series in 1991 and 1992, 
but in 1993, lost to the Pirates in-state rivals. Infielders Manager Coaches
