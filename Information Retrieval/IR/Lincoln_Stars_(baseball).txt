The Lincoln Stars (also known as the Lincoln Stars of New York or the New 
York Lincoln Stars) were a Negro league baseball team that played in New 
York City from 1914 to 1917.[1] Their home stadium was the Lenox Oval, 
located at Lenox Avenue and 145th Street in Manhattan.[2][3] Although they 
lasted less than four years, they were a good team that featured three 
players who would later be elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame—Oscar 
Charleston, John Henry Lloyd, and Louis Santop.[4][5][6][7] In 1914, Jess 
and Ed McMahon, brothers who had previously founded the Lincoln Giants, 
formed the Lincoln Stars.[8] In the team's first summer, its roster included 
second baseman William Parks, left fielder Jap Payne, power-hitting first 
baseman Bill Pettus, and catcher Bill Pierce.[9] In the fall of 1914, the 
Lincoln Stars toured Cuba. A number of players were recruited from the 
Lincoln Giants, including manager and center fielder Spottswood Poles, 
pitchers Dick Redding and Dizzy Dismukes, catcher Louis Santop, and left 
fielder Jules Thomas. In 14 games played against Habana and Almendares 
between October 9 and November 2, the Stars won 4, lost 9, and tied 1. 
Researcher Gary Ashwill has tabulated complete statistics for 13 of the 
14 games. In a pitching-dominated series, the Stars' top hitters in these 
games were Poles, who hit .313, and Santop, who hit .289. Redding had 2 
wins and 3 losses with a 2.59 total run average and 32 hits, 17 walks, 
and 27 strikeouts in 48⅔ innings pitched. Both of Redding's wins were shutouts—a 
4-hit, 1–0 victory over Habana on October 15 and a 3-hit, 3–0 win over 
the same team on October 19.[10] The 1915 team was regarded as perhaps 
the strongest black team in the East.[11] The team comprised Redding and 
Doc Sykes as pitchers, Pierce as catcher, Pettus at first base, Bill Kindle 
at second base, Sam Mongin at third base, John Henry Lloyd at shortstop, 
Jude Gans in left field, Poles in center field, and Santop in right field 
and as backup catcher.[12] They played a championship series against the 
Chicago American Giants, but the series ended in controversy. Each team 
won five games, and the deciding eleventh game was called in the fourth 
inning with the Stars ahead by a run, but the game was never completed 
or replayed.[13] After the series, Lloyd and Gans jumped the Stars to rejoin 
the American Giants.[14] The 1916 Lincoln Stars again were one of the strongest 
teams in the East.[13] This season has the most complete statistics of 
any of their seasons, based on league statistics compiled by Ashwill.[2] 
The Stars played 23 known games against major Negro league opponents. Their 
overall record was 10–13, with a 5–3 record against Eastern opponents and 
5–10 against Western teams. The Stars' roster consisted of pitchers Sykes, 
Gunboat Thompson, and Ad Langford, catcher Santop, first baseman Pettus, 
second baseman C. Johnston, third baseman Lee Miller, shortstop Parks, 
left fielder Ashby Dunbar, center fielders Bruce Hocker and Oscar Charleston, 
and right fielder Peter Green. Statistics for individual players were compiled 
from box scores for 18 of their games. Their top hitters were Pettus, who 
hit .408, Santop (.318), Parks (.311), Charleston (.308), and Dunbar (.294). 
The highlight of their season was another championship series against the 
Chicago American Giants, 7 games played from August 6 through August 18.[2] 
Just before the series, Oscar Charleston jumped the team to rejoin the 
Indianapolis ABCs, with whom he had played the previous season. Despite 
the absence of Charleston, the Stars took a 3–2 lead in the series, but 
then lost the last two games.[13][2] The 1917 Stars team failed to finish 
the season. Many of the players moved on to play with the Pennsylvania
