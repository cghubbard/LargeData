The Illinois State Redbirds are the athletic teams that represent Illinois 
State University in Normal, Illinois. Teams play at the NCAA Division I 
level (FCS in football). The football team competes in the Missouri Valley 
Football Conference while most other teams compete in the Missouri Valley 
Conference. The fight song is Go, You Redbirds.[2] A member of the Missouri 
Valley Conference, Illinois State University sponsors eight men's and eleven 
women's teams in NCAA sanctioned sports:[3] Illinois State began its athletics 
program more than 100 years ago. The school, which had already been an 
NCAA Division I competitor for a decade, left behind its independent status 
in 1980 and affiliated itself with the Missouri Valley Conference. From 
1981 to 1992, Redbird women's teams competed under the Gateway Conference 
banner before women's sports were absorbed into the Missouri Valley Conference. 
From approximately 1910-1970, Illinois State was affiliated with the Illinois 
Intercollegiate Athletic Conference. Athletics at Illinois State consists 
of 19 intercollegiate sports, having won 125 league titles in 23 years.[citation

Conference, with the football team playing in the Missouri Valley Football 
Conference, formerly known as the Gateway Conference. On 7 April 2015, 
seven men died when a privately owned Cessna 414 carrying Redbirds men's 
basketball coach Torrey Ward, Deputy Director of Athletics Aaron Leetch, 
and five community members and athletics supporters crashed.[4] The group 
was returning from Indianapolis, where they attended the NCAA Men's Division 
I Basketball Championship Final. The plane crashed in a soybean field outside 
of Central Illinois Regional Airport in McLean County.[5] The University 
and Athletics Department memorialized the victims in several ways, including 
a uniform patch worn by all 19 teams throughout the 2015–16 sports seasons. 
In addition, a permanent memorial called Redbird Remembrance directly in 
the heart of the Redbird Athletics. [1] Missouri Valley Conference Titles:

College World Series eight times in 1969, 1970, 1971, 1972, 1973, 1976, 
1978 and 1981.[8] The team finished as runner-up in the first WCWS in 1969, 
and in 1973, falling to Arizona State, 4-3, in 16 innings in the title 
game. On the day of the 1973 defeat, Redbirds pitcher Margie Wright heroically 
hurled 30 innings in three games. Ironically, for pitching too many innings 
in one day, a three-woman Illinois sports commission suspended her from 
pitching in any game in her upcoming senior season and also banned the 
softball team from post-season play in 1974. Wright went on to play professional 
softball, followed by a 33-year head coaching career. She coached the Redbirds 
from 1980–85, followed by 27 years at Fresno State, where she became the 
first NCAA Division I softball coach to reach 1000 wins and the NCAA's 
all-time winningest softball coach.[8]:23–24 Basketball starters introduced
