Jerry Dean Lumpe (June 2, 1933 – August 15, 2014) was a Major League Baseball 
second baseman for the New York Yankees (1956–59), Kansas City Athletics 
(1959–63) and Detroit Tigers (1964–67).[1] Lumpe was a member of the 1958 
World Series championship team, appearing in six games for the Yankees. 
He started three of them at third base, including the decisive Game 7 victory 
over the Milwaukee Braves. He also played for New York in the previous 
year's World Series, won in seven games by the Braves. He was traded on 
May 26, 1959 by the Yankees along with pitchers Johnny Kucks and Tom Sturdivant 
to the Kansas City A's in exchange for outfielder Hector Lopez and pitcher 
Ralph Terry. Late in his career, in his first season with Detroit, he was 
named to the 1964 American League All-Star team. Lumpe was raised in Warsaw, 
Missouri. He and future Yankee teammate Norm Siebern had been basketball 
players together for Missouri State University, when the school was known 
as Southwest Missouri State, where they won two NAIA Championships in 1952 
and 1953, although both needed to miss some tournament games to report 
to baseball spring training camp. Lumpe maintained strong ties to the university 
and died in 2014 in Springfield, Missouri, the school's home. He finished
