Rick Hahn is the Vice-President/General Manager of the Chicago White Sox. 
In July 2011, SportsIllustrated.com ranked Hahn as the #1 General Manager 
Candidate in Major League Baseball.[1] Similarly, in March, 2010, Baseball 
America named Hahn the #1 General Manager prospect in Baseball.[2][3] And, 
during the 2008 season, BaseballProspectus.com had named Hahn one of the 
top-ten GM candidates in the game.[4] Following the 2007 season, Hahn withdrew 
his name from consideration for the General Manager's job of the St. Louis 
Cardinals, who eventually named John Mozeliak to the position,[5] and he 
also declined the opportunity to interview for the Pittsburgh Pirates GM 
job prior to Neal Huntington being named to that post.[6] Additionally, 
the White Sox declined Hahn permission to interview for the Seattle Mariners 
GM job following the 2008 season.[7] Hahn is a graduate of the University 
of Michigan, Harvard Law School and Kellogg Graduate School of Management
