As player As manager As coach Anthony "Tony" La Russa, Jr. (/ləˈruːsə/; 
born October 4, 1944) is an American professional baseball player, manager, 
and executive currently serving as chief baseball analyst and advisor for 
the Arizona Diamondbacks. He is best known for his tenures as manager of 
the Chicago White Sox, Oakland Athletics, and St. Louis Cardinals of Major 
League Baseball (MLB). His MLB career has spanned from 1963 to the present. 
As a manager, La Russa guided his teams to three World Series titles, six 
league championships and twelve division titles in 33 seasons. His 2,728 
wins as a manager ranks third all-time in major league history, behind 
Connie Mack and John McGraw. As a player, La Russa made his major league 
debut in 1963 and spent parts of five major league seasons with the Kansas 
City/Oakland Athletics, Atlanta Braves and Chicago Cubs. After a shoulder 
injury during the 1964–65 off-season, he played much of the remainder of 
his career in the minor leagues until retiring in 1977. Following his playing 
career, he earned a Juris Doctor degree from Florida State University. 
La Russa was named manager of the White Sox in the middle of the 1979 season 
and guided the White Sox to an American League West division title four 
seasons later. Despite being fired in the middle of the 1986 season, the 
Athletics hired him less than three weeks later, and La Russa led the A's 
to three consecutive American League championships from 1988 to 1990 and 
the 1989 World Series title. He left Oakland following the 1995 season 
to manage the Cardinals, and led the team to three National League championships 
and the 2006 and 2011 World Series titles. La Russa retired after winning 
the 2011 title and 33 seasons as a major league manager. Three months later, 
he accepted a position assisting fellow former manager, Joe Torre, the 
executive vice president for MLB operations. In 2014, he became the Chief 
Baseball Officer for the Arizona Diamondbacks. On December 9, 2013, he 
was unanimously elected to the Hall of Fame by the 16-member Veterans Committee. 
The induction ceremony was held at Cooperstown, New York, on July 27, 2014.[1] 
On August 16, 2014, he was inducted into the St. Louis Cardinals Hall of 
Fame Museum. La Russa was signed by the Kansas City Athletics as a middle 
infielder prior to the start of the 1962 season. He came up to the A's 
the next season, making his debut on May 10, 1963. In the following off-season, 
he suffered a shoulder injury while playing softball with friends, and 
the shoulder continued to bother him during the remainder of his playing 
career. Over the next six seasons, La Russa spent most of his time in the 
minor leagues, making it to the now-Oakland A's roster in 1968 and 1969. 
He spent the entire 1970 season with the big club, and then late in 1971 
the A's traded him to the Atlanta Braves. His final big league playing 
stop was with the Chicago Cubs, where he appeared as a pinch runner in 
one game, on April 6, 1973. He also spent time in the organizations of 
the Pittsburgh Pirates, Chicago White Sox, and St. Louis Cardinals. In 
132 total games played (40 in the starting lineup) he went 35-for-176, 
a batting average of .199. His 23 walks pushed his on-base percentage to 
.200. He had 7 RBI and scored 15 runs. He made 63 appearances at second 
base, 18 at shortstop, and two at third base, fielding .960 in 249 total 
chances and participating in 34 double plays.[2] La Russa earned a Juris 
Doctor (J.D.) degree from Florida State University College of Law in 1978[3] 
and was admitted to the Florida Bar on July 30, 1980. He is associated 
with a Sarasota law firm although he is not eligible to practice at this 
time.[4] La Russa has been quoted as saying, "I decided I'd rather ride 
the buses in the minor leagues than practice law for a living." Shortly 
before graduating from FSU College of Law, LaRussa spoke with one of his 
professors about his post-graduation plans, indicating to his professor 
that he had an opportunity to coach in the minor leagues and asking his 
professor what he should do. LaRussa's professor responded, "Grow up, you're 
an adult now, you're going to be a lawyer." [5] He is one of a select number 
of major league managers in baseball history who have earned a law degree 
or passed a state bar exam; others include John Montgomery Ward (New York 
Giants, Brooklyn and Providence, late 1800s), Hughie Jennings (Detroit, 
1907–20, New York Giants, 1924), Miller Huggins (St. Louis Cardinals and 
New York Yankees, 1913–29), Muddy Ruel (St. Louis Browns, 1947), Jack Hendricks 
(St. Louis Cardinals, 1918, Cincinnati, 1924–29), and Branch Rickey (St. 
Louis Browns, 1913–15, St. Louis Cardinals, 1919–25). La Russa is also 
commonly credited for the advent of the modern specialized bullpen.[6] 
La Russa credits Loren Babe and Paul Richards of the White Sox organization 
for helping him to become a manager.[7] The White Sox gave La Russa his 
first managerial opportunity in 1978 by naming him skipper of their Double-A 
affiliate, the Knoxville Sox of the Southern League. La Russa spent a half-season 
at Knoxville before being promoted to the White Sox coaching staff when 
owner Bill Veeck changed managers from Bob Lemon to Larry Doby. Doby was 
fired at the end of the season; Don Kessinger, former star shortstop of 
the crosstown Cubs, was named the White Sox' player-manager for 1979, and 
La Russa was named manager of the Triple-A Iowa Oaks of the American Association. 
The White Sox fired Kessinger with a 46–60 record two-thirds of the way 
through the 1979 season and replaced him with La Russa. The White Sox played 
.500 baseball for the rest of the 1979 campaign. He credits Paul Richards 
with first inspiring him to believe he could succeed as a major league 
manager.[citation needed] La Russa was named American League Manager of 
the Year in 1983, when his club won the AL West but fell to the Baltimore 
Orioles in the American League Championship Series. The White Sox fired 
La Russa after the club got off to a 26–38 start in 1986. He finished his 
White Sox career with a 522–510 regular season record and a 1–3 post–season 
record.[8] La Russa had a break of less than three weeks before his old 
club, the Athletics, called him to take over as manager. He led the club 
to three consecutive World Series, from 1988 to 1990, sweeping an earthquake-delayed 
Series from the San Francisco Giants in 1989. In 1988 and 1990, La Russa's 
Athletics lost the World Series to the Los Angeles Dodgers and the Cincinnati 
Reds by wide margins, despite the fact that the A's were heavily favored 
on both occasions. He earned two additional Manager of the Year awards 
with the A's, in 1988 and 1992, again winning the Western Division in the 
latter year. After the 1995 season, in which the A's finished 67–77, the 
Haas family, with whom La Russa had a close personal relationship, sold 
the team after the death of patriarch Walter A. Haas, Jr. La Russa left 
to take over for Joe Torre at the helm of the St. Louis Cardinals. He finished 
his Athletics career with a 798–673 regular season record and a 19–13 post–season 
record.[8] In his first campaign with the Cardinals in 1996, La Russa clinched 
the National League Central Division title (and also finished National 
League runner-up), a feat his clubs repeated in 2000, 2001, 2002 (his fourth 
Manager of the Year award), 2004, 2005, 2006, and 2009. The Cardinals also 
tied for the National League Central crown with the Houston Astros in 2001. 
He became the first manager to win the award four times. The 2004 edition 
was arguably one of the finest seasons in Cardinals' history as they won 
105 games and won another 100 the next year. La Russa's fourth Manager 
of the Year award was arguably the most emotional; La Russa led the Cardinals 
to the National League Championship Series (where they would ultimately 
lose in five games to the San Francisco Giants) in a year in which the 
Cardinals were traumatized by the deaths of beloved Hall of Fame broadcaster 
Jack Buck and 33-year-old pitcher Darryl Kile just four days later. After 
a 2004 regular season in which the Cardinals led the NL in runs scored 
(855) while allowing the fewest (659), La Russa's Cardinals defeated the 
Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League Division Series, 3 games to 
1.[9][10] St. Louis then took on the Houston Astros in the National League 
Championship Series. In a tense series with opposing pitcher Roger Clemens 
at the top of his game, Cardinals third baseman Scott Rolen hit a game-winning 
two-run home run off Clemens in Game 7 following Jim Edmonds' rally saving 
catch.[11] This home run sent the Cardinals to their first World Series 
for the first time since 1987. However, they met a Boston Red Sox team 
that had surmounted a 3–0 deficit against the New York Yankees who swept 
them in four games.[12] 2006 saw a return to the World Series, this time 
with a 4–1 victory over the Detroit Tigers, managed by Jim Leyland. The 
team's 83–78 regular season record is the worst ever by an eventual World 
Series champion, usurping the 1987 Minnesota Twins' 85–77 campaign. La 
Russa is the second manager to win a World Series in both the American 
League and the National League – a distinction shared with his mentor, 
Sparky Anderson. When he came to St. Louis, La Russa wore number 10 to 
symbolize the team's drive to their 10th championship and pay tribute to 
Anderson, who wore number 10 while manager of the Cincinnati Reds.[13] 
After winning the championship, he chose to continue wearing number 10 
to pay tribute to Anderson.[14] It was as a player with the A's that La 
Russa first met catcher Dave Duncan, who would join his coaching staff 
in Chicago in 1983. The two have worked together on every La Russa-managed 
team since, and he often credits Duncan as playing a key role in his success.[citation 
needed] La Russa led the Cardinals to the 2011 World Series, after defeating 
the Philadelphia Phillies in the NLDS (3-2), and then the Milwaukee Brewers 
in the NLCS (4-2). The Cardinals defeated the Texas Rangers in Game 7 of 
the World Series to win the franchise's 11th World Championship, and the 
third of LaRussa's managerial career. He passed Bobby Cox for 2nd place 
on the all-time post-season wins list with his 68th win in Game 3.[15] 
Three days following the World Series win, La Russa announced his retirement, 
ranking second all-time in post-season wins with 70, third all-time with 
2,728 regular season wins, second with 5,097 games managed, and second 
with 33 years (tied) managing with John McGraw. He finished his Cardinals 
career with a 1408–1182 regular season record and 50–42 post–season record.[8] 
La Russa also became the first manager in Major League Baseball history 
to retire in the same season after winning a World Series title.[16] Even 
though he had retired, La Russa managed the National League All Stars in 
the 2012 MLB All-Star Game for the final time in his managerial career.[17] 
The National League won 8-0. Shortly after his retirement from the playing 
field, La Russa took a position with MLB assisting former managerial rival 
Joe Torre in matters of on-field discipline. He held this position for 
more than two seasons. On May 17, 2014, La Russa accepted a position as 
Chief Baseball Officer for the Arizona Diamondbacks to oversee the entire 
baseball operations department.[18][19][20] After joining the Diamondbacks 
in 2014, La Russa was reunited with former assistants Duncan and McKay, 
and the general manager who hired him to manage the White Sox in 1979, 
Roland Hemond.[20] On December 4, 2015, the Diamondbacks agreed to a six-year 
contract with free agent pitcher Zack Greinke worth a total of $206.5 million. 
At that time, it held the highest annual average value in MLB, exceeding 
$34.4 million per year, and was also the largest contract by total value 
in team history.[21] La Russa ranks third in major league history in victories 
(2,728), trailing only Connie Mack (3,731) and John McGraw (2,763). He 
managed 5,097 games, joining Mack as the second manager or coach in American 
sports history to reach 5,000 games.[22][23][24] In 2004, he became the 
sixth manager in history to win pennants with both American and National 
League teams; in 2006 he became the first manager ever to win multiple 
pennants in both leagues and the second manager to win the World Series 
in both leagues. La Russa has also joined Mack as the second manager to 
win World Series titles in three decades and to win pennants in four. He 
is one of only four managers to be named Manager of the Year in both of 
baseball's major leagues. La Russa is the winningest manager in St. Louis 
Cardinals history, with 1,408 wins and 1,182 losses (.544) and 1 tie as 
manager of the club since 1996. He was 522–510–3 (.506) with the Chicago 
White Sox 1979–1986, leading the club to its first postseason appearance 
in 24 years in 1983, and 798–673 (.542) with the Oakland Athletics 1986–1995, 
winning three consecutive AL pennants from 1988 to 1990; he also holds 
the record for victories by an Athletics manager since the franchise relocated 
to Oakland in 1968. His 2,000th game managing the Cardinals came on May 
31, 2008. La Russa became the leader in wins by Cardinals' managers on 
August 31, 2007, when the Cardinals defeated the Cincinnati Reds 8–5, passing 
Red Schoendienst (1,041–955) to take the title. He managed his 2,500th 
win against the Royals at Kansas City on June 21, 2009 in baseball|2009]], 
becoming only the third manager to attain that win level after Mack and 
McGraw.[25][26] After the retirement of Atlanta Braves manager Bobby Cox 
in 2010, La Russa was the longest tenured manager in Major League Baseball, 
and with the resignation of longtime NBA head coach Jerry Sloan from the 
Utah Jazz on February 10, 2011, La Russa had been the longest tenured bench 
boss among all the Big Four sports leagues, until his retirement following 
his 2011 World Series victory with the Cardinals. La Russa became eligible 
as a candidate for the Baseball Hall of Fame in 2013 through voting by 
the Expansion Era Committee for induction in 2014. On November 4, 2013, 
La Russa's inclusion on the Expansion Era ballot was announced with fellow 
former Cardinals Ted Simmons, Joe Torre and Dan Quisenberry. The Baseball 
Writers' Association of America's Historical Overview Committee listed 
the candidates on the ballot and voted the following December 8.[27] La 
Russa was inducted into the 2014 Hall of Fame class as a manager.[28] In 
January, 2014, the Cardinals announced La Russa among 22 former players 
and personnel to be inducted into the St. Louis Cardinals Hall of Fame 
Museum for the inaugural class of 2014.[29] In 2012, he became the second 
manager to manage the All-Star Game (2012) after retiring since John McGraw 
in 1933. With his All-Star Game 8–0 win in Kansas City, he became the first 
manager to win an All-Star Game in both leagues.[30] La Russa and second 
wife, Elaine, are the founders of Tony La Russa's Animal Rescue Foundation, 
headquartered in Walnut Creek, California, which saves abandoned and injured 
animals as well as running programs to bring dogs and cats to abused children, 
hospital patients, seniors and shut-ins. La Russa is also a vegetarian.[31] 
The La Russas have two daughters, Bianca & Devon, and reside in Alamo, 
California. La Russa has two older daughters, Andrea and Averie from his 
first marriage to Luzette Sarcone. La Russa and Sarcone divorced in 1973 
and Sarcone received full custody of their daughters. La Russa married 
Elaine Coker shortly after his divorce to Sarcone became official.[32] 
La Russa is also personal friends with celebrities outside the sports world, 
such as pianist and songwriter Bruce Hornsby, Bruce Springsteen, and jazz 
bassist Christian McBride.[citation needed] In 2007, at a concert in San 
Francisco on La Russa's birthday, Hornsby played a comedic song he named 
"Hooray For Tony". The original song, titled "Hooray For Tom", is La Russa's 
favorite Hornsby song. In the "Hooray For Tony" version, Hornsby mentions 
the "Bash Brothers" Mark McGwire and José Canseco (from La Russa's days 
as the manager of the Oakland A's), Albert Pujols, Jim Edmonds, ARF, and 
La Russa's World Series Championships.[citation needed] La Russa is a graduate 
of the University of South Florida and the Florida State University College 
of Law. La Russa has Italian and Spanish ancestry, and speaks fluent Spanish.[33][34][35] 
His father's parents were migrants from the Italian island of Sicily and 
his mother's family originated from Spain.[36] Having a father who could 
speak Spanish and Italian and a mother who could speak Spanish, La Russa 
claimed in a 2008 interview that “Spanish was my first language.”[36] He 
was inducted into the National Italian American Sports Hall of Fame in 
1998.[33] La Russa was also inducted into the Hispanic Heritage Baseball 
Museum Hall of Fame on April 11, 2008 in a pregame ceremony at AT&T Park.[35] 
La Russa and his family had an uncredited extra role in the film Angels 
in the Outfield. The La Russas also made an appearance in an episode of 
Housecat Housecall, a reality show on Animal Planet presented by Purina 
Cat Chow, during the show's third season, which began on June 5, 2010.[citation 
needed] In 1980, La Russa appeared as a contestant on the game show To 
Tell The Truth, and helped fool the celebrity panel.[37] In June 2010, 
La Russa was asked about a tea party protest taking place during his game 
against the Arizona Diamondbacks that criticized the Diamondbacks' position 
against the controversial new Arizona immigration statute. La Russa expressed 
support for the Tea Partiers' right to free speech to protest at the ballpark. 
He also stated, "I'm actually a supporter of what Arizona is doing... you 
know if people don't fix their problems they have to take care of it themselves."[38] 
La Russa and Pujols attended Glenn Beck's "Restoring Honor" rally on August 
28, 2010 in Washington, D.C. while the Cardinals were in town for a series 
against the Washington Nationals.[39] LaRussa decided to attend after being 
told by Beck that the rally was not political in nature.[40] Throughout 
the 2011 season, La Russa has been struggling with shingles. He originally 
disclosed that it was conjunctivitis, however, on May 10, after a visit 
to the Mayo Clinic (Scottsdale, Arizona), he disclosed that he was dealing 
with a case of shingles, and had to take off a few days for treatment and 
rest.[41] Because bench coach Joe Pettini was named 'acting manager' instead 
of 'interim manager', it assures that La Russa will be credited for all 
wins and losses the team plays without him there.[42] On March 22, 2007 
La Russa was arrested in Jupiter, Florida for suspicion of driving under 
the influence of alcohol. He was found asleep at the wheel of his running 
SUV with the car in park at a stop sign. He was booked at the Palm Beach 
County Jail and blew a .093 blood- alcohol content, above the legal limit 
of .08.[43] Calling his arrest on the DUI charge an "embarrassment", La 
Russa apologized to "anyone who is close to me, members of the Cardinals 
organization, our fans." He was defended by the organization and players, 
such as Albert Pujols. On November 28, 2007 La Russa pleaded guilty to 
DUI, saying it was in the best interest of all concerned. "I accept full 
responsibility for my conduct, and assure everyone that I have learned 
a very valuable lesson and that this will never occur again", La Russa 
said in a statement released by his attorney. On June 4, 2009, the St. 
Louis Post-Dispatch reported that La Russa had sued the online social network 
platform Twitter the previous month for a fake page established under his 
name on the site. La Russa claimed that he had "suffered significant emotional 
distress (and) damage to reputation" because of the profile. The fake profile 
made several "distasteful references" to La Russa and his team, according 
to the suit.[44] Twitter's terms of service forbids impersonation directly, 
stating that users "may not impersonate others through the Twitter service 
in a manner that does or is intended to mislead, confuse, or deceive others."[45] 
Reports that Twitter had settled ("the first celebrity lawsuit against 
the 32-million-user site", according to the Wall Street Journal) were rebuffed 
on the official Twitter blog. La Russa eventually filed a request to dismiss 
the suit, while Twitter, whether in regard to the suit or not, continued 
improving its privacy protections.[46] In 2012, La Russa released his New 
York Times bestselling memoir, One Last Strike, which recounts his legendary 
last season as manager of the St. Louis Cardinals and their remarkable 
journey to becoming the 2011 World Series Champions from ten and a half 
games back. In 2005, La Russa was the focus of a book by sportswriter Buzz 
Bissinger. Bissinger's Three Nights in August delves into La Russa's role 
as manager during a 3-game series in 2003 between his Cardinals and manager 
Dusty Baker's Chicago Cubs, their longtime rivals. The book received much 
praise from both fans and critics, though some complained that Bissinger 
sets out to glorify La Russa's "old school" managerial style as a direct 
challenge to the statistical analysis theses of Michael Lewis's 2004 book 
Moneyball. As David Leonhardt of The New York Times wrote of the "stats 
vs. hunches" debate in an August 29, 2005 piece, "what makes this fight 
truly comparable to those that periodically roil the world of art history 
or foreign policy is that the differences between the sides are not as 
great as the sniping between them suggests. La Russa spends much of his 
time jotting down information on index cards and studying statistics in 
his office." George Will's book Men at Work likewise depicted La Russa 
and his long-time pitching coach Dave Duncan as making more use of statistical 
analysis than any other team in the major leagues (this book was published 
in 1990, more than a decade before the Moneyball revolution). La Russa 
also provided the AI for a series of successful video games, Tony La Russa 
Baseball (1991–1997). The games won numerous awards and featured "new" 
statistics selected with La Russa (and provided by prominent sabermetrics 
authors John Thorn and Pete Palmer) as tools for players as they managed
