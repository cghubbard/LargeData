David Robert Joseph Beckham, OBE[4] (/ˈbɛkəm/; born 2 May 1975) is an English 
former professional footballer. He played for Manchester United, Preston 
North End, Real Madrid, Milan, LA Galaxy, Paris Saint-Germain, and the 
England national team for which he held the appearance record for an outfield 
player until 2016 when Wayne Rooney surpassed his total. He is the first 
English player to win league titles in four countries: England, Spain, 
the United States and France. He announced his retirement in May 2013 after 
a 20-year career, during which he won 19 major trophies.[5][6] Known for 
his range of passing, crossing ability and bending free-kicks as a right 
winger, Beckham was twice runner-up for FIFA World Player of the Year and 
in 2004 he was named in the FIFA 100 list of the world's greatest living 
players.[7][8][9] He was inducted into the English Football Hall of Fame 
in 2008. A global ambassador for the sport, Beckham is regarded as a British 
cultural icon.[10][11] Beckham's professional club career began with Manchester 
United, where he made his first-team debut in 1992 aged 17.[12] With United, 
he won the Premier League title six times, the FA Cup twice, and the UEFA 
Champions League in 1999.[12] He then played four seasons with Real Madrid,[13] 
winning the La Liga championship in his final season with the club.[14] 
In July 2007 Beckham signed a five-year contract with Major League Soccer 
club LA Galaxy.[15] While a Galaxy player, he spent two loan spells in 
Italy with Milan in 2009 and 2010. He was the first British footballer 
to play 100 UEFA Champions League games.[12] In international football, 
Beckham made his England debut on 1 September 1996 at the age of 21. He 
was captain for six years, earning 58 caps during his tenure.[16][17] He 
made 115 career appearances in total, appearing at three FIFA World Cup 
tournaments, the 1998, 2002 and 2006 editions and two UEFA European Championship 
tournaments, the 2000 and 2004 editions. One of the most marketable athletes 
in sport, Beckham has consistently ranked among the highest earners in 
football, and in 2013 he was listed as the highest-paid player in the world, 
earning over $50 million in the previous 12 months.[18] He has been married 
to Victoria Beckham since 1999 and they have four children.[19] He has 
been a UNICEF UK ambassador since 2005, and in 2015 he launched 7: The 
David Beckham UNICEF Fund to help protect children in danger around the 
world.[20] In February 2014, MLS announced Beckham and a group of investors 
would own an expansion team in Miami, which would begin in 2016 or 2017.[21] 
Beckham was born at Whipps Cross University Hospital in Leytonstone, London, 
England.[22] He is the son of Sandra Georgina (née West; b. 1949), a hairdresser, 
and David Edward Alan "Ted" Beckham (b. Edmonton, London, July–September 
1948), a kitchen fitter, who married at the London Borough of Hackney in 
1969.[23] He has an older sister, Lynne Georgina, and a younger sister, 
Joanne Louise. He regularly played football in Ridgeway Park, Chingford, 
as a child, and attended Chase Lane Primary School and Chingford County 
High School.[24] In a 2007 interview, Beckham said that, "At school whenever 
the teachers asked, 'What do you want to do when you're older?' I'd say, 
'I want to be a footballer.' And they'd say, 'No, what do you really want 
to do, for a job?' But that was the only thing I ever wanted to do."[25] 
Beckham's maternal grandfather was Jewish,[26] and Beckham has referred 
to himself as "half Jewish"[27] and wrote in his autobiography "I've probably 
had more contact with Judaism than with any other religion".[28] In his 
book Both Feet on the Ground, he stated that growing up he attended church 
every week with his parents, because that was the only way he could play 
football for their team.[29] His parents were fanatical Manchester United 
supporters who would frequently travel to Old Trafford from London to attend 
the team's home matches. David inherited his parents' love of Manchester 
United, and his main sporting passion was football. He attended one of 
Bobby Charlton's football schools in Manchester and won the chance to take 
part in a training session with Barcelona, as part of a talent competition. 
He played for a local youth team called Ridgeway Rovers – coached by his 
father, Stuart Underwood and Steve Kirby. Beckham was a Manchester United 
mascot for a match against West Ham United in 1986. Young Beckham had trials 
with his local club Leyton Orient, Norwich City and attended Tottenham 
Hotspur's school of excellence. Tottenham Hotspur was the first club he 
played for. During a two-year period in which Beckham played for Brimsdown 
Rovers' youth team, he was named Under-15 Player of the Year in 1990.[30] 
He also attended Bradenton Preparatory Academy, but signed schoolboy forms 
at Manchester United on his 14th birthday, and subsequently signed a Youth 
Training Scheme contract on 8 July 1991.[31] Having signed for Manchester 
United as a trainee on 8 July 1991,[32] Beckham was part of a group of 
young players, including Ryan Giggs, Gary Neville, Phil Neville, Nicky 
Butt and Paul Scholes, who were coached by Eric Harrison, and helped the 
club win the FA Youth Cup in May 1992. Known as the 'Class of '92', all 
six players came through Manchester United ranks together and went on to 
be teammates for over a decade.[33] Beckham scored Manchester United's 
second goal in the 30th minute of their 3–1 first-leg win of the final 
against Crystal Palace on 14 April 1992. In the second leg on 15 May, Beckham 
played a full 90-minutes of the fixture which ended 3–2 in favour of Manchester 
United and 6–3 on aggregate. Beckham's impact led to a first-team debut 
on 23 September 1992, as a substitute for Andrei Kanchelskis in a League 
Cup match against Brighton & Hove Albion. Shortly afterwards, Beckham signed 
as a professional on 23 January 1993.[32] Manchester United would again 
reach the final of the FA Youth Cup, where they would face Leeds United. 
The first leg was played on 10 May 1993, where Beckham started in Manchester 
United's 2–0 home loss but was replaced by substitute Robbie Savage. In 
the second leg on 13 May 1993, Beckham played the full 90 minutes of Manchester 
United's 2–1 defeat, which gave Leeds United a 4–1 aggregate score. Beckham 
would also receive honours with the club's reserve team, when the squad 
would win the league in 1994. In September 1994, Beckham went on to gain 
his first full appearance in the club's first team against Port Vale in 
a League Cup fixture. On 7 December 1994, Beckham made his UEFA Champions 
League debut, scoring a goal in a 4–0 victory at home to Galatasaray in 
the final game of the group stage. Despite the victory, however, they finished 
third out of four in their group, behind Barcelona.[34] Beckham then went 
to Preston North End on loan for part of the 1994–95 season to get some 
first team experience. He impressed, scoring two goals in five appearances, 
notably scoring directly from a corner kick.[35] Beckham returned to Manchester 
and finally made his Premier League debut for Manchester United on 2 April 
1995, in a goal-less draw against Leeds United. He played four times for 
United in the league that season, as they finished second behind Blackburn 
Rovers and missed a third successive Premier League title by a single point. 
He was not in the squad for the FA Cup final with Everton on 20 May, which 
they lost 1–0 and were left without a major trophy for the first time since 
1989.[36] United manager Sir Alex Ferguson had a great deal of confidence 
in the club's young players. Beckham was part of a group of young talents 
Ferguson brought into United in the 1990s (known as "Fergie's Fledglings"), 
which included Nicky Butt and Gary and Phil Neville. When experienced players 
Paul Ince, Mark Hughes, and Andrei Kanchelskis left the club after the 
end of the 1994–95 season, his decision to let youth team players replace 
them instead of buying star players from other clubs (United had been linked 
with moves for players including Darren Anderton, Marc Overmars and Roberto 
Baggio, but no major signings were made that summer), drew a great deal 
of criticism. The criticism increased when United started the season with 
a 3–1 defeat at Aston Villa,[37] with Beckham scoring United's only goal 
of the game; however, United would recover from this early season defeat 
and the young players performed well.[38] Beckham swiftly established himself 
as United's right-sided midfielder (rather than a right-winger in the style 
of his predecessor Andrei Kanchelskis) and helped them to win the Premier 
League title and FA Cup double that season, scoring the winner in the semi-final 
against Chelsea and also provided the corner that Eric Cantona scored from 
in the FA Cup Final. Beckham's first title medal had, for a while, looked 
like it would not be coming that season, as United were still 10 points 
adrift of leaders Newcastle United at the turn of the new year, but Beckham 
and his team-mates had overhauled the Tynesiders at the top of the league 
by mid March and they remained top until the end of the season. Despite 
playing regularly (and to a consistently high standard) for Manchester 
United, Beckham did not break into the England squad before Euro 1996.[39] 
"It changed my life. The ball seemed to be in the air for hours and it 
all went quiet. Then the ball went in and it just erupted. I was on cloud 
nine. I just wanted to shake everybody's hand and be out on the pitch for 
an hour." At the beginning of the 1996–97 season, Beckham was given the 
number 10 shirt that had most recently been worn by Mark Hughes. On 17 
August 1996 (the first day of the Premier League season), Beckham became 
something of a household name when he scored a spectacular goal in a match 
against Wimbledon. With United leading 2–0, Beckham noticed that Wimbledon's 
goalkeeper Neil Sullivan was standing a long way out of his goal, and hit 
a shot from the halfway line that floated over the goalkeeper and into 
the net.[41] When Beckham scored his famous goal, he did so in Adidas Predator 
shoes custom-made for Charlie Miller ("Charlie" embroidered on boots), 
which had been given to Beckham by mistake.[42] In a UK poll conducted 
by Channel 4 in 2002, the British public voted the goal No.18 in the list 
of the 100 Greatest Sporting Moments.[43] During the 1996–97 season, Beckham 
became an automatic first-choice player at Manchester United helping them 
to retain the Premier League championship, and was voted PFA Young Player 
of the Year by his peers.[44] On 18 May 1997, Eric Cantona retired as a 
player and left the coveted number 7 shirt free, and with Teddy Sheringham 
arriving from Tottenham Hotspur as Cantona's successor, Beckham left his 
number 10 shirt for Sheringham and picked up the iconic number 7 shirt, 
famously worn by club legends George Best, Bryan Robson and Eric Cantona, 
and subsequently by Cristiano Ronaldo.[45] Manchester United started the 
1997–98 season well but erratic performances in the second half of the 
season saw United finish second behind Arsenal.[46] In the 1998–99 season, 
he was part of the United team that won the treble of the Premier League, 
FA Cup and Champions League, a unique feat in English football.[47] There 
had been speculation that the criticism that he had received after being 
sent off in the World Cup would lead to him leaving England, but Beckham 
decided to stay at Manchester United.[48] To ensure they would win the 
Premier League title, United needed to win their final league match of 
the season, at home to Tottenham (with reports suggesting that the opposition 
would allow themselves to be easily beaten to prevent their deadly local 
rivals Arsenal from retaining the title), but Tottenham took an early lead 
in the match.[47] Beckham scored the equaliser with a curling strike from 
25 yards out into the top left corner of the goal and United went on to 
win the match and the league.[47] Beckham played in central midfield in 
United's win over Bayern Munich in the 1999 UEFA Champions League Final, 
since United's first string centre-midfielders Paul Scholes and Roy Keane 
were suspended for the match.[47] United were losing the match 1–0 at the 
end of normal time, but won the trophy by scoring two goals in injury time. 
Both of the goals came from corners taken by Beckham.[47] Those crucial 
assists, coupled with great performances over the rest of the season, led 
to him finishing runner up to Rivaldo for 1999's European Footballer of 
the Year and FIFA World Player of the Year awards.[49] Despite Beckham's 
achievements in the 1998–99 season, he was still unpopular among some opposition 
fans and journalists, and he was criticised after being sent off for a 
deliberate foul in Manchester United's World Club Championship match against 
Necaxa. It was suggested in the press that his wife was a bad influence 
on him, and that it might be in United's interests to sell him,[50] but 
his manager publicly backed him and he stayed at the club. During the 1999–2000 
season, there was a talk of a transfer to Juventus in Italy, but this never 
happened. Beckham helped United retain the Premier League title in 1999–2000 
by an 18-point margin – after being pushed by Arsenal and Leeds United 
for much of the season. United won their final 11 league games of the season, 
with Beckham scoring five goals during this run, with his last goal coming 
from a swerving shot from the edge of the penalty area in their final home 
game against Tottenham Hotspur.[51] By the early 2000s, the relationship 
between Ferguson and Beckham had begun to deteriorate, possibly as a result 
of Beckham's fame and commitments away from football. In 2000, Beckham 
was given permission to miss training to look after his son Brooklyn, who 
had gastroenteritis, but Ferguson was furious when Victoria Beckham was 
photographed at a London Fashion Week event on the same night, claiming 
that Beckham would have been able to train if Victoria had looked after 
Brooklyn that day. He responded by fining Beckham the maximum amount that 
was permitted (two weeks' wages – then £50,000) and dropping him for a 
crucial match against United's rivals Leeds United. He later criticised 
Beckham for this in his autobiography, claiming he had not been "fair to 
his teammates"[52] Beckham had a good season for his club, though, and 
helped United to win the Premier League by a record margin. "He was never 
a problem until he got married. He used to go into work with the academy 
coaches at night time, he was a fantastic young lad. Getting married into 
that entertainment scene was a difficult thing – from that moment, his 
life was never going to be the same. He is such a big celebrity, football 
is only a small part."' – Alex Ferguson speaking about Beckham's marriage 
in 2007.[53] He was a key player in United's third successive league title 
in 2000–01 – only the fourth time that any club had achieved three league 
titles in a row. He scored nine goals that season, all in the Premier League. 
On 10 April 2002, Beckham was injured during a Champions League match against 
Deportivo de La Coruña, breaking the second metatarsal bone in his left 
foot. There was speculation in the British media that the injury might 
have been caused deliberately, as the player who had injured Beckham was 
Argentine Aldo Duscher, and England and Argentina were due to meet in that 
year's World Cup.[54] The injury prevented Beckham from playing for United 
for the rest of the season and they missed out on the Premier League title 
to Arsenal (also being knocked out of the Champions League by Bayer Leverkusen 
on away goals in the semi-finals), but he signed a three-year contract 
in May, following months of negotiations with the club, mostly concerning 
extra payments for his image rights. The income from his new contract, 
and his many endorsement deals, made him the highest-paid player in the 
world at the time.[55] Despite the injury, 2001–02 was arguably Beckham's 
best season as a United player; he scored 11 goals in 28 league games, 
and a total of 16 goals in 42 games in all competitions, the best of his 
career. Following an injury early in the 2002–03 season, Beckham was unable 
to regain his place on the Manchester United team, with Ole Gunnar Solskjær 
having replaced him on the right side of midfield. His relationship with 
his manager deteriorated further on 15 February 2003 when, in the changing 
room following an FA Cup defeat to Arsenal, a furious Alex Ferguson threw[56][57][58][59][60] 
[61] or kicked a boot that struck Beckham over the eye, causing a cut that 
required stitches. The incident led to a great deal of transfer speculation 
involving Beckham, with bookmakers offering odds on whether he or Ferguson 
would be first to leave the club.[62] Although the team had started the 
season badly, their results improved greatly from December onwards and 
they won the league, with Beckham managing a total of 11 goals in 52 games 
in all competitions. He was still a first-choice player for England, however, 
and was appointed an Officer of the Most Excellent Order of the British 
Empire (OBE) for services to football on 13 June 2003.[63] Beckham had 
made 265 Premier league appearances for United and scored 61 goals. He 
also made 81 Champions league appearances, scoring 15 goals. Beckham won 
six Premier League titles, two FA Cups, one European Cup, one Intercontinental 
Cup and one FA Youth Cup in the space of 12 years. By this stage, he was 
their joint second longest serving player behind Ryan Giggs (having joined 
them at the same time as Nicky Butt, Gary Neville and Paul Scholes). "He 
is a great player who is going to become part of the club's great history. 
He is a man of our times and a symbol of modern-day stardom and what is 
certain is Real have signed Beckham because he's a great footballer and 
a very dedicated professional. His team spirit is unsurpassed and he is 
one of the best English players of all-time and if only because of that 
he is with us." As the summer 2003 transfer window approached, Manchester 
United appeared keen to sell Beckham to Barcelona[65] and the two clubs 
even announced that they reached a deal for Beckham's transfer,[66] but 
instead he joined reigning Spanish champions Real Madrid for €35 million 
on a four-year contract.[67] Beckham was the latest signing in the Galácticos 
era of global stars signed by club president Florentino Pérez every summer.[68] 
The news came as a bitter blow to the newly elected Barcelona president 
Joan Laporta, who based much of his presidential campaign on signing Beckham.[69] 
Though announced in mid-June, the transfer was completed on 1 July 2003, 
making him the third Englishman to play for the club after Laurie Cunningham 
and Steve McManaman. Following a successful medical on 2 July, Beckham 
was unveiled in front of 500 accredited journalists from 25 countries at 
Real's basketball facility, where he was handed the famous white shirt 
by club legend Alfredo Di Stéfano.[70] Although Beckham had worn the number 
seven shirt for Manchester United and England, he was unable to wear it 
at Madrid as it was currently assigned to club captain Raúl. He decided 
to wear number 23 instead, citing his admiration of basketball player Michael 
Jordan, who also wore the number 23 shirt, as the reason behind his decision.[71] 
In the week before Beckham's presentation, Real named Carlos Queiroz as 
their new head coach, meaning that Beckham got reunited with a familiar 
face upon arriving to Madrid since Queiroz spent the previous season as 
Alex Ferguson's assistant at Manchester United. In late July 2003, the 
club went on a tour of the Far East as part of the pre-season training, 
but also to cash in on Beckham's huge marketing appeal in Asia where he 
enjoyed tremendous following. Real's brand recognition in that part of 
the globe was already well established as the club made financially successful 
trips to Asia during previous off-seasons; however, the presence of global 
marketing icon such as Beckham made this particular tour a financial smash 
for los Merengues.[72] Shortly after his Real switch, Beckham also ended 
his relationship with agent Tony Stephens of SFX Europe who had guided 
him through his career up until this point, including helping to engineer 
Beckham's move from Manchester to Madrid. Beckham signed on with Simon 
Fuller and his company 19 Entertainment that already managed the career 
of Victoria.[73] Beckham also appointed close friend Terry Byrne to be 
his personal manager.[74][75] In late August 2003, Real Madrid won the 
Spanish Super Cup over two legs versus RCD Mallorca, with Beckham scoring 
the final goal in a 3–0 return leg win at home, thus setting the stage 
for the start of the league season. Playing on a star-laden team which 
included three former FIFA World Player of the Year recipients, Zinedine 
Zidane, Ronaldo and Luís Figo, in addition to Roberto Carlos, Raúl and 
Iker Casillas, Beckham did not require much time to settle in, scoring 
five times in his first 16 matches (including a goal less than three minutes 
into his La Liga debut). Queiroz mostly favoured the adaptable 5–3–2 formation 
with two fullbacks Míchel Salgado and Roberto Carlos often joining the 
attack down the wings, while Beckham played on the right of the three-man 
midfield alongside Zidane and Figo.[76] Real Madrid were runners-up in 
the Copa del Rey, were knocked out of the UEFA Champions League at the 
quarter-final stage and finished the league season in fourth place, meaning 
the team, whose president Pérez expected them to win either the Spanish 
league or the Champions League each season, did not match expectations. 
In July 2004, while Beckham was in pre-season training in Spain, an intruder 
scaled a wall at the Beckham home while carrying a can of petrol. Victoria 
and their children were in the house at the time, but security guards apprehended 
the man before he reached the house.[77] The league season began with new 
head coach José Antonio Camacho behind the bench, but he ended up lasting 
only three matches, handing in his resignation as Real dropped to eighth 
spot in the La Liga standings. Camacho's assistant Mariano García Remón 
took over on temporary basis as Real leadership scrambled to find a permanent 
replacement. Beckham made more headlines on 9 October 2004 when he admitted 
intentionally fouling Ben Thatcher in an England match against Wales to 
get himself booked. Beckham was due to receive a one-match suspension for 
his next caution, and had picked up an injury, which he knew would keep 
him out of England's next match, so he deliberately fouled Thatcher to 
serve his suspension in a match that he would have had to miss anyway. 
The Football Association asked Beckham for an explanation of his actions 
and he admitted that he had "made a mistake" and apologised.[78] He was 
sent off shortly afterwards, this time in a league match for Real Madrid 
against Valencia. Having received a yellow card, he was judged to have 
sarcastically applauded the referee and was given a second yellow card, 
causing an automatic dismissal, although the suspension was cancelled on 
appeal. By Christmas 2004, with the team sitting in second league spot, 
García Remón was gone as Vanderlei Luxemburgo became the new head coach. 
However, the well-traveled Brazilian failed to inspire the team to the 
title as Real again finished the season in the runner-up spot. On 3 December 
2005, Beckham was sent off for the third time that season in a league match 
against Getafe CF. One day later Luxemburgo got the axe and was replaced 
with Juan Ramón López Caro. By the end of that season, Beckham led La Liga 
in number of assists. During the season, Beckham established football academies 
in Los Angeles and east London and he was named a judge for the 2006 British 
Book Awards.[79] Real Madrid finished second to Barcelona in the 2005–06 
La Liga, albeit with a large 12-point gap, and reached the last 16 only 
in the Champions League after losing to Arsenal. The season also marked 
the end of an era for the club as Pérez resigned his president post in 
January 2006 with Vicente Boluda named as replacement on interim basis 
until the end of the season. The summer 2006 off-season marked a turbulent 
time as club president elections were held. Ramón Calderón became the new 
Real president. As expected, none of the club officials that served under 
the previous president were kept, including head coach López Caro. Initially 
out of favour with newly arrived head coach Fabio Capello, Beckham started 
only a few games at the beginning of the season, as the speedier José Antonio 
Reyes was normally preferred on the right wing. In the first nine matches 
Beckham started, Real lost seven. On 10 January 2007, after prolonged contract 
negotiations, Real Madrid's sporting director Predrag Mijatović announced 
that Beckham would not remain at Real Madrid after the end of the season. 
However, he later claimed that he was mistranslated and that he actually 
said that Beckham's contract had not yet been renewed.[80] On 11 January 
2007, Beckham announced that he had signed a five-year deal to play for 
the LA Galaxy beginning 1 July 2007. On 13 January 2007, Fabio Capello 
said that Beckham had played his last game for Real Madrid, although he 
would continue to train with the team.[81] A few days later while speaking 
to the students at Villanueva University Center in Madrid, Calderón said 
that Beckham is "going to Hollywood to be half a film star", adding "our 
technical staff were right not to extend his contract, which has been proved 
by the fact that no other technical staff in the world wanted him except 
Los Angeles".[82] About a month later, however, Capello backtracked on 
his earlier statement, allowing Beckham to rejoin the team for the match 
against Real Sociedad on 10 February 2007. The player immediately repaid 
his head coach's trust by scoring the equalising goal from a 27-yard free 
kick as Real Madrid eventually recorded a 2–1 victory.[83] In his final 
UEFA Champions League appearance for the club, Real Madrid were knocked 
out of the competition by Bayern Munich at the round-of-16 stage (on the 
away goals rule) on 7 March 2007. Beckham played a pivotal role in all 
three Madrid goals in the home game, with Bayern goalkeeper Oliver Kahn 
describing his performance as "world class".[84] On 17 June 2007, the last 
day of the La Liga season, Beckham started in his final match for the club, 
a 3–1 win over Mallorca, which saw them clinch the title from Barcelona. 
With Real down 0–1 Beckham limped off the field and was replaced by José 
Antonio Reyes, who scored two goals leading the team to that season's La 
Liga title, their first since Beckham had signed with them and 30th overall 
in the club's history. Although Real and Barça both finished level on points, 
Madrid took the title because of superior head-to-head record, capping 
a remarkable six-month turnaround for Beckham.[85] With his wife and children 
along with celebrity friends Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes watching from 
a luxury box at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium; it was only Beckham's second 
piece of silverware since he joined the famous club.[85] Towards the end 
of the season, as Beckham was getting back into Capello's good books after 
successfully fighting his way back into the first team, Real Madrid announced 
they would try to untie his transfer to LA Galaxy, but were ultimately 
unsuccessful.[86] Several weeks before Beckham's scheduled arrival to the 
United States, Real's management contacted LA Galaxy's ownership group 
about reacquiring the player, but were quickly turned down.[87] A month 
after the conclusion of Beckham's Real career, Forbes magazine reported 
that he had been the party primarily responsible for the team's huge increase 
in merchandise sales, a total reported to top US$600 million during Beckham's 
four years at the club.[88] I'm coming there not to be a superstar. I'm 
coming there to be part of the team, to work hard and to hopefully win 
things. With me, it's about football. I'm coming there to make a difference. 
I'm coming there to play football ... I'm not saying me coming over to 
the States is going to make soccer the biggest sport in America. That would 
be difficult to achieve. Baseball, basketball, American football, they've 
been around. But I wouldn't be doing this if I didn't think I could make 
a difference.[89] Beckham's involvement with Major League Soccer (MLS) 
began while he was still a Real Madrid player when it was confirmed on 
11 January 2007 that he would be leaving Madrid in six months to join MLS 
side LA Galaxy. The speculation about his new contract in Madrid was thus 
put to an end and the following day Beckham's official press conference 
was held in conjunction with the 2007 MLS SuperDraft.[90] The announcement 
made top news all across the globe. Though many worldwide media outlets 
reported the deal to be worth US$250 million,[91] the astronomical figure 
was soon revealed to be something of a PR stunt engineered by Beckham's 
media handlers (British representative agency 19 Entertainment).[92] To 
maximise the media effect, in the press release they decided to list the 
potential sum that Beckham could make over the five-year period from all 
his revenue sources, which in addition to his Galaxy pay also include his 
personal endorsements. Beckham's actual deal with the Galaxy was a five-year 
contract worth US$32.5 million in total or $6.5 million per year.[74][93] 
The high-profile acquisition paid immediate financial dividends for Galaxy 
long before Beckham joined the team. On the strength of the signing and 
the media frenzy it created, the club was able to pull off a new five-year 
shirt sponsorship deal with Herbalife nutrition company worth US$20 million. 
The gate revenue peaked as well with 11,000 new season tickets holders 
and sold-out luxury suites (each one of the 42 inside the team's home ground, 
the Home Depot Center).[94] Even the LA Galaxy owners Anschutz Entertainment 
Group (AEG) saw an immediate spike in business. Involved on many business 
fronts worldwide, AEG was already leveraging its Beckham association in 
places such as China, where the company had been working aggressively in 
Shanghai and Beijing for years to receive clearance to build arenas and 
stadiums. The company's CEO Tim Leiweke put it as follows: "Suddenly, we're 
known as the company that owns the team that David Beckham is going to 
play for, so our world changed".[95] In the months following the announcement, 
the additional terms of Beckham's contract became public knowledge. One 
unique contract provision was giving him the option of buying an MLS expansion 
franchise in any market except New York City at the fixed price of $25 million 
whenever he stopped playing in the league[96] – an allowance that the league's 
owners had never given to a player before. Another provision was the opt-out 
clause after the 2009 season, meaning that should he decide so, Beckham 
was free to leave the club after completing year three of his five-year 
contract.[94] In April 2007, he and wife Victoria bought an $18.2 million 
home on San Ysidro Drive in Beverly Hills.[97] Beckham's contract with 
LA Galaxy took effect on 11 July, and on 13 July, the famous Englishman 
was officially unveiled as a Galaxy player at the Home Depot Center to 
much fanfare and world media interest in front of more than 5,000 gathered 
fans and some 700 accredited media members.[98] Beckham chose to wear number 
23. It was announced that Galaxy jersey sales had already reached a record 
figure of over 250,000 prior to this formal introduction.[99] In parallel, 
Beckham's handlers at 19 Entertainment succeeded in putting together an 
unprecedented US media rollout designed to expand his carefully crafted 
personal brand in America. He made the cover of Sports Illustrated, a few 
weeks earlier Adidas launched the extensive 13-part ad campaign "Fútbol 
meets Football" starring Beckham and NFL running back Reggie Bush, and 
W magazine published a racy photo spread featuring David and wife Victoria 
photographed by Steven Klein. Meanwhile, ESPN sports network was running 
"Hello, Goodbye" promotional campaign and it also agreed to air David Beckham: 
New Beginnings documentary produced by 19 Entertainment and directed by 
Gary Brooks before the friendly match versus Chelsea, which was expected 
to be Beckham's American debut. In addition to popularising soccer, Beckham's 
arrival was used as platform for entertainment industry endeavours. Since 
both Beckham's and his wife's often overlapping careers were handled by 
19 Entertainment, which is owned by Simon Fuller, who in turn has a business 
relationship with the Creative Artists Agency (CAA), one of Hollywood's 
most powerful talent agencies, it was important also for CAA that the Beckhams 
made as big a splash as possible upon their arrival in the United States. 
On 16 July, CAA had hosted a welcoming bash for David at its new eight-storey, 
$400 million headquarters in Century City with CAA employees reportedly 
instructed beforehand to line the staircase and clap for Beckham upon his 
arrival.[100] That night Victoria's reality show prime-time special Victoria 
Beckham: Coming to America aired on NBC, drawing negative reviews in the 
press and poor viewership ratings.[101] On Saturday afternoon, 21 July, 
despite still nursing the injured left ankle that he picked up a month 
earlier during the final match of La Liga's season, Beckham made his Galaxy 
debut, coming on for Alan Gordon in the 78th minute of a 0–1 friendly loss 
to Chelsea as part of the World Series of Soccer.[102] With a capacity 
crowd, along with a long Hollywood celebrity list featuring Tom Cruise, 
Katie Holmes, Eva Longoria, Mary-Kate Olsen, Governor of California Arnold 
Schwarzenegger, Jennifer Love Hewitt, Alicia Silverstone and Drew Carey 
among others, present at the Home Depot Center, the match was broadcast 
live on ESPN's main network. However, the proceedings on the field of play 
completely took a back seat to the Beckham spectacle, and despite the presence 
of worldwide football stars Andriy Shevchenko, Didier Drogba, Michael Ballack, 
Frank Lampard and John Terry, the US television cameras were firmly focused 
on Beckham who spent most of the match on the bench. The match's added 
time featured a scare for already injured Beckham when he got tackled by 
Steve Sidwell whose cleats struck Beckham's right foot, sending him airborne 
before he crumpled hard to the ground. Though the existing injury was not 
aggravated too much, Beckham's recovery process was set back by about a 
week. ESPN's presentation of Beckham's debut earned a 1.0 TV rating, meaning 
it was seen in an average of 947,000 television homes in the US – a disappointing 
figure given the national media buzz and two weeks of constant promotion 
by ESPN. For comparison ESPN2's weekly MLS broadcasts on Thursdays drew 
a consistent 0.2 rating on virtually no promotion while Freddy Adu's MLS 
debut televised on ABC back in 2004 earned a 1.3 rating.[97] As far as 
sporting events that were televised that weekend in the United States, 
Beckham's much publicised debut drew fewer TV viewers than British Open 
golf tournament, a regular-season national baseball game, and even the 
Indy Racing League's Honda 200 motor race.[97] The day after the made-for-TV 
debut was reserved for the welcoming party for the Beckhams at LA's Museum 
of Contemporary Art, formally billed as being hosted by Tom Cruise, Katie 
Holmes, Will Smith, and Jada Pinkett Smith though in actuality a CAA-organized 
event. Attended by many Hollywood A-listers, the lavish bash was big news 
in the US celebrity tabloid media, including daily entertainment TV magazines 
such as Entertainment Tonight and Access Hollywood.[103] Beckham missed 
the next four LA Galaxy matches – three in the North American SuperLiga 
and an MLS game away at Toronto FC though he still made the trip with his 
teammates, sitting on the bench in street clothes. It was in Toronto on 
5 August that the team got its first taste of what life would be like on 
the road with Beckham on the roster. Due to security concerns, it was the 
first time the team flew on a charter for a road match, rather than flying 
commercial (MLS normally forbids charter flights for away matches, claiming 
they provide competitive advantage, but in this case they made an exception 
due to the frenzy created around Beckham and resulting security issues). 
Also, instead of the usual MLS-mandated modest hotels, LA Galaxy stayed 
at the five-star Le Méridien King Edward in downtown Toronto (an expense 
paid for by the local Toronto promoter), while the glitz and glamour continued 
with the velvet rope, red carpet party at the Ultra Supper Club with Beckham 
as the centerpiece guest.[104] Two weeks after his 12-minute appearance 
vs. Chelsea, still not fully healed Beckham finally made his league debut 
as a substitute on 9 August away versus D.C. United in front of the sellout 
crowd of 46,686 (nearly three times the average D.C. United home crowd) 
at the RFK Stadium, coming on for Quavas Kirk in the 71st minute.[105] 
Coming into the nationally televised match on ESPN, played under a heavy 
downpour with his team down a man and down a goal, even if only 70% fit, 
Beckham left a mark during the remaining 20-plus minutes. He hit a long 
free kick that Carlos Pavón failed to finish on for the equaliser, and 
then in the final minutes Beckham served a weighted through ball into Landon 
Donovan's path that United's keeper Troy Perkins managed to break up in 
the last moment – the Galaxy lost 1–0. The next match on the road trip 
was at New England Revolution and Beckham decided to sit it out, fearing 
further aggravating his ankle injury on the Gillette Stadium's artificial 
surface. Beckham returned to the pitch the following week, again facing 
D.C. United, in the SuperLiga semi-final on 15 August. During this game 
he had many firsts with the Galaxy; his first start, first yellow card 
and first game as team captain.[106] He also scored his first goal for 
the team, from a free kick, and also made his first assist, for Landon 
Donovan in the second half. These goals gave the team a 2–0 victory, and 
a place in the North American SuperLiga final versus Pachuca on 29 August. 
During the SuperLiga final against Pachuca, Beckham injured his right knee, 
with an MRI scan revealing that he had sprained his medial collateral ligament 
and would be out for six weeks. He returned to play in the final home match 
of the season. The Galaxy were eliminated from playoff contention on 21 
October, in the final MLS match of the season, a 1–0 loss to the Chicago 
Fire. Beckham played as a substitute in the match, bringing his season 
totals to eight matches played (5 league); one goal scored (0 league); 
and three assists (2 league). Beckham trained with Arsenal from 4 January 
2008 for three weeks until he returned to the Galaxy for pre-season training.[107] 
Beckham scored his first league goal with the Galaxy on 3 April against 
the San Jose Earthquakes in the ninth minute.[108] On 24 May 2008, the 
Galaxy defeated the Kansas City Wizards 3–1, giving the Galaxy their first 
winning record in two years and moving the club into first place in the 
Western Conference. In the match, Beckham scored an empty-net goal from 
70 yards out. The goal marked the second time in Beckham's career that 
he had scored from his own half, the other being a 1996-goal from the half-way 
line against Wimbledon at Selhurst Park.[109] Overall, however, the Galaxy 
had a disappointing year, failing to qualify for the end-of-season play-offs. 
In 2008, Beckham's success in the England national team under Fabio Capello 
led to speculation that he might return to Europe to retain match fitness 
for the World Cup qualifying matches in 2009. On 30 October 2008, Milan 
announced that Beckham was to join them on loan from 7 January 2009.[110] 
Despite this and other speculation, Beckham made it clear that the move 
in no way signalled his intent to leave MLS and announced his intent to 
return to the Galaxy in time for the start of the 2009 season in March.[111] 
Many at Milan both within and outside of the club expressed serious reservations 
about the transfer, with it considered by some players no more than a marketing 
move.[112] Beckham was unveiled at Milan's training facility by the club's 
chief executive Adriano Galliani on 20 December 2008. The player chose 
the number 32 shirt previously worn by Christian Vieri, as both the number 
7 and 23 shirts were already used by Alexandre Pato and club captain Massimo 
Ambrosini, respectively. After his physical, Beckham was reportedly told 
by a club doctor that he believed he could continue playing football for 
another five years, up to the age of 38.[113] The day after his unveiling, 
Beckham was brought to San Siro where he got introduced to home fans by 
walking out on the pitch before the league match versus Udinese and proclaiming 
"Forza Milan" over the public address system.[114] Afterwards, he and wife 
Victoria watched from a luxury box as Milan won 5–1.[115] "On the pitch, 
Beckham sees everything before everyone else. His vision of play is better 
now than during his time in Manchester. He is slower but much stronger 
tactically and technically. He is very intelligent and works a lot." Playing 
on the squad led by the 26-year-old superstar Kaká in addition to several 
other world-class players at or near the peak of their careers – 28-year-old 
Ronaldinho, and 29-year-old Andrea Pirlo – as well as club veterans Paolo 
Maldini, Clarence Seedorf, Massimo Ambrosini, Giuseppe Favalli, Gianluca 
Zambrotta, Filippo Inzaghi and Andriy Shevchenko, Beckham made his competitive 
debut for the rossoneri in Serie A as a starter away at Roma on 11 January 
2009, playing 89 minutes of the 2–2 draw in front of 53,444 at the Stadio 
Olimpico.[117] Playing his first competitive match in almost three months, 
Beckham gave a decent performance in right midfield alongside Pirlo. Though 
clearly lacking match fitness, occasionally struggling to keep up in a 
high-tempo match, Beckham put in enough useful crosses and corners to justify 
the coach Carlo Ancelotti's decision to play him from the start.[118] Going 
into Beckham's home debut versus Fiorentina a week later, all the talk 
was around Kaká being the target of a reported £100 million transfer bid 
by Manchester City.[119] Beckham turned in another understated performance 
on the right side of midfield before advancing into a more active central 
role in the second half thus effectively taking over Seedorf's role after 
the Dutchman was subbed off. Milan won 1–0 courtesy of Pato, but the 65,000+ 
San Siro crowd mostly focused on Kaká, imploring him to stay.[120] A noticeably 
older team, Ancelotti-coached Milan was proving a good fit for the 33-year-old 
Englishman. He scored his first goal in Serie A for Milan in a 4–1 victory 
over Bologna on 25 January, his third appearance for the club.[121] Though 
Beckham was expected to return to Los Angeles in March, after impressing 
at the Italian club, scoring two goals in his first four matches and assisting 
on several more, rumours began to swirl that Beckham would stay in Milan, 
with the Italian club reportedly offering to pay a multimillion-dollar 
fee for him. The rumours were confirmed on 4 February, when Beckham stated 
that he was seeking a permanent transfer to Milan in a bid to sustain his 
England career through the 2010 World Cup. Milan, however, failed to match 
Galaxy's valuation of Beckham, in the US$10–15 million range.[122] Still, 
negotiations continued during a month of speculation.[123] On 2 March, 
the Los Angeles Times reported that Beckham's loan had been extended through 
mid-July.[124] This was later confirmed by Beckham, revealing what was 
described as a unique "timeshare" deal, in which Beckham would play with 
L.A. from mid-July till the end of the 2009 MLS season.[125] After his 
return from Milan, many LA fans showed dislike and anger towards him as 
he missed the first half of the season and several held up signs saying 
"Go home fraud", and "Part-time player".[126] The Galaxy, however, had 
a much more successful season than in previous years, rising from third 
to first in the Western Conference during Beckham's time with them. He 
remained a key part of the squad which saw Galaxy win the 2009 Western 
Conference final after a 2–0 overtime victory over the Houston Dynamo.[127] 
In the final on 22 November 2009, the Galaxy lost to Real Salt Lake by 
5–4 in a penalty shoot-out after a 1–1 draw. Beckham also scored in the 
shootout.[128] In November 2009, after the end of 2009 MLS season, it was 
confirmed that Beckham would return to Milan for a second loan period beginning 
in January 2010.[129] On 6 January 2010, Beckham made a winning return 
in a Milan shirt, playing 75 minutes of a 5–2 victory over Genoa.[130] 
On 16 February 2010, Beckham played against Manchester United for the first 
time since he left the club in 2003. He played 76 minutes of the match 
at the San Siro – which ended 3–2 to Manchester United – before being substituted 
for Clarence Seedorf.[131] Beckham returned to Old Trafford for the second 
leg of the tie on 10 March 2010; he did not start the match, but was brought 
on for Ignazio Abate in the 64th minute to a positive reception from the 
Manchester United fans. The score was 3–0 for United at that point and 
the tie was all but decided. The match was the first time Beckham had played 
against Manchester United at Old Trafford and saw him create several scoring 
opportunities via crosses and corner kicks, but Manchester United dominated 
Milan and beat them 4–0, winning the tie 7–2.[132] Following the final 
whistle, he aroused a bit of controversy by draping the green-and-gold 
scarf around his neck that was given to him by the Manchester United supporters 
protesting against club owner Malcolm Glazer. As the fan protests against 
Glazer by the people gathered around Manchester United Supporters' Trust 
gained steam in 2010, the green-and-gold scarf had come to be seen as an 
anti-Glazer symbol, and by extension many saw Beckham's decision to publicly 
put it on as gesture of support. When asked about it later, however, Beckham 
responded that protests are not his business.[133] In Milan's next game, 
against Chievo, Beckham suffered a torn left Achilles tendon,[134] causing 
him to miss the World Cup as well as the MLS season due to the injury, 
which took him out of action for the next five months. Doctor Sakari Orava 
performed surgery on Beckham's tendon in Turku, Finland, on 15 March 2010.[135] 
After the operation, Orava affirmed that, "it went quite fine. The prognosis 
is he needs a rehabilitation for the next few months, and the plaster cast 
is the next six to eight weeks. I would say that [it will be] maybe four 
months before he's running, but six months before he's jumping and kicking."[136] 
On 11 September 2010, after recovering from his Achilles tendon injury, 
Beckham returned to the game as a substitute in the 70th minute in the 
Galaxy's 3–1 win over Columbus Crew.[137] On 4 October, Beckham scored 
a trademark free kick in a 2–1 win over Chivas USA to mark his first goal 
in 2010.[138] On 24 October, Beckham scored his second goal of the season 
in the Galaxy's 2–1 win over FC Dallas which secured them their second 
successive Western Conference title and first MLS Supporters' Shield since 
2002.[139] During January and February 2011, ahead of the 2011 MLS season, 
Beckham trained with Tottenham Hotspur. Rumours in the media claimed that 
the club were in talks with the Galaxy to sign the player on loan, but, 
according to Spurs manager Harry Redknapp, the move was blocked by Galaxy, 
who wanted a full final season from their number 23.[140] As a result, 
he ended up only training with the club as he had done with Arsenal three 
years earlier. With Beckham playing in the centre of midfield, the Galaxy 
won the 2011 MLS cup.[141] On 15 May, Beckham scored his first goal of 
the season for the Galaxy from a 30-yard free kick, in a 4–1 victory over 
Sporting Kansas City.[142] On 9 July, Beckham scored directly from a corner 
in a 2–1 win over Chicago Fire, repeating a feat he also achieved while 
playing for Preston North End.[143] After having his best season with the 
Galaxy to date and finishing second in the league in assists, Beckham finished 
his fifth MLS season on a high. On 20 November 2011, he joined an elite 
group of players to have won three league titles in three different countries, 
when Los Angeles won their third MLS Cup against the Houston Dynamo, winning 
1–0 on a goal by captain Landon Donovan, with assists from Beckham and 
fellow designated player Robbie Keane.[141][144] Had it been Beckham's 
final match for the Galaxy, it would have been the third time he has won 
a league championship in his final match for a club, repeating the feat 
he accomplished with Manchester United in 2003 and Real Madrid in 2007.[141] 
Following the 2011 season, in which the Galaxy won their second consecutive 
Supporters' Shield, having the second most points in MLS history, Beckham's 
five-year contract with the Galaxy expired on 31 December 2011. Despite 
being 36, he stated that he did not intend to retire. Beckham was heavily 
linked with Paris Saint-Germain, but on 18 January 2012, Galaxy announced 
Beckham had signed a new two-year contract to remain in Los Angeles.[145][146][147][148] 
In May 2012, Beckham and his victorious teammates were received by President 
of the United States Barack Obama at the White House.[149] Beckham helped 
the Galaxy to a fourth-place finish in the MLS Western Conference 2012 
regular season with Beckham scoring seven goals and adding nine assists. 
The Galaxy defeated Vancouver Whitecaps FC, the San Jose Earthquakes, Seattle 
Sounders FC and then 3–1 over the Houston Dynamo to retain the MLS Cup.[150] 
He was subbed off in the 89th minute for Marcelo Sarvas and was given a 
standing ovation at their home venue.[151] Beckham had earlier announced 
that the 2012 MLS Cup Final would be his final game with the Galaxy despite 
having another year remaining on his contract.[152][153] On 31 January 
2013, ahead of the transfer deadline it was announced that Beckham would 
be undergoing a medical with Paris Saint-Germain ahead of a potential move 
to the Ligue 1 side.[154] Beckham signed a five-month deal with the club 
later that afternoon and confirmed that his entire salary during his time 
in Paris would be donated to a local children's charity.[155] His PSG debut 
came on 24 February 2013, when he came off the bench in the 76th minute 
in a Ligue 1 home match against Marseille. This made him the 400th player 
in the history of the club.[156] On 12 May 2013, Beckham won a fourth different 
top flight winners' medal after PSG beat Lyon 1–0 to claim the Ligue 1 
title.[157] On 16 May 2013, Beckham announced that he would retire from 
professional football at the end of that year's French football season.[158][159] 
Following his decision to retire at the end of the 2012–13 season, Beckham 
was given specially designed boots in the colours of the Union Jack to 
wear in his final game. These boots had the names of his wife and children 
stitched on to them. On 18 May 2013, Beckham was made captain in his final 
home game against Brest.[160] In this game, Beckham assisted a goal by 
Matuidi from a corner. Beckham was subbed after 80 minutes, receiving hugs 
from his fellow players and manager, as well as a standing ovation from 
fans.[160] PSG went on to win the game 3–1.[160] Beckham made his first 
appearance for the England national team on 1 September 1996, in a World 
Cup qualifying match against Moldova.[161] Beckham had played in all of 
England's qualifying matches for the 1998 World Cup and was part of the 
England squad at the World Cup finals in France,[162] but the team's manager 
Glenn Hoddle publicly accused him of not concentrating on the tournament,[163] 
and he did not start in either of England's first two games. He was picked 
for the third game against Colombia and scored with a bending 30-yard free 
kick in a 2–0 victory, which was his first goal for England.[164] In the 
second round (last 16) of that competition, he received a red card in England's 
match against Argentina.[165] Beckham, after having been fouled by Diego 
Simeone, kicked Simeone while lying on the floor, striking him on the calf 
muscle.[165] Sports Illustrated was critical of the Argentinians' theatrics 
in that incident, stating that Simeone first delivered a "heavy-handed 
challenge" on Beckham and then "fell like a ton of bricks" when Beckham 
retaliated.[166] Simeone later admitted to trying to get Beckham sent off 
by over-reacting to the kick and then, along with other members of his 
team, urging the referee to send Beckham off.[167] The match finished in 
a draw and England were eliminated in a penalty shootout. Many supporters 
and journalists blamed him for England's elimination and he became the 
target of criticism and abuse, including the hanging of an effigy outside 
a London pub, and the Daily Mirror printing a dartboard with a picture 
of him centred on the bullseye. Beckham also received death threats after 
the World Cup.[168] The abuse that Beckham was receiving from English supporters 
peaked during England's 3–2 defeat by Portugal in Euro 2000, a match where 
Beckham set up two goals, when a group of England supporters taunted him 
throughout the match.[169] Beckham responded by raising his middle finger 
and, while the gesture attracted some criticism, many of the newspapers 
that had previously encouraged his vilification asked their readers to 
stop abusing him.[170] On 15 November 2000, following Kevin Keegan's resignation 
as England manager in October, Beckham was promoted to team captain by 
the caretaker manager Peter Taylor, and then kept the role under new manager 
Sven-Göran Eriksson.[171] "We've played two and a half minutes of stoppage 
time. England trail by 2 goals to 1. Beckham could raise the roof here 
with a goal ... I don't believe it! David Beckham scores the goal to take 
England all the way to the World Cup Finals! ... Give that man a Knighthood!" 
Beckham played a major role in helping England qualify for the 2002 FIFA 
World Cup, starring in an impressive 5–1 victory over Germany in Munich. 
The final step in Beckham's conversion from villain to national hero happened 
in England's final qualifying game against Greece on 6 October 2001.[173] 
England needed to win or draw the match to qualify outright for the World 
Cup, but were losing 2–1 with little time remaining. When Teddy Sheringham 
was fouled eight yards outside the Greek penalty area, England were awarded 
a free-kick and Beckham ensured England's qualification with a curling 
strike of the kind that had become his trademark.[173] Beckham was voted 
the BBC Sports Personality of the Year for 2001, and finished runner-up, 
to Luís Figo of Portugal, for the FIFA World Player of the Year award.[174] 
Beckham was partially fit by the time of the 2002 World Cup held in Japan 
and South Korea, and played in the first match against Sweden. After the 
events of four years earlier, Beckham achieved a degree of revenge over 
Argentina by scoring the winning goal with a penalty, causing Argentina 
to fail to qualify for the knockout stage.[175] England defeated Denmark 
in the second round with Beckham providing an assist in a 3–0 win. England 
were knocked out in the quarter-finals by eventual winners Brazil after 
Ronaldinho scored the winner.[176] The following month, at the opening 
ceremony of the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester, Beckham escorted 
Kirsty Howard as she presented the Jubilee Baton to the Queen. Beckham 
played in all of England's matches at Euro 2004. He had a penalty saved 
in England's 2–1 defeat to France and missed another in a penalty shootout 
in the quarter-final match against Portugal.[177] England lost the shootout 
thus going out of the competition.[177] Beckham became a UNICEF Goodwill 
Ambassador in January 2005 and was involved in promoting London's successful 
bid for the 2012 Olympic Games.[178] In October 2005, Beckham's sending 
off against Austria made him the first England captain to be sent off and 
the first player to be sent off twice while playing for England. He captained 
England for the 50th time in a friendly international against Argentina 
the following month.[171] In England's opening game at the 2006 World Cup, 
against Paraguay on 10 June 2006, Beckham's free kick led to an own-goal 
by Carlos Gamarra as England won 1–0. In England's next match, played against 
Trinidad and Tobago on 15 June 2006, Beckham's cross in the 83rd minute 
led to a Peter Crouch goal, which put England into the lead 1–0. Beckham 
gave another assist to Steven Gerrard. In the end they won 2–0. He was 
named Man of the Match by tournament sponsor Budweiser. During England's 
second round match against Ecuador, Beckham scored from a free kick in 
the 59th minute, becoming the first English player to score in three separate 
World Cups,[179] and giving England a 1–0 victory and a place in the quarter-finals. 
He was sick before the game and vomited several times as a result of dehydration 
and illness that he got after having scored the winning goal for England.[179] 
In the quarter-final against Portugal, Beckham was substituted following 
an injury shortly after half time and the England team went on to lose 
the match on penalties (3–1), the score having been 0–0 after extra time.[180] 
After his substitution, Beckham was visibly shaken and emotional for not 
being able to play, being in tears at one point.[181] A day after England 
were knocked out of the World Cup, an emotional Beckham made a statement 
in a news conference that he had stepped down as England captain,[171] 
stating, "It has been an honour and privilege to captain my country but, 
having been captain for 58 of my 95[182] games, I feel the time is right 
to pass on the armband as we enter a new era under Steve McClaren." (Beckham 
had won 94 caps up to that point.) He was succeeded by Chelsea captain 
John Terry.[183] Having stepped down as captain after the World Cup, Beckham 
was dropped completely from the England national team selected by new coach 
Steve McClaren on 11 August 2006. McClaren claimed that he was "looking 
to go in a different direction" with the team, and that Beckham "wasn't 
included within that."[184] McClaren said Beckham could be recalled in 
future. Shaun Wright-Phillips, Kieran Richardson, and the World Cup alternative 
to Beckham, Aaron Lennon, were all included, although McClaren eventually 
opted to employ Steven Gerrard in that role. On 26 May 2007, McClaren announced 
that Beckham would be recalled to the England squad for the first time 
since stepping down as their captain. Beckham started against Brazil in 
England's first match at the new Wembley Stadium and put in a positive 
performance. In the second half, he set up England's goal converted by 
captain John Terry. It looked as though England would claim victory over 
Brazil, but newcomer Diego equalised in the dying seconds. In England's 
next match, a Euro 2008 qualifier against Estonia, Beckham sent two trademark 
assists for Michael Owen and Peter Crouch, helping England to prevail 3–0. 
Beckham had assisted in three of England's four total goals in those two 
games,[185] and he stated his desire to continue to play for England after 
his move to Major League Soccer. On 22 August 2007, Beckham played in a 
friendly for England against Germany, becoming the first to play for England 
while with a non-European club team.[186] On 21 November 2007, Beckham 
earned his 99th cap against Croatia, setting up a goal for Peter Crouch 
to tie the game at 2–2. Following the 2–3 loss, England failed to qualify 
for the Euro 2008 Finals. Despite this, Beckham said that he has no plans 
to retire from international football and wanted to continue playing for 
the national team.[187] After being passed over by new England coach and 
Beckham's former manager at Real Madrid, Fabio Capello, for a friendly 
against Switzerland which would have given him his hundredth cap; Beckham 
admitted that he was not in shape at the time, as he had not played a competitive 
match in three months.[188] On 20 March 2008, Beckham was recalled to the 
England squad by Capello for the friendly against France in Paris on 26 
March. Beckham became only the fifth Englishman to win 100 caps. Capello 
had hinted on 25 March 2008 that Beckham had a long-term future in his 
side ahead of crucial qualifiers for the 2010 World Cup.[189] On 11 May 
2008, Capello included an in-form Beckham in his 31-man England squad to 
face the United States at Wembley Stadium on 28 May before the away fixture 
with Trinidad and Tobago on 1 June. Beckham was honoured before the match 
by receiving an honorary gold cap representing his 100th cap from Bobby 
Charlton, and was given a standing ovation from the crowd. He played well 
and assisted John Terry on the match-winning goal. When substituted at 
half-time for David Bentley, the pro-Beckham crowd booed the decision.[190] 
In a surprise move, Capello handed Beckham the captaincy for England's 
friendly against Trinidad and Tobago on 1 June 2008. The match was the 
first time since the 2006 World Cup that Beckham had skippered England 
and marked a dramatic turnaround for Beckham. In two years, he had gone 
from being dropped completely from the England squad to being reinstated 
(though temporarily) as England captain.[191] During the 2010 World Cup 
Qualifier against Belarus in which England won 3–1 in Minsk, Beckham came 
off the bench in the 87th minute to earn his 107th cap making him England's 
third-most-capped player in history, overtaking Bobby Charlton in the process. 
On 11 February 2009, Beckham drew level with Bobby Moore's record of 108 
caps for an English outfield player, coming on as a substitute for Stewart 
Downing in a friendly match against Spain.[192] On 28 March 2009, Beckham 
surpassed Moore to hold the record outright when he came on as a substitute 
in a friendly against Slovakia, providing the assist for a goal from Wayne 
Rooney in the process.[193] In all, Beckham had made 16 appearances out 
of a possible 20 for England under Capello until his ruptured Achilles 
tendon of March 2010 ruled him out of selection for the 2010 FIFA World 
Cup in South Africa.[194] His last game for England before injury had been 
on 14 October 2009 as a substitute in England's last World Cup qualifying 
game, which ended England 3 – 0 Belarus.[194] After a poor performance 
from England at the World Cup Capello remained as manager, but was under 
pressure to revamp the England squad for the imminent UEFA Euro 2012 qualification 
campaign. He unveiled a new team at the next England match, a home friendly 
game against Hungary on 11 August 2010, with Beckham still unavailable 
for selection but aiming for a return to playing in MLS by the following 
month.[194] In the post-match interview, Capello said of the prospect of 
the now 35-year-old Beckham playing any future competitive matches for 
England, that "I need to change it. David is a fantastic player but I think 
we need new players for the future", referring to the new players that 
play in Beckham's right midfield position, including Theo Walcott and Adam 
Johnson, adding "This is the future of the team under Fabio Capello or 
another manager."[194] He said that Beckham may be selected for one last 
friendly game, stating, "If he is fit, I hope we will play one more game 
here at Wembley so the fans can say goodbye." In response to the comments, 
Beckham's agent released a statement reiterating Beckham's position that 
he had no desire to retire from international football, and would always 
make himself available for selection for England if fit and if needed.[194] 
He remains 10 caps short of the record number of 125 caps by goalkeeper 
Peter Shilton, for a player of any position.[194] Beckham was named in 
the provisional squad to represent the Great Britain Olympic football team 
at the 2012 Olympics.[195] He was not included in the final selection by 
manager Stuart Pearce.[196] "David Beckham is Britain's finest striker 
of a football not because of God-given talent but because he practises 
with a relentless application that the vast majority of less gifted players 
wouldn't contemplate." Beckham is a "product of Sir Alex Ferguson's school 
of hard graft" at Manchester United. Renowned for his long-range passing, 
crossing ability, and bending free-kicks as a right winger, Ferguson noted 
that Beckham "practised with a discipline to achieve an accuracy that other 
players wouldn't care about."[198][199][200] Beckham reportedly spent hours 
practising his free kicks after training sessions had ended.[197] Beckham 
maintained his training routine at Real Madrid and even when his relationship 
with management was strained in early 2007, Real Madrid president Ramón 
Calderón and manager Fabio Capello praised Beckham for maintaining his 
professionalism and commitment to the club.[201][202] Beckham's Real Madrid 
teammate Roberto Carlos regarded Beckham to be the best free-kick exponent 
he had ever seen.[203] Two of the best free kick exponents of their generation, 
Roberto Carlos commented on the dilemma the team faced when they won a 
free kick on the edge of the penalty area: "I would stand on one side and 
Beckham on the other but I wanted to see Beckham take the free-kick because 
it's beautiful how he hits the ball."[203] In May 2013, asked about how 
he wanted to be remembered in his retirement, Beckham said, "I just want 
people to see me as a hardworking footballer, someone that's passionate 
about the game, someone that – every time I stepped on the pitch – I've 
given everything that I have, because that's how I feel. That's how I look 
back on it and hope people will see me."[197] Beckham was the first England 
player ever to collect two red cards and the first England captain to be 
sent off.[204] Beckham's most notorious red card was during the 1998 World 
Cup after Argentina's Diego Simeone had fouled him: Beckham, lying face 
down on the pitch, kicked out at the Argentine midfielder, who fell dramatically.[165] 
He amassed 41 yellow cards and four red cards in his time at Real Madrid, 
all four reds came in La Liga.[205] He received one red card while on loan 
at Paris Saint-Germain, picked up in injury time in a match against Evian 
on 28 April 2013.[206] Between 2000 and 2013, Beckham played 420 competitive 
games for England, Milan, LA Galaxy, Manchester United, Real Madrid and 
PSG, and received seven red cards, one every 60 matches on average.[205] 
In 2005, Beckham founded the David Beckham Academy football school, operating 
from two sites, in London and Los Angeles. It was announced in late 2009 
that both would close.[207] A mobile academy is being developed by Beckham, 
to travel around the UK and further afield.[208] On 5 February 2014, MLS 
announced that Beckham had exercised his option to buy a MLS expansion 
team for $25 million, which he had received as part of the contract he 
signed with the LA Galaxy in 2007.[96] The team based in Miami would begin 
play in 2016 or 2017, assuming a stadium can be built.[21] In 1997, Beckham 
started dating Victoria Adams, after she attended a Manchester United match. 
She was famously known as "Posh Spice" of the pop music group Spice Girls, 
one of the world's top pop groups at the time, and his team was also enjoying 
a great run of success. Therefore, their relationship instantly attracted 
a great deal of media attention. The couple were dubbed "Posh and Becks" 
by the media. He proposed to her on 24 January 1998 in a restaurant in 
Cheshunt, England. On 4 July 1999, David and Victoria married at Luttrellstown 
Castle in Ireland. Beckham's team-mate Gary Neville was the best man, and 
the couple's infant son, Brooklyn, was the ring bearer. The media were 
kept away from the ceremony, as the Beckhams had an exclusive deal with 
OK! Magazine, but newspapers were still able to obtain photographs showing 
them sitting on golden thrones.[209] 437 staff were employed for the wedding 
reception, which was estimated to have cost £500,000.[210] David and Victoria 
Beckham have four children: sons Brooklyn Joseph (born 4 March 1999),[211] 
Romeo James (born 1 September 2002 in London),[citation needed] and Cruz 
David (born 20 February 2005 in Madrid;[citation needed] the word "cruz" 
is Spanish for "cross"); and daughter Harper Seven (born 10 July 2011, 
in Los Angeles).[212] Elton John is godfather to Brooklyn and Romeo Beckham; 
their godmother is Elizabeth Hurley.[213] Beckham's three sons have all 
played football in the Arsenal Academy.[214] Like their father, Brooklyn 
and Romeo have both done modelling work and been named among GQ's best 
dressed British men.[215] Beckham's eldest son Brooklyn previously played 
football for Arsenal U16,[214] but was released at the end of the 2014–15 
season.[216] In his early Manchester United career, Beckham lived in a 
four-bedroom house in Worsley that he bought directly from the property 
developer as a 20-year-old in 1995.[217] In 1999, the Beckhams purchased 
their most famous home in Hertfordshire, unofficially dubbed Beckingham 
Palace, for £2.5 million, but subsequently sold it to insurance entrepreneur 
Neil Utley for £11.3 million in March 2014.[218] In January 2014, they 
purchased a £45 million house in Holland Park, London, on which they spent 
a further £3 million renovating before moving in.[219] Beckham suffers 
from obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), which he says makes him "have 
everything in a straight line or everything has to be in pairs." Victoria 
claims, "If you open our fridge, it's all co-ordinated down either side. 
We've got three fridges – food in one, salad in another and drinks in the 
third. In the drinks one, everything is symmetrical. If there's three cans, 
he'll throw one away because it has to be an even number."[220] In April 
2004, the British tabloid News of the World carried claims by Beckham's 
former personal assistant Rebecca Loos that he and Loos had an extramarital 
affair.[221][222] A week later, the Malaysian-born Australian model Sarah 
Marbeck claimed that she had slept with Beckham on two occasions. Beckham 
dismissed both accusations as "ludicrous".[223] In September 2010, Beckham 
announced that he was making a court application against prostitute Irma 
Nici and several others over claims in the magazine In Touch that he had 
sex with her.[224] Although the magazine later accepted that the allegations 
against Beckham were untrue, his court application was dismissed under 
US freedom of speech laws.[225][226] Beckham's fame extends beyond the 
pitch; in much of the world his name is "as instantly recognisable as that 
of multinational companies like Coca-Cola and IBM."[227] Beckham's relationship 
and marriage to Victoria, who has been famous in her own right as part 
of the Spice Girls, contributed to his celebrity beyond football. Beckham 
became known as a fashion icon, and together with Victoria, the couple 
became lucrative spokespeople sought after by clothing designers, health 
and fitness specialists, fashion magazines, perfume and cosmetics manufacturers, 
hair stylists, exercise promoters, and spa and recreation companies. One 
example is a line of aftershave and fragrances called David Beckham Instinct.[228] 
In 2002, Beckham was hailed as the ultimate "metrosexual" by the man who 
invented the term[229] and has been described as such by numerous other 
articles since.[230] The Beckhams were paid $13.7 million in 2007 to launch 
his fragrance line in the U.S.[231] In the world of fashion, David has 
already appeared on the covers of many magazines. U.S. covers have included 
the men's magazine Details, and with his wife for the August 2007 issue 
of W.[232] According to Google, "David Beckham" was searched for more than 
any other sports topic on their site in 2003 and 2004.[233][234] According 
to Ask Jeeves, Beckham ranked third, after Britney Spears and Osama bin 
Laden, among subjects most searched for by British users of that site in 
the first decade of the 2000s.[235] Upon their arrival in Los Angeles on 
12 July 2007, the night before Beckham's formal introduction, Los Angeles 
International Airport was filled with paparazzi and news reporters.[236] 
On the next night, Victoria appeared on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno 
to talk about their move to LA, and presented Leno with a number 23 Galaxy 
jersey with his own name on the back. Victoria also talked about her NBC 
TV show Victoria Beckham: Coming to America.[237] On 22 July, a private 
welcoming party was held for the couple at the Museum of Contemporary Art, 
Los Angeles. A-list celebrities attending included Steven Spielberg, Jim 
Carrey, George Clooney, Tom Cruise, Katie Holmes, Will Smith, Jada Pinkett 
Smith, and Oprah Winfrey.[238] Beckham's many endorsement deals make him 
one of the most recognisable athletes throughout the world. Having worn 
Adidas football boots from the start of his career (notably Adidas Predator), 
in 2003 he signed a $160 million lifetime contract with Adidas, earning 
nearly half the money upfront, and will continue to earn percentages of 
profits on all of his branded Adidas products.[239] He had a 10-year collaboration 
with Pepsi Co. that expired in 2009.[240] Other endorsements include Armani, 
Breitling, H&M, Diet Coke, Burger King and Samsung, which in 2012 earned 
him $27.7 million.[241][242] He has also promoted Walt Disney Co. theme 
parks.[243] His fragrances include, Homme by David Beckham.[244] Beckham 
has several eponymous video games, including Go! Go! Beckham! Adventure 
on Soccer Island, a platform game for the Game Boy Advance, and David Beckham 
Soccer, a football game for a number of different platforms,[245][246] 
and he was brand ambassador for exercise video game EA Sports Active 2.[247] 
Beckham featured in EA Sports' FIFA video game series; he was on the cover 
for the International edition of FIFA 98.[248] During his playing career 
(which ended in May 2013), Beckham generated an estimated £1 billion in 
shirt and boot sales.[249] In 2006, Lloyd's of London insured his legs 
for £100m, at the time he was playing for Real Madrid.[250][251] In March 
2015 Beckham had the third highest social media rank in the world among 
sportspeople, behind Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi, with over 52 million 
Facebook fans.[252] Beckham visited Afghanistan in May 2010 for a morale-boosting 
visit to British troops fighting the Taliban insurgency.[253][254] The 
appearance of Beckham as well as British Foreign Secretary William Hague 
and Defence Secretary Liam Fox was believed to have prompted a Taliban 
attack on Kandahar airfield.[255][256] Chinese authorities appointed Beckham 
as global ambassador for Chinese football in March 2013. After numerous 
officials had been banned for match-fixing, and the Chinese Super League 
had failed to retain the services of well-known international names, Beckham's 
role was to help improve the image of the game and raise its profile both 
in China and abroad.[257] From 14 July 2013, Beckham started appearing 
in adverts for BSkyB advertising their Sky Sports coverage via the Sky 
Go app.[258] In January 2014, Beckham appeared on Late Night with Jimmy 
Fallon on NBC in the U.S, and in March he made a guest appearance in the 
BBC's Sport Relief special of Only Fools and Horses.[259] He was named 
one of GQ's 50 best dressed British men in 2015.[215] Beckham has supported 
UNICEF since his days at Manchester United and in January 2005, the English 
national team captain became a Goodwill Ambassador with a special focus 
on UNICEF's Sports for Development program.[20] In 2012 he met with UK 
Prime Minister David Cameron at 10 Downing Street to call for more action 
to help children affected by malnutrition around the world.[260] In 2015, 
his tenth year as a UNICEF Ambassador, Beckham launched 7: The David Beckham 
UNICEF Fund to help protect children in danger.[20] In June 2015 he visited 
Siem Reap in Cambodia, where he met with child victims of violence.[20] 
Beckham has pledged his support for the Unite for Children, Unite Against 
AIDS campaign. He is also a patron of the Elton John AIDS Foundation.[261] 
On 17 January 2007, Rebecca Johnstone, a 19-year-old cancer patient from 
Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, received a surprise phone call from Beckham. 
After the conversation, he sent her a Real Madrid jersey with his signature 
on it. Rebecca died on 29 January 2007.[262] On 1 July 2007, Beckham appeared 
as a speaker at the Concert for Diana held at Wembley Stadium, London to 
celebrate the life of Princess Diana almost 10 years after her death.[263] 
Proceeds from the concert went to Diana's charities as well as to charities 
of which her sons Princes William and Harry are patrons.[264][265] Beckham 
is a founding member of the Malaria No More UK Leadership Council and helped 
launch the charity in 2009 with Andy Murray at Wembley Stadium. Beckham 
also appeared in a 2007 public service announcement for Malaria No More 
U.S, advertising the need for inexpensive bed nets. The TV spot aired in 
the U.S. on Fox Networks, including Fox Soccer Channel, and can also be 
seen on YouTube.[266] Since joining Major League Soccer, Beckham has been 
a very public advocate in the U.S. for related charities such as "MLS W.O.R.K.S." 
On 17 August 2007, he conducted a youth clinic in Harlem, along with other 
current and former MLS players. This was in advance of his first New York 
City area match the following day against the New York Red Bulls. That 
team's Jozy Altidore and Juan Pablo Ángel were also with Beckham, teaching 
skills to disadvantaged youth to benefit FC Harlem Lions.[267] Beckham 
never personally appeared in the 2002 film Bend It Like Beckham, except 
in archive footage. He and his wife wanted to make cameo appearances, but 
scheduling proved difficult, so the director used lookalike Andy Harmer 
instead.[268] Beckham makes a cameo appearance with Zinedine Zidane and 
Raúl, in the 2005 film Goal!: The Dream Begins. Lookalike Andy Harmer, 
who played him in Bend It Like Beckham, also appears here in one party 
scene as Beckham.[269] Beckham himself appears in the sequel Goal! 2: Living 
the Dream...[270] in a larger role, when the film's lead character gets 
transferred to Real Madrid. This time, the story centres on the Real Madrid 
team, and besides Beckham, other real life Real Madrid players also appear 
on and off the pitch, alongside the fictional characters. Beckham appeared 
in Goal! 3: Taking on the World, which was released straight to DVD on 
15 June 2009.[271] Despite moving to Los Angeles, California, Beckham has 
expressed no personal interest in pursuit of acting roles, saying he is 
too "stiff".[272] Beckham appears as a projectionist in the Guy Ritchie 
action film The Man from U.N.C.L.E., based on the 1964 MGM television series 
of the same name.[273] Beckham captained England 59 times,[274] the fourth 
highest after Bobby Moore and Billy Wright both with and Bryan Robson with 
65. With his free kick goal against Ecuador in the second round of the 
2006 World Cup, Beckham gained membership into two of football's exclusive 
clubs: he became the only English player – and the 21st player in the world 
– to score in three World Cups; Real Madrid teammate Raúl also achieved 
this feat a few days earlier.[275] It also made him only the fifth player 
in World Cup history to score twice from a direct free kick; the other 
four were Pelé, Roberto Rivelino, Teófilo Cubillas, and Bernard Genghini 
(Beckham had previously scored this way against Colombia in the first round 
of the 1998 World Cup). All three goals were against South American teams 
(Colombia, Argentina and Ecuador) and from set pieces (the two aforementioned 
free kicks and a penalty against Argentina).[164][179] As of 2013, Beckham 
had a total of 32 tattoos.[276] There are names of his sons Romeo, Cruz 
and Brooklyn, and the name of his wife Victoria. His wife's name, tattooed 
on his left forearm, is in Hindi script because Beckham thought it would 
be "tacky" to have it in English. Unfortunately, this was misspelt as the 
equivalent of "Vihctoria".[277] Another tattoo is a Bible verse written 
in Hebrew, reads אני לדודי ודודי לי הרעה בשושנים, translated into: "I am 
my beloved's, and my beloved is mine, that shepherds among the lilies." 
In his autobiography David Beckham: My Side, he revealed some of his thoughts 
on tattoos: "The idea came to me much later, a little while after Brooklyn 
was born. I was talking to Mel B and her then-husband, Jimmy Gulzar, and 
the subject of tattoos came up. I ended up going to this Dutch guy who'd 
done all of Jimmy's. I'd finally realised what I wanted a tattoo to represent. 
Mine are all about the people in my life, my wife and sons, who I want 
with me always. When you see me, you see the tattoos. You see an expression 
of how I feel about Victoria and the boys. They're part of me."[278] [281][282]
