August Joseph "Augie" Donatelli (August 22, 1914 – May 24, 1990) was an 
American umpire in Major League Baseball who worked in the National League 
from 1950 to 1973. Highly regarded for his ability, he was also known for 
his inclination to eject players and managers quickly and dramatically. 
Known as Gus to those close with him, Donatelli was born in Heilwood, Pennsylvania 
and raised in Bakerton. After enjoying a 14-game career as a minor league 
infielder in 1938, he served in the Army Air Forces' Eighth Air Force during 
World War II and spent 15 months as a German prisoner of war after flying 
18 missions as a tailgunner on a B-17. His plane was shot down during the 
first daylight raid on Berlin, and he suffered a broken ankle upon parachuting. 
He began umpiring softball games while a POW before being freed when Soviet 
troops overran the area. After the war he opted for an umpiring career 
rather than return to the coal mines near his hometown, and after graduating 
from Bill McGowan's school in 1946 worked in the Pioneer League in 1946, 
the South Atlantic League in 1947, and the International League in 1948-49.[1] 
During his major league career, he umpired in the World Series in 1955 
(outfield only), 1957, 1961, 1967 and 1973. He also officiated in the National 
League Championship Series in 1969 and 1972, serving as crew chief for 
the latter series, and in the 3-game playoff series to determine the NL 
champion in both 1959 and 1962. He umpired in the All-Star game in 1953, 
1959 (first game), 1962 (first game) and 1969. When the National League 
umpires began wearing uniform numbers in 1970, Donatelli was assigned uniform 
number 7. Donatelli was involved in numerous other notable games. On September 
20, 1969, working behind the plate for Bob Moose's 4-0 win,[2] he officiated 
in his eighth official no-hitter, tying an NL record held by Bob Emslie 
and Frank Secory; after Secory extended the record to nine in 1970, Donatelli 
again tied it on September 2, 1972 when he worked first base in Milt Pappas' 
8-0 gem.[3] Tom Gorman also tied the record in 1976 before Paul Pryor worked 
in his 10th no-hitter in 1978. Donatelli called balls and strikes for four 
of his nine no-hitters, including Warren Spahn's second no-hitter on April 
28, 1961,[4] and Ken Johnson's game of April 23, 1964 in which he became 
the first pitcher in history to lose a nine-inning no-hitter, by a score 
of 1-0.[5] In Game 4 of the 1957 World Series, he awarded Milwaukee Braves 
pinch-hitter Nippy Jones first base in the 10th inning after determining 
that there was shoe polish on the ball, showing that Jones had been hit; 
a pinch runner scored the game-tying run, and the Braves went on to win 
both the game and the series.[1] Donatelli was noted for having perhaps 
the most dramatic ejection gesture in baseball. In a 1952 game between 
the New York Giants and St. Louis Cardinals, Donatelli ejected the Giants' 
Bob Elliott for arguing a called strike two, then ejected Elliott's replacement 
Bobby Hofman for disputing a called third strike.[1] He was part of the 
crew on May 2, 1954, when Stan Musial hit five home runs in a doubleheader; 
he was behind the plate in the first game, when Musial hit three of the 
five.[6] He was also in the umpiring crew for the May 30, 1956 doubleheader 
between the Braves and Chicago Cubs, in which the teams combined for a 
record 15 home runs; the Braves' Bobby Thomson hit a pair in each game, 
and Hank Aaron and Eddie Mathews each homered in both contests as well.[7] 
He also umpired in the April 30, 1961 game in which Willie Mays hit four 
home runs.[8] Donatelli is widely regarded as having been a primary force 
in the creation of the first umpires' union, the Major League Umpires Association, 
in 1964. He lost his position as crew chief immediately afterward, though 
NL president Warren Giles denied that Donatelli's involvement with the 
union was the cause.[1] Following Game 7 of the 1967 World Series, Donatelli 
was seen running off the field from his position at third base with the 
hats of two members of the victorious St. Louis Cardinals in his hands. 
The picture was picked up by the Associated Press and ran in newspapers 
from coast to coast the next day. His final game behind the plate came 
in Game 2 of the 1973 World Series between the New York Mets and Oakland 
Athletics. Donatelli was involved in a controversial play when he called 
the Mets' Bud Harrelson out when he tried to score from third base on a 
fly ball by Félix Millán in the top of the 10th inning with the score tied 
at 6-6. Replays showed that Harrelson avoided the tag of Athletics catcher 
Ray Fosse. Willie Mays, playing in his final season in baseball, pleaded 
his case in front of Donatelli, and soon the argument was joined by Mets 
manager Yogi Berra and Harrelson. Berra described the call as a "damn joke". 
The Mets went on to win the game 10-7 in 12 innings, thanks to two errors 
in 12th by Oakland second baseman Mike Andrews. Donatelli died in his sleep 
at age 75 at his home in St. Petersburg, Florida, and was buried at Bay
