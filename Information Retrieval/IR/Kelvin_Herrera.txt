Kelvin de Jesús Herrera Mercado (born December 31, 1989) is a Dominican 
professional baseball pitcher for the Kansas City Royals of Major League 
Baseball. Herrera along with Wil Myers represented the Royals at the 2011 
All-Star Futures Game.[1] Herrera was called up to the majors for the first 
time on September 21, 2011.[2] He gave up three earned runs over two innings. 
2012 was a breakout season for Herrera. He appeared in 76 games and posted 
a 2.35 ERA over 84 innings while compiling 77 strikeouts. On August 30, 
2012, Herrera got his first career save. Herrera took a bit of a step back 
in 2013 and spent part of the year in the minors. While pitching in the 
majors his ERA ballooned to 3.86 and he gave up nine home runs in 59 appearances.
