For the American architect see Archimania Todd Arthur Walker (born May 
25, 1973, in Bakersfield, California) is a former Major League Baseball 
infielder. Walker attended LSU where he led the Tigers to the 1993 national 
championship. He also earned the 1993 College World Series Most Outstanding 
Player award. In 2006, Walker was elected to the LSU Hall of Fame. In July 
2009, Walker was inducted into the National College Baseball Hall of Fame 
in Lubbock, Texas.[1] In 1994, the Minnesota Twins drafted Walker with 
the 8th pick in the 1st Round of the amateur draft. On August 30, 1996, 
Walker made his major league debut with the Twins. In 1998, Walker became 
the starting second baseman for the Twins, hitting .316 with 12 HR, 62 
RBIs, and a career best 19 stolen bases. Over the next season and a half, 
Walker's offensive performance began to decline, and the Twins traded Walker 
to the Colorado Rockies. He responded by hitting .316 through the rest 
of 2000 and .297 through the first half of 2001. Walker hit 12 home runs 
as a member of the Rockies that year. The Cincinnati Reds, in need of a 
better performance from its second base position, traded for Walker in 
July 2001. Walker rewarded the Reds by providing consistent offense, hitting 
.295 through the end of the season. In 2002, Walker enjoyed another fine 
year, hitting .299 with 11 HR and 64 RBIs and setting career highs with 
42 doubles and 155 games played. Following the season, the Boston Red Sox 
hired Theo Epstein as their new General Manager. One of his first moves 
was trading for Walker. During 2003, Walker continued to provide consistent 
offense, hitting .283 with 13 HR and setting a career high with 85 RBIs. 
On September 23 that year, with the Red Sox trailing the Baltimore Orioles 
5-2 in the ninth inning, Walker hit a two-out, two-strike, three-run home 
run off Jorge Julio to tie the game. (The Sox won, 6-5, on David Ortiz's 
walk-off home run in the tenth.)[2] The Red Sox made the playoffs and Walker 
stepped up his performance again; he hit .313 with three homers in the 
American League Division Series against the Oakland A's, and .370 with 
two more homers and hits in every game against the New York Yankees in 
the ALCS. The Red Sox were eliminated in 7 games. Walker's 5 postseason 
homers are still a Red Sox record. Despite his performance, Walker was 
allowed to leave, signing with the Chicago Cubs via free agency. Over the 
next three seasons, Walker attempted to maintain his offensive performance 
with the Cubs, but found himself playing less, platooning with younger 
players. Walker hit .274 (2004), .305 (2005), and .277 (through July 2006). 
However, he began to share time at second base with other players like 
Neifi Pérez, and started to make appearances at first base and in the outfield. 
At the end of July 2006, the San Diego Padres were attempting to make the 
playoffs while the Cubs were already out of the race. Before the trading 
deadline, the Padres traded low-A pitching prospect José Ceda to the Cubs 
for Walker, who became the new starting third baseman. He hit .282 down 
the stretch, and the Padres made the playoffs, but were eliminated in the 
first round by the St. Louis Cardinals. In 2007, Walker attended spring 
training with the Padres. However, during the offseason, the Padres had 
restocked the team with more infielders and left-handed hitters, and after 
a poor performance during the exhibition season, Walker was released on 
March 27. On March 30, 2007, he signed with the Oakland A's. On May 12, 
2007, Walker was designated for assignment to make room for Dallas Braden. 
Walker was subsequently released. From 2013 to 2015 Walker coached baseball 
at Calvary Baptist Academy in Shreveport, Louisiana.[3] Todd is a graduate 
of Airline High School in Bossier City, Louisiana. He married his high
