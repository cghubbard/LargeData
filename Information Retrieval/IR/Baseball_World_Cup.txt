The Baseball World Cup was an international tournament in which national 
baseball teams from around the world competed. It was sanctioned by the 
International Baseball Federation (IBAF). Along with the World Baseball 
Classic, it was one of two active tournaments considered by the IBAF to 
be a major world championship.[1] The baseball tournament at the Summer 
Olympic Games was also considered a major world championship while baseball 
was an Olympic sport.[2] After the 2011 tournament, the Baseball World 
Cup was discontinued in favor of an expanded World Baseball Classic tournament. 
The World Baseball Softball Confederation (WBSC) -- successor to the IBAF 
-- now sanctions two new tournaments: the biennial 23U Baseball World Cup 
(begun as the 21U Baseball World Cup in 2014) and WBSC's quadrennial, flagship 
tournament -- involving the twelve best-ranked national teams in the world 
-- called the WBSC Premier12 (begun in 2015).[3] There have been 38 Baseball 
World Cups to date and the last World Cup was held in 2011 in Panama. The 
first tournament, held in 1938, featured only two teams, but the last tournament 
included 22 participants; the previous two featured 16 and 18 teams (in 
2007 and 2005, respectively). The World Cup was originally called the Amateur 
World Series, until the tournament in 1988. Until 1988, the Amateur World 
Series was held in intervals of one to four years, except for the eight-year 
period from 1953–61. From 1988 to 2001, the Baseball World Cup was held 
in intervals of two to four years. After 2001, the tournament was held 
every two years. Until 1998 the competition was limited to amateur players. 
After 1998, professional minor league players competed, but Major League 
Baseball has not allowed its players to participate. In the months leading 
up to the high-profile first World Baseball Classic in 2006, many commentators 
heralded it as a "Baseball World Cup", perhaps not realizing that a tournament 
of that description already existed and had for almost seventy years. However, 
the 2006 World Baseball Classic was the first international baseball tournament 
to include players from the major leagues, making it a closer equivalent 
to the other world cups—which include players from the most prestigious
