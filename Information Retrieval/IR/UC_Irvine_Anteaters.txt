The UC Irvine Anteaters are the athletic teams that represent the University 
of California, Irvine (UC Irvine). Its Athletics program participates in 
the NCAA's Division I, as members of the Big West Conference and the Mountain 
Pacific Sports Federation. UC Irvine fields nationally competitive teams 
in men's baseball, men's and women's basketball, men's and women's cross 
country running, men's and women's golf, men's and women's soccer, men's 
and women's tennis, women's indoor track & field, men's and women's outdoor 
track & field, men's and women's volleyball, and men's and women's water 
polo. The Anteaters have won 28 national championships in nine different 
team sports. 64 Anteaters have won individual national championships, and 
53 Anteaters have competed in the Olympics. During the 1982 season the 
men's basketball team were led by two-time first team All-American Kevin 
Magee. That season, the team was ranked as high as No. 19 in the nation 
for NCAA Division I basketball. During the 1986 season the Anteaters were 
led by future NBA player and former head coach of the Oklahoma City Thunder, 
Scott Brooks. The Anteaters hired Golden State Warriors assistant Russell 
Turner as the head men's basketball coach in 2010. Turner was named Big 
West Conference Coach of the Year after he led the Anteaters to the 2013-2014 
conference regular season championship. UC Irvine's baseball team won two 
national championships at the College Division and the Division II level 
in 1973 and 1974, prior to moving to Division I. The program was eliminated 
in 1992 due to state budget cuts, but was reinstated in 2002. Since the 
return of its baseball program in 2002, UCI has been ranked as high as 
No. 1 in the country. In 2007, UCI participated in the College World Series 
for the first time in school history. The Anteaters eliminated both Cal 
State Fullerton and Arizona State before losing to Oregon State, earning 
a 3rd-place finish. In 2014, the Anteaters returned to the College World 
Series and earned a 5th-place finish. The man who helped rebuild UCI's 
baseball program, manager Dave Serrano, left after the 2007 season to manage 
at Cal State Fullerton. Mike Gillespie, who is best known for leading USC 
to the 1998 national championship, replaced Serrano and is the current 
manager of the Anteaters. UCI soccer plays its home games at Anteater Stadium. 
The men's team has been ranked as high as No. 3 in the nation and has made 
five Division I NCAA tournament appearances with berths in 2008, 2009, 
2011, 2013, and 2014. In addition, since the introduction of the Big West 
Conference Tournament for soccer in 2008 the Anteaters have won the tournament 
championship four times. The women's team has made two Division I NCAA 
tournament appearances with berths in 2010 and 2011. Notable Anteater soccer 
alumni include United States men's national team member Brad Evans (Seattle 
Sounders FC) and Rouzy (LA Galaxy). UC Irvine men's volleyball has won 
a total of four national championships, with titles in 2007, 2009, 2012, 
and 2013. The Anteaters made their first final four appearance in 2006, 
losing in the NCAA semi-finals to Penn State. They won their first national 
championship in 2007 by defeating IPFW 3–1 in the NCAA final. UCI won its 
second national championship in 2009 after defeating USC 3-2 in a five-set 
comeback victory in the NCAA final. The Anteaters won their third NCAA 
men's volleyball title in 2012 after defeating USC again in the NCAA final, 
this time in a 3-0 sweep at the Galen Center. UCI's longtime head coach 
John Speraw had guided the Anteaters to three national championships in 
six years but immediately after winning the 2012 national title he left 
UCI after accepting the head coaching position at UCLA. UC Irvine alum 
and former assistant coach David Kniffin took over the Anteater program 
in 2013 and became just the second head coach in NCAA men's volleyball 
history to win a national championship in his first season. In the 2013 
NCAA final the Anteaters defeated BYU in a 3-0 sweep to win back-to-back 
national championships. UC Irvine's men's water polo team won three NCAA 
Division I national championships in 1970, 1982, and 1989.[2] UCI's head 
men's water polo coach for many years was Ted Newland. As the Anteaters' 
head coach from 1966-2005, Newland had a lifetime record of 714–345–5. 
In his 39 years at the helm the Anteaters won three national championships, 
and the team was consistently rated among the nation's top 5 programs. 
Many world-class water polo players have been affiliated with UCI, with 
more than 70 NCAA All-Americans and 13 Olympians being produced by the 
program. Four Anteaters were a part of the United States team that won 
the silver medal at the 2008 Olympics in Beijing. The UCI basketball teams 
compete at the on-campus Bren Events Center. The volleyball teams compete 
at the nearby Crawford Hall, while using the Bren for some games where 
high attendance is expected. The baseball team plays in Anteater Ballpark, 
which is located behind the Mesa Parking Structure. Anteater Stadium itself 
is part of UCI's Crawford Athletics Complex, which houses the track and
