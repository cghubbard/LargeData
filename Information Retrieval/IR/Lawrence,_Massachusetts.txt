Lawrence is a city in Essex County, Massachusetts, United States, on the 
Merrimack River. As of the 2010 census, the city had a population of 76,377,[1] 
which had risen to an estimated 78,197 as of 2014.[2] Surrounding communities 
include Methuen to the north, Andover to the southwest, and North Andover 
to the southeast. Lawrence and Salem are the county seats of Essex County.[3] 
Lawrence is part of the Merrimack Valley. Manufacturing products of the 
city include electronic equipment, textiles, footwear, paper products, 
computers, and foodstuffs. Lawrence was the residence of poet Robert Frost 
for his early school years; his essays and poems were first published in 
the Lawrence High School newspaper.[4] Native Americans, namely the Pennacook 
or Pentucket tribe, had a presence in this area. Evidence of farming at 
Den Rock Park and arrowhead manufacturing on the site of where the Wood 
Mill now sits have been discovered.[5] Europeans first settled the Haverhill 
area in 1640, colonists from Newbury following the Merrimack River in from 
the coast.[6] The area that would become Lawrence was then part of Methuen 
and Andover. The first settlement came in 1655 with the establishment of 
a blockhouse in Shawsheen Fields, now South Lawrence. The future site of 
the city (formerly parts of Andover and Methuen), was purchased by a consortium 
of local industrialists. The Water Power Association members: Abbott Lawrence, 
Edmund Bartlett, Thomas Hopkinson of Lowell, John Nesmith and Daniel Saunders, 
had purchased control of Peter's Falls on the Merrimack River and hence 
controlled Bodwell's Falls the site of the present Great Stone Dam. The 
group allotted fifty thousand dollars to buy land along the river to develop.[7]:11 
In 1844, the group petitioned the legislature to act as a corporation, 
known as the Essex Company, which incorporated on April 16, 1845. The first 
excavations for the Great Stone Dam to harness the Merrimack River's water 
power were done on August 1, 1845.[7]:17 The Essex Company would sell the 
water power to corporations such as the Arlington Mills, as well as organize 
construction of mills and build to suit. Until 1847, when the state legislature 
recognized the community as a town, it was called interchangeably the "New 
City", "Essex" or "Merrimac".[7]:23 The post office, built in 1846, used 
the designation "Merrimac". Incorporation as a city would come in 1853, 
and the name "Lawrence", merely chosen as a token of respect to Abbott 
Lawrence, who it cannot be verified ever saw the city named after him. 
Canals were dug on both the north and the south banks to provide power 
to the factories that would soon be built on its banks as both mill owners 
and workers from across the city and the world flocked to the city in droves; 
many were Irish laborers who had experience with similar building work. 
The work was dangerous: injuries and even death were not uncommon.[8] Working 
conditions in the mills were unsafe and in 1860 the Pemberton Mill collapsed, 
killing 145 workers.[9] As immigrants flooded into the United States in 
the mid to late 19th century, the population of Lawrence abounded with 
skilled and unskilled workers from several countries.[citation needed] 
Lawrence was the scene of the infamous Bread and Roses Strike, also known 
as the Lawrence Textile Strike, one of the more important labor actions 
in American history.[citation needed] Lawrence was a great wool-processing 
center until that industry declined in the 1950s. The decline left Lawrence 
a struggling city. The population of Lawrence declined from over 80,000 
residents in 1950 (and a high of 94,270 in 1920) to approximately 64,000 
residents in 1980, the low point of Lawrence's population. Like other northeastern 
cities suffering from the effects of post-World War II industrial decline, 
Lawrence has often made efforts at revitalization, some of them controversial. 
For example, half of the enormous Wood Mill, powered by the Great Stone 
Dam and once the largest mills in the world, was knocked down in the 1950s.[citation 
needed] The Lawrence Redevelopment Authority and city officials utilized 
eminent domain for a perceived public benefit, via a top down approach, 
to revitalize the city throughout the 1960s. Known first as urban redevelopment, 
and then urban renewal, Lawrence's local government's actions towards vulnerable 
immigrant and poor communities, contained an undercurrent of gentrification 
which lies beneath the goals to revitalize Lawrence. There was a clash 
of differing ideals and perceptions of blight, growth, and what constituted 
a desirable community. Ultimately the discussion left out those members 
of the community who would be directly impacted by urban redevelopment.[10] 
Under the guise of urban renewal, large tracts of downtown Lawrence were 
razed in the 1970s, and replaced with parking lots and a three-story parking 
garage connected to a new Intown Mall intended to compete with newly constructed 
suburban malls. The historic Theater Row along Broadway was also razed, 
destroying ornate movie palaces of the 1920s and 1930s that entertained 
mill workers through the Great Depression and the Second World War. The 
city's main post office, an ornate federalist style building at the corner 
of Broadway and Essex Street, was razed. Most of the structures were replaced 
with one-story, steel-frame structures with large parking lots, housing 
such establishments as fast food restaurants and chain drug stores, fundamentally 
changing the character of the center of Lawrence.[citation needed] Lawrence 
also attempted to increase its employment base by attracting industries 
unwanted in other communities, such as waste treatment facilities and incinerators.[citation 
needed] From 1980 until 1998, private corporations operated two trash incinerators 
in Lawrence. Activist residents successfully blocked the approval of a 
waste treatment center on the banks of the Merrimack River near the current 
site of Salvatore's Pizza on Merrimack Street.[citation needed] Recently 
the focus of Lawrence's urban renewal has shifted to preservation rather 
than sprawl. Immigrants from the Dominican Republic and migrants from Puerto 
Rico began arriving in Lawrence in significant numbers in the late 1960s, 
attracted by cheap housing and a history of tolerance toward immigrants.[citation 
needed] In 1984, tensions between remaining working class whites and increasing 
numbers of Hispanic youth flared into a riot, centered at the intersection 
of Haverhill Street and Oxford Street, where a number of buildings were 
destroyed by Molotov cocktails and over 300 people were arrested.[11][12] 
Lawrence saw further setbacks during the recession of the early 1990s as 
a wave of arson plagued the city. Over 200 buildings were set alight in 
an eighteen-month period in 1991–92, many of them abandoned residences 
and industrial sites.[13] The Malden Mills factory burned down on December 
11, 1995. CEO Aaron Feuerstein decided to continue paying the salaries 
of all the now-unemployed workers while the factory was being rebuilt. 
By going against common CEO business practices, especially at a time when 
most companies were downsizing and moving overseas, he achieved recognition 
for doing the right thing.[14] A sharp reduction in violent crime starting 
in 2004[15] and massive private investment in former mill buildings along 
the Merrimack River, including the remaining section of the historic Wood 
Mill – to be converted into commercial, residential and education uses 
– have lent encouragement to boosters of the city.[citation needed] One 
of the final remaining mills in the city is Malden Mills. Lawrence's downtown 
has seen a resurgence of business activity as Hispanic-owned businesses 
have opened along Essex Street, the historic shopping street of Lawrence 
that remained largely shuttered since the 1970s.[citation needed] In June 
2007, the city approved the sale of the Intown Mall, largely abandoned 
since the early 1990s recession, to Northern Essex Community College for 
the development of a medical sciences center, the construction of which 
commenced in 2012 when the InTown Mall was finally removed.[16][17] A large 
multi-structure fire in January 2008 destroyed many wooden structures just 
south of downtown.[18] A poor financial situation that has worsened with 
the recent global recession and has led to multiple municipal layoffs had 
Lawrence contemplating receivership.[19] Lawrence has been aptly nicknamed 
the "Immigrant City".[20] Starting with the Irish in the 1840s, it has 
been home to numerous different immigrant communities, most of whom arrived 
during the great wave of European immigration to America that ended in 
the 1920s. Since the early 1970s, Lawrence has become home to a sizable 
Hispanic population, primarily Dominicans and Puerto Ricans. In 2010, 74% 
of the population of Lawrence was Hispanic. Lawrence became home to large 
groups of immigrants from Europe, beginning with the Irish in 1845, Germans 
after the social upheaval in Germany in 1848, and French Canadians seeking 
to escape hard northern farm life from the 1850s onward. A second wave 
began arriving after 1900, as part of the great mass of Italian and Eastern 
European immigrants, including Jews from Russia, Poland, Lithuania and 
neighboring regions. Immigration to the United States was severely curtailed 
in the 1920s with the Immigration Act of 1924, when foreign born immigration 
to Lawrence virtually ceased for over 40 years.[20] In 1890, the foreign-born 
population of 28,577 was divided as follows, with the significant remainder 
of the population being children of foreign born residents: 7,058 Irish; 
6,999 French Canadians; 5,131 English; 2,465 German; 1,683 English Canadian.[21] 
In 1920, toward the end of the first wave of immigration, most ethnic groups 
had numerous social clubs in the city. The Portuguese had 2; the English 
had 2; the Jews had 3; the Armenians, 5; the Lebanese and Syrians, 6; the 
Irish, 8; the Polish, 9; the French Canadians and Belgian-French, 14; the 
Lithuanians, 18; the Italians, 32; and the Germans, 47.[22] However, the 
center of social life, even more than clubs or fraternal organizations, 
was churches. Lawrence is dotted with churches, many now closed, torn down 
or converted into other uses. These churches signify, more than any other 
artifacts, the immigrant communities that once lived within walking distance 
of each church.[22][23] Irish immigrants arrived in Lawrence at its birth, 
which coincided with the Great Potato Famine of the 1840s, the event that 
drove great numbers of Irish out of Ireland. The Great Stone Dam, constructed 
in from 1845–1848 to power the nascent textile mills, was largely built 
by Irish laborers. The first Irish immigrants settled in the area south 
of the Merrimack River near the intersection of Kingston Street and South 
Broadway. Their shantytown settlement put them close to the dam being constructed, 
but away from the Essex Corporation row houses built north of the river 
to attract New England farm girls as millworkers. The religious needs of 
the Irish were initially met by the Immaculate Conception church, originally 
erected near the corner of Chestnut and White Street in 1846, the first 
Roman Catholic church in Lawrence. In December, 1848, the Reverend James 
O'Donnell erected "old" St. Mary's Church.[24]:82 By 1847, observers counted 
over ninety shanties in the Irish shantytown. In 1869,[25] the Irish were 
able to collect sufficient funds to form their own church, St. Patrick's, 
on South Broadway.[22] The first sizable German community arrived following 
the revolutions of 1848.[20] However, a larger German community was formed 
after 1871, when industrial workers from Saxony were displaced by economic 
competition from new industrial areas like the Ruhr.[26] The German community 
was characterized by numerous school clubs, shooting clubs, national and 
regional clubs, as well as men's choirs and mutual aid societies,[26] many 
of which were clustered around the Turn Verein, a major social club on 
Park Street.[22] Some Italian immigrants celebrated Mass in the basement 
chapel of the largely Irish St. Laurence O'Toole Church, at the intersection 
of East Haverhill Street and Newbury Street, until they had collected sufficient 
funds to erect the Holy Rosary Church in 1909 nearby at the intersection 
of Union Street and Essex Street.[22] Immigrants from Lentini (a comune 
in the Sicilian province of Syracuse) and from the Sicilian province of 
Catania maintained a particular devotion to three Catholic martyrs, Saint 
Alfio, Saint Filadelfo and Saint Cirino, and in 1923 began celebrating 
a procession on their feast day.[27] Although most of the participants 
live in neighboring towns, the Feast of Three Saints festival continues 
in Lawrence today. Many of the Italians who lived in the Newbury Street 
area had immigrated from Trecastagni, Viagrande, Acireale, and Nicolosi, 
Italy. French Canadians were the second major immigrant group to settle 
in Lawrence. In 1872, they erected their first church, St. Anne's, at the 
corner of Haverhill and Franklin streets. Within decades, St. Anne's established 
a "missionary church", Sacred Heart on South Broadway, to serve the burgeoning 
Québécois community in South Lawrence. Later it would also establish the 
"missionary" parishes in Methuen: Our Lady of Mount Carmel and St. Theresa's 
(Notre-Dame du Mont Carmel et St-Thérèse). The French-Canadians arrived 
from various farming areas of Quebec where the old parishes were overpopulated: 
some people moved up north (Abitibi and Saguenay–Lac-Saint-Jean), while 
others moved to industrial towns to find work (Montreal, Quebec; but also 
in the United States). Others who integrated themselves into these French-Canadian 
communities were actually Acadians who had left the Canadian Maritimes 
of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia also in search of work. Lawrence residents 
frequently referred to their Arabic-speaking Middle Eastern community as 
"Syrian". In fact, most so-called Syrians in Lawrence were from present-day 
Lebanon and were largely Maronite Christian.[22] Lebanese immigrants organized 
St. Anthony's Maronite Church in 1903,[28] as well as St. George's Orthodox 
Church, the oldest Greek Orthodox-rite church in the United States.[22] 
Jewish merchants became increasingly numerous in Lawrence and specialized 
in dry goods and retail shops. The fanciest men's clothing store in Lawrence, 
Kap's, established in 1902 and closed in the early 1990s, was founded by 
Elias Kapelson, born in Lithuania. Jacob Sandler and two brothers also 
immigrated from Lithuania in approximately 1900 and established Sandlers 
Department Store, which continued in business until 1978. In the 1880s, 
the first Jewish arrivals established a community around Common, Valley, 
Concord and Lowell streets. In the 1920s, the Jews of Lawrence began congregating 
further up Tower Hill, where they erected two synagogues on Lowell Street 
above Milton Street, as well as a Jewish Community Center on nearby Haverhill 
Street. All three institutions had closed their doors by 1990 as the remaining 
elderly members of the community died out or moved away.[22] The Polish 
community of Lawrence was estimated to be only 600–800 persons in 1900. 
However, by 1905, the community had expanded sufficiently to fund the construction 
of the Holy Trinity Church at the corner of Avon and Trinity streets.[22] 
Their numbers grew to 2,100 Poles in 1910. Like many of their immigrant 
brethren from other nations, most of the Poles were employed in woolen 
and worsted goods manufacturing.[29] A sizable English community, composed 
mainly of unskilled laborers who arrived after 1880, sought work in the 
textile mills where they were given choice jobs by the Yankee overseers 
on account of their shared linguistic heritage and close cultural links. 
Not all immigrants to Lawrence were foreign-born or their children. Yankee 
farmers, unable to compete against the cheaper farmlands of the Midwest 
that had been linked to the East coast by rail, settled in corners of Lawrence. 
Congregationalists were the second Protestant denomination to begin worship 
in Lawrence after the Episcopalians, with the formation of the Lawrence 
Street Congregational Church in 1847,[24]:66 and the first in South Lawrence, 
with the erection in 1852 of the first South Congregational Church on South 
Broadway, near the corner of Andover Street.[22] Immigration of foreign 
born workers to Lawrence largely ceased in 1921 with the passage of strict 
quotas against immigrants from the countries that had supplied the cheap, 
unskilled workers. Although many quotas were lifted after the Second World 
War, foreign immigration to Lawrence only picked up again in the early 
1960s with Hispanic immigrants from Cuba, Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic 
and other Latin American countries. Immigrants from Southeast Asia, particularly 
Vietnam, have also settled in Lawrence. Indicative of immigration trends, 
several Catholic churches now conduct masses in two or more languages. 
St. Patrick's Church, a Catholic church in Lawrence and once an Irish bastion, 
has celebrated Spanish masses on Sundays since 1999. A mass in Vietnamese 
is also offered every other week.[30] St. Mary's of the Assumption Parish 
is the largest Catholic parish in Lawrence by Mass attendance and number 
of registered parishioners. It has the largest multi-lingual congregation 
in the city and has been offering Spanish masses since the early 1990s.[citation 
needed] Since the 1990s, increasing numbers of former Catholic churches, 
closed since the 1980s when their Irish or Italian congregations died out, 
have been bought by Hispanic evangelical churches.[31] The 2000 Census 
revealed the following population breakdown, illustrating the shift toward 
newer immigrant groups: Dominican Republic, 22%; Puerto Rican, 22%; other 
Hispanic or Latino, 12%; Irish, 7%; Italian, 7%, French (except Basque), 
5%; Black or African American, 5%; French Canadian, 5%; English, 3%; Arab, 
2%; German, 2%; Lebanese, 2%; Central American, 1%; Polish, 1%; Portuguese, 
1%; Guatemalan, 1%; Vietnamese, 1%; South American, 1%; Spanish, 1%; Cambodian, 
1%; Scottish, 1%; Cuban, 1%; Scotch-Irish, 1%; Ecuadoran, 1%.[32] According 
to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 7.4 square 
miles (19 km2), of which 7.0 square miles (18 km2) is land and 0.4 square 
miles (1.0 km2) (6.07%) is water. Lawrence is on both sides of the Merrimack 
River, approximately 26 miles (42 km) upstream from the Atlantic Ocean. 
On the north side of the river, it is surrounded by Methuen. On the south 
side of the river, the town is bordered by North Andover to the east, and 
Andover to the south and southwest. Lawrence is approximately 30 miles 
(48 km) north-northwest of Boston and 27 miles (43 km) southeast of Manchester, 
New Hampshire. Aside from the Merrimack River, other water features include 
the Spicket River, which flows into the Merrimack from Methuen, and the 
Shawsheen River, which forms the southeastern border of the city. Lawrence 
has two power canals that were formerly used to provide hydropower to the 
mills - one on the north bank of the river, the other on the south. Channeling 
water into these canals is the Great Stone Dam, which lies across the entire 
Merrimack and was, at the time of its construction in the 1840s, the largest 
dam in the world. The highest point in Lawrence is the top of Tower Hill 
in the northwest corner of the city, rising approximately 240 feet (73 m) 
above sea level. Other prominent hills include Prospect Hill, in the northeast 
corner of the city, and Mount Vernon, along the southern edge of the city. 
Most industrial activity was concentrated in the flatlands along the rivers. 
Den Rock Park, a wooded conservation district on the southern edge of Lawrence 
that spans the Lawrence-Andover town line, provides recreation for nature 
lovers and rock-climbers alike.[33] There are also several small parks 
throughout town. Lawrence lies along Interstate 495, which passes through 
the eastern portion of the city. There are three exits entirely within 
the city, though two more provide access from just outside the city limits. 
The town is also served by Route 28 passing from south to north through 
the city, and Route 110, which passes from east to west through the northern 
half of the city. Route 114 also has its western terminus at Route 28 at 
the Merrimack River. Lawrence is the site of four road crossings and a 
railroad crossing over the Merrimack, including the O'Leary Bridge (Route 
28), a railroad bridge, the Casey Bridge (bringing Parker Street and access 
to Route 114 and the Lawrence MBTA station to the north shore), the Duck 
Bridge (which brings Union Street across the river), and the double-decked 
O'Reilly Bridge, bringing I-495 across the river. Lawrence is the western 
hub of the Merrimack Valley Regional Transit Authority's bus service. It 
is also home to the Senator Patricia McGovern Transportation Center, home 
to regional bus service and the Lawrence stop along the Haverhill/Reading 
Line of the MBTA Commuter Rail system, providing service from Haverhill 
to Boston's North Station. Lawrence Municipal Airport provides small plane 
service, though it is actually in neighboring North Andover. Lawrence is 
approximately equidistant from Manchester-Boston Regional Airport and Logan 
International Airport. Future plans to revitalize the Manchester and Lawrence 
branch[34] to the north, leading to Manchester, New Hampshire, will allow 
the MBTA to operate rail service up to Manchester from Lawrence, in conjunction 
with Pan Am Freights. Lawrence has a humid continental climate (Köppen 
climate classification Dfa), which is typical for the southern Merrimack 
valley region in eastern Massachusetts. According to the U.S. Census Bureau 
2010 Census, the city's population is 76,377, the population density is 
10,973.7 per square mile (4237/km²), and there are 27,137 households (25,181 
occupied). The racial makeup of the city is 42.8% White (20.5% non-Hispanic), 
7.6% Black or African American, 2.5% Asian (0.8% Vietnamese, 0.8% Cambodian), 
1.3% American Indian or Alaskan Native, 0.1% (57 total) Hawaiian Native 
or Pacific Islander, 39.3% some other race, 6.5% two or more races, and 
73.8% of the population is Hispanic or Latino (of any race) (39.6% Dominican, 
22.2% Puerto Rican, 3.0% Guatemalan, 0.8% Ecuadorian, 0.7% Mexican, 0.6% 
Salvadoran, 0.5% Cuban) (U.S. Average: 12.5%).[37] As of the census[38] 
of 2000, there were 72,043 people, 24,463 households, and 16,903 families 
residing in the city. The population density was 10,351.4 people per square 
mile (3,996.5/km²). There were 25,601 housing units at an average density 
of 3,678.4 per square mile (1,420.2/km²). The racial makeup of the city 
was 48.64% White (U.S. Average: 72.4%), 4.88% African American (U.S. Average: 
12.3%), 2.65% Asian (U.S. Average: 3.6%), 0.81% Native American (U.S. Average: 
0.1%), 0.10% Pacific Islander (U.S. Average: 0.1%), 36.67% from other races 
(U.S. Average: 5.5%), 6.25% from two or more races (U.S. Average: 2.4%). 
There were 24,463 households where the average household size was 2.90 
and the average family size was 3.46. In the city the population had a 
median age was 30.0 years (U.S. Average: 35.3): For every 100 females there 
were 91.6 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 86.8 
males. The median income for a household in the city was $25,983 (U.S. 
Average: $41,994), and the median income for a family was $29,809 (U.S. 
Average: $50,046). Males had a median income of $27,772 versus $23,137 
for females. The per capita income for the city was $11,360. About 21.2% 
of families (U.S. Average: 9.2%) and 34.3% (U.S. Average: 12.4%) of the 
population were below the poverty line, including 31.7% of those under 
age 18 and 20.1% of those age 65 or over. The Mayor of Lawrence, Daniel 
Rivera, said the city was "approximately 75% Spanish" following an incident 
where non English speaking callers were allegedly hung up on by a 911 operator.[39] 
Form of government: Plan B - "Strong mayor" - Mayor and city council, the 
councilors being elected partly at large and partly from districts or wards 
of the city. Party primaries prohibited.[41] [42] Lawrence has an established 
City Charter[43] and with a Mayor-council government. There are nine city 
councilors and six school committee members; most are elected by district; 
three city council members are elected at large. There are six districts 
in Lawrence and all elections are non-partisan. The Mayor serves as the 
seventh member and chair of the school committee. The city council chooses 
one of its number as president who serves as chair of the council. The 
city of Lawrence also elects three members to the Greater Lawrence Technical 
School Committee these members are elected at-large. City Council and Mayoral 
terms of office begin in the month of January. * = President/Chair ** = 
Vice President/Vice Chair Lawrence has its own police and fire departments, 
and Lawrence General Hospital provides ambulance services to the city.[44] 
The city also has its own public works and trash pickup departments. Lawrence 
is one of Essex County's two county seats, along with Salem. As such, it 
is home to a juvenile, district and superior court, as well as a regional 
office of the Massachusetts Registry of Motor Vehicles. It is also home 
to the Lawrence Correctional Alternative Center, a regional alternative 
jail for low-risk offenders. It is not home to the county's sheriff or 
district attorney; they are in Middleton (home to the county's correctional 
facility) and Salem, respectively. The city is also covered by the Andover 
barracks of Troop A of the Massachusetts State Police, which serves much 
of the western Merrimack Valley and several towns just south of Andover. 
Lawrence General Hospital[46] is the city's main hospital, providing service 
to much of the area south of the city. Other nearby hospitals are in Methuen, 
Haverhill and Lowell. The city also is served by the Greater Lawrence Family 
Health Center.[47] Guardian Ambulance was established in 1990 and incorporated 
in 1991 by local EMTs to serve the city during a downturn in the economy 
at that time. The station moved from the Tower Hill section to its current 
location on Marston Street in 1993. The city has a public school system 
managed by Lawrence Public Schools.[52] High schools Elementary schools 
High schools Public Private The Lawrence public library was established 
in 1872.[59][60] In fiscal year 2008, the city of Lawrence spent 0.55% 
($1,155,597) of its budget on its public library—some $16 per person.[61] 
Lawrence's main newspaper is The Eagle-Tribune,[62] one of the major newspapers 
for the Merrimack Valley that was founded in Lawrence in 1890 but later 
moved its facilities to the town of North Andover on Route 114. Lawrence 
is home to Rumbo (a bilingual English/Spanish paper) and Siglo 21[63] (a 
Spanish paper). Another newspaper closely covering Lawrence news is The 
Valley Patriot,[64] a monthly paper published in North Andover. The city 
has one FM station, WEEI-FM 93.7, and four AM stations, WNNW 800, WCAP 
980, WCCM 1110 and WLLH 1400. Lawrence Community Access Television[65] 
is the only television station operating out of the city, and the city 
is considered part of the Boston television market. What's Good in the 
Hood[66] (est.2010), a local blog produced by youth, covers stories about 
Lawrence. Lawrence is served by Area codes 978 and 351. Originally a part 
of area code 617, it became part of area code 508 in 1988 before that, 
too, was split, with 978 covering the northern half of the old area code. 
Area code 351 is considered an overlay code. New Balance has a shoe manufacturing 
plant in Lawrence, one of five plants operating in the US.[67] Charm Sciences, 
which manufactures test kits and systems for antibiotic, veterinary drugs, 
mycotoxins, pesticides, alkaline phosphatase, pathogens, end-product microbial 
assessment, allergen control, and ATP hygiene, has a laboratory in Lawrence.
