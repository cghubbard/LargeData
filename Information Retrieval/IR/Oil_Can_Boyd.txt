Dennis Ray "Oil Can" Boyd (born October 6, 1959) is a former starting pitcher 
in Major League Baseball. Boyd played for the Boston Red Sox (1982–89), 
Montreal Expos (1990–91), and Texas Rangers (1991). He batted and threw 
right-handed. His nickname has been reported as coming from his beer-drinking 
days in his hometown of Meridian, Mississippi, where beer is referred to 
as "oil."[1] However, in a September 2012 interview, he said that wasn't 
strictly true; it was actually "rot-gut whiskey" from the neighborhood 
moonshiner.[2] He attended Jackson State University. He was selected by 
the Boston Red Sox in the 16th round of the 1980 amateur draft, Boyd made 
his debut in the 1982 season. He pitched 10 years in the majors before 
blood clots in his right arm ended his career.[3] According to the Inside 
Baseball portion of the April 27, 1987 Sports Illustrated, Boyd listed 
Haiti in the '87 Red Sox yearbook as his favorite vacation destination. 
In a 10-season career, Boyd collected a 78-77 record with 799 strikeouts 
and a 4.04 ERA in 1389.2 innings.[3] From 1983–85 Boyd won 31 games for 
Boston, with 15 victories in 1985. In the same season, he posted career-highs 
in games started (35), complete games (13), strikeouts (154) and innings 
pitched (272.1). In 1986 he won a career high 16 games for the Sox. Boyd 
signed with the Expos as a free agent after the 1989 season. In 1990 he 
won 10 games for the Expos and compiled a 2.93 ERA. When the Rangers acquired 
him from Montreal during the 1991 season, it looked like a deal which might 
lead to a division title, and though Boyd's work with the Expos before 
coming to Texas wasn't great (6-8, 3.52), it was plenty good enough for 
the pitching-poor Rangers. That was the plan, but Boyd turned out to be 
bad. In 12 starts he posted a 2-7 record with a 6.68 ERA (the highest of 
his career) and allowed 81 hits in only 62 innings. Boyd was a free agent 
when the season ended, and after turning down some offers for relief duties, 
he retired. Between the 1990s and 2000s, Boyd has pitched in the minors, 
Northern League, Puerto Rico and In 1993 he played for the Industriales 
de Monterrey Mexico. In 2005, he came out of retirement to pitch for the 
Brockton Rox of the Can-Am League. In November 2005, Boyd was indicted 
by a federal grand jury in Mississippi for threatening a former girlfriend 
(who was also a business associate) as well as her son. On November 14, 
2005, Boyd surrendered to F.B.I. agents in Tupelo, Mississippi.[4] In February 
2009, Boyd announced he was attempting a comeback to Major League Baseball.[5] 
In February 2012, Boyd admitted to extensive use of cocaine while he was 
playing in the Major Leagues and said he was often under the influence
