The 1999 Atlanta Braves season marked the franchise's 34th season in Atlanta. 
The Braves won their eighth consecutive division title with a 103-59 record 
and 6 game lead over the New York Mets. The Braves appeared in the World 
Series for the fifth time during the 1990s. The Braves lost all four games 
of the 1999 World Series to the New York, resulting in a dominant sweep. 
The Braves suffered their 2nd World Series elimination to the Yankees in 
4 years. The first being in 1996 in six games. Two key players on the 1999 
Braves were Chipper Jones & John Rocker. Jones won the National League's 
Most Valuable Player award with a .310 average, 45 HRs, 110 RBIs, and sealed 
the award with his September heroics against the New York Mets. Rocker 
recorded 38 saves as Atlanta's closer, but later created controversy due 
to his racist and homophobic comments in a December 27, 1999, Sports Illustrated
