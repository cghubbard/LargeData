The 1958 Philadelphia Phillies season was the 76th in franchise history. 
The Phillies finished the season in last place in the National League. 
It was the Phillies third losing season in five seasons, and their fourth 
losing season during the 1950s. Following their off-season move from Brooklyn 
to Los Angeles, the Dodgers played their first game as the Los Angeles 
Dodgers against the Phillies at Miami Stadium in the 1958 spring training 
opener on March 8, 1958. The Phillies won 7 to 4.[2] With the move of the 
Brooklyn Dodgers and New York Giants to California prior to the 1958 season, 
the Phillies became the closest National League club to New York City, 
and in response, contracted to broadcast 78 games into the New York metropolitan 
television market to fill the void in National League games on TV in New 
York.[3][4][5] Al Helfer and Rex Barney called the games for New York's 
WOR-TV.[6] However, due to competition with games at Yankee Stadium, Phillies 
games were not able to match the audience for Yankee broadcasts, and thus, 
they stopped broadcasting games in the New York television market in the 
1959 season.[7] On July 22 with the team sporting a 39â€“44 record General 
Manager Roy Hamey fired Manager Mayo Smith rehiring Eddie Sawyer, who led 
the team to the 1950 World Series.[8] Infielders Other batters Coaches
