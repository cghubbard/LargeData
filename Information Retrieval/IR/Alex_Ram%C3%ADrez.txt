As a player: As manager: NPB Alexander Ramón Ramírez (born 15 August 1974) 
is a Venezuelan former professional baseball outfielder who had a long 
career in Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB). He is the first foreign-born 
player to record 2,000 hits while playing in NPB. Before playing in Japan, 
he played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Cleveland Indians (1998–2000) 
and Pittsburgh Pirates (2000). He batted and threw right-handed. In October 
2015 he was named as the BayStars manager for the 2016 season.[1] He was 
named the Indians' 1998 Minor League Player of the Year (receiving the 
"Lou Boudreau Award").[2][3] In three MLB seasons, Ramírez batted .259 
with 12 home runs, 48 RBI, 38 runs, 17 doubles, three triples, and three 
stolen bases in 135 games. After the 2000 season, Ramírez signed with the 
Yakult Swallows (2001–2007) and was their cleanup hitter. During his final 
season with the Swallows he set the Central League record for most base 
hits in a single season (204). (This record did not stand long: Hanshin 
Tigers outfielder Matt Murton surpassed Ramírez's tally en route to finishing 
the 2010 season with 214 hits.) The 2007 season, however, proved to be 
Ramírez's last with the Swallows, who did offer him the multi-year contract 
he sought. Instead, the outfielder signed with the Yomiuri Giants for the 
2008 season. Ramírez quickly flourished with his new team. In 2008, he 
led the Central League with 125 RBI while hitting .319 (6th in the league) 
with 45 home runs (2nd). He also hit two home runs in Game 2 of the Japan 
Series, including one in the bottom of the ninth to win Game 2. At the 
end of the 2008 season, Ramírez won the Central League MVP Award. He was 
the third Venezuelan player to be so honored in Japanese Baseball, joining 
Roberto Petagine (Central League, 2001) and Alex Cabrera (Pacific League, 
2002).[4] After playing eight seasons in NPB, he obtained FA Right in 2008 
and became exempt from the restriction of the number of non-Japanese players 
on each team. Very few non-Japanese players have accrued enough service 
time in the NPB to earn such rights. In 2009, he became the second player 
to obtain overseas FA right allowing him to play overseas (though due to 
his previous stint in the Major Leagues, he was already exempt from the 
posting system between the NPB and the MLB) and the fastest foreign player 
to accumulate 1500 hits in NPB.[5] On April 6, 2013, however, Ramirez hit 
a home run to record his 2,000 career hit in the NPB, becoming the 42nd 
player and the first foreign player to accomplish the feat. This accomplishment 
also earned Ramírez an invitation to the Meikyukai, a private club recognizing 
Japan's elite players. He was the first Western player to be so honored.[6] 
Ramírez spent the 2014 season as a player-coach with the Gunma Diamond 
Pegasus of Japan's Baseball Challenge League. In 45 games, he hit .305 
with 7 home runs and 38 RBI.[7] He retired after the 2014 season and signed 
on as the Diamond Pegasus' Senior Director.[8] In the middle of the 2015 
Ramírez joined the Orix Buffaloes as an advisor, mentoring younger players.[9] 
In October 2015 he was named as the BayStars manager for the 2016 season, 
replacing Kiyoshi Nakahata who resigned at the end of the 2015 season due 
to the team's poor performance.[1] Statistics current as of 21 November 
2014 In February 2013, Alex Ramirez started, with his wife and his son, 
a restaurant in Tokyo, Japan, called Ramichan Cafe, serving the cuisine 
of Puerto Rico, where his wife grew up.[10] Ramirez is a Christian. Ramirez 
has spoken about his faith saying, "I believe (continuing to play baseball) 
is my desire, but it's not my life. God has already blessed me with this 
career, and whatever God has planned for me, I will be happy to follow 
that, whether or not I play baseball again. It's not what I want; it's
