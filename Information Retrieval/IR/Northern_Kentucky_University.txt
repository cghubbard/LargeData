Northern Kentucky University is a public, co-educational university in 
northern Kentucky located in Highland Heights, seven miles (11 km) southeast 
of downtown Cincinnati, Ohio. The university is primarily an undergraduate, 
liberal arts institution, but it also features graduate programs. Total 
enrollment at the university currently exceeds 15,000 students, with over 
13,000 undergraduate students and over 2,000 graduate students served by 
nearly 2600 faculty and staff.[4] Northern Kentucky University is the third 
largest university, behind the University of Cincinnati and Miami University, 
but before Xavier University, of Greater Cincinnati's four large, four-year 
universities and the youngest of Kentucky's eight state universities, although 
it is not the last to join the state system, as the University of Louisville 
did not become a state university until 1970. Notable among the university's 
programs are the Salmon P. Chase College of Law and the College of Informatics, 
founded in 2006.[7] The university has been cited for academic quality 
and value by such publications as CIO Magazine,[8] U.S. News and World 
Report,[9] and Forbes.[10][11] The university issues an annual report that 
recaps significant achievements by students, faculty, and staff.[12] Northern 
Kentucky University began in 1948, when an extension campus for the University 
of Kentucky was opened in Covington, Kentucky, known as the UK Northern 
Extension Center.[13] After 20 years in operation as an extension center 
for UK, it became an autonomous four-year college under the name Northern 
Kentucky State College (NKSC).[1] In 1970, Dr. W. Frank Steely was hired 
as the first president.[14] The following year, the Salmon P. Chase College 
of Law, formerly an independent law school in Cincinnati, merged with Northern 
Kentucky State College. The main campus moved from Covington to Highland 
Heights, Kentucky, in 1972. NKSC awarded its first bachelor's degrees in 
May 1973. Rapid expansion resulted in the school being upgraded to university 
status in 1976.[15] Since its founding in 1968 and elevation to university 
status in 1976, Northern Kentucky University has expanded with numerous 
construction projects, new colleges and a much larger, more diverse student 
body. The most recent former president of the university, James C. Votruba, 
is largely credited with transforming the image of the university since 
his arrival in 1997, helping to build the university's reputation as a 
respected academic institution.[16] As part of Votruba's administration, 
the university has increased its admissions standards and improved the 
academic performance of its students. Northern Kentucky University also 
launched a new university logo and branding effort in 2002.[17] In recent 
years, the university has also concentrated on the construction of new 
and improved facilities across campus. Northern Kentucky University's main 
campus in Highland Heights, Kentucky is situated on 400 acres (1.6 km2) 
of rolling countryside along U.S. Route 27, just off of Interstate 275 
and Interstate 471, seven miles (11 km) southeast of Cincinnati, Ohio. 
The campus was built beginning in the early 1970s, and the first building, 
Nunn Hall, opened in 1972.[15] Although most of the university's students 
commute daily to the campus, approximately 2,000 students live on campus. 
In recent years, the university has been in the process of expanding its 
campus and facilities. The $60 million BB&T Arena is a recently completed 
9,400-seat arena. It serves as the primary venue for athletics on campus, 
and also as a venue for entertainment, such as live bands and concerts. 
The arena was originally known as The Bank of Kentucky Center, named after 
The Bank of Kentucky, which made an endowment of $5 million toward construction. 
The name was changed in 2015 when that bank was purchased by BB&T. Additionally, 
a new $37 million, 144,000-square-foot (13,400 m2) Student Union building, 
which opened to students in August 2008, largely replaces an old university 
center and is designed to accommodate student needs on campus. The building 
includes cafeterias, stores, a game room, offices for student life programs, 
and other amenities for students. Other recent projects included the construction 
of a new parking garage to accommodate the arena and a European-style roundabout 
for traffic control and flow management. The most recent university master 
plan envisions a massive expansion of the campus by the year 2020, including 
multiple new academic buildings, housing developments, campus quad areas, 
athletic fields, parking lots and connector roads.[18] The Landrum Academic 
Center houses an Anthropology Museum. The university campus is also the 
first educational institute in the world to have a laser-projection planetarium, 
as part of the Dorothy Westerman Hermann Natural Science Center. The Covington 
campus, located in Covington, Kentucky, closed at the end of 2008. It mainly 
served nontraditional and adult students and also hosted the Program for 
Adult-Centered Education and Emergency Medical Technology programs.[19] 
Northern Kentucky University's Grant County Center, located in Williamstown, 
Kentucky, is a partnership between the Grant County Foundation for Higher 
Education and Northern Kentucky University. It houses Northern Kentucky 
educational programs and the Williamstown Innovation Center. The Japanese 
Language School of Greater Cincinnati (シンシナティ日本語補習校 Shinshinati Nihongo 
Hoshūkō) is a weekend supplementary Japanese school held at the Mathematics, 
Education and Psychology Center (MP), formerly known as the Business Education 
Psychology (BEP) Building.[20][21] The school was founded in 1975.[21] 
Northern Kentucky's main library is the W. Frank Steely Library,[22] completed 
in 1975 and named after the first president of the university. A $9.1 million 
renovation and expansion project was completed in 1995. The library's five 
floors contain over 850,000 volumes, more than 18,000 bound periodicals, 
and approximately 1.4 million microforms. The two-floor Chase Law Library[23] 
Northern Kentucky's other library on campus, contains more than 313,000 
volumes and 57,000 monographic and serial titles. Corporate and university 
partnerships include The Scripps Howard Center for Civic Engagement[24] 
the Fifth/Third Entrepreneurial Center[25] the Metropolitan Education and 
Training Services Center,[26] the Center for Applied Informatics,[27] and 
Fidelity Investments. Other centers on campus include the Center for Applied 
Anthropology,[28] the Institute for Freedom Studies,[29] the Center for 
Environmental Restoration[30] the Small Business Development Center[31] 
the Institute for New Economy Technologies[32] the Center for Environmental 
Education[33] the Center for Integrative National Science and Mathematics[34] 
and the Chase Local Government Law Center.[35] Northern Kentucky University 
includes an international enrollment process, with many students hailing 
from Kentucky and Ohio, as well as Indiana. Northern Kentucky University 
students organize to form six colleges. The newest college is the College 
of Informatics, founded in 2006, replacing the College of Professional 
Studies. Northern Kentucky University students are also a part of university-wide 
honors programs,[41] as well as individual chapters in numerous honor societies. 
Northern Kentucky's Alpha Beta Phi chapter of Phi Alpha Theta, the International 
History Honor Society, has won 18 consecutive best chapter awards. Students 
may attend lecture-style debates between well-known conservative and liberal 
guests. NKU's Alumni Association Lecture Series has featured such guests 
as politicians Mario Cuomo, Alan Keyes, Steve Forbes, Newt Gingrich, George 
McGovern, Bob Dole and John Edwards; political strategists James Carville, 
Mary Matalin and Paul Begala; journalist Bob Woodward; and commentators 
George Stephanopoulos, George Will, Tucker Carlson and Al Franken. Most 
recently, the 2007 lecture featured former Republican political candidate 
Pat Buchanan and former Senate Majority Leader, Democrat Tom Daschle, and 
the 2008 lecture featured Karl Rove, the Republican political consultant 
and former Deputy Chief of Staff to George W. Bush and Dee Dee Myers, the 
Democratic strategist and former White House Press Secretary in the Clinton 
administration. The university's teams for both men and women are nicknamed 
"Norse". Their mascot is named Victor E. Viking.[43] Northern Kentucky 
University joined the Horizon League on July 1, 2015 after leaving the 
Atlantic Sun Conference.[6] NKU is in the process of becoming a full Division 
I member. During this time, NKU will not be eligible for NCAA championships 
during the four-year reclassification period to Division I.[44] The university 
fields teams in baseball, men's and women's basketball, men's and women's 
cross country, men's and women's golf, men's and women's soccer, softball, 
women's track and field, men's and women's tennis and women's volleyball. 
Students have also organized club teams in ice hockey,[45] men soccer club,[46] 
taekwondo[47] fencing,[48] boxing, lacrosse,[49] rugby, kickball, skeet 
& trap, and Men's Wrestling. These clubs are primarily organized through 
the Sport Club program.[50] The Northerner is Northern Kentucky's student-run
