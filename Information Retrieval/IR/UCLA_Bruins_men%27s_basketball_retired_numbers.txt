The men's college basketball program of the University of California, Los 
Angeles (UCLA) was founded in 1920 and is known competitively as the UCLA 
Bruins. The Bruins have won 11 National Collegiate Athletic Association 
(NCAA) Men's Division I Basketball Championships, the most of any school.[1] 
UCLA players have been assigned jersey numbers ranging from 0 to 78 in 
the team's history.[2] The school no longer issues 10 retired numbers in 
honor of former players.[3] To qualify, a player must have been a three-time 
consensus All-American, a consensus national player of the year, or been 
inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. The retired 
numbers are displayed in the rafters of the Bruins' home arena, Pauley 
Pavilion.[4] UCLA's legendary coach John Wooden generally opposed having 
numbers retired. Numbers retired by UCLA were originally limited to three-time 
consensus All-Americans.[5] In 1990, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, known as Lew 
Alcindor during his UCLA career, and Bill Walton were the first to have 
their numbers retired.[6] The ceremony was held in conjunction with the 
25th anniversary of Pauley Pavilion.[7][8] Wooden valued team play over 
individual accolades, and he opposed retiring numbers.[5][9] "What about 
the fellows who wore that number before?" Wooden asked. "Didn't they contribute 
to the team?"[9] Wooden did think highly of Abdul-Jabbar and Walton. "If 
such a thing can be deserved, it'd be Alcindor and Walton. But I don't 
think it would be anyone else," said Wooden.[10] UCLA in 1996 expanded 
the requirements for retiring numbers to include players who were consensus 
national players of the year.[5] This allowed the jersey numbers of Walt 
Hazzard (No. 42), Sidney Wicks (35), Marques Johnson (54) and Ed O'Bannon 
(31) to be retired.[10] In 2004, UCLA also allowed players inducted into 
the Naismith Hall of Fame to be eligible, enabling the retirement of Gail 
Goodrich's No. 25.[5][11] Three Bruins were inducted into the Hall of Fame 
in 2012, and UCLA retired their numbers in 2013—Jamaal Wilkes (52), Reggie 
Miller (31), and Don Barksdale (11).[12] Eight of the players honored were 
members of NCAA championship teams,[13][14] and seven of the players were 
coached by Wooden.[15] Although Hazzard's No. 42 was retired, he allowed 
Kevin Love (2007–2008) to wear it.[2][16][17][18] Johnson's retired No. 
54 was worn by his sons, Kris (1994–1998) and Josiah (2001–2005).[2][19] 
In addition, UCLA announced on November 22, 2014 that the number 42 would 
be retired across all university sports in honor of Jackie Robinson, a 
four-sport star at UCLA who went on to a Hall of Fame career in Major League 
Baseball and broke that sport's 20th-century color line. While Robinson 
wore several different numbers while at the school from 1939 to 1941, the 
number 42 was chosen because it was the number he wore during his Brooklyn 
Dodgers career. The all-sports retirement had no effect on men's basketball 
since that number had already been retired for Hazzard; however, Robinson's 
42 will be prominently displayed within all UCLA athletic venues, including
