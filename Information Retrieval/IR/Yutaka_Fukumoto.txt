As player As coach Yutaka Fukumoto (福本 豊, born November 7, 1947 in Osaka, 
Osaka) is a retired Japanese professional baseball player in Nippon Professional 
Baseball. An aggressive lead-off man and superior defensive centerfielder, 
he holds the Japanese career records in triples and stolen bases. He also 
hit more lead-off home runs than anyone in Japanese history, with 43. In 
2002 (Heisei 14), Fukumoto was inducted into the Japanese Baseball Hall 
of Fame.[1] After a brief career at the company team of Matsushita,[1] 
he was drafted seventh overall by the Hankyu Braves (currently the Orix 
Buffaloes) in 1968. In his second season, he stole 75 bases, setting the 
Japanese single-season record. In 1972 (Shōwa 47), he stole 106 bases, 
setting the all-world single-season modern-era record.[1][2] He also led 
the Braves to the Japanese championship. Fukumoto was named Most Valuable 
Player (MVP) and became the first Japanese MVP who had also led the league 
in steals. In 1983, he stole his 939th career base,[1] passing Lou Brock 
and setting the all-world career steals mark (later passed by Rickey Henderson 
in 1993).[2][3] That year he also collected his 2000th career hit. He was 
contacted for a National Honor Award, but declined.[citation needed] After 
the 1988 season, the Braves were slated to become the Orix Blue Wave. At 
the last game of the year, manager Toshiharu Ueda delivered a farewell 
address at the post-game ceremony. Ueda made the mistake of saying, "We 
bid farewell to Yamada and Fukumoto (who will leave the team) ..." instead 
of "We bid farewell to Yamada but will have Fukumoto (for the new team) 
...". Everyone was caught by surprise, including Fukumoto himself, since 
he had intended to play at least another year. Fukumoto shrugged to reporters 
and said, "Ueda said so, I'm retiring", and ended his career, He retired 
with 2,543 hits, 208 home runs, 449 doubles (2nd all-time), 115 triples, 
884 runs batted in, 1,065 stolen bases, and a .291 batting average, in 
2401 games. Fukumoto felt no ill will towards Ueda and went on to coach 
for Orix in 1989 and 1990. From 1998 to 1999, he coached for the Hanshin 
Tigers. He works as a baseball commentator for Asahi Broadcasting Corporation
