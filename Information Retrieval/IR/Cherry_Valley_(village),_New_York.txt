tourists; Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg used to visit to escape city

people around Cherry Valley are dairy farmers; tapping maple trees for 
sap, which is then refined into syrup, is a common spring practice. The 
area looks much like it did in the 19th century. Historic re-enactments 
are held to commemorate the importance of Cherry Valley during the American 
Revolution. Area attractions include the Baseball Hall of Fame, the Bates

New York City in 1857, and his younger sister Jane Augusta Funk (1823 - 
1860), better known as the notorious Fanny White. Cherry Valley has a long 
history as an artist and writer's community. Willa Cather left New York 
City for the isolated village in 1911, writing O Pioneers! while there. 
Poet Allen Ginsberg bought a farm there in the 1960s, and the town became 
a haven and destination point for many of the major personalities of the 
Beat scene: William Burroughs, Gregory Corso, Peter Orlovsky, Herbert Huncke, 
Ray Bremser, Anne Waldman, Robert Creeley, Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Harry 
Smith, Mary Beach, Claude Pelieu and many others all spent time either 
living or visiting there. Poet Charles Plymell still lives in Cherry Valley—he 
and his wife Pam ran Cherry Valley Editions from their home, publishing 
small editions of major writers. Jazz pianist Paul Bley is also a resident 
of the small town, as is artist/writer Jack Walls, artists Richard Saba 
and Mark Mastroianni, film maker James Rasin, and National Book Award nominated 
novelist Dana Spiotta. The transgender pioneer, actress and Andy Warhol 
Superstar Candy Darling is buried in the historic Cherry Valley Cemetery. 
A significant portion of the award winning feature-length documentary film 
about her life, Beautiful Darling (2010), was shot in Cherry Valley. The 
photographer Ryan McGinley has staged several photo shoots in and around 
the village, and the artist Dash Snow shot one of his last 8mm pieces, 
"Sisyphus, Sissy Fuss, Silly Puss", there in late May 2009. The recent 
Actress Jill Flint, (Royal Pains & The Night Shift) was born (1977) and
