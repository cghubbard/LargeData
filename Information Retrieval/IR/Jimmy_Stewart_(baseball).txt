James Franklin Stewart (June 11, 1939 – November 24, 2012 born in Opelika, 
Alabama) was a Major League Baseball player for the Chicago Cubs, Chicago 
White Sox, Cincinnati Reds and Houston Astros from 1963 to 1973.[2] He 
was born June 11, 1939 to John and Nelle Stewart. He graduated in 1957 
from Lafayette High School in Lafayette, Alabama, where he starred in baseball, 
basketball and track.[3] He went to Austin Peay State University in Clarksville, 
Tennessee where he lettered in baseball, basketball and track.[4] Stewart 
came up with the Cubs as a middle infielder, making his major league debut 
at age 24 on September 3, 1963 in a 16-3 loss to the San Francisco Giants 
in Candlestick Park. His first career at-bat was a pinch-hit flyout against 
Baseball Hall of Famer Juan Marichal.[5] His first hit came a week later 
on September 10 in an 8-0 road loss to the St. Louis Cardinals. Again, 
he was pinch-hitting against a Baseball hall of Famer, Bob Gibson, but 
this time he hit a double and later singled against Gibson.[6] His most 
productive season came in 1964 for the Cubs, when he played 132 games and 
hit .253 with three home runs, 33 runs batted in, 17 doubles and 49 walks. 
He was purchased from the Cubs by the Chicago White Sox during the 1967 
season. After playing in their minor league system for two seasons, he 
was drafted by the Cincinnati Reds from the White Sox in the 1968 rule 
5 draft. Due to his versatility in the field, during his three seasons 
with the Reds Stewart was known as "Super Sub" as he played every position 
except pitcher.[7] He played in two games of the 1970 World Series, going 
hitless in two at-bats as the Reds fell to the Baltimore Orioles in five 
games. On November 29, 1971, Stewart was part of a trade that brought Joe 
Morgan, César Gerónimo, Ed Armbrister, Jack Billingham and Denis Menke 
to the Reds from the Houston Astros for Stewart, Lee May and Tommy Helms. 
After two seasons with the Astros, he played his final major league game 
at age 34 on September 29, 1973. He ended his 10-year career with 777 games 
played with a .237 batting average, eight home runs and 112 runs batted 
in.[8] In 1978 he was inducted into the Austin Peay Athletics Hall of Fame.[9] 
After his playing days ended, in 1980 Stewart rejoined the Reds, serving 
first as a minor league manager and then as a scout, serving as major league 
scout from 1984 through 1991. In 1992 he joined the Philadelphia Phillies 
as a major league special assignment scout, and remained in that position 
until his retirement in 2006. He retired to Florida with his wife Donna. 
Jimmy Stewart died at age 73 on November 24, 2012 in Odessa, Florida. He 
was survived by his wife of 50 years, Donna; two sons, Jimmy and Andy; 
eight grandchildren, Brad, Andrew, Jeremy, Kristina, Lindsey, Donna, Valeria
