As player As manager Joseph James Kelley (December 9, 1871 – August 14, 
1943) was an American left fielder in Major League Baseball (MLB) who starred 
in the outfield of the Baltimore Orioles teams of the 1890s. Making up 
the nucleus of the Orioles along with John McGraw, Willie Keeler, and Hughie 
Jennings, Kelley received the nickname "Kingpin of the Orioles".[1] In 
his MLB career, Kelley played in the National League (NL) for the Boston 
Beaneaters (1891), Pittsburgh Pirates (1892), Baltimore Orioles (1892–1898), 
and Brooklyn Superbas (1899–1901), before he jumped to the upstart American 
League to play for the Baltimore Orioles (1902). He returned to the NL 
with Cincinnati Reds (1902–1906) and Boston Doves (1908). Kelley served 
as player-manager of the Reds (1902–1905) and Doves (1908). After extending 
his career in the minor leagues, he coached the Brooklyn Robins (1926), 
and scouted for the New York Yankees (1915–1916). Kelley was regarded as 
an excellent batter, a good base runner, and a great leader. Over his seventeen 
season MLB career, Kelley had a .317 batting average, and batted over .300 
in eleven consecutive seasons. Kelley stole a career-high 87 bases in the 
1896 season, which led MLB. He finished in the league's top ten in categories 
such as batting average, home runs, runs batted in (RBI), and stolen bases 
numerous times. He served as team captain of the Orioles and the Superbas. 
In recognition of his career achievements, Kelley was elected a member 
of the National Baseball Hall of Fame by the Veterans Committee in 1971. 
Kelley was born to Patrick Kelly and Ann Kelly (née Carney) in Cambridge, 
Massachusetts on December 9, 1871.[2] Kelley's parents emigrated to the 
United States from Ireland, and he had five siblings. According to the 
1880 United States Census, Patrick worked as a marble cutter.[3] As a child, 
Kelley was educated at a parochial grammar school and St. Thomas Aquinas 
College in Cambridge, where he starred for the school's baseball team as 
a pitcher. He worked for a local piano manufacturer and the John P. Lowell 
Arms Company. He practiced with the Harvard Crimson, the college baseball 
team of Harvard University, and played semi-professional baseball for the 
Lowell Arms Company.[3][4] Kelley made his professional debut with the 
Lowell Indians of the New England League (NEL) in 1891, at age 19. During 
games he did not pitch, Lowell's manager put him in the lineup as an infielder.[3][5] 
Kelley had a 10–3 win–loss record and a NEL-leading .323 batting average 
with Lowell.[3] Lowell folded in July.[6] Three days later, Kelley signed 
with the Boston Beaneaters of the National League (NL).[7] Kelley made 
his major league debut in August 1891 with the Beaneaters. After batting 
.244 in twelve games played, the Beaneaters released Kelley after the season.[3] 
Kelley began the 1892 season with the Omaha Omahogs of the Class–A Western 
League, turning down a $1,200 salary ($31,658 in current dollar terms) 
from the Oakland Oaks of the Pacific Coast League. With Omaha, Kelley batted 
.316 with 19 stolen bases in 58 games.[3] The Pittsburgh Pirates of the 
NL purchased Kelley's contract from Omaha for $500 ($13,191 in current 
dollar terms) on July 2, 1892. Ned Hanlon, new manager of the Baltimore 
Orioles, traded George Van Haltren to the Pirates for Kelley and $2,000 
($52,763 in current dollar terms) in September 1892.[3] Hanlon had succeeded 
Van Haltren as Orioles' manager during the season; remaining with the Orioles 
as a player, Van Haltren openly criticized Hanlon. Hanlon mentioned that 
he "had [his] eye on Kelley for a long time."[8] Hanlon taught Kelley how 
to play center field.[8] During the 1893 season, Kelley batted .305, with 
120 runs scored, and stole 33 bases.[8] He finished ninth in the NL with 
a .476 slugging percentage (SLG), and tied Eddie Burke for ninth in home 
runs with 9.[9] The Orioles won the NL pennant in 1894, 1895, and 1896. 
Kelley moved to left field in 1894 with the acquisition of Steve Brodie, 
who played center.[8] That year, he batted .393 with 111 runs batted in 
(RBI), 199 hits, and 165 runs scored, tying teammate Willie Keeler for 
second in runs and finishing sixth in batting average and eighth in hits.[10] 
Combined with 107 walks, which were tied for second most in the NL with 
Cupid Childs and behind only Billy Hamilton, Kelley posted a .502 on-base 
percentage (OBP), finishing second in the NL to Hamilton, and hit 48 doubles, 
good for second in the NL, behind only Hugh Duffy.[10] His .602 SLG was 
the fourth best in the NL.[10] These Orioles teams, led by John McGraw, 
were known to break the rules in order to win, including tampering with 
their bats and the playing field.[11] Kelley hid baseballs in the outfield, 
using the closest hidden ball instead of finding the ball batted into the 
outfield.[12] Kelley hit ten home runs in 1895, a then-franchise record,[13] 
tying him for fifth in the NL with five other players. He also tied Brodie 
for second with 134 RBI, finished fourth with 54 stolen bases, fifth with 
a .546 SLG, and sixth with a .456 OBP.[14] In 1896, Kelley finished seventh 
in the NL in batting average (.364), fourth in runs scored (148), fourth 
in SLG (.543), fifth in OBP (.469), ninth in hits (189), and tied Gene 
DeMontreville for eighth in home runs (8).[15] In 1897, Kelley agreed to 
serve as the coach of the Georgetown Hoyas, the college baseball team of 
Georgetown University.[16] That year, he finished fifth in the NL in batting 
average (.362) and RBI (118), seventh in OBP (.447), and eighth in SLG 
(.489).[17] By 1898, Kelley earned an annual salary of $2,500 ($71,230 
in current dollar terms), plus a $200 ($5,698 in current dollar terms) 
bonus for serving as team captain.[3] He finished third in the league with 
110 RBI and ninth with a .438 SLG.[18] Due to insolvency, the Brooklyn 
Superbas purchased the Orioles after the 1898 season and transferred Kelley, 
Hanlon, Keeler, Joe McGinnity, and Hughie Jennings to Brooklyn.[19] Wanting 
an opportunity to manage, and to remain near Baltimore, Kelley requested 
a transfer to the Washington Senators, but Washington did not have enough 
talent to send to Brooklyn to make a trade.[19] With McGraw remaining in 
Baltimore, Hanlon named Kelley team captain.[19] The Superbas won the NL 
pennant in 1899 and 1900, as Kelley finished tenth in RBI (93), OBP (.410), 
and tied several players for tenth in home runs (6) in 1899[20] and led 
the team with a .319 batting average in 1900,[19][21] while finishing fourth 
in the league in SLG (.485), tying Hickman for seventh in RBI (91), and 
tying Jimmy Collins and Buck Freeman for tenth in home runs (6).[22] Kelley 
moved back to the infield, becoming the regular first baseman in 1901.[21] 
After the 1901 season, Kelley denied reports that he would jump from the 
Superbas to the Detroit Tigers of the American League (AL), the former 
Western League which had decided to compete with the NL by creating franchises 
in east coast cities that housed NL franchises.[23] However, the opportunity 
to return to Baltimore proved irresistible to Kelley, and after the AL's 
successful 1901 season, he jumped from the Superbas to the Baltimore Orioles 
AL.[21][24] Kelley's father-in-law, John Mahon, was president and principal 
share holder of the AL's Orioles.[25] Kelley was named Orioles' captain 
and received some stock in the team.[21] McGraw, player-manager of the 
Orioles, resigned from the team to take over as manager of the New York 
Giants on July 7, 1902. In his absence, Kelley and Wilbert Robinson took 
over in the interim.[26] Under indefinite suspension by Ban Johnson by 
July 1902 for fighting with umpires,[3] Kelley entertained the idea of 
leaving the Orioles with McGraw, who was becoming frustrated with Johnson, 
and had begun negotiating to join the New York Giants of the NL.[27] With 
the team in financial straits,[28] Kelley sold his shares of the Orioles 
to Mahon, who had purchased McGraw's shares when he left for New York, 
becoming principal shareholder of the Orioles.[3] Mahon then sold controlling 
interest in the Orioles to Andrew Freedman, principal owner of the Giants, 
and John T. Brush, principal owner of the Cincinnati Reds, on July 17.[3] 
On the day they owned the franchise, they released the best players on 
the Orioles from their contracts so that they could be signed by National 
League teams: Kelley and Cy Seymour signed with the Reds, while McGinnity, 
Roger Bresnahan, Dan McGann, and Jack Cronin signed with the Giants.[29][30] 
Johnson, along with Orioles minority owners, took control of the Orioles 
franchise, which had to forfeit their game that day as they did not have 
enough players.[3] Kelley stated that the Orioles owed $12,000 ($328,754 
in current dollar terms), and that selling his shares was the only way 
Mahon could pay the team's debts.[3] The Superbas lodged a complaint against 
the Reds, claiming that Kelley was still under their control, seeking compensation 
from the Reds.[31][32] However, the other NL owners saw the situation as 
a coup for their league, and compelled Hanlon to drop his complaint.[33] 
Kelley did not immediately report to Cincinnati, instead traveling to Boston 
to attempt to convince members of the Boston Americans to join him in the 
NL.[33] Kelley joined the Reds on July 31.[28] With rumors that Kelley 
was negotiating to become the Reds' manager, incumbent manager Bid McPhee 
resigned, and Kelley succeeded him.[33] Kelley served as manager of the 
Reds from 1902 until 1905. In 1903, Kelley finished ninth in the NL in 
OBP (.402).[34] He was dismissed as manager after the 1905 season, and 
replaced by Hanlon.[35] He remained as a Reds player for the 1906 season. 
He batted .228 during the 1906 season, and the Reds released him.[35] Kelley 
signed with the Toronto Maple Leafs of the Class–AA International League 
(IL) in 1907, receiving a $5,000 salary ($127,196 in current dollar terms), 
the highest for a minor league player to date.[3] Kelley batted .322 for 
the Maple Leafs as a part-time player, spending time in left field and 
first base.[35] The Maple Leafs won the IL pennant that season.[3] With 
Fred Tenney set to leave the Boston Doves of the NL for the Giants,[36] 
the Doves claimed Kelley from the Maple Leafs,[35][37] signing Kelley to 
a two-year contract[38] with an annual salary of $5,500 ($145,098 in current 
dollar terms).[3] Kelley announced that he would play left field.[39] Kelley 
feuded with Doves' owner George Dovey, as Dovey wanted George Browne fined 
for "indifferent play", which Kelley refused to do.[40] Dovey fired Kelley 
in December 1908.[35] Kelley threatened legal action against Dovey, stating 
in the press that Dovey was releasing him to cut salary.[40][41] Kelley 
and Dovey settled their case, freeing Kelley from the second year of his 
Doves contract.[42] Maple Leafs president James McCafferey secured Kelley's 
return to the club in 1909.[38][43] He played with the Maple Leafs through 
1910, managing the Maple Leafs from 1912 to 1914, winning a second pennant 
in 1912.[3] After the 1914 season, the Maple Leafs released Kelley. The 
New York Yankees considered hiring Kelley as their manager after the 1914 
season.[44] Kelley scouted for the Yankees in 1915 and 1916.[3][45] Former 
teammate Wilbert Robinson, then manager of the Brooklyn Robins, hired Kelley 
and McGinnity to join his coaching staff for the 1926 MLB season.[3] Kelley 
and McGinnity were not retained after the season.[46] "Joe had no prominent 
weakness. He was fast on the bases, could hit the ball hard and was as 
graceful an outfielder as one would care to see. He covered an immense 
amount of ground and had that necessary faculty, so prominent in Speaker 
and others, of being able to place himself where the batter would be likely 
to hit the ball." As a player, Kelley had 11 consecutive .300-plus seasons 
during his MLB career. Kelley was also known as a good base runner and 
stole a career-high 87 bases in 1896. He retired with a career .317 batting, 
.402 OBP, 65 home runs, 1,421 runs, 1,194 RBI and 443 stolen bases in 1,853 
career games. His 194 triples ranks him ninth all-time.[47] Kelley tied 
Fred Carroll's MLB record with nine hits in a doubleheader,[48][49] which 
he presently shares with eight other players.[50] Additionally, he was 
known as a great leader.[51] He compiled a 338–321 win–loss record as a 
MLB manager. Kelley was considered by the Veterans Committee for induction 
into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1964,[48] but was not selected. 
He was voted into the Hall of Fame by the Veterans Committee in 1971.[52] 
Kelley married Margaret Mahon on October 26, 1897. Keeler served as Kelley's
