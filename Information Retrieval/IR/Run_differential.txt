In baseball, run differential is the subtraction of runs scored for a team 
and runs allowed by a team. The run differential is positive if a team 
scores more runs than allowed, while it is negative if a team allows more 
runs than scored for. Run differential can be used to predict the expected 
win total for a team. The differences in records between close games and 
blowout games can deviate the actual win–loss record from expected record 
based on run differential.[1] The best run differential in a MLB season 
is +411, set by the New York Yankees in 1939 in which they scored 967 runs 
and allowed 556 runs.[2] The worst run differential is the Cleveland Spiders 
in 1899 at −723 (529 runs scored, 1252 runs allowed).[3] The highest run 
differential in a single game in major league history is 29, when the Chicago 
Colts (now the Cubs) beat the Louisville Colonels 36–7 on June 29, 1897, 
and the record in modern history is 27, when the Texas Rangers beat the 
Baltimore Orioles 30–3 on August 22, 2007. The biggest run differential 
in a shutout is 22, when the Cleveland Indians defeated the New York Yankees
