Gardner is a city in Worcester County, Massachusetts, United States. The 
population was 20,228 at the 2010 census. Gardner is home to Dunn State 
Park, Gardner Heritage State Park, Lake Wampanoag Wildlife Sanctuary, and 
Mount Wachusett Community College. Named in honor of Col. Thomas Gardner,[3] 
the community was first settled in 1764 and officially incorporated as 
a town in 1785 after receiving land grants from the surrounding towns of 
Ashburnham, Westminster, Templeton and Winchendon.[4]:2 Dating from about 
1805, it became a center for lumber and furniture industries. Gardner is 
known as the "Chair City" and "The Furniture Capital of New England", due 
to its long history in furniture production. By 1910 it had 20 chair factories 
which produced 4 million chairs per year. It was also noted for silversmithing. 
The Gardner State Colony for the Insane pioneered the use of cottage residences. 
Gardner was incorporated as a city in 1923. Gardner is the birthplace of 
Heywood-Wakefield furniture, dating from 1826 when the five Heywood brothers 
began to fashion furniture in a barn near their father's farm. Brothers 
Walter, Levi, Seth, Benjamin and William began that year making wooden 
chairs. In the early years, Walter fashioned chairs by hand, also using 
a foot lathe. He was soon joined by his brothers Levi and Benjamin, part-time, 
while running a nearby country store. A new store was built across the 
street from the original store. In 1831 Levi moved to Boston where he established 
an outlet store to sell the chairs, while Benjamin and William remained 
in Gardner to manufacture the chairs. A fire destroyed the Heywoods' chair 
shop in 1834. In 1835 the partnership of B. F. Heywood & Co. was formed, 
composed of Benjamin, Walter and William, with Moses Wood and James W. 
Gates. Gardner was also the home of the Conant-Ball furniture factory. 
Nichols & Stone Chair Company traces their origin to 1762 in Westminster, 
Massachusetts. The company moved to Gardner at the turn of the 20th century. 
As of July 2008, it was announced they would terminate production. The 
Nichols & Stone name, the intellectual property and the design rights were 
purchased by the L. & J.G. Stickley of Manlius, New York.[5] Biggest Chair, 
c. 1910 Elm Street, c. 1908 Chestnut Street, c. 1906 The seal of Gardner 
was designed in 1898 by native-born illustrator Walter Harrison Cady, at 
the age of 21. According to the city code, the seal shows a portrayal of 
Col. Thomas Gardner standing in front of Crystal Lake with Mount Monadnock 
in the background. Within five smaller circles we see a chair, representing 
the importance of the furniture industry to the city's economy, as well 
as the letters W, W, A, and T, representing the surrounding towns of Westminster, 
Winchendon, Ashburnham, and Templeton which all contributed land to the 
city at its founding.[6][7] Gardner is located at 42°34′26″N 71°59′27″W﻿
