The sport of cricket has a known history beginning in the late 16th century. 
Having originated in south-east England, it became the country's national 
sport in the 18th century and has developed globally in the 19th and 20th 
centuries. International matches have been played since 1844 and Test cricket 
began, retrospectively recognised, in 1877. Cricket is the world's second 
most popular spectator sport after association football. Governance is 
by the International Cricket Council (ICC) which has over one hundred members 
although only ten play Test cricket. The origin of cricket is unknown. 
There is a consensus of expert opinion that it was probably created during 
Saxon or Norman times by children living in the Weald, an area of dense 
woodlands and clearings in south-east England that lies across Kent and 
Sussex.[1] The first definite reference is dated Monday, 17 January 1597 
(Julian date; see below). There have been several speculations about the 
game's origins including some that it was created in France or Flanders. 
The earliest of these speculative references is dated Thursday, 10 March 
1300 (Julian date) and concerns the future King Edward II playing at "creag 
and other games" in both Westminster and Newenden. It has been suggested 
that "creag" was an Olde English word for cricket but expert opinion is 
that it was an early spelling of "craic", meaning "fun and games in general".[2] 
It is generally believed that cricket survived as a children's game for 
many generations before it was increasingly taken up by adults around the 
beginning of the 17th century. Possibly cricket was derived from bowls, 
assuming bowls is the older sport, by the intervention of a batsman trying 
to stop the ball from reaching its target by hitting it away. Playing on 
sheep-grazed land or in clearings, the original implements may have been 
a matted lump of sheep’s wool (or even a stone or a small lump of wood) 
as the ball; a stick or a crook or another farm tool as the bat; and a 
stool or a tree stump or a gate (e.g., a wicket gate) as the wicket.[3] 
A 1597 court case in England concerning an ownership dispute over a plot 
of common land in Guildford, Surrey mentions the game of creckett. A 59-year-old 
coroner, John Derrick, testified that he and his school friends had played 
creckett on the site fifty years earlier when they attended the Free School. 
Derrick's account proves beyond reasonable doubt that the game was being 
played in Surrey circa 1550, and is the earliest universally accepted reference 
to the game.[4][5] The first reference to cricket being played as an adult 
sport was in 1611, when two men in Sussex were prosecuted for playing cricket 
on Sunday instead of going to church.[6] In the same year, a dictionary 
defined cricket as a boys' game and this suggests that adult participation 
was a recent development.[4] A number of words are thought to be possible 
sources for the term "cricket". In the earliest definite reference, it 
was spelled creckett. The name may have been derived from the Middle Dutch 
krick(-e), meaning a stick; or the Old English cricc or cryce meaning a 
crutch or staff, or the French word criquet meaning a wooden post.[3] The 
Middle Dutch word krickstoel means a long low stool used for kneeling in 
church; this resembled the long low wicket with two stumps used in early 
cricket.[7] According to Heiner Gillmeister, a European language expert 
of the University of Bonn, "cricket" derives from the Middle Dutch phrase 
for hockey, met de (krik ket)sen (i.e., "with the stick chase").[8] It 
is more likely that the terminology of cricket was based on words in use 
in south-east England at the time and, given trade connections with the 
County of Flanders, especially in the 15th century when it belonged to 
the Duchy of Burgundy, many Middle Dutch[9] words found their way into 
southern English dialects.[10] A number of references occur up to the English 
Civil War and these indicate that cricket had become an adult game contested 
by parish teams, but there is no evidence of county strength teams at this 
time. Equally, there is little evidence of the rampant gambling that characterised 
the game throughout the 18th century. It is generally believed, therefore, 
that village cricket had developed by the middle of the 17th century but 
that county cricket had not and that investment in the game had not begun.[11] 
After the Civil War ended in 1648, the new Puritan government clamped down 
on "unlawful assemblies", in particular the more raucous sports such as 
football. Their laws also demanded a stricter observance of the Sabbath 
than there had been previously. As the Sabbath was the only free time available 
to the lower classes, cricket's popularity may have waned during the Commonwealth. 
However, it did flourish in public fee-paying schools such as Winchester 
and St Paul's. There is no actual evidence that Oliver Cromwell's regime 
banned cricket specifically and there are references to it during the interregnum 
that suggest it was acceptable to the authorities provided that it did 
not cause any "breach of the Sabbath".[11] It is believed that the nobility 
in general adopted cricket at this time through involvement in village 
games.[4] Cricket certainly thrived after the Restoration in 1660 and is 
believed to have first attracted gamblers making large bets at this time. 
In 1664, the "Cavalier" Parliament passed the Gaming Act 1664 which limited 
stakes to £100, although that was still a fortune at the time,[11] equivalent 
to about £14 thousand in present-day terms [12]. Cricket had certainly 
become a significant gambling sport by the end of the 17th century. There 
is a newspaper report of a "great match" played in Sussex in 1697 which 
was 11-a-side and played for high stakes of 50 guineas a side.[6] With 
freedom of the press having been granted in 1696, cricket for the first 
time could be reported in the newspapers. But it was a long time before 
the newspaper industry adapted sufficiently to provide frequent, let alone 
comprehensive, coverage of the game. During the first half of the 18th 
century, press reports tended to focus on the betting rather than on the 
play.[11] Gambling introduced the first patrons because some of the gamblers 
decided to strengthen their bets by forming their own teams and it is believed 
the first "county teams" were formed in the aftermath of the Restoration 
in 1660, especially as members of the nobility were employing "local experts" 
from village cricket as the earliest professionals.[4] The first known 
game in which the teams use county names is in 1709 but there can be little 
doubt that these sort of fixtures were being arranged long before that. 
The match in 1697 was probably Sussex versus another county. The most notable 
of the early patrons were a group of aristocrats and businessmen who were 
active from about 1725, which is the time that press coverage became more 
regular, perhaps as a result of the patrons' influence. These men included 
the 2nd Duke of Richmond, Sir William Gage, Alan Brodrick and Edwin Stead. 
For the first time, the press mentions individual players like Thomas Waymark. 
Cricket was introduced to North America via the English colonies in the 
17th century,[10] probably before it had even reached the north of England. 
In the 18th century it arrived in other parts of the globe. It was introduced 
to the West Indies by colonists[10] and to India by British East India 
Company mariners in the first half of the century. It arrived in Australia 
almost as soon as colonisation began in 1788. New Zealand and South Africa 
followed in the early years of the 19th century.[4] Cricket never caught 
on in Canada, despite efforts by an imperial-minded elite to promote the 
game as a way of identifying with the British Empire. Canada, unlike Australia 
and the West Indies, witnessed a continual decline in the popularity of 
the game during 1860–1960. Linked to upper class British-Canadian elites, 
the game never became popular with the general public. In the summer season 
it had to compete with baseball. During the First World War, Canadian units 
stationed in Britain played baseball, not cricket.[13][14] The basic rules 
of cricket such as bat and ball, the wicket, pitch dimensions, overs, how 
out, etc. have existed since time immemorial. In 1728, the Duke of Richmond 
and Alan Brodick drew up Articles of Agreement to determine the code of 
practice in a particular game and this became a common feature, especially 
around payment of stake money and distributing the winnings given the importance 
of gambling.[6] In 1744, the Laws of Cricket were codified for the first 
time and then amended in 1774, when innovations such as lbw, middle stump 
and maximum bat width were added. These laws stated that the principals 
shall choose from amongst the gentlemen present two umpires who shall absolutely 
decide all disputes. The codes were drawn up by the so-called "Star and 
Garter Club" whose members ultimately founded MCC at Lord's in 1787. MCC 
immediately became the custodian of the Laws and has made periodic revisions 
and recodifications subsequently.[15] The game continued to spread throughout 
England and, in 1751, Yorkshire is first mentioned as a venue.[16] The 
original form of bowling (i.e., rolling the ball along the ground as in 
bowls) was superseded sometime after 1760 when bowlers began to pitch the 
ball and study variations in line, length and pace.[11] Scorecards began 
to be kept on a regular basis from 1772 and since then an increasingly 
clear picture has emerged of the sport's development.[17] The first famous 
clubs were London and Dartford in the early 18th century. London played 
its matches on the Artillery Ground, which still exists. Others followed, 
particularly Slindon in Sussex which was backed by the Duke of Richmond 
and featured the star player Richard Newland. There were other prominent 
clubs at Maidenhead, Hornchurch, Maidstone, Sevenoaks, Bromley, Addington, 
Hadlow and Chertsey. But far and away the most famous of the early clubs 
was Hambledon in Hampshire. It started as a parish organisation that first 
achieved prominence in 1756. The club itself was founded in the 1760s and 
was well patronised to the extent that it was the focal point of the game 
for about thirty years until the formation of MCC and the opening of Lord's 
Cricket Ground in 1787. Hambledon produced several outstanding players 
including the master batsman John Small and the first great fast bowler 
Thomas Brett. Their most notable opponent was the Chertsey and Surrey bowler 
Edward "Lumpy" Stevens, who is believed to have been the main proponent 
of the flighted delivery. It was in answer to the flighted, or pitched, 
delivery that the straight bat was introduced. The old "hockey stick" style 
of bat was only really effective against the ball being trundled or skimmed 
along the ground. Cricket faced its first real crisis during the 18th century 
when major matches virtually ceased during the Seven Years' War. This was 
largely due to shortage of players and lack of investment. But the game 
survived and the "Hambledon Era" proper began in the mid-1760s. Cricket 
faced another major crisis at the beginning of the 19th century when a 
cessation of major matches occurred during the culminating period of the 
Napoleonic Wars. Again, the causes were shortage of players and lack of 
investment. But, as in the 1760s, the game survived and a slow recovery 
began in 1815. On 17 June 1815, on the eve of the Battle of Waterloo British 
soldiers played a cricket match in the Bois de la Cambre park in Brussels. 
Ever since the park area where that match took place has been called La 
Pelouse des Anglais (the Englishmen's lawn). MCC was itself the centre 
of controversy in the Regency period, largely on account of the enmity 
between Lord Frederick Beauclerk and George Osbaldeston. In 1817, their 
intrigues and jealousies exploded into a match-fixing scandal with the 
top player William Lambert being banned from playing at Lord's Cricket 
Ground for life. Gambling scandals in cricket have been going on since 
the 17th century. In the 1820s, cricket faced a major crisis of its own 
making as the campaign to allow roundarm bowling gathered pace. The game 
also underwent a fundamental change of organisation with the formation 
for the first time of county clubs. All the modern county clubs, starting 
with Sussex in 1839, were founded during the 19th century. No sooner had 
the first county clubs established themselves than they faced what amounted 
to "player action" as William Clarke created the travelling All-England 
Eleven in 1846. Though a commercial venture, this team did much to popularise 
the game in districts which had never previously been visited by high-class 
cricketers. Other similar teams were created and this vogue lasted for 
about thirty years. But the counties and MCC prevailed. The growth of cricket 
in the mid and late 19th century was assisted by the development of the 
railway network. For the first time, teams from a long distance apart could 
play one other without a prohibitively time-consuming journey. Spectators 
could travel longer distances to matches, increasing the size of crowds. 
Army units around the Empire had time on their hands, and encouraged the 
locals so they could have some entertaining competition. Most of the Empire 
embraced cricket, with the exception of Canada. [18] In 1864, another bowling 
revolution resulted in the legalisation of overarm and in the same year 
Wisden Cricketers' Almanack was first published. W. G. Grace began his 
long and influential career at this time, his feats doing much to increase 
cricket's popularity. He introduced technical innovations which revolutionised 
the game, particularly in batting. The first ever international cricket 
game was between the USA and Canada in 1844. The match was played at the 
grounds of the St George's Cricket Club in New York.[19] In 1859, a team 
of leading English professionals set off to North America on the first-ever 
overseas tour and, in 1862, the first English team toured Australia. Between 
May and October 1868, a team of Australian Aborigines toured England in 
what was the first Australian cricket team to travel overseas.[20] In 1877, 
an England touring team in Australia played two matches against full Australian 
XIs that are now regarded as the inaugural Test matches. The following 
year, the Australians toured England for the first time and the success 
of this tour ensured a popular demand for similar ventures in future. No 
Tests were played in 1878 but more soon followed and, at The Oval in 1882, 
the Australian victory in a tense finish gave rise to The Ashes. South 
Africa became the third Test nation in 1889. A significant development 
in domestic cricket occurred in 1890 when the official County Championship 
was constituted in England. This organisational initiative has been repeated 
in other countries. Australia established the Sheffield Shield in 1892–93. 
Other national competitions to be established were the Currie Cup in South 
Africa, the Plunkett Shield in New Zealand and the Ranji Trophy in India. 
The period from 1890 to the outbreak of the First World War has become 
one of nostalgia, ostensibly because the teams played cricket according 
to "the spirit of the game", but more realistically because it was a peacetime 
period that was shattered by the First World War. The era has been called 
The Golden Age of cricket and it featured numerous great names such as 
Grace, Wilfred Rhodes, C. B. Fry, Ranjitsinhji and Victor Trumper. In 1889 
the immemorial four ball over was replaced by a five ball over and then 
this was changed to the current six balls an over in 1900. Subsequently, 
some countries experimented with eight balls an over. In 1922, the number 
of balls per over was changed from six to eight in Australia only. In 1924 
the eight ball over was extended to New Zealand and in 1937 to South Africa. 
In England, the eight ball over was adopted experimentally for the 1939 
season; the intention was to continue the experiment in 1940, but first-class 
cricket was suspended for the Second World War and when it resumed, English 
cricket reverted to the six ball over. The 1947 Laws of Cricket allowed 
six or eight balls depending on the conditions of play. Since the 1979/80 
Australian and New Zealand seasons, the six ball over has been used worldwide 
and the most recent version of the Laws in 2000 only permits six ball overs. 
When the Imperial Cricket Conference (as it was originally called) was 
founded in 1909, only England, Australia and South Africa were members. 
West Indies (1928), New Zealand (1930) and India (1932) became Test nations 
before the Second World War and Pakistan (1952) soon afterwards. The international 
game grew with several ICC Affiliate Members getting involved and, in the 
closing years of the 20th century, three of those became Test nations also: 
Sri Lanka (1982), Zimbabwe (1992) and Bangladesh (2000). Test cricket remained 
the sport's highest level of standard throughout the 20th century but it 
had its problems, notably in the infamous "Bodyline Series" of 1932–33 
when Douglas Jardine's England used so-called "leg theory" to try and neutralise 
the run-scoring brilliance of Australia's Don Bradman. The greatest crisis 
to hit international cricket was brought about by apartheid, the South 
African policy of racial segregation. The situation began to crystallise 
after 1961 when South Africa left the Commonwealth of Nations and so, under 
the rules of the day, its cricket board had to leave the International 
Cricket Conference (ICC). Cricket's opposition to apartheid intensified 
in 1968 with the cancellation of England's tour to South Africa by the 
South African authorities, due to the inclusion of "coloured" cricketer 
Basil D'Oliveira in the England team. In 1970, the ICC members voted to 
suspend South Africa indefinitely from international cricket competition. 
Starved of top-level competition for its best players, the South African 
Cricket Board began funding so-called "rebel tours", offering large sums 
of money for international players to form teams and tour South Africa. 
The ICC's response was to blacklist any rebel players who agreed to tour 
South Africa, banning them from officially sanctioned international cricket. 
As players were poorly remunerated during the 1970s, several accepted the 
offer to tour South Africa, particularly players getting towards the end 
of their careers for which a blacklisting would have little effect. The 
rebel tours continued into the 1980s but then progress was made in South 
African politics and it became clear that apartheid was ending. South Africa, 
now a "Rainbow Nation" under Nelson Mandela, was welcomed back into international 
sport in 1991. The money problems of top cricketers were also the root 
cause of another cricketing crisis that arose in 1977 when the Australian 
media magnate Kerry Packer fell out with the Australian Cricket Board over 
TV rights. Taking advantage of the low remuneration paid to players, Packer 
retaliated by signing several of the best players in the world to a privately 
run cricket league outside the structure of international cricket. World 
Series Cricket hired some of the banned South African players and allowed 
them to show off their skills in an international arena against other world-class 
players. The schism lasted only until 1979 and the "rebel" players were 
allowed back into established international cricket, though many found 
that their national teams had moved on without them. Long-term results 
of World Series Cricket have included the introduction of significantly 
higher player salaries and innovations such as coloured kit and night games. 
In the 1960s, English county teams began playing a version of cricket with 
games of only one innings each and a maximum number of overs per innings. 
Starting in 1963 as a knockout competition only, limited overs grew in 
popularity and, in 1969, a national league was created which consequently 
caused a reduction in the number of matches in the County Championship. 
Although many "traditional" cricket fans objected to the shorter form of 
the game, limited-over cricket did have the advantage of delivering a result 
to spectators within a single day; it did improve cricket's appeal to younger 
or busier people; and it did prove commercially successful. The first limited-over 
international match took place at Melbourne Cricket Ground in 1971 as a 
time-filler after a Test match had been abandoned because of heavy rain 
on the opening days. It was tried simply as an experiment and to give the 
players some exercise, but turned out to be immensely popular. limited-over 
internationals (LOIs or ODIs—one-day internationals) have since grown to 
become a massively popular form of the game, especially for busy people 
who want to be able to see a whole match. The International Cricket Council 
reacted to this development by organising the first Cricket World Cup in 
England in 1975, with all the Test-playing nations taking part. Limited-overs 
cricket increased television ratings for cricket coverage. Innovative techniques 
introduced in coverage of limited-over matches were soon adopted for Test 
coverage. The innovations included presentation of in-depth statistics 
and graphical analysis, placing miniature cameras in the stumps, multiple 
usage of cameras to provide shots from several locations around the ground, 
high-speed photography and computer graphics technology enabling television 
viewers to study the course of a delivery and help them understand an umpire's 
decision. In 1992, the use of a third umpire to adjudicate run-out appeals 
with television replays was introduced in the Test series between South 
Africa and India. The third umpire's duties have subsequently expanded 
to include decisions on other aspects of play such as stumpings, catches 
and boundaries. From 2011, the third umpire was being called upon to moderate 
review of umpires' decisions, including LBW, with the aid of virtual-reality 
tracking technologies (e.g., Hawk-Eye and Hot Spot), though such measures 
still could not free some disputed decisions from heated controversy.[21] 
In June 2001, the ICC introduced a "Test Championship Table" and, in October 
2002, a "One-day International Championship Table". As indicated by ICC 
rankings,[22] the various cricket formats have continued to be a major 
competitive sport in most former British Empire countries, notably the 
Indian subcontinent, and new participants including the Netherlands. As 
of August 2013[update], the top rankings were held by South Africa (Tests), 
India (one-day internationals), and Sri Lanka (Twenty20 champion). The 
ICC expanded its development programme, aiming to produce more national 
teams capable of competing at the various formats. Development efforts 
are focused on African and Asian nations, and on the United States. In 
2004, the ICC Intercontinental Cup brought first-class cricket to 12 nations, 
mostly for the first time. Cricket's newest innovation is Twenty20, essentially 
an evening entertainment. It has so far enjoyed enormous popularity and 
has attracted large attendances at matches as well as good TV audience 
ratings. The inaugural ICC Twenty20 World Cup tournament was held in 2007. 
The formation of Twenty20 leagues in India – the unofficial Indian Cricket 
League, which started in 2007, and the official Indian Premier League, 
starting in 2008 – raised much speculation in the cricketing press about 
their effect on the future of cricket.[23][24][25][26] "First-class cricket" 
was not officially defined until May 1894 and became effective from the 
start of the 1895 English cricket season.[27] Cricket of a recognised first-class 
standard (i.e., in important matches) had, however, been recorded in England 
for two centuries before then, and in other countries from the middle of 
the 19th century. There is no official term for cricket of this high standard 
before 1895 and many loose terms were used for convenience including "first-class" 
itself and other adjectives like "major", "great" and "important", the 
latter being coined by the ACS for its A Guide to Important Cricket Matches 
Played in the British Isles 1709–1863 (1981).[27] It is generally agreed 
by the main historical sources that the earliest known example of what 
was contemporarily called a "great match" was the one played for fifty 
guineas in June 1697 between two eleven-a-side teams at an unspecified 
location in Sussex.[6] It is entirely feasible, and is indeed believed 
by some historians, that major matches were played for many years before 
1697.[28][29] In 1695, the English Parliament decided against a renewal 
of the 1662 Licensing Act and so cleared the way for a free press on the 
Act's expiry in 1696.[30] The main reason for matches before 1697 being 
unknown is that, while the Licensing Act was in force, it effectively imposed 
censorship upon the press and sport was not deemed to be a suitable subject 
for newspaper coverage. After the restrictions were removed, sport was 
gradually introduced into the newspapers but it would be decades before 
coverage became anything substantial, let alone comprehensive.[30] From 
1895, there is no question about first-class status because of the official 
definition.[27] The concept became global from 1947 when it was re-defined 
by the ICC, although there has been hardly any controversy about match 
status outside Great Britain before 1947.[31] Status of limited overs matches, 
which began in 1963, is governed by the official List A categorisation 
and there are similarly no issues about major Twenty 20 matches. Although 
the experts are in general agreement about match status, there have been 
exceptions although these account for a tiny percentage of the total number 
of matches recorded. Apart from one tour of India and Ceylon by a privately-organised 
team in the winter of 1930–31, all the "disputed" matches took place in 
England before 1895: see Variations in published cricket statistics for 
further information. The list below is by no means exhaustive, but the 
works included are widely held in cricketing circles to be significant 
and substantial sources of information about the development of the sport 
from the end of the 17th century to the commencement of officially defined 
first-class cricket in 1895. These are widely used to determine the status 
of individual matches, teams, venues and players. In a more general sense, 
all of the sources listed in Bibliography of cricket, though again this 
is not an exhaustive list, are reliable but it should be noted that autobiographies 
and other works with a narrow scope are not necessarily suitable, certainly
