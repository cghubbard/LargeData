The 1937 Detroit Tigers finished in second place in the American League 
with a record of 89–65. The team finished 13 games behind the New York 
Yankees. Their winning percentage of .578 ranks as the 15th best season 
in Detroit Tigers history. The strength of the 1937 Tigers was hitting. 
The Tigers had scored 900 or more runs each season from 1934 to 1937. The 
1937 total of 935 runs is the second highest in franchise history, trailing 
only the 1934 Tigers team that scored 958 runs. The 1937 Tigers led the 
major leagues with a .292 batting average—nine points higher than the Yankees. 
The 1937 Tigers also had power, belting twice as many home runs (150 to 
74) as the 1934 team. Second baseman Charlie Gehringer won both the American 
League batting title and the AL Most Valuable Player Award. First baseman 
Hank Greenberg led the major leagues with 183 RBIs—still the third highest 
single season total in major league history. Rookie catcher Rudy York did 
not make it into the starting lineup until early August and promptly broke 
the AL record with 18 home runs in the month. York finished as the AL leader 
in at bats per home run (10.7) and with the third highest slugging percentage 
(.651) in the major leagues. While the team had the bats, it lacked the 
pitching to compete with the Yankees. In contrast to its league-best batting 
average, the Tigers pitching staff had an ERA of 4.87—ranking seventh among 
the eight American League teams. Elden Auker (17–9; 3.88) was the only 
pitcher on the staff with an ERA below 4.00. Former ace Schoolboy Rowe 
was suspended at the beginning of the year for poor conditioning, pitched 
only 31-1/3 innings for the year, and compiled a staggering 7.59 ERA. The 
team continued to have strong support from Detroit fans, finishing the 
1937 season with a team record 1,072,276 fans attending the team's home 
games at Briggs Stadium. The only American League team to draw more fans 
up to that time was the 1930 Yankees' team that drew 1,169,230. The 1937 
season began with Mickey Cochrane as the team's player/manager. However, 
Cochrane's playing career came to a sudden end on May 25, 1937. After hitting 
a home run in the third inning, Cochrane was hit in the head by a pitch 
from Yankees pitcher Bump Hadley when he next came to bat. Hospitalized 
for seven days, the injury nearly killed him. Ordered by doctors not to 
play baseball again (he was just 34 years old), Cochrane returned to the 
dugout but never played again. Backup catcher Ray Hayworth had his arm 
broken by a pitched ball shortly after Cochrane's injury, and Birdie Tebbetts 
took over the catching duties for most of June and July. At the beginning 
of August, rookie Rudy York took over as the team's catcher and set the 
league on fire with his home run hitting. In August 1937, his first full 
month in the major leagues, York broke Babe Ruth's major league record 
for most home runs in a single month, slugging 18 home runs (and 44 RBIs). 
For the year, York hit .307 with a .651 slugging percentage, 35 home runs, 
and 103 RBIs. Defensively, York was a liability at catcher, leading the 
AL in passed balls in 1937 despite playing only two months. In 1940, the 
Tigers persuaded Hank Greenberg to move to left field, allowing York to 
take over at first base. York was among the American League leaders in 
home runs for 11 consecutive seasons from 1937 to 1947, and his .503 slugging 
percentage as a Tiger ranks #4 in franchise history. The Detroit infield 
remained intact for five years from 1933 through 1937: Hank Greenberg at 
first, Charlie Gehringer at second, Billy Rogell at shortstop, and Marv 
Owen at third. They were a solid group both at the bat and defensively. 
In 1937, Greenberg led the AL in putouts with 1477, and Gehringer, Rogell, 
and Owen all led the league in fielding percentage at their position. "Hammerin' 
Hank" Greenberg led the major leagues with 183 RBIs in 1937—a total that 
still ranks as the third highest in major league history. Greenberg also 
led the major leagues with 103 extra base hits and 172 runs created, and 
was second in the major leagues with 40 home runs, a .668 slugging percentage, 
102 walks, 397 total bases, and 305 times on base. He also hit for average, 
with a .337 batting average and .375 on-base percentage. Greenberg had 
already won the AL MVP award in 1935 and finished third in the 1937 voting 
behind Gehringer and Joe DiMaggio. Charlie Gehringer had the best season 
of his career winning the American League batting title (.371) and the 
American League Most Valuable Player award. Gehringer also lead AL second 
basemen in fielding percentage and was among the major league leaders with 
a .473 on-base percentage (2nd in MLB), 300 times on base (3rd in MLB), 
135 runs created (3rd in MLB), 133 runs (4th in MLB), and 209 hits (5th 
in the AL). Known for his consistency as a hitter and fielder, Gehringer 
was given the nickname "The Mechanical Man" by Yankee pitcher Lefty Gomez.[1] 
Mickey Cochrane joked that "Charlie says `hello' on Opening Day, `goodbye' 
on closing day, and in between hits .350." [5] Shortstop Billy Rogell led 
all AL shortstops in fielding percentage each year from 1935 to 1937, and 
in 1937 he hit .276 and scored 85 runs. Rogell and Gehringer played over 
1,000 games together as the Tigers' double play combination. Rogell's fiery 
demeanor was a stark contrast to the calm, quiet demeanor of Gehringer. 
After retiring from baseball, Rogell served on the Detroit City Council 
from 1942 to 1980 . He was chairman of the city planning committee that 
built Detroit Metropolitan Airport, and the road entering the airport from 
the north, Merriman Road, changes its name to William G. Rogell Drive as 
it enters the airport. Marv Owen hit .288 with 22 doubles and 45 RBIs. 
Owen is remembered for his role in the 1934 and 1935 World Series. In Game 
7 of the 1934 Series, Joe Medwick tripled in the 6th inning with the Cardinals 
ahead by 7 runs. He slid hard into Owen at third, knocking Owen down. The 
two fought, and Detroit fans pelted Medwick with fruit and garbage when 
he returned to left field. As the fan reaction escalated, Commissioner 
Landis ordered Medwick removed from the game. Owen also owns one record 
that still stands: 31 consecutive World Series plate appearances without 
a hit. In the outfield, the Tigers had Gee Walker, Pete Fox, and Jo-Jo 
White. Right fielder Pete Fox was a mainstay in the Detroit outfield for 
eight seasons (1933–1940). He played on three AL pennant champion teams, 
and he was the Tigers' leading hitter in the 1935 World Series. Though 
a native of Indiana, Detroit became his adopted home, and he died there 
in 1966. In 1937, Fox hit .331 and was among the league leaders with 149 
singles (3rd), 208 hits (6th), 116 runs scored (8th), and 12 stolen bases 
(10th). Gee Walker played in the Tigers' outfield from 1931 to 1937. Known 
as "The Madman from Mississippi", Walker was a fiery competitor and a clown. 
In 1937, he played 151 games in the outfield, including 88 games in left, 
54 in right, and 11 in center. Walker began the season on fire. On Opening 
Day, he hit for the cycle—the only player to accomplish that feat on Opening 
Day. Walker hit the cycle in reverse order—starting with a home run, followed 
by triple, then a double, and a single.[2] Walker continued his hot hitting 
in the spring of 1937 with a 27-game hit streak in April and May 1937. 
Walker's fast start earned him a spot on the AL All-Star team. He finished 
among the AL leaders with 213 hits (3rd), 23 stolen bases (3rd), 149 singles 
(3rd), 42 doubles (6th), 113 RBIs (9th), and a .335 average (8th). His 
Power/Speed Number in 1937 was 20.2—tops in both leagues. Despite Walker's 
strong performance in 1937, the Tigers (reportedly unhappy with Walker's 
antics) traded him and Marv Owen to the Red Sox on December 2, 1937. The 
trade caused an uproar among Detroit fans, and owner Walter Briggs was 
forced to issue an announcement from his Miami home that "the deal was 
made with my approval." Center fielder Jo-Jo White played in the Tigers' 
outfield from 1932 to 1938. He hit .313 in 1934, but his average fell off 
after that year. In 1937, Jo-Jo hit .246 and played only 94 games. White's 
real first name was Joyner, but he was called "Jo-Jo" because of the way 
he pronounced his native state of Georgia. Rookie Chet Laabs also played 
62 games in the outfield for the 1937 Tigers. Labs hit .240 with a .434 
slugging percentage. In 1938, Laabs struck out five times in one game against 
Bob Feller, helping Feller set the all-time record with 18 strikeouts in 
a nine-inning game. Laabs later hit 27 home runs with 99 RBIs for the 1943 
St. Louis Browns. Hall of Famer Goose Goslin also played in 39 games, but 
his batting average fell to .238 with 43 hits and 35 RBIs. The Tigers released 
Goslin on October 3, 1937, and Goslin later recounted (in "The Glory of 
Their Times") that he received a call from his old boss, Clark Griffith, 
asking him if he'd be interested in ending his career back where it began 
in Washington. Goslin jumped at the opportunity and batted .158 in 38 games 
for the Senators in the 1938 season. The Senators played in only three 
World Series in their history (1924, 1925, and 1933), and Goslin played 
for the Senators in every game of those Series. Elden Auker was the team's 
best pitcher in 1937. An underhand pitcher out of Kansas A&M, Auker had 
a record of 17–9 with 19 complete games and an ERA of 3.88 (Adjusted ERA+ 
of 120). During the 1935 World Series, Auker was interviewed by a young 
Cubs broadcaster, Ronald Reagan. When they met after Reagan had been elected 
Governor of California, Reagan told him, "You probably won't remember me, 
but I'll remember you as long as I live." The 1935 radio interview, Reagan 
said, "was my first big break."[3] After three consecutive 20+ win seasons, 
Tommy Bridges dropped to a 15–12 season with a 4.07 ERA. He continued, 
however, to be among the league leaders with 138 strikeouts (5th in the 
AL). Bridges played in four World Series and six All-Star Games with the 
Tigers. One of the hardest throwers of the 1930s, Bridges was among the 
AL leaders in strikeouts 12 times and led the league in strikeouts in 1935 
and 1936. Roxie Lawson had his best season was 1937, with a record of 18–7, 
despite a 5.26 ERA in 217-1/3 innings. His 18 wins was 3rd best in the 
AL, and his winning percentage of .720 was 6th best. Lawson also threw 
15 complete games (10th best in the AL) and had a .259 batting average 
with six RBIs. His performance garnered him enough votes to finish 19th 
in the 1937 AL MVP voting. Rookie Boots Poffenberger was called up to the 
Tigers mid-season and went 10–5. His won-loss percentage of .667 in 1937 
was seventh best in the AL. Boots was only 21 years old when he debuted 
with the Tigers, and his career spun out of control within two years. Stories 
about Poffenberger's late night drinking and poor training practices caused 
him to fall out of favor with the team. After a night of heavy drinking 
while on the road in 1937, Poffenberger called room service and said, "I'll 
have the breakfast of champions." When asked if he wanted cereal, Poffenberge 
replied, "Hell, no. Two fried eggs and a bottle of beer." ’ [4][5] George 
Gill made his debut with the Tigers at age 28 on May 4, 1937. On May 30, 
1937, led by fellow Mississippian Gee Walker‚ the Tigers collected 20 hits 
in an 18–3 victory for Gill. In his rookie season, Gill went 11–4 in 31 
games (10 as a starter). His 1937 record ranked 5th in the AL in winning 
percentage (.733). He was also 7th in the league in games finished with 
18. Pitcher "Whistling Jake" Wade also had his most productive season in 
1937, posting career highs in wins (7), starts (25), complete games (7), 
strikeouts (69) and innings pitched (165-1/3). Wade pitched a one-hit shutout 
in the last game of the 1937 regular season, preventing Cleveland pitcher 
Johnny Allen from tying the AL record of 16 straight wins. However, Wade 
struggled with control and was among the AL leaders in 1937 with 107 walks 
allowed (7th) and five wild pitches (8th). Wade was nicknamed "Whistling 
Jake" not for his fastball but because of his tendency to whistle whenever 
he was nervous.[6] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] Infielders Coaches
