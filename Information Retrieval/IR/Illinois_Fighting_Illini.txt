and Justin Spring, From 1926 until 2007, a mascot of the university's athletic 
teams was a Native American figure, Chief Illiniwek, which sparked significant 
controversy beginning in the 1980s. Critics of the Chief, who was represented 
at games by someone dressed in costume, claimed that it was a racist stereotype 
and a symbol of the oppression to Native Americans which took place in 
American history. Supporters claimed that it was inoffensive and a source 
of pride and reverence to the Native American heritage of Illinois. In 
1982, Oglala Sioux elder Frank Fools Crow sold an authentic ceremonial 
costume and headdress to the university. Since 1992, the Oglala Sioux tribe 
demanded the costume and headdress be returned to Fools Crow's family. 
The university was unable to locate the feathers and a grandson of Fools 
Crow has stated he disagreed with the way the University used his grandfather's 
gift.[28] The university remains deeply divided on this issue; while some 
of the faculty condemned the symbol, the administration remained supportive 
of it. The university's Board of Trustees announced on February 16, 2007 
that the Chief's last public performance would be the final home game of 
the 2006–2007 Men's Basketball season. The name "Fighting Illini" was retained
