The Browning School is a United States college preparatory school for boys 
founded in 1888 by John A. Browning. It offers study from Pre-Primary level 
(Kindergarten) through Form VI (12th Grade). The Browning School is a member 
of the New York Interschool consortium. The Browning School was founded 
in 1888 by John A. Browning. Arthur Jones succeeded Browning as Headmaster 
in 1920 and moved the school from West 55th Street to its present location 
on East 62nd Street. Extracurricular activities expanded in his time. Jones 
retired in 1948 and Lyman B. Tobin, a Browning teacher for more than 30 
years, became Browning’s third Headmaster. In 1952, upon Tobin’s retirement, 
the school named Charles W. Cook ’38, an alumnus and teacher, as its fourth 
Headmaster. Under his leadership for thirty-six years, the Browning School 
expanded rapidly. After a lengthy fund-raising drive, the school bought 
the adjoining carriage house and rebuilt it. The new building opened in 
1960. The school’s expansion continued in 1967, with the building of a 
larger gymnasium on the roof, and in the late 1970s, with the acquisition 
of an interest in the building next door. In 1988, Stephen M. Clement, 
III became Browning’s fifth Headmaster and served in this role for 28 years. 
John M. Botti is the current Head of School, having been appointed in 2015. 
Today, the school has over 400 students, more than double its size fifty 
years ago. Furthermore, Browning has completed a new library, four new 
science laboratories, two new art studios, and additional classrooms. Browning 
is a part of Interschool, a consortium of eight schools to enhance academic, 
extracurricular, and administrative sharing, consists of four schools for 
girls (Brearley, Chapin, Nightingale-Bamford, and Spence), two schools 
for boys (Browning and Collegiate), and two coeducational schools (Dalton 
and Trinity). Additionally, Browning enjoys strong relationships with Marymount 
and Hewitt. Browning has a selective admissions process with only a 10% 
acceptance rate of students. Browning does not admit students for 11th 
and 12th grades and very rarely for 10th grade. There are approximately 
30-34 boys per grade at Browning. A financial aid program ensures that 
the boys remain heterogeneous; as with many of its peer NYC schools. The 
school is private, functioning under a New York City non-profit statute 
enacted in the 1940s. Browning is controlled by a Board of Trustees, and 
the school is administered by a Head of School. Browning's Upper School 
(high school) curriculum consists of English, Math, Science, History, Modern 
Foreign Languages (Spanish or French), Classics (Latin and Ancient Greek), 
Music, Visual Art, Technology, and Physical Education. Browning has soccer 
and cross country in the fall, basketball and fencing in the winter and 
baseball, track, tennis and golf in the spring, and squash all year. Browning 
is a member of the New York State Association of Independent Schools Athletic 
Association and competes against schools such as Columbia Prep, Calhoun 
School, Trevor Day, Trinity School, and Birch Wathen Lenox. Coordinates:
