James Michael "Mike" Hegan (July 21, 1942 – December 25, 2013) was an American 
Major League Baseball first baseman/outfielder, and later broadcaster. 
He was the son of longtime Cleveland Indians catcher Jim Hegan.[1] A graduate 
of Saint Ignatius High School in Cleveland, Hegan began his major league 
career with the New York Yankees in 1964, also playing for the Seattle 
Pilots (for whom he hit the first home run in franchise history in his 
first at-bat with the team in 1969), Milwaukee Brewers, and Oakland Athletics 
as an outfielder and first baseman. He was one of two Pilots to represent 
the team at the All-Star Game in their lone year of existence, along with 
Don Mincher. He was a member of the 1972 World Champion Oakland Athletics, 
chiefly as a pinch hitter and defensive replacement for starting first 
baseman Mike Epstein. Hegan was the last batter in the (pre-renovation) 
Yankee Stadium, flying out to center field as the Yankees lost to Detroit, 
8–5 on September 30, 1973. On September 3, 1976, he became the first Brewer 
to hit for the cycle. Hegan also held the American League record for most 
consecutive error-less games as a first baseman (178), until it was broken 
by Kevin Youkilis on September 7, 2007. After his retirement from baseball 
as a player, Hegan spent the next twelve seasons as a television color 
commentator for the Brewers.[1] In 1989 he was hired by the Cleveland Indians, 
and served as a commentator for the team on both radio and television for 
the next 23 seasons.[2][3] In 2012, Hegan left the broadcast booth for 
a role with the Indians as an alumni ambassador. However, on May 23 of 
that year he filled in for a game against the Detroit Tigers. He died on 
December 25, 2013 in his home in Hilton Head, South Carolina due to heart 
failure at the age of 71. Heart problems had forced Hegan to retire from
