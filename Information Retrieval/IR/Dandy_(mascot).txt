Dandy was the mascot of the New York Yankees between 1979 and 1981.[1] 
He was a large pinstriped bird that sported a Yankees hat. He had a mustache 
that gave him an appearance similar to that of former Yankee catcher Thurman 
Munson.[2] His name was a play on the classic American folk song "Yankee 
Doodle Dandy". Eager to add a mascot, Yankees management contracted Wayde 
Harrison and Bonnie Erickson of Acme Mascots, who created the Phillie Phanatic 
in 1978, to develop a mascot for their franchise.[2] After a meeting with 
Yankees owner George Steinbrenner, in which Steinbrenner and Erickson argued 
over the shade of blue to use, the Yankees leased Dandy for three years 
and $30,000.[2] On July 10, 1979, The San Diego Chicken, then working for 
the Seattle Mariners, put a hex on Yankees pitcher Ron Guidry during a 
game at the Seattle Kingdome. Yankees outfielder Lou Piniella responded 
by chasing the mascot and throwing his glove at him.[2][3] In response, 
Steinbrenner said that mascots had no place in baseball, despite the imminent 
release of Dandy.[2] Dandy debuted in late-July 1979, weeks after the incident 
in Seattle.[2] When Thurman Munson died in a plane crash on August 2, 1979, 
Dandy was put on hiatus, as Dandy resembled Munson.[2] Though Yankees organist 
Eddie Layton composed a song for Dandy, it was never played.[2] Dandy was 
confined to the upper deck area of Yankee Stadium by Yankees management.[2] 
After the lease expired, Harrison and Erickson declined the Yankees' request 
to sign another lease, as they felt the mascot did not receive the necessary 
support from management.[2] Along with this experiment, the Yankees briefly 
had mascots resembling ballpark food (plus Yankees hats on top) during 
the mid-1990s.[citation needed] Outside of these two occasions, the Yankees 
have not had an official mascot or cheerleading squad roam the stands or 
perform on the field. Unofficial mascots have included a squirrel that 
Teddy Kider of The New York Times nicknamed "Left Field Ratatosk" after 
it was seen on the right field foul pole in late 2007.[4] The squirrel 
was referred to as "Scooter" by the fans, for Yankees legendary shortstop, 
Phil Rizzuto, who died in August 2007. Though George Steinbrenner gave 
final approval to Dandy,[2] he claimed had "no recollection" of Dandy in 
1998.[1] Joseph M. Perello, vice president for business development for 
the Yankees, and Lonn Trost, Yankees' general counsel, were unaware that
