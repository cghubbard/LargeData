The 1982 Chicago Cubs season was the 111th season of the Chicago Cubs franchise, 
the 107th in the National League and the 67th at Wrigley Field. The Cubs 
finished fifth in the National League East with a record of 73-89, 19 games 
behind the eventual National League and 1982 World Series Champion St. 
Louis Cardinals. For the first time in more than a half-of-a-century, the 
Cubs were not owned by a member of the Wrigley family. Instead, it was 
the first-full season for the Cubs under the ownership of the Tribune Company.
