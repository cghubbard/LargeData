Marvin Mardo Goodwin (January 16, 1891 – October 21, 1925), was a professional 
baseball player who was a pitcher in Major League Baseball from 1916 to 
1925. He would play for the Washington Senators, St. Louis Cardinals and 
Cincinnati Reds. Goodwin was known for throwing the spitball, and he was 
one of the 17 pitchers allowed to continue throwing the pitch after it 
was outlawed in 1920. Goodwin was a pilot in World War I, and died after 
the war from injuries sustained in a training flight while a member of 
the Army Air Service Reserve. He is believed to have been the first professional 
athlete killed as a result of a plane crash.[1] Goodwin was born and raised 
in Gordonsville, Virginia, and graduated from high school there. He attended 
college for two years in New London, Connecticut, and later took a position 
as a telegraph operator with the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad. Goodwin 
became an established baseball star with the semipro team in his hometown, 
and the railroad agreed to give him time off when he was offered a contract 
by the Washington Senators in 1916.[2] In 1916, Goodwin pitched for the 
Martinsburg Blue Sox of the Class D Blue Ridge League, starting and completing 
31 games with a record of 19-12, with 10 shutouts. His major league debut 
came in September of that year, when he appeared 3 times in relief for 
Washington, pitching 5 2/3 innings and giving up 2 earned runs.[2] Goodwin 
started the 1917 season with the Milwaukee Brewers of the American Association, 
and compiled a record of 8-9 with a 1.91 ERA, before being acquired by 
the St. Louis Cardinals in July. With the Cardinals his record for the 
season was 6-4 with a 2.21 ERA.[2] In December 1917, Goodwin joined the 
United States Army. Being unmarried and with no dependents, he told the 
Cardinals he was sure to be drafted, so he enlisted in order to join the 
aviation corps. He was stationed in Texas, where he successfully completed 
his training, and became an aviation instructor. He was preparing to deploy 
to France when the war ended in November 1918.[3] After the war, Goodwin 
rejoined the St. Louis Cardinals. In 1919 his record was 11-9 with a 2.51 
ERA, and in 1920 his record was 3-8 with a 4.95 ERA. For 1921 and 1922 
he split time between the Cardinals and their farm club, the Houston Buffaloes 
of the Texas League, and then spent all of the 1923 and 1924 seasons with 
Houston. In May 1924, Goodwin became player-manager of the Houston club, 
a role he continued through the next season. Late in the 1925 season he 
was sold to the Cincinnati Reds; he appeared in 4 games for the Reds, compiling 
a 0-2 record with a 4.79 ERA. His final major league appearance came on 
the final day of the season, when he pitched a complete game in the first 
half of a doubleheader, but lost 4-2.[2][4] Two weeks after his final appearance 
with the Reds, Goodwin crash landed his airplane at Ellington Field on 
October 18, 1925. The accident occurred during a training exercise when 
he was performing reserve duty with the United States Army Air Service. 
Goodwin experienced a tailspin about 200 feet (61 meters) in the air. He 
was hospitalized with serious injuries including two broken legs. His piloting 
skills were credited with saving him from immediate death.[5] Goodwin died 
on October 21, 1925 from the injuries he sustained three days earlier.[2] 
As noted by The Sporting News, "Marvin was a gentleman and an athlete of 
whom baseball can be proud... Lieutenant Goodwin sacrificed his life in 
behalf of his country. No person can do more.”[2] Goodwin is buried in
