The New York Mets' 2012 season was the franchise's 51st season and its 
fourth in Citi Field. The team celebrated its 50th anniversary, as they 
became a team in 1962. Johan Santana pitched the first no-hitter in franchise 
history on June 1, 2012. The Mets missed the post season for a 6th straight 
year. Shortly after the 2011 season ended, the Mets made changes to their 
coaching staff, keeping only pitching coach Dan Warthen and hitting coach 
Dave Hudgens. 3rd base coach Chip Hale went to the Oakland Athletics to 
join manager Bob Melvin.[1] General Manager Sandy Alderson said that the 
"changes were necessary for us to move forward."[2] Former A's manager 
Bob Geren was named to replace Hale.[3] New additions will improve the 
depth of the bullpen, that was known to be sub-par in relief in the 2011 
season.[4] They added reliever Ramon Ramírez,and center fielder Andrés 
Torres, in exchange for the starting centerfielder Ángel Pagán. They also 
signed Frank Francisco, who will be their closer. They also added Jon Rauch, 
who is the tallest current player in the MLB, and will be the set-up man 
for Francisco. For 2012, the Mets made several construction changes to 
Citi Field's dimensions. In center field a new 8 foot wall was built in 
front of the 16 foot wall, coined by fans as,"The Great Wall of Flushing."[5] 
In right field a new wall in front of the existing Mo's Zone was also built. 
The Mets overhauled their uniforms for 2012. The cream colored pinstriped 
uniform became the primary home uniform, while the snow white uniforms 
serves as the alternate home uniform. The black drop-shadows were removed 
from the pinstriped, snow white and road gray jerseys and the black two 
toned cap has been retired. The black jersey and all black cap was worn 
on a limited basis on the road and was retired at the end of the season. 
The Mets wore two patches, one commemorating the team's 50th anniversary 
and another honoring Gary Carter, who died of brain cancer on February 
16, 2012.[6] The Mets began their 2012 season with a surprising three-game 
sweep of the Atlanta Braves. The Mets outscored the Braves 12 to 6 in the 
series. During that series, Frank Francisco became the third player in 
Major League history to record a save in every game of a season-opening 
series of three or more games. following Derrick Turnbow of the Milwaukee 
Brewers in 2006 and Salomón Torres of the Pittsburgh Pirates in 2007.[7] 
On June 1, Johan Santana made club history by becoming the first Mets pitcher 
to throw a no-hitter in an 8–0 victory over the St. Louis Cardinals. This 
was also the first no-hitter to be pitched against a defending World Series 
champion since a former Met, Nolan Ryan, did so against the Oakland Athletics 
in their 1990 pennant season while with the Texas Rangers.[8][9] On June 
27 against the Chicago Cubs, the Mets became the first MLB team to hit 
a home run cycle. Daniel Murphy began with a two-run home run, which was 
his first home run in 352 at-bats, then in the fourth, then Ike Davis hit 
a three-run home run followed by Murphy's solo home run off of Casey Coleman, 
who replace starting pitcher Jeff Samardzija. In the sixth inning, Scott 
Hairston, who was typically a utility outfielder throughout the first half 
of the season, hit the cycle ending grand slam off of Coleman. The Mets 
won the game, 17–1.[10] R.A. Dickey won the 2012 Cy Young Award, becoming 
the first knuckleball pitcher to do so. Infielders Outfielders Other batters
