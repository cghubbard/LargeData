Grant U. "Home Run" Johnson (September 23, 1872 â€“ September 4, 1963) was 
an American shortstop and second baseman in baseball's Negro Leagues. He 
played for many of the greatest teams of the deadball era. Born in Findlay, 
Ohio, he died at age 90 in Buffalo, New York. Johnson began his career 
as a shortstop with the semipro Findlay Sluggers in 1893. The following 
year he earned his nickname "Home Run" by hitting 60 home runs. In 1895, 
he and Bud Fowler formed the Page Fence Giants in Adrian, Michigan.[4] 
Johnson was the shortstop and the team's captain. After 1898 the Page Fence 
Giants were unable to continue playing, so Johnson and most of the other 
players moved to Chicago where they played for the Chicago Columbia Giants 
in 1899. The next season he played with the Chicago Unions, where he teamed 
with Bill Monroe and Mike Moore. Johnson returned to the Columbia Giants 
for 1901 and 1902. In 1903 and 1904 Johnson played for the Cuban X-Giants 
and captained the team to the colored championship in 1903, defeating the 
Philadelphia Giants for the honor. His teammates included Rube Foster and 
Charlie Grant. He joined the Philadelphia Giants in 1905. Findlay, Ohio's 
celebrated contribution to African-American baseball history turned 33 
years old late that season. His hitting and pitching electrified his new 
team. The unselfish qualities of Johnson's power-packed swing helped him 
to lead the team in categories as hit-by pitches, sacrifice hits and, of 
course, home runs with twelve. An honorable man of exemplary character, 
he hustled out ground balls and seldom disputed an umpire's questionable 
call. It was equally rare for him to strike out. In one reflective moment 
Johnson told a reporter, "when I did [strike out] I surprised myself." 
Slowed by an injury that occurred early in the season, he missed thirteen 
days of play. Johnson was rushed back into the team's starting line-up, 
and as a consequence his home run totals slumped dramatically. He also 
was used as an occasional starting pitcher. A submarine pitcher of exceptional 
ability, he was essentially the Philadelphia Giants' fourth starter in 
1905. His gutsy mound appearances continually kept everyone questioning 
why he did not pitch more often. In 1906 he moved to the Brooklyn Royal 
Giants, where he was again captain, and led the team to championships in 
1908 and 1909. Sportswriter Harry Daniels named Captain Grant Johnson to 
his 1909 "All-American Team" saying he "always has been a hard, consistent 
hitter, fielder, and base runner, and a great handler."[5] In 1910 Johnson 
signed with Rube Foster's Leland Giants and hit .397. Around this time 
he began to be known by the nickname of "Dad" Johnson as well as his old 
nickname, "Home Run Johnson." [2] From 1911 to 1913 Johnson played with 
the New York Lincoln Giants, hitting .374, .413, and .371. In 1913 the 
Lincoln Giants won the eastern title and beat the Chicago American Giants 
in the championship playoff. Later he played with the Pittsburgh Colored 
Stars of Buffalo and managed the Buffalo Giants. Johnson continued to play 
with lesser teams until finally retiring in 1932 at the age of 58. After 
retiring from baseball he lived in Buffalo, where he worked for the New 
York Central Railroad Company. He was buried in Lakeside Cemetery (formerly 
Lakeside Memorial Park Cemetery and Buffalo Rural Cemetery) in Hamburg,
