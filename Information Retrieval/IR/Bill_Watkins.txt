As player As manager William Henry Watkins (May 5, 1858 – June 9, 1937), 
sometimes known as "Wattie,"[1] or "Watty,"[2] was a Canadian-born baseball 
player, manager, executive and team owner whose career in organized baseball 
spanned 47 years from 1876 to 1922. He began playing organized baseball 
in Canada and Michigan and played one season of Major League Baseball as 
an infielder for the Indianapolis Hoosiers in 1884. He was a manager of 
five major league clubs and several minor league clubs, including stints 
with the Indianapolis Hoosiers (1884–85), Detroit Wolverines (1885–1888), 
Kansas City Cowboys (1888–89), St. Louis Browns (1893) and Pittsburgh Pirates 
(1898–99). He led the 1887 Detroit Wolverines to the first professional 
sports championship for Detroit with a National League pennant and a victory 
over the St. Louis Browns in the 1887 World Series. He was also the business 
manager of the 1914 Indianapolis Hoosiers team that won the Federal League 
pennant, the first and only major league baseball championship for Indianapolis. 
Watkins was born in Brantford, Ontario, Canada, in 1858.[3] His parents, 
John Harton Watkins and Eliza Jane (Tyler) Watkins, were immigrants to 
Canada from Wales and Ireland, respectively. His mother died in 1868, and 
he was thereafter raised by his maternal grandparents in Erin, Ontario. 
Watkins attended Upper Canada College in Toronto for one year,[4] and he 
began playing organized baseball in 1876 as part of "the academy team" 
in Milton, Ontario, a suburb of Toronto.[5] He also held jobs as an apprentice 
for a manufacturer of novelty games and with a branch of the Ingles Corliss 
Engine Works.[4][6] In 1879, at age 21, Watkins moved to Port Huron, Michigan, 
where he lived for the next 40 years.[4] From 1879 to 1880, Watkins played 
for the Maple Leafs of Guelph in Southwestern Ontario. The Maple Leafs 
won the Canadian amateur championship while Watkins was a player.[5] In 
1881 and/or 1882, he was a player-manager for the Atlantic Club of St. 
Thomas, Ontario (part of the London, Ontario metropolitan area).[1][5] 
He led the Athletics to the Ontario provincial baseball championship in 
1881.[1] Watkins joined the Port Huron, Michigan, baseball club late in 
the 1882 season. In 1883, he served as player-manager for the Port Huron 
club, playing at third base, and leading the club to a Michigan State League 
championship.[4][5] In September 1883, Watkins was hired to take over as 
manager of the Bay City, Michigan club for the 1884 season at a salary 
of $2,000.[7] He led Bay City to a tie for first place in the Northwest 
League when the team disbanded in July 1884.[5] On August 1, 1884, Watkins 
made his major league debut with the Indianapolis Hoosiers of the American 
Association. Watkins appeared in 34 games, 23 at third base, nine at second 
base and two at shortstop.[3] Watkins also took over as the Hoosiers' manager, 
compiling a 4-18 record.[8] On August 26, 1884, Watkins was hit on the 
head by a pitch from Gus Shallix, at Cincinnati. The Cincinnati Enquirer 
described the incident as follows: With two out, Watkins came to bat and 
fell a victim to one of the swift curves of Shallix. The poor fellow ducked 
his head, but it was too late, and the ball caught him on the temple. He 
rolled over into the diamond, while a thrill of horror passed through the 
hearts of those in the stands. He was half carried, writhing nervously 
with pain, to the directors' room, where it was found that though the shock 
to his system had been great, no bones were broken.[9] Newspaper accounts 
indicate that he "hovered between life and death" for five days.[2] It 
took two weeks for him to recover and during that time, he lost 16 pounds.[10] 
Watkins returned briefly as a player after the injury, but his performance 
was substantially diminished.[4] On September 14, 1884, Watkins' error 
at second base let in most of Baltimore's runs in a 4-4 tie game.[11] He 
appeared in his final game as a player on October 13, 1884.[3][12] Newspaper 
stories published in 1912 in the Indianapolis Star and in 1937 in The Sporting 
News claimed that Watkins' hair turned prematurely white in 1884 due to 
the injury sustained when he was struck on the head.[2][13] In his biography 
for the SABR Baseball Biography Project, Bill Lamb wrote that the story 
about Watkins' hair turning white appears to be "folklore", as "post-beaning 
photographs" (including the image displayed above) "show Watkins with reddish-brown 
hair and mustache until he was well into middle age."[4] In 1885, the Indianapolis 
club in the American Association disbanded. Along with Ted Sullivan, Tom 
Loftus, and George Tebeau, Watkins helped organize the original Western 
League, a minor league baseball circuit based in the Midwestern United 
States.[4] A new version of the Indianapolis Hoosiers was established in 
the Western League with Watkins as the manager. In April 1885, The Sporting 
Life praised Watkins' effort in maintaining "rigid discipline", putting 
an end to the "carousals" of the prior year, and ridding the club of "the 
whiskey element", and noted that Watkins had become "the most popular and 
efficient manager the club has ever had."[14] By mid-June, the Hoosiers 
were the dominant team in the Western League, compiling an .880 winning 
percentage.[15] However, the league disbanded in mid-June, and a rush developed 
to sign the players on the Indianapolis roster, a line-up that included 
Sam Thompson, Deacon McGuire, Sam Crane, Jim Donnelly, Chub Collins, Mox 
McQuery, Gene Moriarty, and Dan Casey.[15] Sam Thompson later told the 
colorful story of the Hoosiers' acquisition by Detroit. Detroit sent two 
representatives (Marsh and Maloney) to Indianapolis, principally to sign 
the Hoosiers' battery of Larry McKeon and Jim Keenan. The Wolverines were 
outbid by the Cincinnati Reds for McKeon and Keenan but wound up with Watkins 
and the rest of the team's starting lineup. The only catch was that a 10-day 
waiting period would allow other teams to outbid Detroit. Marsh and Maloney 
promptly sent the players to Detroit and quartered them in a hotel there. 
The next morning, the players were told that the team had arranged a fishing 
trip for them. The players boarded the steamship Annette and enjoyed the 
first day and night of successful fishing. After three days, the players 
became suspicious, but the ship captain laughed when asked when they would 
return to Detroit. As the players became mutinous on the sixth day, the 
captain admitted he had been ordered to keep them "out at sea" for 10 days.[15] 
In another account, Thompson described his 10 days aboard the Annette as 
follows: We were prisoners, but well cared-for prisoners. Anything in the 
line of creature comforts you could find packed away on ice. We lived on 
the best in the market, and spent the rest of the time in fishing and playing 
poker, chips having very thoughtfully been provided. On the night of the 
tenth day, at midnight, we were all taken ashore where Watkins met us and 
signed us to our contracts.[16] The players were only later presented with 
their accumulated mail which included scores of offers from other clubs.[15] 
A writer in the Detroit Free Press noted: "Detroit magnates showed some 
inside baseball brains and great finessing in sending the players away 
from all tempters for that period when they belonged to no club."[15] When 
Watkins took over as manager of the Detroit Wolverines in June 1885, the 
team had compiled a 7-31 record to that point in the season. With the infusion 
of talent from Indianapolis, the team improved to 34–36 for the remainder 
of the 1885 season.[17] Late in the 1885 season, Detroit acquired four 
players from the Buffalo baseball club (Jack Rowe, Dan Brouthers, Hardy 
Richardson, and Deacon White) who were known as the "Big Four." The "Big 
Four" were "regarded for many years as the greatest quartette in the history 
of the national pastime."[18] The "Big Four" joined Detroit for the 1886 
season. With the addition of the "Big Four", the Wolverines improved substantially, 
finishing in second place with a 85-38 record in 1886.[19] The 1887 season 
was the pinnacle in the history of the Detroit Wolverines. The team was 
loaded with hitters, including six regulars who hit above .300: Sam Thompson 
(.372 and 166 RBIs in 127 games), Dan Brouthers (.338 and 101 RBIs in 123 
games), Larry Twitchell (.333), Hardy Richardson (.328), Jack Rowe (.318) 
and Deacon White (.303). The pitching staff was led by "Pretzels" Getzein, 
a curveball specialist who compiled a 29–13 (.690) win-loss records and 
a 3.73 earned run average. Outfielder Larry Twitchell also started 12 games 
as pitcher and compiled an 11–1 record. The Wolverines won the National 
League pennant with a 79-45 record and then defeated the St. Louis Browns 
in the 1887 World Series.[20] During the 1888 season, the Wolverines fell 
to fifth place. In late August 1888, the Detroit club fired, or accepted 
the resignation of, Watkins as their manager, and Robert Leadley was hired 
as "acting manager" in his place.[21] The Wolverines compiled a 49–44 record 
in their final year under Watkins.[22] After parting ways with the Wolverines 
in late August 1888, Watkins was hired in early September 1888 as the manager 
of the Kansas City Cowboys of the American Association. He led the club 
to an 8–17 record in the final month of the 1888 season and a 55-82 record 
in 1889.[23] In June 1890, Watkins was hired as the mid-season replacement 
manager for the St. Paul Apostles of the Western Association.[24] Watkins 
had little success in turning the St. Paul club around, and in August 1890, 
The Sporting Life reported that Watkins had been forced to release players 
and cut salaries to reduce expenses,[25] and that he was "running the St. 
Paul team economically according to instructions", though he hoped to have 
a stronger team in 1891.[26] The Apostles finished in last place in 1890 
with a 37-84 record.[27] In September 1890, with the St. Paul club losing 
money, C. L. Flatley, a personal friend of Watkins, purchased the club 
and promptly signed Watkins to serve as the club's manager again in 1891.[28][29] 
However, Flatley had sold the club by December 1890.[29] In June 1891, 
with the Apostles continuing to struggle financially and on the field, 
the club was sold and moved to Duluth, Minnesota.[30] Two months later, 
in August 1891, the club disbanded, and Watkins was left with financial 
responsibility for half of the Duluth team's unpaid player salaries.[31] 
In April 1892, Watkins was hired as the manager of the Rochester Flour 
Cities in the Eastern League and was described by The Sporting Life as 
"a cuckoo" who "will not be handicapped by meddling directors."[12][32] 
By the end of the season, the Rochester correspondent for The Sporting 
Life commended Watkins for his efforts with a "misfit team" that had a 
"scarcity of good men", was "badly crippled", suffered "internal dissension", 
and drew small crowds. The correspondent noted that Watkins had turned 
the club around with his emphasis on discipline: He has been as watchful 
of his men in the dark hours of the night as any man with self-respect 
could be, he has been always safe in his financial policy, his judgment 
of players has never gone wrong, he has been a stickler for finished team 
work ... He has been a dignified gentleman throughout and, considering 
the circumstances, the highest success as a manager... Local cranks will 
wish him unlimited success in every undertaking, and bear on with the hope 
that he may again pilot base ball in Rochester in 1893.[33] In 1893, Watkins 
was hired as the manager of the St. Louis Browns (later renamed the Cardinals) 
of the National League. Under owner Chris von der Ahe, the Browns had gone 
through five managers during the 1892 season, finishing in 11th place with 
a 56–94 (.373) record. Watkins remained the manager for the entire 1893 
season and led the club to a 57-75 (.432) record and a 10th-place finish 
in 1893.[23] In 1894, Watkins was the manager of the Sioux City Cornhuskers 
in the newly formed Western League.[12] He led the Sioux City club to the 
first Western League pennant with a 74-52 record. Four of his regular players 
(Lew Camp, Frank Genins, Lefty Marr and George Hogriever) hit .350 or higher, 
and pitcher Bert Cunningham won 35 games,[34] but the Sporting Life gave 
much of the credit for the Huskers' championship to Watkins: Watkins' success 
as a manager is largely due to the discipline which he enforces and to 
his knowledge of the intricate points of the game. With him the national 
game has become as easy as the moves to an expert chess player. With the 
diamond in front of him every correct move of the men on the field is quickly 
discerned, and with the signals used so advantageously he is always in 
communication with the captain and players. Many of the Husker victories 
this season have been won by the silent man on the bench ...[35] By 1894, 
Watkins had won pennants as a manager in St. Thomas, Port Huron, Detroit 
and Sioux City, and had led teams in Indianapolis and Bay City to first 
place in seasons that ended prematurely; the Sporting Life at the time 
asserted that Watkins had "the distinction of piloting more pennant winners 
than any other manager before the public to-day."[35] From 1895 through 
the early part of the 1898 season, Watkins was the manager of the Indianapolis 
Hoosiers/Indians in the Western League.[12] In 1898, Watkins was hired 
as the manager of the Pittsburgh Pirates. Wasting the efforts of pitcher 
Jesse Tannehill (25-13 record and 2.95 ERA), the 1898 Pirates compiled 
a .258 team batting average (13 points below the league average) and finished 
in eighth place out of twelve teams with a 72–76 record.[36] As he had 
been with other clubs, Watkins remained a strict disciplinarian as manager 
of the Pirates. The Sporting Life wrote: Watty is a firm base ball man, 
knows the practical side of the sport, and in the writer's recollection 
one of the few chiefs in the Pittsburg Club's employ who had courage to 
rebuke with spirit and determination players violating edicts, etc. Discipline 
prevails in his club. His iron-bound policy of directing plays of course 
cannot be popular with players, but if dictation is absent and appeal impossible 
the method may be pushed to success.[37] Watkins also gained note while 
in Pittsburgh for his giving mandatory signs to each batter from the bench. 
One newspaper suggested that Watkins was turning his players into machines: 
The chief objection to the Watkins system is that it compels players to 
lose all individuality and become a mere portion of the machine that Watkins 
makes of his team. According to Walter Brodie, late of Pittsburg, and now 
of the Orioles, Watkins is the most autocratic of autocrats. He establishes 
rules that must be lived up to the letter, and no man on the team must 
have a mind of his own. ... Watkins success, then, lies in making machines 
of his men and thinking for them.[38] Watkins described his sign system 
as follows: "I have only four, one telling the player to sacrifice, the 
second for the hit and run game, the third to hit the ball out, and the 
fourth to bunt. This completes the list, and they are as simple as can 
be. But when I give a player instructions what to do he will obey or get 
out of the club."[38] Watkins returned as the Pirates' manager in 1899 
at an annual salary of $4,500, but he resigned in May 1899 after the team 
began the season with a 7-15 record.[39][40] Watkins said at the time that 
he had other business to attend to, that he intended to quit baseball for 
good,[39] and that he planned to return to his farm in Wadhams, Michigan: 
"I am going back to the farm to see the horses and dogs. I have wanted 
to give up base ball for some time past. A turbulent life? I should say 
so. I will go into a quieter business."[37] In November 1899, Watkins purchased 
the Indianapolis Hoosiers of the American League from John T. Brush for 
"something like $10,000."[41] Watkins also leased land on the east side 
of Indianapolis and announced plans to build a new baseball field there.[41] 
Speculation was immediate that Watkins was not a bona fide purchaser of 
the club and that he had "purchased" the club as a front man for Brush, 
who had been roundly criticized for his manipulations of the lineups of 
the two clubs (the Cincinnati Reds and Indianapolis Hoosiers) that he owned.[41] 
Watkins also served as manager of the 1900 Indianapolis team, compiling 
a 71-64 record and finishing in third place.[23] After American League 
president Ban Johnson converted the circuit into a major league, eliminating 
Indianapolis' spot in the league, Watkins was a leader of efforts in early 
1901 to re-establish the American Association in competition with the American 
League. In January 1901, he was named chairman of the new league.[42] The 
efforts to establish a new American Association were unsuccessful, and 
Watkins' Indianapolis club joined the Western Association for the 1901 
season. He sold the club in July 1901, and it was moved to Matthews, Indiana.[4] 
In late 1901, Watkins led renewed, and this time successful, efforts to 
re-establish a 20th-century version of the American Association with teams 
in Indianapolis, Louisville, Milwaukee, Kansas City, Columbus, Toledo and 
Minneapolis.[4][13] In the early days of the new league, Watkins was credited 
with keeping the league from doing business with players who had jumped 
contracts with other teams and was called "the prime mover in the events 
which finally resulted in peace between the American Association and the 
minor leagues."[43] He became a one-half owner of the Indianapolis Indians 
in the American Association,[13] and he also served as manager during the 
1902 and 1903 seasons.[12] Official records cite John Grim as manager of 
the 1902 team, but Watkins' biographer Bill Lamb wrote that Watkins fully 
exercised duties now associated with a team manager.[4] Moreover, contemporaneous 
newspaper accounts in 1902 referred to Watkins as the team's manager.[44] 
The 1902 Indians compiled a 96-45 record and won the first American Association 
pennant.[4][45] After the pennant was secured, The Indianapolis Journal 
described Watkins' reaction: It is useless to mention him as Mr. W. H. 
Watkins. There are others of that name, while there is only one Watty. 
The exuberance of his eye, the thrill of enthusiasm in his voice and the 
general air of conquest surrounds him, told eloquently that Watty was happy. 
He leaned back in his mahogany chair in the pennant office in the Majestic 
building and illuminated every part of the room with his sunny countenance. 
He was in a benign mood, loquacious and enthusiastic.[46] Watkins' 1903 
team drew only 88,000 spectators, the lowest attendance in the American 
Association.[4] In November 1903, Watkins purchased the Minneapolis Millers 
of the American Association for $10,000.[43] Watkins also served as the 
manager of the Minneapolis club during the 1904 and 1905 seasons.[12] While 
managing the Millers, Watkins developed a reputation as a fierce competitor. 
The Minneapolis Journal in 1906 wrote: He has been in the business so long 
he has probably handled more players than any other man in baseball today. 
Some men in managing a team from the bench can do so in a calm manner, 
but 'Watty' was not one of these. He was 'in' the game just as much as 
any player ... It hurt him to lose games more than it did to lose money. 
Taking baseball so seriously threatened injury of a lasting nature to his 
nervous organization ...[47] In October 1905, Watkins authored a lengthy 
article for The Minneapolis Journal outlining his views on the value of 
baseball as a game wherein "brains must be combined with skill", a game 
that "demands temperance and proper living", and "as an element of great 
good in American life."[48] In December 1905, Watkins sold his ownership 
interest in the Minneapolis baseball club to Mike Kelley. The sale price 
was not disclosed but was "said to be in the neighborhood of $50,000."[49] 
Watkins returned to Indianapolis in 1906 as manager of the Indianapolis 
Indians of the American Association. The Indianapolis Morning Star reported 
that local baseball fans were "rejoicing",[50] and that Watkins was "regarded 
as the most competent manager in the American Association."[49] He had 
retained his half ownership interest in the Indianapolis club even while 
he was managing the Minneapolis team.[13][51] He was also president of 
the club from 1906 to 1912.[4][52][53][54] He stepped down as bench manager 
in May 1906, turning over responsibility of bench manager to Charlie Carr.[47] 
As of January 1912, Watkins owned interests in baseball clubs in three 
different leagues: the Indianapolis Indians in the American Association, 
the Springfield, Ohio club in the Central League, and the Newark, Ohio 
club in the Ohio State League. The Springfield and Newark clubs were both 
farm teams for the Indianapolis club.[55] In February 1912, the Sporting 
Life reported that Watkins actually had a say in four minor league clubs 
and referred to him as the "monarch of the minors."[56] In the spring of 
1912, the Sporting Life published a report that Watkins had sold his interest 
in the Indianapolis club,[57] and the Indianapolis Star reported that Watkins 
had been "deposed" as president of the Indianapolis team, tendering his 
resignation after refusing the demand from club owners to remove the manager, 
Jimmy Burke.[13] The Star noted at the time: For more than thirty years 
he has been a prominent figure in baseball. He was one of the organizers 
of the American Association ... Mr. Watkins is a baseball man of the old 
school and he has been in the thick of all the grueling battles through 
which organized baseball has passed to bring it up to its present standard 
as one of the greatest amusement enterprises in the country. He has been 
through five baseball wars, and, as he says, 'went broke' in every one 
of them.[13] While Watkins was generally regarded as a good judge of talent, 
he and manager Charlie Carr were criticized in hindsight for having sold 
Grover Cleveland Alexander (later inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame), 
Marty O'Toole and Buck O'Brien for a mere $750 while they were president 
and manager of the Indianapolis club.[58] In February 1914, Watkins was 
hired, at a salary reported to be $8,000, as the business manager for the 
Indianapolis Hoosiers team in the newly formed Federal League.[59][60] 
Upon his hiring, The Sporting Life opined: "William H. Watkins has served 
the game as player, manager, and magnate for three decades, with credit 
to himself and the sport, and his re-entrance in the Indianapolis field, 
where he labored for the greater part of his brilliant career, is absolutely 
certain to redound to the advantage of his new club and league."[61] Watkins 
told the press: "I know that Indianapolis, with its large suburban population, 
is large enough and has enough enthusiastic fans to support two base ball 
teams so long as there is no serious confliction in dates. I am glad to 
get back into the harness and particularly glad to return to Indianapolis."[59] 
The 1914 Hoosiers compiled an 88-65 record and won the first Federal League 
pennant, the first and only major league pennant in Indianapolis baseball 
history.[62][63][64] However, in late March 1915, a deal was struck that 
resulted in the Indianapolis club being moved to Newark, New Jersey. Watkins 
did not follow the team to Newark.[65][66] In all, Watkins was affiliated 
with Indianapolis baseball clubs in seven different leagues: the 1884 Hoosiers 
in the American Association, the 1885 Hoosiers in the first version of 
the Western League, the 1895-98 Hoosiers/Indians in the second version 
of the Western League, the 1900 Hoosiers in the American League, the 1901 
Hoosiers in the Central League,[2] the 1903 and 1906–1910 Indians in the 
20th century version of the American Association and the 1914 Hoosiers 
in the Federal League.[12][23][67] From 1920 to 1922, Watkins served as 
president of the Port Huron baseball club.[1] In 1921, Watkins was one 
of the principal backers of the Port Huron club when it joined the Michigan–Ontario 
League.[68] Watkins resigned the club's presidency in May 1922 in a letter 
stating that his business commitments prevented him from devoting the time 
needed for proper management of the club.[69] Watkins was married in 1884 
to Edna Buzzard. They apparently had no children. Watkins became a naturalized 
United States citizen in 1897.[4] After retiring from baseball, Watkins 
lived in Port Huron, Michigan, and worked as an executive at banks and 
land development and manufacturing companies. He also served as president 
of the Port Huron Chamber of Commerce and helped found the city of Marysville, 
Michigan, serving as the first village president and chairing the committee 
that incorporated Marysville into a city. He was elected justice of the 
peace in Marysville in 1933.[4][68] Watkins died from diabetes in 1937 
at age 79 in Port Huron, Michigan.[1] He was survived by his wife, Edna,[1] 
and was buried at Lakeside Cemetery in Port Huron.[3] The field used by 
both the Port Huron semipro and high school baseball teams was named Watkins 
Field in his honor (though it ceased being used in the early 1940s).[68] 
Watkins was inducted into the Port Huron Sports Hall of Fame in 2008.[68]
