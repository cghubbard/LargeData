Timothy Howard Worrell (born July 5, 1967) is a former professional baseball 
pitcher. A right-hander, he pitched all or part of fourteen seasons in 
Major League Baseball, primarily as a relief pitcher. During his major 
league career, Worrell pitched for nine teams, including the San Diego 
Padres, Cleveland Indians, Detroit Tigers, Oakland Athletics, Baltimore 
Orioles, Chicago Cubs, San Francisco Giants (twice), Philadelphia Phillies, 
and Arizona Diamondbacks. Worrell's greatest success came in 2003 when 
he replaced the injured Robb Nen as the closer for San Francisco. After 
the season Worrell signed with the Philadelphia Phillies, where he returned 
to his previous role as a set-up pitcher, often pitching the eighth inning 
before Phillies closer Billy Wagner entered the game. Worrell is the younger 
brother of former Major League pitcher Todd Worrell, himself a former closer 
for the St. Louis Cardinals and Los Angeles Dodgers. On May 6, 2005, Worrell 
stated that he was dealing with "personal psychological issues" that had 
to be resolved and was subsequently placed on the 15-day disabled list. 
Prior to this disclosure Worrell had struggled, posting a 9.82 ERA, by 
far the worst of his career. Seemingly back to his old self, Worrell returned 
to pitch a perfect ninth on July 4, 2005 and completed the season in Arizona 
with an exceptional 0.90 ERA over his last 18 games. On December 1, 2005, 
Worrell's return to the San Francisco Giants was agreed, with a two-year 
contract valued at $4 million. On January 10, 2007, he announced his retirement 
due to a persistent nerve problem in his neck. Worrell stated that his 
major league career is not completely over as he wanted to get into coaching.[1]
