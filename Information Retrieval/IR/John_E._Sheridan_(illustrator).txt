John E. Sheridan (born 1880, Tomah, Wisconsin â€“ d. July 3, 1948, New York) 
was an illustrator well known in his lifetime for his cover art for The 
Saturday Evening Post, his illustrations for Collier's Weekly and Ladies' 
Home Journal, and his commercial advertisements.[1] His obituary in The 
New York Times states that he "was credited with the idea of using posters 
to advertise college sports."[1] Sheridan attended Georgetown University 
in the late 1890s,[2] graduating in 1901. During World War I, he created 
many patriotic posters in support of the United States' war effort as part 
of the committee of artists that also included Charles Dana Gibson (creator 
of the Gibson Girl) and James Montgomery Flagg (creator of the iconic Uncle 
Sam recruiting poster).[1] Sheridan was art editor for the Washington Times 
(predecessor of the now-defunct Washington Times-Herald) and worked for 
the San Francisco Chronicle in the development of its first color Sunday 
supplement.[1] Between 1931 and 1939 he produced 13 cover illustrations 
for The Saturday Evening Post.[3] As an advertising illustrator, Sheridan 
produced a large number of advertisements, posters and seasonal style books 
for Hart Schaffner & Marx, a Chicago-based clothier. [4] Sheridan was a 
member of the Dutch Treat Club, and a frequent contributor to the program 
of their annual banquet and show, and was an instructor at New York's School 
of Visual Arts at the time of its founding.[3] As an artist of advertisements 
and magazine covers, Sheridan was not always free to sign his full name 
to his art work. As a result, many of his illustrations contain only stylized 
monograms to identify the artist. Signature with an initial JS Monogram
