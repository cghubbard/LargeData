Moisés Rojas Alou (English /ˈmɔɪzᵻs əˈluː/; Spanish: [moiˈses aˈlo.u]; 
born July 3, 1966) is a former Dominican-American outfielder in Major League 
Baseball who played for 17 seasons in the National League. In 1,942 career 
games, Alou had a batting average of .303 with 2,134 hits, 421 doubles, 
332 home runs, and 1,287 runs batted in. His father Felipe, who managed 
Moises with the Expos from 1992 to 1996 and the Giants from 2005 to 2006, 
as well as uncles Matty and Jesús, and cousin Mel Rojas, all had long careers 
in Major League Baseball. In 2008, he was one of four active major leaguers 
(along with Prince Fielder, Ken Griffey, Jr., and Daryle Ward) to hit 20 
home runs in a season whose fathers had also hit 20 home runs in an MLB 
season. Alou is married to Austria Alou; they have three sons: Percio, 
Kirby and Moisés Jr. Alou is one of the few baseball players who batted 
without the use of batting gloves. Instead, Moisés Alou revealed that during 
baseball season he urinates on his hands to toughen them up.[1] Alou was 
also known for pranking teammates while they were sleeping in the locker 
room. At the age of 18, Alou was more interested in playing basketball 
during his youth, and did not play organized baseball until he attended 
Cañada College in Redwood City, California. It was there that baseball 
scouts noticed his bat speed and speed on the basepaths. In 1986, Alou 
was the second overall pick in the amateur draft, chosen by the Pittsburgh 
Pirates. In 1990, he was traded to the Montreal Expos where he would later 
play under his father while he managed the Expos. Alou suffered a severe 
ankle injury in 1993 that would rob him of his speed and force him to become 
strictly a corner outfielder. He recovered in 1994, hitting .339 and hit 
the game-winning hit in the year's All-Star Game. For the next two seasons, 
he would enjoy success at the plate in Montreal, although surgery to both 
shoulders prematurely ended his 1995 season.[2] Prior to the 1997 season, 
Alou signed as a free agent with the Florida Marlins, where he led the 
team with 23 home runs and 115 RBIs. The Marlins made the playoffs as a 
wild card team, and defeated the San Francisco Giants in the National League 
Divisional Series, and then the Atlanta Braves in the National League Championship 
Series, before going to the World Series, which Florida won in seven games. 
Alou led the team by hitting .321 with three home runs and nine RBI in 
the World Series (although, pitcher Liván Hernández, by virtue of his wins 
in Games 1 and 5 was named the Series Most Valuable Player instead). Before 
the 1998 season, the Marlins traded Alou to the Houston Astros. In his 
first season with the team, Alou hit a career-high 38 home runs and drove 
in 124 runs while leading the Astros to a franchise record 102 wins. However, 
he tore his ACL in a treadmill accident in the offseason, and missed the 
entire 1999 season. Once recovered, he returned to the Astros lineup to 
hit .355 in 2000 and .331 in 2001, while driving in at least 108 runs in 
each season. After the 2001 season, the Astros did not offer Alou a new 
contract, making him a free agent. In December 2001, he inked a 3-year, 
$27 million contract with the Chicago Cubs. In 2002, Alou again ended up 
on the disabled list at the start of the season, and once healthy, he hit 
.275 and 15 home runs. After the 2002 season, Alou, hired a personal trainer 
and dedicated himself[vague] to return to his old form. In the 2003 season, 
Alou batted over .300 for most of the season while driving in runs as he 
used to[quantify], before a late season slump dropped his season batting 
average to .280, with 22 home runs and 91 RBIs. Alou went on to lead the 
team in average in its two series against the Atlanta Braves and Florida 
Marlins. In Game 6 of the National League Championship Series against the 
Florida Marlins that year, Alou was involved in the Steve Bartman incident, 
in which a Cubs fan named Steve Bartman deflected a foul ball landing one 
row into the stands, preventing Alou, who reached into the stands, from 
attempting to catch the ball for an out that could have been the second 
out of the 8th Inning. However, the Marlins went on to score eight runs 
in the inning, which the Cubs had led 3–0. The Cubs, who had led the series 
3–2, lost the game 8–3 and eventually lost the series in seven games. Alou 
openly admitted later in interviews that while he was frustrated at the 
moment, he could not have made the catch anyway.[3] Later he denied making 
such a statement and said if he had, it was only to make Bartman feel better.[4] 
In 2004, Alou set new career highs in home runs (39) and doubles (36), 
while driving in 106 runs. However, the Cubs missed the playoffs after 
losing seven of their last nine games. The Cubs refused to offer arbitration 
and let him go, citing numerous fights with umpires whom he claimed had 
a vendetta against him.[5] In October 2004, Alou announced that he had 
talked to his father, Felipe, about possibly playing for him and the Giants 
next season. In December 2004, he signed a one-year deal with the Giants 
worth 13.5 million, with a player option for a second year. Alou was expected 
to regularly play in right field for the first time since 2001, but due 
to injuries to left fielder Barry Bonds, he started most games in left 
field. Alou had stated that he would retire if the Giants won the World 
Series in 2005. They did not, and Alou exercised his option and stayed 
with San Francisco in 2006 season, hitting 22 home runs and 74 RBI. On 
November 20, 2006, the New York Mets signed Alou to a one-year contract 
worth $7.5 million with a club option for 2008. After hitting .318 in his 
first month as the regular left fielder, Alou suffered a torn quadriceps 
muscle, and was forced out until August. Upon his return, Alou led the 
Mets with a .345 batting average and had a 30-game hitting streak. The 
streak was the longest streak of the 2007 season, was the longest hitting 
streak by a player over age 40, and broke the Mets' overall and single-season 
hitting streak records. On October 31, 2007, the Mets exercised their option 
on Alou's contract for the 2008 season. "Last year, Moises showed us what 
type of hitter he was", said General Manager Omar Minaya.[6] On March 5, 
2008 Alou underwent hernia surgery and missed the start of the 2008 season. 
On July 9, Alou suffered a torn right hamstring playing in the outfield 
for AA Binghamton in Norwich, Connecticut. Mets general manager Omar Minaya 
stated in a press conference the following day that Alou will likely need 
surgery and miss the remainder of the 2008 season, which ended his career.[7][8] 
On March 5, 2009, Alou announced that he would retire after the World Baseball
