Jackie Robinson Stadium is a college baseball stadium in Los Angeles, California, 
U.S., the home field of the UCLA Bruins of the Pac-12 Conference. Opened 
in 1981, it is the smallest stadium in the conference, with a seating capacity 
of 1,820.[1] It is named after former Bruin baseball player Jackie Robinson, 
the first African-American Major League Baseball player of the modern era. 
Robinson attended UCLA from 1939â€“41, after graduating from Pasadena Junior 
College. He was the first UCLA athlete to earn varsity letters in four 
sports: baseball, basketball, football, and track. He played in the major 
leagues for ten seasons (1947-56), all with the Brooklyn Dodgers. A statue 
and a mural of Robinson can be found at the entrance concourse of the stadium. 
Jackie Robinson Stadium is located off-campus, on the west side of the 
Interstate 405 (San Diego) freeway, on the grounds of the Los Angeles Veterans 
Health Administration. Robinson's classmate, Hoyt Pardee (UCLA '41), gave 
a gift to help with the construction of the stadium. The stadium's "Steele 
Field" was dedicated in honor of the Steele Foundation on May 3, 2008, 
prior to a game against Arizona State, for its support of the stadium. 
The hitting facility at the stadium is named Jack and Rhodine Gifford Hitting 
Facility.[2] Gifford played baseball at UCLA and graduated from the Engineering 
School with a BSEE degree. He was a founder of Advanced Micro Devices and 
Maxim Integrated Products. A capacity crowd of 2,613 saw the Bruins defeating 
the defending National Champions LSU Tigers 6-3 at the Los Angeles Regional 
of the NCAA Baseball Tournament on June 5, 2010. The record of 2,914 fans 
was set on March 23, 1997 in a game against USC.[3] In 2010, the Bruins 
ranked 48th among Division I baseball programs in attendance, averaging 
1,178 per home game.[4] The stadium is not the same as the Jackie Robinson 
Memorial Field (dedicated on January 30, 1988) at Brookside Park, next 
to the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, where UCLA plays its home football games.[5] 
On August 30, 2013, a federal judge ruled that the United States Department 
of Veterans Affairs misused the West Los Angeles campus where the stadium 
is located for a variety of uses, including the stadium, but stopped short 
of ordering the tenants off the property.[6] However, the judge's ruling 
left open the possibility that, if not modified or reversed, UCLA could
