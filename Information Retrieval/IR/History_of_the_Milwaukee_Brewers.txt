The following is a history of professional baseball in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, 
including its current team, the Brewers. Milwaukee was an early prospect 
for professional baseball, with several brief experiments at the major 
league level but mostly in the minor leagues. The longest-lasting minor 
league club was the Milwaukee Brewers, who played in the American Association 
from 1902 through 1952. The nicknames of these teams were initially assigned 
by the media rather than the teams themselves. Some were known as the "Creams" 
or "Cream Citys" after the distinctive brick which gave Milwaukee its nickname, 
others were known as the "Brewers", in reference to one of the city's chief 
industries. This chart is a brief overview of the various Milwaukee professional 
baseball clubs: The nickname "Brewers" has been used by Milwaukee baseball 
teams since at least the 1880s, although none of those clubs ever enjoyed 
a measure of success or stability. That would change with Milwaukee's entry 
into the American Association, which would last fifty years and provide 
the city's springboard into the major leagues. The American Association 
Milwaukee Brewers were founded in 1901, after the American League Brewers 
moved to St. Louis and became the St. Louis Browns. The modern Orioles 
franchise can trace its roots back to the original Milwaukee Brewers of 
the minor Western League, beginning in 1894 when the league reorganized. 
The Brewers were there when the WL renamed itself the American League in 
1900. At the end of the 1900 season, the American League removed itself 
from baseball's National Agreement (the formal understanding between the 
NL and the minor leagues). Two months later, the AL declared itself a competing 
major league. As a result of several franchise shifts, the Brewers were 
one of only two Western League teams that didn't either fold or move (the 
other being the Detroit Tigers). During the first American League season, 
they finished dead last with a record of 48-89. During its lone Major League 
season, the team played at Lloyd Street Grounds, between 16th and 18th 
Streets in Milwaukee. The Brewers did not win their first American Association 
championship until 1913, then repeated the next year. Over 20 years would 
pass before they claimed another with a 90-64 club in 1936 as a Detroit 
affiliate. In 1944, the team won again, placing the team in the top 100. 
Three years later, the Brewers became a farm team of the Boston Braves. 
Although this move eventually paved the way for the team's demise, in the 
short run it led directly to Milwaukee's final two league championships—one 
in 1951 when they also won the Junior World Series, followed by an even 
better team the next year. In 1941 the club was purchased by Bill Veeck 
(son of former Chicago Cubs president William Veeck, Sr.), in a partnership 
with former Cubs star Charlie Grimm. Under Veeck's ownership, the Brewers 
would become one of the most colorful squads in baseball and Veeck would 
be become one of the game's premiere showmen. Constantly creating new promotional 
gimmicks, Veeck gave away live animals, scheduled morning games for wartime 
night shift workers, staged weddings at home plate, and even sent Grimm 
a birthday cake containing a much-needed left-handed pitcher. When Grimm 
was hired as the manager of the Cubs, he recommended that Casey Stengel 
be hired to replace him. Veeck was opposed to the idea – Stengel had little 
success in his previous managerial stints with the Dodgers and Braves – 
but as Veeck was stationed overseas in the Marine Corps, Grimm won out. 
The club went on to win the 1944 American Association pennant, and Stengel's 
managerial career was resurrected. In 1945, after winning three pennants 
in five years, Veeck sold his interest in the Brewers for a $275,000 profit. 
Milwaukee had long been coveted by major league teams looking for a new 
home. Bill Veeck himself tried to relocate the St. Louis Browns back to 
Milwaukee in the late 1940s, but his move was vetoed by the other American 
League owners. The city of Milwaukee, hoping to attract a major league 
club, constructed Milwaukee County Stadium for the 1953 season. The Brewers 
were set to move in, until Spring training of 1953, when Lou Perini moved 
his Boston Braves to Milwaukee. The Brewers moved to Toledo, where they 
became the next incarnation of the Toledo Mud Hens. The new Mud Hens continued 
their winning ways, claiming an American Association pennant in their first 
season in Ohio. The legacy of the American Association Milwaukee Brewers 
continues in the major league Milwaukee Brewers, which took its name from 
the 1902–1952 club. After the Braves moved to Atlanta in 1966, local automobile 
dealer and Braves part-owner Bud Selig created a group to lobby for a new 
major league club in Milwaukee. As a name for his group, he chose "Milwaukee 
Brewers Baseball Club, Inc.", after the American Association club he grew 
up watching. As a logo, he chose the Beer Barrel Man in navy and red – 
traditional Brewers colors. When Selig bought the one-year-old Seattle 
Pilots franchise in the spring of 1970, he moved them to Milwaukee and 
they officially became the "new" major-league Milwaukee Brewers. The club 
continued to use the Beer Barrel Man as the team's primary logo until 1978, 
although due to time constraints, the team continued to use the old Pilots' 
colors of blue and gold. Recently, it has seen a resurgence on throwback 
merchandise, and been featured on several stadium promotions. The current 
Brewers have played in the National League since 1998, when the franchise 
switched over from the American League after 29 years in the "Junior Circuit" 
as both the Pilots and the Brewers. The Junior World Series was held between 
the champions of the American Association and the International League. 
During its 51-year tenure in the American Association, Milwaukee played 
in the same ballpark. Originally constructed in 1888, it was located in 
the North side of Milwaukee on a rectangular city block with the main entrance 
on Chambers St. between Eighth and Ninth Streets. It had abnormally short 
foul lines, 268 feet to left and right. The fences then angled out sharply, 
making for deep "power alleys" and center field was 400 feet from home 
plate. It was known as Athletic Park until 1928 when it was renamed Borchert 
Field in honor of Brewers owner Otto Borchert, who had died the previous 
year. The Polo Grounds had a similar configuration. 'Borchert Orchard' 
was also the first Milwaukee home park for the Green Bay Packers, who played 
the New York Giants on Oct. 1, 1933. The following year, the Packers moved 
their Milwaukee games to the Wisconsin State Fair Grounds. Interstate 43 
now runs through where Borchert Field once stood. In an effort to prevent 
the relocation of the Milwaukee Braves to a larger television market, Braves 
minority owner Bud Selig, a Milwaukee-area car dealer, formed an organization 
named "Teams Inc." devoted to local control of the club. He successfully 
prevented the majority owners of the Braves from moving the club in 1964 
but was unable to do more than delay the inevitable. The Braves relocated 
to Atlanta after the 1965 season, and Teams Inc. turned its focus to returning 
Major League Baseball to Milwaukee. Selig doggedly pursued this goal, attending 
owners meetings in the hopes of securing an expansion franchise. Selig 
changed the name of his group to "Milwaukee Brewers Baseball Club Inc.". 
The "Brewers" name, honoring Milwaukee's beer-brewing tradition, also was 
traditional for Milwaukee baseball teams going back into the 19th century. 
The city had hosted a major league team by that name in 1901, which relocated 
at the end of that season to become the St. Louis Browns (now the Baltimore 
Orioles). From 1902 through 1952, a minor league Milwaukee Brewers club 
in the American Association had been so successful that it lured the Braves 
from Boston. Selig himself had grown up watching that minor league team 
at Borchert Field and intended his new franchise to follow in that tradition. 
To demonstrate there still was support for big-league ball in Milwaukee, 
Selig's group contracted with Chicago White Sox owner Arthur Allyn to host 
nine White Sox home games at Milwaukee County Stadium in 1968. A 1967 exhibition 
game between the White Sox and Minnesota Twins had attracted more than 
51,000 spectators, and Selig was convinced the strong Milwaukee fan base 
would demonstrate the city would provide a good home for a new club. The 
experiment was staggeringly successful – those nine games drew 264,297 
fans. In Chicago that season, the Sox drew 539,478 fans to their remaining 
58 home games. In just a handful of games, the Milwaukee crowds accounted 
for nearly one-third of the total attendance at White Sox games. In light 
of this success, Selig and Allyn agreed County Stadium would host Sox home 
games again the next season. In 1969, the Sox schedule in Milwaukee was 
expanded to include 11 home games (one against every other franchise in 
the American League at the time). Although those games were attended by 
slightly fewer fans (198,211 fans, for an average of 18,019) they represented 
a greater percentage of the total White Sox attendance than the previous 
year – over one-third of the fans who went to Sox home games in 1969 did 
so at County Stadium (in the remaining 59 home dates in Chicago, the Sox 
drew 391,335 for an average of 6,632 per game). Selig felt this fan support 
lent legitimacy to his quest for a Milwaukee franchise, and he went into 
the 1968 owners meetings with high hopes. Those hopes were dashed when 
National League franchises were awarded to San Diego (the Padres) and Montreal 
(the Expos), and American League franchises were awarded to Kansas City 
(the Royals) and Seattle (the Pilots). That last franchise, however, would 
figure very prominently in Selig's future. Having failed to gain a major 
league franchise for Milwaukee through expansion, Selig turned his efforts 
to purchasing and relocating an existing club. His search began close to 
home, with the White Sox themselves. According to Selig, he had a handshake 
agreement with Allyn to purchase the Pale Hose and move them north. The 
American League, unwilling to surrender Chicago to the National League, 
vetoed the sale, and Allyn sold the franchise to his brother John. Frustrated 
in these efforts, Selig shifted his focus to another American League team, 
the expansion Seattle Pilots. Seattle initially had a lot going for it 
when it joined the American League in 1969. Like Milwaukee, Seattle had 
long been a hotbed for minor league baseball and was home to the Seattle 
Rainiers, one of the pillars of the Pacific Coast League (PCL). The Cleveland 
Indians had almost moved to Seattle in the early 1960s. Many of the same 
things that attracted the Indians made Seattle a plum choice for an expansion 
team. Seattle was the third-biggest metropolitan area on the West Coast 
(behind Los Angeles and the San Francisco Bay Area). The addition of a 
third team on the West Coast also would balance out the addition of Kansas 
City. Also, there was no real competition from other pro teams. While Seattle 
had just landed the NBA's SuperSonics, the NBA was not in the same class 
as baseball was in terms of popularity at the time. The front man for the 
franchise was Dewey Soriano, a former Rainiers pitcher and general manager 
and former president of the PCL. In an ominous sign of things to come, 
Soriano had to ask William R. Daley, who had owned the Indians at the time 
they flirted with Seattle, to furnish much of the expansion fee. In return, 
Daley bought 47 percent of the stock—the largest stake in the club. He 
became chairman of the board while Soriano served as president. However, 
a couple of factors were beyond the Pilots' control. They were originally 
not set to start play until 1971. But the date was moved up to 1969 under 
pressure from Sen. Stuart Symington of Missouri. Professional baseball 
had been played in Kansas City for all but two years in the 20th century 
until the A's left for Oakland after the 1967 season, and the prospect 
of having Kansas City wait three years for its return was not acceptable 
to Symington. Also, the Pilots had to pay the PCL $1 million to compensate 
for the loss of one of its most successful franchises. After King County 
voters approved a bond for a domed stadium (what would become the Kingdome) 
in 1968, the Seattle Pilots were officially born. California Angels executive 
Marvin Milkes was hired as general manager, and St. Louis Cardinals coach 
Joe Schultz became manager. To the surprise of no one outside Seattle (Schultz 
and Milkes actually thought they could finish third in the newly formed 
AL West), the Pilots were terrible. They won their very first game, and 
then their home opener three days later, but only won five more times in 
the first month and never recovered. They finished last in the West with 
a record of 64–98, 33 games out of first. However, the team's poor play 
was the least of its troubles. The most obvious problem was Sick's Stadium. 
The longtime home of the Rainiers, it had been considered one of the best 
ballparks in minor league baseball. By the 1960s, however, it was considered 
far behind the times. While a condition of MLB awarding the Pilots to Seattle 
was that Sick's had to be expanded to 30,000 seats by the start of the 
1969 season, only 17,000 seats were ready due to numerous delays. The scoreboard 
wasn't even ready until the eve of opening day. While it was expanded to 
25,000 by June, the added seats had obstructed views. Water pressure was 
almost nonexistent after the seventh inning, especially with crowds above 
10,000. Attendance was so poor (678,000) that the Pilots were almost out 
of money by the end of the season. The team's new stadium was slated to 
be built at the Seattle Center, but a petition by stadium opponents ground 
the project to a halt. By the end of the season, it was obvious that the 
Pilots would not survive long enough to move to their new stadium without 
new ownership. It was also obvious that the move would have to happen quickly, 
as Sick's Stadium was completely inadequate even for temporary use. During 
the offseason, Soriano crossed paths with Selig. They met in secret for 
over a month after the end of the season, and during Game 1 of the World 
Series, Soriano agreed to sell the Pilots to Selig for $10 million to $13 
million (depending on the source). Selig would then move the team to Milwaukee 
and rename it the Brewers. However, the owners turned it down in the face 
of pressure from Washington's two senators, Warren Magnuson and Henry (Scoop) 
Jackson, as well as state attorney general Slade Gorton. MLB asked Soriano 
and Daley to find a local buyer. Local theater chain owner Fred Danz came 
forward in October 1969 with a $10 million deal, but it fizzled when the 
Bank of California called in a $4 million loan it had made to Soriano and 
Daley for startup costs. In January 1970, Westin Hotels owner Eddie Carlson 
put together a nonprofit group to buy the team. However, the owners rejected 
the idea almost out of hand since it would have devalued the other clubs' 
worth. A more traditional deal came one vote short of approval. After a 
winter and spring full of court action, the Pilots reported for spring 
training under new manager Dave Bristol unsure of where they would play. 
The owners had given tentative approval to the Milwaukee group, but the 
state of Washington got an injunction on March 17 to stop the deal. Soriano 
immediately filed for bankruptcy – a move intended to forestall any post-sale 
legal action. At the bankruptcy hearing a week later, Milkes testified 
there wasn't enough money to pay the coaches, players and office staff. 
Had Milkes been more than 10 days late in paying the players, they would 
have all become free agents and left Seattle without a team for the 1970 
season. With this in mind, Federal Bankruptcy Referee Sidney Volinn declared 
the Pilots bankrupt on April 1 – six days before Opening Day – clearing 
the way for them to move to Milwaukee. The team's equipment had been sitting 
in Provo, Utah with the drivers awaiting word on whether to drive toward 
Seattle or Milwaukee. Much of the story of the Seattle Pilots' only year 
in existence is told in Jim Bouton's classic baseball book, Ball Four. 
With the season's opening day only six days away, there was not enough 
time to order completely new uniforms, so the club had to remove the Pilots 
logo from team uniforms and replace them with Brewers logos. In fact, the 
outline of the old Pilots logo could still be seen on the Brewers' uniforms. 
Selig's original intention had been to adopt navy and red as the team colors, 
hearkening back to the minor league club (souvenir buttons sold at White 
Sox games at County Stadium featured the major league club's logo in that 
color combination), but with no time to order new uniforms, the Brewers 
adopted the blue and gold of the Pilots as their own. That color combination, 
in various shades, is still used by the club. The short notice (along with 
their geographical location) also forced the Brewers to assume the Pilots' 
old place in the AL West. While this resulted in natural rivalries with 
the White Sox and Twins, it also meant the Brewers faced some very long 
road trips, traveling to the Angels and Athletics for three series each 
per season (although this was no worse than the National League's Atlanta 
Braves and Cincinnati Reds having to play nine series per season in California 
as members of the NL West). Under the circumstances, the Brewers' 1970 
season was over before it started, and they finished 65-97. They would 
not have a winning season until 1978. Selig brought back former Milwaukee 
Braves catcher (and fan favorite) Del Crandall in 1972 to manage the club. 
In 1972, the Brewers were shifted to the AL East when the second edition 
of the Washington Senators moved to Arlington, Texas and became the Texas 
Rangers. It was during this period that Milwaukee County Stadium gained 
its reputation for fun as well as baseball. Then-team vice president Dick 
Hackett hired Frank Charles to play the Wurlitzer organ during the games, 
and Hackett introduced team mascots Bernie and Bonnie Brewer. On November 
2, 1974, the Brewers orchestrated a trade that brought one of the most 
beloved Braves back to Milwaukee, sending outfielder Dave May and a player 
to be named later (minor league pitcher Roger Alexander) to Atlanta for 
Hank Aaron. Although not the player he was in his prime, Aaron brought 
prestige to the young club, and the opportunity to be a designated hitter 
allowed Aaron to extend his playing career two more seasons. Following 
the 1977 season, the Brewers made two big hires that turned the previously 
underachieving Brewers into perennial contenders. Harry Dalton was hired 
as the club's General Manager and he, in turn, hired Baltimore Orioles 
pitching coach George Bamberger as the Brewers' third manager in their 
brief history. Bamberger immediately turned the Brewers into pennant contenders 
in 1978. The team won 93 games, an astonishing 26 game improvement from 
the previous season. The Brewers finished in 3rd place in the AL East, 
6.5 games behind the first place New York Yankees. GM Harry Dalton was 
able to build a winning club with a combination of home-grown players like 
Robin Yount, Paul Molitor, and Gorman Thomas, as well as getting players 
that were cast-offs from other teams that became major contributors like 
Cecil Cooper, Ben Oglivie, and Mike Caldwell. The next season, Milwaukee 
won 95 games and finished second in the East behind the Baltimore Orioles 
on the strength of their home run power, led by Oglivie (who led the league 
in homers in 1980 along with Reggie Jackson), Cooper, and Thomas (who hit 
a then club-record 45 home runs in 1979, since broken by Prince Fielder, 
who hit 50 homers in 2007). Because of the team's slugging ability and 
the nickname of their manager Bamberger, the Brewers were nicknamed "Bambi's 
Bombers." As 1980 began, the Brewers and their fans were optimistic about 
becoming pennant winners, but the team scuffled during the season, partially 
due to manager George Bamberger suffering a heart attack and having to 
be replaced by Buck Rodgers. The Brewers fell back to 3rd place in 1980, 
largely due to a lack of an effective bullpen. Determined to get a proven 
relief pitcher, general manager Harry Dalton made a huge offseason trade 
with the St. Louis Cardinals, trading outfielder Sixto Lezcano and 3 minor 
league pitchers to the Cardinals in exchange for Rollie Fingers, Pete Vuckovich, 
and Ted Simmons, all of whom became key parts of the Brewers future success. 
The Brewers won the second half of the 1981 season (divided because of 
a players' strike) and played the Yankees in a playoff mini-series they 
ultimately lost. It was the first playoff appearance for the franchise. 
Rollie Fingers had one of the greatest seasons for a relief pitcher that 
season, saving 28 games in the shortened season and sporting an astonishing 
1.04 ERA, earning him both the MVP and Cy Young Awards in the American 
League. In 1982, the Brewers were considered heavy favorites to win the 
AL East, but by June, the team had fallen to 23–24 and signs had shown 
that the players were having problems playing under manager Buck Rodgers. 
Taking a gamble, the Brewers fired Rodgers and replaced him with hitting 
coach Harvey Kuenn. The team immediately excelled under Kuenn's low-key 
managerial style and gained a new nickname as Harvey's Wallbangers, a play 
on the drink Harvey Wallbanger and the team's manager's name. The Brewers 
went 72–43 under Kuenn for the rest of the season and went wild offensively, 
clubbing a then club-record 216 home runs during the season. The Brewers 
alone had three players finish in the top five in the league in home runs 
with Gorman Thomas, who led the league with 39, Ben Oglivie, who hit 34, 
and Cecil Cooper, who hit 32. Late in the season, to try to ensure the 
Brewers' pennant chase, the team made one last trade on August 30 for Don 
Sutton. That trade would become even more important on the final game of 
the regular season between the Brewers and the Baltimore Orioles, with 
both teams tied for first place in the AL East. Don Sutton started against 
Jim Palmer and the Brewers won 10–2, thanks to Robin Yount hitting two 
clutch home runs, clinching the AL East Division. The Brewers finished 
the season 95–67, the best record in baseball that year. The Brewers faced 
the California Angels in the 1982 American League Championship Series and 
lost the first two games in California, but then rallied to win the next 
two games back in Milwaukee, setting up the pivotal Game 5, with the winner 
being the American League Champions. Down 3–2 in the 7th, Cecil Cooper 
hit a clutch 2-run single to put the Brewers on top and proved to be a 
game winner. The Brewers became the first team to win the American League 
Championship Series when down two games to none. The Brewers then played 
the St. Louis Cardinals in the World Series, which was seen as a match-up 
of contrasting playing styles, as the Cardinals' offensive style was speed 
and defense, whereas the Brewers' offense was power hitting. The Brewers 
won Game One 10–0, thanks to Paul Molitor's World Series record 5 hits 
and a complete game shutout by Mike Caldwell. The Cardinals won the next 
two games and seemed to have Game 4 in complete control until the Brewers 
rallied for six runs in the 7th to win the game 7–5. The Brewers then won 
Game Five 6–4, giving them a 3–2 series lead, but the Cardinals trounced 
Don Sutton winning Game 6 13–1, and rallied for three runs late in Game 
7 to win the Series, 4 games to 3. Many point to the lack of a bullpen 
for their downfall, as the Brewers had the lead in five of the seven games. 
Ace closer Rollie Fingers missed the playoffs due to a torn muscle in his 
throwing arm that not only kept him out for the entire playoffs but also 
would have him miss the entire 1983 season. The Brewers had many individual 
accomplishments during their two playoff years, as both in 1981 and 1982, 
Brewer players won both the AL MVP and Cy Young Awards, with Rollie Fingers 
winning both awards in 1981, and Robin Yount winning the MVP and Pete Vuckovich 
winning the Cy Young in 1982. The Brewers were in contention to repeat 
in 1983, but the team fell on a rough September to finish in 4th place 
with an 87–75 record, their last winning season until 1987. Part of the 
reason for the Brewers' fall in 1983 was the absence of three main parts 
of their pennant-winning club the year before. Rollie Fingers was lost 
for the whole season with a torn muscle in his throwing arm, beloved slugger 
Gorman Thomas struggled badly offensively and was traded to the Cleveland 
Indians, and their ace, Pete Vuckovich, was revealed to have had a torn 
rotator cuff that had been plaguing him since 1981 and only pitched in 
5 games in 1983. Two milestones were reached by Brewers players in 1983, 
however, when Don Sutton got his 3,000th career strikeout and Ted Simmons 
got his 2,000th career hit. Harvey Kuenn resigned as manager after the 
season. Following their two playoff years, the club quickly retreated to 
the bottom of the standings, never finishing higher than fifth (out of 
seven) in their division from 1983 to 1986. Hope was restored in 1987 when, 
guided by rookie manager Tom Trebelhorn, the team began the year with a 
13-game winning streak. Unfortunately, they followed that hot start with 
a 12-game skid in May. But "Team Streak" eventually posted a strong third-place 
finish. Highlights of the year included Paul Molitor's 39-game hitting 
streak and what is still the only no-hitter in team history, pitched by 
Juan Nieves on April 15. On that day, Nieves became the first (and so far, 
only) Brewer and first Puerto Rican-born Major Leaguer to pitch a no-hitter, 
defeating the Baltimore Orioles 7–0 at Memorial Stadium. The final out 
came on a climactic diving catch in right-center field by Robin Yount of 
a line drive hit by Eddie Murray. The game also was the first time the 
Orioles were no-hit at Memorial Stadium. Yount later recalled at a Brewers 
banquet that he did not have to dive to catch the line drive hit by Murray 
but figured ending the game with a diving catch would be the icing on the 
cake for Nieves' no-hitter. In 1988 the team had another strong season, 
finishing only two games out of first (albeit with a lesser record than 
the previous year) in a close playoff race with four other clubs. Following 
this year, the team slipped, posting mediocre records from 1989 through 
1991, after which Trebelhorn was fired. In 1992, reminiscent of the resurgence 
which greeted Trebelhorn's arrival in 1987, the Brewers rallied behind 
the leadership of rookie manager Phil Garner and posted their best record 
since their World Series year in 1982, finishing the season 92–70 and in 
second place, four games behind that year's eventual World Champion Toronto 
Blue Jays. As a bit of a shocker for Brewers fans, who were used to the 
team sporting several power hitters, the Brewers in 1992 instead led the 
American League with 256 stolen bases, while hitting only 82 home runs, 
with only two players (Greg Vaughn and Paul Molitor) hitting more than 
12 for the year. Despite not making the playoffs, the Brewers had some 
other memorable moments, as Pat Listach hit .290 and stole 54 bases while 
winning the AL Rookie of the Year award, while Robin Yount got his 3000th 
career hit. 1992 proved to be the end of an era for the Brewers, as teammates 
Robin Yount, Paul Molitor, and Jim Gantner, who had been together since 
1978 would go their separate ways, as Molitor left the Brewers for the 
Toronto Blue Jays, Gantner retired, and Yount would only last one more 
season before retiring in 1993. Hope of additional pennant races was quickly 
dashed, as the club plummeted to the bottom of the standings in 1993, finishing 
an abysmal 26 games out of first. Since 1992, highlights were few and far 
between as the franchise failed to produce a winning season, having not 
fielded a competitive team because of a combination of bad management and 
financial constraints that limit the team relative to the resources available 
to other, larger-market clubs. As the 1990s came to a close, the Brewers 
were on their way to becoming a perennial doormat. A lack of good management 
and an aging ballpark in old County Stadium, were both becoming stark problems 
for the Brewers and many fans began to wonder if the Brewers would ever 
become contenders again. In 1994, Major League Baseball adopted a new, 
expanded playoff system. This change would necessitate a restructuring 
of each league from two divisions into three. The Brewers were transferred 
from the old AL East division to the newly created AL Central. (Due to 
the baseball strike, however, the new-look playoffs and World Series did 
not materialize that year.) In March 1995, two new franchises—the Arizona 
Diamondbacks and Tampa Bay Devil Rays—were awarded by Major League Baseball, 
to begin play in 1998. It was decided to add one new team to each league. 
At the time, however, MLB did not want to have an odd number of teams per 
league because they would either have to give teams many more off-days 
than in the past, or interleague play would have to be extended year-round, 
or both (14 years later however, another realignment would cause there 
to be an odd number of teams in each league with year round interleague 
play). In order for MLB officials to continue the existing schedule, where 
teams play almost every day and where interleague play is limited to a 
few days per year, both leagues would need to carry an even number of teams. 
The decision was made to have one existing club switch leagues.[1] This 
realignment was widely considered to have great financial benefit to the 
club moving.[citation needed] However, to avoid the appearance of a conflict 
of interest, Commissioner (then club owner) Bud Selig decided another team 
should have the first chance to switch leagues. The Kansas City Royals 
of the American League's Central Division were asked first, but they decided 
not to move over to the National League's Central Division.[2] The choice 
then fell to the Brewers, who, on November 6, 1997, elected to move to 
the National League's Central Division. At the same time, the Detroit Tigers 
agreed to move from the AL East to the AL Central (to replace Milwaukee).[2] 
The Tampa Bay Devil Rays joined the AL East and the Arizona Diamondbacks 
joined the NL West. Had the Brewers elected not to move to the National 
League, the Minnesota Twins would have been offered the opportunity next.[3] 
Milwaukee had formerly been a National League town, having been the home 
of the Braves for 13 seasons (1953–65). With the Brewers having joined 
the National League, it was now necessary for their pitchers to take batting 
practice, because the NL has a no DH rule. As early as 1993, Brewers owner 
Bud Selig had talked of a new ballpark for the Brewers to replace Milwaukee 
County Stadium, which had become heavily outdated and antiquated and didn't 
even have luxury suites. By 1996, the club was set to build a new ballpark 
near the site of County Stadium, which would have a retractable roof to 
counter the unpredictable Wisconsin weather in the spring and autumn. It 
also helped to bring more fans and their families from all around Wisconsin 
to come to games with a practical guarantee of no rain-outs, bring in more 
potential revenue for the club. Miller Park was opened in 2001, built to 
replace Milwaukee County Stadium. The stadium was built with $310 million 
of public funds, drawing some controversy, and is the only sporting facility 
to have a fan-shaped retractable roof. Miller Park has a seating capacity 
of seating 41,900 and with standing room 43,000, which is 10,000 fewer 
seats than County Stadium. The park was to have opened a year earlier, 
but an accident during its construction, which resulted in the deaths of 
three workers, forced a year's delay and $50 million to $75 million in 
damage. On July 14, 1999, the three men lost their lives when the Lampson 
"Big Blue" crane, one of the largest in the world, collapsed while trying 
to lift a 400-ton right field roof panel. A statue commemorating the men 
now stands between the home plate entrance to Miller Park and Helfaer Field. 
The Brewers made renovations to Miller Park before the 2006 campaign, adding 
both LED scoreboards from Daktronics, a company in Brookings, South Dakota, 
in left field and on the second-tier of the stadium, as well as a picnic 
area in right field, shortening the distance of the right-field fence.[4] 
The picnic area was an immediate hit and sold out for the season before 
the year began. Miller Park also features another fan favorite, Klement's 
Racing Sausages, in a race of five costumed mascots, held before the bottom 
of the sixth inning. While the Brewers' new park was a hit, the club itself 
was not successful playing in it, as the Brewers finished the season even 
worse than their previous seasons, going 68–94 in their first season at 
Miller Park. The Brewers finished 2002 even worse, finishing with a dismal 
56–106 record, 41 games out of first place, the worst record in franchise 
history. In 2003, the Brewers hired Doug Melvin as General Manager, who 
in turn brought in Ned Yost, coach with the Atlanta Braves and a former 
member of the 1982 American League Champion Brewers, as manager. Though 
the Brewers only went 68–94 in 2003, the Brewers did raise hopes with a 
winning record in August during the season. On January 16, 2004, Selig 
announced that his ownership group was putting the team up for sale, to 
the great relief of many fans who were unhappy with the team's lackluster 
performance and poor management by his daughter, Wendy Selig-Prieb, over 
the previous decade. In September 2004, the Brewers announced they had 
reached a verbal agreement with Los Angeles investment banker Mark Attanasio 
to purchase the team for a reported US$223 million. The sale to Attanasio 
was completed on January 13, 2005, at Major League Baseball's quarterly 
owners meeting. Other members of Attanasio's ownership group include private 
equity investor John Canning, Jr., David Uihlein, Harris Turer and Stephen 
Marcus, all of whom were involved with the previous ownership group led 
by Major League Baseball commissioner Bud Selig.[5] Since taking over the 
franchise, Attanasio has worked hard to build bridges with Milwaukee baseball 
fans, including giving away every seat to the final home game of 2005 free 
of charge and bringing back the classic "ball and glove" logo of the club's 
glory days on "Retro Friday" home games, during which they also wear versions 
of the team's old pinstriped uniforms. The Brewers caused a stir in the 
first half of the 2004 season, when the team had a winning record in the 
first half of the season, even briefly being in 1st place in the NL Central. 
However, lack of a productive offense doomed the Brewers and the club sunk 
back to last place, finishing the season 67–94. The Brewers did have some 
bright moments during the season with pitcher Ben Sheets striking out 18 
Atlanta Braves in one game and the Brewers coming back from a 9-run deficit 
to beat the Cincinnati Reds. After the 2004 season, with Mark Attanasio 
now in control of the franchise, the Brewers were finally able to spend 
some money on free agents. The Brewers first significant free-agent signing 
in many years was veteran catcher Damian Miller, a Wisconsin native, and 
to address a need for better run production, the Brewers traded speedy 
outfielder Scott Podsednik and relief pitcher Luis Vizcaíno to the Chicago 
White Sox in exchange for slugging outfielder Carlos Lee. The arrival of 
Lee gave Brewer fans even higher hopes that better seasons were on the 
way for the Brewers. In 2005, under Attanasio's ownership, the team finished 
81–81 to secure its first non-losing record since 1992. True to form, Carlos 
Lee provided the Brewers with much needed run support, hitting 32 home 
runs and driving in 112. Starting pitcher Chris Capuano also had a stellar 
season, going 18–12 with a 3.99 ERA, the most wins by a Brewer pitcher 
since Pete Vuckovich won 18 games in 1982. With a solid base of young talent 
assembled over the past five years, including Prince Fielder, Rickie Weeks, 
J. J. Hardy and Corey Hart, the Brewers showed renewed competitiveness. 
Further encouraging this sentiment, the Brewers had hired former stars 
Yount (bench coach; resigned in November 2006) and Dale Sveum (third base 
coach), both very popular players for the Brewers in the '80s. In 2006, 
the Brewers' play disappointed fans, players, and management. They began 
the season 5–1 and had a 14–11 record at the end of April. On Mother's 
Day Bill Hall hit a walk off home run with his mother in the stands, a 
play that was shown on ESPN throughout the summer. However, soon starters 
JJ Hardy, Rickie Weeks, and Corey Koskie were lost to injuries, and the 
Brewers were forced to trade for veteran infielders David Bell and Tony 
Graffanino. They also suffered setbacks when losing starting pitchers Ben 
Sheets and Tomo Ohka for a substantial amount of time, forcing Triple A 
starters Ben Hendrickson, Dana Eveland, Carlos Villanueva, and Zach Jackson 
into starting roles at different points in the year. Shortly before the 
All Star break the Brewers climbed to one game above .500, but then lost 
their next three to the Chicago Cubs and would never return to .500. After 
the All Star break closer Derrick Turnbow blew four straight save opportunities. 
This led to the Brewers being far enough down in the standings that management 
decided to trade free agent-to-be Carlos Lee to the Texas Rangers for closer 
Francisco Cordero, outfielder Kevin Mench, and two minor league prospects. 
Cordero replaced Turnbow as the Brewers closer and had immediate success, 
converting his first 13 save opportunities. On August 24 the Brewers completed 
a sweep of the Colorado Rockies to climb to less than five games out in 
both the NL Central Division and NL Wild Card races, but then Milwaukee 
went on a 10-game losing streak that ended any postseason hope. The Brewers 
did rebound and play well in September including a four-game sweep of San 
Francisco, but it was too little too late. The Brewers ended the season 
with a 75–87 record. At the end of the season, Attanasio stated that he 
and General Manager Doug Melvin would have to make some decisions about 
returning players for the 2007 season. With young players waiting in the 
minor leagues, during the off-season the key additions were starting pitcher 
and 2006 NLCS MVP Jeff Suppan, starter Claudio Vargas, reliever Greg Aquino, 
catcher Johnny Estrada, and returning Brewer Craig Counsell. The Brewers 
parted ways with 2006 starters Doug Davis and Tomo Ohka, as well as fan 
favorite Jeff Cirillo, who wanted more playing time with another team. 
Before the 2007 season, the buzz surrounding the Brewers greatly increased. 
They were dubbed a "sleeper team" and "contenders in the NL" by numerous 
sports analysts and magazines. ESPN's Peter Gammons and Dan Patrick both 
picked The Brewers to beat out the defending champion Cardinals and re-vamped 
Chicago Cubs to win the NL Central. To celebrate the successful 1982 Milwaukee 
Brewers team, the franchise decided to have the 2007 season be named as 
the "25th Anniversary of '82", with more fan giveaways than any other Major 
League Baseball team except the Pittsburgh Pirates, and more discounts 
and deals than any other time in Brewers' history. ESPN.com's lead story 
on August 29 stated: ".... Then there are the Brewers. The strange, impossible-to-figure-out 
Brewers. They once had the best record in the majors, were 14 games over 
.500 twice, and led the division by as many as 8½ games on June 23. Since 
then, and there's no nice way of saying it; they've reeked.".[6] The Brewers 
cast this negativity to the side, and rebounded in September. Despite poor 
performances from the usually steady Chris Capuano and more nagging injuries 
to Ben Sheets, the Brewers found themselves in a heated pennant race with 
Chicago's North Siders. The team's playoff drive took a hit late in the 
year, however, losing three of four games in a crucial series in Atlanta, 
dropping the Brewers to a season-high 3.5 games out of first. The Brewers 
won the first two games of their final homestand of the season to pull 
within two games of the Cubs, but faced a near impossible task with the 
club's elimination number down to only three and the wild card leading 
Padres coming to town. The club played well, but the Cubs clinched on the 
final Friday of the season. On September 29 the Brewers beat Padres 4–3 
in extra innings to secure a winning season. The game was tied in the ninth 
inning by a triple by Tony Gwynn, Jr. in a highlight reel play that was 
repeated often during the 2007 post season. That win, and the win the next 
day, by the Brewers kept the Padres from advancing to the playoffs. The 
irony, of course, being that Gwynn's father was arguably the most popular 
Padre of all-time, and Tony Gwynn, Jr. would later be traded to the Padres 
in 2009. Milwaukee finished at a respectable 83–79, only two games behind 
Chicago, the club's best finish since 1992. First baseman Prince Fielder 
made history in 2007, becoming the first Brewer and the youngest player 
ever to reach the 50 home run mark in a single season. For his effort, 
he finished third in the 2007 National League Most Valuable Player voting, 
garnering 284 total points including 5 first place votes. Fielder was also 
awarded the Hank Aaron Award for reaching the amazing single year record. 
Third baseman Ryan Braun was also rewarded for his historic season by being 
named 2007 NL Rookie of the Year. The Brewers came into 2008 with hopes 
of ending the team's 26-year playoff drought, adding several veterans to 
the team in outfielder Mike Cameron and catcher Jason Kendall, as well 
as relief pitchers Éric Gagné and Salomón Torres. The Brewers started April 
on a solid winning note, but suffered two big blows in their pitching rotation 
when Dave Bush was demoted to AAA Nashville, and Yovani Gallardo suffered 
a potential season ending knee injury. The team dropped below .500 by the 
middle of May, capped off by a sweep from the Boston Red Sox. The Brewers 
rebounded in June as Salomón Torres took over as closer, becoming a big 
success, and soon climbed back into contention. As June came to a close, 
the Brewers made their biggest move for playoff contention as they traded 
4 prospects, most notably Matt LaPorta, to the Cleveland Indians for CC 
Sabathia. General Manager Doug Melvin summed up the trade by saying, "We 
are going for it." The Brewers came into the All-Star break with a 52–43 
record, still third behind the Cubs and Cardinals. Ben Sheets was named 
starting pitcher for the National League in the All-Star game, and Ryan 
Braun also started at left field. Corey Hart was named to the team in the 
Final Vote. The Brewers came out of the All-Star break with a bang as they 
won their first seven games back, all of them on the road, sweeping first 
the Giants and then the Cardinals, taking over first place in the Wild 
Card standings. The Brewers came into the end of July still in the hunt 
for the division, but the front running Cubs swept the Brewers in a four-game 
set at Miller Park. While the Brewers were still holding on to the Wild 
Card lead, the division was never seriously challenged for the remainder 
of the year. The Brewers came off the sweep from the Cubs with an amazing 
August, winning 20 of 28 games in the month. Sabathia made history by becoming 
the first pitcher in over 90 years to win his first 9 games after being 
traded mid-season. With a steady five game lead for the Wild Card, the 
hope of a playoff spot seemed secured, but the Brewers struggled in September, 
first getting swept by the New York Mets, and then just over a week later, 
getting swept in four games by the Philadelphia Phillies, losing their 
lead in the Wild Card. Feeling a change was needed, the Brewers fired manager 
Ned Yost with just 12 games left in the season, replacing him with Brewers 
third base coach Dale Sveum. Sveum named Garth Iorg as his replacement 
as third base coach, and made Robin Yount the new bench coach, replacing 
Ted Simmons. With the final 6x games at home, the Brewers were still in 
the hunt for the Wild Card behind the New York Mets. They first swept the 
Pittsburgh Pirates, thanks to walk-off home runs by Prince Fielder and 
Ryan Braun, tying the New York Mets for the Wild Card lead with 3 games 
to go against the NL Central division champion Chicago Cubs. The Brewers 
took the first game thanks to a pinch-hit home run by Rickie Weeks and 
stellar relief pitching by Seth McClung. The Cubs took the second game, 
with the Wild Card race still in a dead tie. CC Sabathia was called to 
pitch his third game in a week, and was stellar, pitching a complete game, 
while Ryan Braun hit possibly the biggest home run in club history with 
a 2-run shot in the 8th inning to break a 1–1 tie. The Brewers won 3–1 
while the New York Mets lost to the Florida Marlins 4–2, sealing the Brewers 
the Wild Card spot. The Brewers finished the 2008 season one game ahead 
of the New York Mets in the wild card race with a final record of 90–72, 
and faced the Philadelphia Phillies in the NLDS. This was the first time 
the Brewers reached the playoffs since 1982. The Brewers played their first 
postseason game in 26 years on October 1. Pitcher Yovani Gallardo made 
his first postseason start and only his second start since coming off the 
disabled list in late September. The Brewers lost the first game of the 
NLDS 3–1 on a dominant performance by Phillies pitcher Cole Hamels. Hamels 
allowed only two hits and struck out nine Brewers batters in eight shutout 
innings. The Brewers mounted a comeback in the 9th inning as closer Brad 
Lidge allowed two hits, a walk, and a run to score. However, Brewers right 
fielder Corey Hart struck out with runners on second and third to end the 
game. The Brewers hosted Game 3, which was the first playoff game ever 
hosted at Miller Park and the first in Milwaukee since Game 5 of the 1982 
World Series. The Brewers won, but were eliminated in Game 4, ending the 
Brewers season while the Phillies went on to win the World Series. During 
the off-season, the Brewers lost C.C. Sabathia when he filed for free agency 
and signed a lucrative deal with the New York Yankees. Despite the loss 
of a starting pitcher in Sabathia, the Brewers were able to sign all-time 
save leader Trevor Hoffman. The Brewers were not able to build on their 
success from the year prior falling below .500 but were witness to Prince 
Fielder setting the all-time franchise record for RBI. The Brewers attempted 
to shore up their starting pitching with the signing of free agent Doug 
Davis, but the Brewers still struggled. After just one month, the Brewers 
released Jeff Suppan, Doug Davis got injured, and Trevor Hoffman struggled 
to get saves. The only bright spots of the season was the Brewers' hitting. 
The Brewers were the only team in baseball to have three players with 100+ 
RBIs in Ryan Braun, Casey McGehee, and Corey Hart. The Brewers lost 9 games 
in a row in May and never fully recovered, finishing the season 77–85, 
which was good for 3rd place in the National League Central division, behind 
the Cincinnati Reds and the St. Louis Cardinals. The only other bright 
spots of the season was Trevor Hoffman getting his 600th career save and 
the emergence of new closer John Axford. After the season, the Brewers 
chose not to renew the contract of manager Ken Macha. In October, just 
days after the World Series, the Brewers hired Ron Roenicke, bench coach 
of the Los Angeles Angels, to be the Brewers' new manager. With the trades 
for Shaun Marcum and Zack Greinke, the Brewers were tabbed by many experts 
as favorites to not only win the NL Central Division, but also contenders 
for the National League pennant. The Brewers did suffer some early losses 
in spring training, as Zack Greinke was lost to a rib injury that would 
keep him out for a month, and Corey Hart was out for the first half of 
April with a hamstring injury, which caused the Brewers to make a last-minute 
trade at the end of spring training for Washington Nationals outfielder 
Nyjer Morgan. The Brewers struggled during the first month of the season, 
losing their first 4 games of the season and fell as far down as to 5th 
place in the NL Central Division, but the Brewers rebounded starting at 
the end of May and throughout June and early July. By the All-Star Break, 
the Brewers were in 2nd place in the division, behind Pittsburgh and St. 
Louis. To address some needed bullpen depth, the Brewers made a shocking 
trade just hours after the All-Star Game, trading two Class-A prospects 
to the New York Mets for ace reliever Francisco Rodriguez, who immediately 
became the Brewers set-up reliever for closer John Axford. The Brewers 
went on a hot winning stretch through the month of August and by the beginning 
of September were 10 1/2 games ahead of St. Louis for the NL Central lead. 
Though the Brewers scuffled some in September, the Brewers clinched the 
division on September 26, beating the Florida Marlins 4-1. The Brewers 
finished the season with a 96-66 record, the best record in franchise history. 
Along with their team accomplishments, the Brewers had many individual 
achievements from their players. Ryan Braun finished the season with 33 
homers and 33 steals while finishing second in the National League in batting 
average, hitting .332 while Prince Fielder finished second in the league 
in both home runs and RBIs, hitting 38 home runs while driving in 120. 
The Brewers starting pitching was also drastically better than 2010. Each 
of the Brewers 5 regular starters had 10-plus wins during the regular season. 
Yovani Gallardo won 17 games, the most by a Brewer since 2005, Zack Greinke 
won 16 games despite missing one month, both Shawn Marcum and Randy Wolf 
won 13 games, and number five starter Chris Narveson won 11 games. It was 
the first time since 1982 that the Brewers had five pitchers with 10 or 
more wins in a season. The Brewers also used fewer starting pitchers than 
any team in baseball, using only six starting pitchers, with Marco Estrada 
filling in for 7 games when Greinke and later Narveson were out with injuries. 
The Brewers faced the NL West Champion Arizona Diamondbacks in the NLDS 
and won the first two games at Miller Park, with Yovani Gallardo pitching 
8 stellar innings in a 4-1 Game 1 win. The Diamondbacks won games 3 and 
4 in Arizona, setting up a deciding Game 5 back in Miller Park. The Brewers 
had a 2-1 lead going into the 9th inning when closer John Axford blew his 
first save since April, giving up the lead. The Brewers went on to win 
the game and the series in the 10th inning on a base hit by Nyjer Morgan 
driving in Carlos Gomez for the winning run. With this win, they are currently 
the only team in modern times to win a divisional series in both the American 
and National Leagues. The Brewers faced their divisional foe and the NL 
Wild Card winner, the St. Louis Cardinals, who had upset the favored Philadelphia 
Phillies in the NLDS. Many Brewer fans[who?] welcomed facing the Cardinals 
with the National League pennant at stake, with the Brewers and Cardinals 
having a growing rivalry, and also a chance for the Brewers to avenge their 
1982 World Series defeat, which was at the hands of the Cardinals. The 
two teams split the first two games at Miller Park, then the Cardinals 
took two out of 3 games at Busch Stadium and won Game 6 to win the National 
League pennant and eventually the World Series against the Texas Rangers. 
Probably the biggest reason for the Brewers defeat[according to whom?] 
was the downfall of their starting pitching. In their 11 postseason games, 
the Brewers starting pitchers only had three quality starts, with Yovani 
Gallardo accounting for two of them, both of which were in the NLDS. The 
other quality start was Randy Wolf in Game 4 of the NLCS. In the offseason, 
the Brewers would lose many of their spot players that had helped them 
during the season, such as Mark Kotsay, Jerry Hairston, Jr., and Craig 
Counsell but their most notable loss was that of Prince Fielder, who would 
leave the team via free agency after having been a part of the Brewers 
organization for almost a decade. Fielder would end up signing with the 
Detroit Tigers. The Brewers would make two significant free agent signings 
during the off-season, signing shortstop Alex Gonzalez and third baseman 
Aramis Ramierez to improve the left side of the Brewers infield. The Brewers 
would also sign Japanese outfielder Norichika Aoki to bring some needed 
outfield depth. The biggest news of all during the off-season, though, 
was the issue of the reigning NL MVP Ryan Braun apparently testing positive 
for PED's and facing a possible 50-game suspension. Braun would appeal 
the suspension and won on the basis that the test was not processed properly, 
making him the first player to win an appeal against a suspension regarding 
illegal substances. Despite the offseason losses and controversies, the 
Brewers fans still looked forward to the 2012 season with great optimism, 
as the Brewers, by the end of February, had sold over 1.5 million tickets, 
the most before the month of March. However, the Brewers started the season 
poorly, with a 40-45 record by the All-Star break.[7] Poor bullpen play 
put the team even further out of contention by the end of July, which caused 
the Brewers to trade ace pitcher Zack Greinke to the Los Angeles Angels 
of Anaheim in exchange for top minor league shortstop Jean Segura and two 
minor league relief pitchers. Suddenly, in mid-August, the Brewers went 
on a run to put themselves back in postseason contention. The bullpen started 
to turn itself around and the team was able to get production from several 
minor league call-ups, like Mike Fiers, Martin Maldonado, Jeff Bianchi, 
and Wily Peralta. Combined with stellar hitting of Ryan Braun, Aramis Ramírez, 
Corey Hart, and Jonathan Lucroy, the Brewers, from August 16 to September 
23, won 26 of 35 games. However, the Brewers were eliminated from postseason 
contention on September 30, a 7-0 loss to the Houston Astros. The Brewers 
still finished with a winning record in 2012, going 83-79, finishing in 
3rd place in the NL Central behind Cincinnati and St. Louis. The Brewers 
hoped to become contenders again in 2013, and tried to shore up their starting 
pitching with the signing of free-agent Kyle Lohse, but the Brewers, after 
starting off well with a 14-11 record in April, fell flat with a 6-22 mark 
in May, and never regained momentum, finishing the season 74-88. Further 
compounding the Brewers' fall during the season were nagging injuries to 
Aramis Ramírez, and also Ryan Braun's supposed involvement with the Biogensis 
scandal, which resulted in Braun being suspended for the final 60 games 
of the regular season after he admitted to taking PEDs during the 2011 
playoffs. Major League Baseball didn't force Braun to surrender his 2011 
National League MVP award. On the field, the Brewers did have several individual 
performances that gave fans some hope for the coming seasons. Shortstop 
Jean Segura finished second in the National League with 44 stolen bases, 
and Carlos Gomez had a breakout season, batting .284 with 24 home runs, 
40 stolen bases, and became the first Brewer since 1982 to win a Gold Glove 
award for his defensive play, and catcher Jonathan Lucroy had a stellar 
offensive season, hitting 18 home runs and driving in 82 RBIs. Few experts 
considered the Brewers as contenders in the NL Central for 2014, even after 
the Brewers signed another free-agent starting pitcher in Matt Garza; most 
expected the Brewers to finish no better than 4th in the division. The 
team also improved their bullpen with resigning Francisco Rodriguez as 
closer, trading outfielder Nori Aoki to the Kansas City Royals in exchange 
for a young pitcher in Will Smith, and signing veteran slugging first baseman 
Mark Reynolds. The Brewers started the season hot, going 20-7 in April, 
much to the surprise of many. The Brewers have showed much improved starting 
pitching, with a steady rotation in Yovani Gallardo, Kyle Lohse, Matt Garza, 
Wily Peralta, and Marco Estrada. In addition, Francisco Rodriguez regained 
his old form, successfully closing out his first 17 saves of the season, 
and Will Smith became virtually untouchable, sporting a 0.88 ERA in the 
first two months of the season. Though the Brewers showed some struggles 
in the months of May and July, the team continued to stay on top of the 
standings as one of the better teams in the National League, helped by 
a 18-10 record in June. By mid September, however, they had lost their 
division lead to the St. Louis Cardinals and were trailing behind the Pittsburgh 
Pirates in the National League Wild Card race. The Brewers were in first 
place in the division from April 5 to September 1, but ultimately finished 
third in the division after a sub-.500 September, barely getting over .500 
with an 82-80 record.[8] A couple of standout performers for the Brewers 
came from Jonathon Lucroy, who finished with a .301 batting average and 
led the National League with 53 doubles and set a new Major League record 
for doubles by a catcher in a season with 48. Second-year pitcher Wily 
Peralta had a 17-11 record, while Kyle Lohse had a 13-9 record with 2 complete 
game shutouts. The offseason for the Brewers was relatively quiet, with 
only a couple of trades made where the Brewers parted with two starting 
pitchers. Marco Estrada was traded to the Toronto Blue Jays for first baseman 
Adam Lind,[9] and Yovani Gallardo, after 8 seasons with the Brewers and 
becoming the franchise's all-time strikeout leader, was traded to the Texas 
Rangers.[10] During the offseason, Ryan Braun, who had his worst season 
ever during 2014 (.266 avg., 19 HR, and 81 RBI's), had surgery on his right 
thumb,[11] which had bothered him all during the season and was thought 
to be the reason behind his dismal numbers. On the field, the Brewers' 
season went south almost immediately, going 5-17 in the month of April. 
On May 4, manager Ron Roenicke was fired and Craig Counsell was named interim 
manager, staying manager for the Brewers through the rest of the season, 
as the team finished 68-94. The Brewers began a mode of rebuilding the 
team, with Doug Melvin stepping down as general manager and being replaced 
with Houston Astros assistant GM, David Stearns. Stearns kept interim manager 
Craig Counsell, making him the Brewers full-time manager, and traded away 
over half of the Brewers' 40-man roster from 2015 before the 2016 season 
came to a close. The Brewers finished the 2016 season with a 73-89 record, 
but had a 41-40 record at home, and had two players lead the National League 
in major offensive categories, with infielder Jonathan Villar leading the 
NL, and all of Major League Baseball, with 62 stolen bases, and first baseman 
Chris Carter tied for the NL lead in home runs, with 41. Ryan Braun also 
had a rebound season, with a .305 batting average, 30 home runs, 91 RBIs,
