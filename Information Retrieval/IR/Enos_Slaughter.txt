Enos Bradsher Slaughter (April 27, 1916 – August 12, 2002), nicknamed "Country", 
was an American Major League Baseball (MLB) right fielder. He played for 
19-seasons on four major league teams from 1938–1942 and 1946–1959. He 
is noted primarily for his playing for the St. Louis Cardinals and is best 
known for scoring the winning run in Game Seven of the 1946 World Series. 
A ten time All-Star, he has been elected to both the National Baseball 
Hall of Fame and the St. Louis Cardinals Hall of Fame. Slaughter was born 
in Roxboro, North Carolina, where he earned the nickname "Country",[1] 
and joined the St. Louis Cardinals in 1938 before being traded to the New 
York Yankees in 1954. When Slaughter was a minor leaguer in Columbus, Georgia, 
he went running towards the dugout from his position in the outfield, slowed 
down near the infield, and began walking the rest of the way. Manager Eddie 
Dyer told him, "Son, if you're tired, we'll try to get you some help". 
During the remainder of his major-league career, Slaughter ran everywhere 
he went on a baseball field.[2] In 1937, he had 245 hits and 147 runs scored 
for Columbus.[3] Slaughter batted left-handed and threw right-handed. He 
was renowned for his smooth swing that made him a reliable "contact" hitter. 
Slaughter had 2,383 hits in his major-league career, including 169 home 
runs, and 1,304 RBIs in 2,380 games.[4] Slaughter played 19 seasons with 
the Cardinals, Yankees, Kansas City Athletics, and Milwaukee Braves. During 
that period, he was a 10-time All-Star and played in five World Series. 
His 1,820 games played ranks fourth in Cardinals' history behind Ozzie 
Smith, Lou Brock, and Stan Musial. He presently ranks second in RBIs with 
1,148; fifth in ABs with 6,775; and sixth in doubles with 366. Immediately 
upon return from his military service in 1946, he led the National League 
with 130 RBI and led the Cardinals to a World Series win over the Boston 
Red Sox. In the decisive seventh game of that series, Slaughter, running 
with the pitch, made a famous "Mad Dash" for home from first base on Harry 
Walker's hit in the eighth inning, scoring the winning run after a delayed 
relay throw by the Red Sox' Johnny Pesky. The hit was ruled a double, though 
most observers felt it should have been ruled a single, as only the throw 
home allowed Walker to advance to second base. This play was named #10 
on the Sporting News list of Baseball's 25 Greatest Moments in 1999.[5] 
Slaughter was known for his hustle, especially for running hard to first 
base on walks, a habit later imitated by Pete Rose and David Eckstein. 
Slaughter was allegedly one of the leaders of racial taunting against the 
first black major league player, Jackie Robinson, and he had injured Robinson 
during a game by inflicting a seven-inch gash from his shoe spikes on Robinson's 
leg. Slaughter had denied that he had any animosity towards Robinson, claiming 
that such allegations had been made against him because he was "a Southern 
boy", and that the injury suffered by Robinson had been typical of Slaughter's 
rough playing style.[6] Slaughter retired from major league baseball in 
1959. He was a player-manager in 1960 for a minor league team in Houston 
and for Raleigh in 1961. Slaughter coached baseball for Duke University 
from 1971 to 1977.[7] Enos Slaughter is a cousin of Henry Slaughter, southern 
gospel musician. Slaughter died at age 86, on August 12, 2002, after battling 
non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. He was scheduled for an autograph appearance in 
St. Louis, Missouri before he died.[8] Slaughter was elected to the Baseball 
Hall of Fame in 1985.[9] His jersey number 9 was retired by the Cardinals 
on September 6, 1996. The Cardinals dedicated a statue depicting his famous 
Mad Dash in 1999.[10] Slaughter was a fixture at statue dedications at 
Busch Stadium II for other Cardinal Hall of Famers during the last years 
of his life. In January, 2014, the Cardinals announced Slaughter among 
22 former players and personnel to be inducted into the St. Louis Cardinals
