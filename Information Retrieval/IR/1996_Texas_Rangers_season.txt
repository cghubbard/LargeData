The Texas Rangers 1996 season involved the Rangers finishing 1st in the 
American League west with a record of 90 wins and 72 losses. It would be 
the first post-season appearance for the Rangers in franchise history. 
The Rangers would win their first post-season game at Yankee Stadium against 
the New York Yankees, but would lose the last three games to lose the division 
series. The one post-season win would be the club's only post-season success 
until 2010. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14]
