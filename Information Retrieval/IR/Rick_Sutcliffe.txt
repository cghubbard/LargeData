Richard Lee "Rick" Sutcliffe (born June 21, 1956), nicknamed "The Red Baron" 
for his red hair and beard, is a former Major League Baseball starting 
pitcher and current broadcaster. A right-hander, Sutcliffe was a three-time 
All-Star. He won the National League Rookie of the Year award in 1979 and 
the National League Cy Young Award in 1984. Sutcliffe's first full season 
in the majors was 1979.[1] He won 17 games for the Los Angeles Dodgers 
and was the first of four consecutive Rookies of the Year for the Dodgers 
from 1979–1982 (Steve Howe, Fernando Valenzuela, and Steve Sax were the 
others).[1][2] The Dodgers traded Sutcliffe to the Cleveland Indians for 
Jorge Orta, a journeyman outfielder.[3] Sutcliffe won 31 games over the 
course of the next two seasons for Cleveland and led the American League 
in earned run average in 1982. In mid-1984, Cleveland traded a struggling 
Sutcliffe to the Chicago Cubs for Mel Hall and Joe Carter. Sutcliffe rebounded 
and won 16 games for the Cubs while losing only one, helping them to the 
division championship. On October 2, 1984, he started the first game of 
the NLCS against the San Diego Padres, giving up two hits and no runs, 
not only gaining the victory, but also hitting a home run in the third 
inning.[4] Five days later, Sutcliffe pitched the final game of the series 
at Jack Murphy Stadium, but posted the loss after giving up four runs in 
the seventh inning.[5] Rick won the Cy Young Award with a unanimous vote, 
beating out Dwight Gooden and Bruce Sutter.[6] He also finished fourth 
in the league MVP voting. When he re-signed with the Cubs as a free agent 
the following year, his contract briefly made him the highest-paid pitcher 
in baseball. Sutcliffe started the 1985 season strong, going 5-3 in his 
first eight starts, including two complete game shutouts. A hamstring pull 
on May 19, limited his starts for the year, followed by a series of arm 
injuries limited Sutcliffe's effectiveness over the next two seasons. In 
1987, he bounced back to win 18 games and finished second in the league's 
Cy Young voting to Steve Bedrosian despite playing for a last-place Cubs 
team which also featured National League Most Valuable Player Andre Dawson. 
He also was presented 1987's Roberto Clemente Award, given annually to 
a Major League player who demonstrates sportsmanship and community involvement. 
On July 29, 1988 in Philadelphia, Rick achieved one of baseball's rarest 
feats, especially for a pitcher by stealing home plate during an 8-3 win 
over the Phillies, in which he also notched the victory. In 1989, Sutcliffe 
won 16 games and made his final All-Star appearance, where he was managed 
once again by Tommy Lasorda. He also helped the Cubs to another division 
title, but the Cubs lost to the San Francisco Giants in the playoffs.[citation

and 1991 seasons and the Cubs did not offer him a contract for the next 
season. Signing with the Baltimore Orioles, Sutcliffe went 16–15 and 10–10 
in 1992 and 1993, starting the first game at Oriole Park at Camden Yards. 
He wound up his career with the St. Louis Cardinals in 1994, going 6-4 
in an injury-plagued season. He retired with a career record of 171–139, 
with an ERA of 4.08. He holds the unique distinction of having won each 
of the following league awards, once each, and each in a different season: 
Rookie of the Year (1979), Cy Young Award (1984), ERA leader (1982), and 
wins leader (1987).[citation needed] After his retirement from baseball, 
Sutcliffe became a color commentator for the San Diego Padres on Channel 
4 San Diego (1997–2004), ESPN (1998–present) and DirecTV/MLB International 
(1997–2002 and since 2010, as well as a minor-league pitching coach in 
the San Diego Padres system for a couple of seasons. He also broadcasts 
the World Series and either the ALCS or NLCS for MLB International, where 
he is teamed with Gary Thorne. In previous years he has also appeared with 
Dave O'Brien. On March 13, 2008, Sutcliffe was diagnosed with "curable 
and maintainable" colon cancer. He underwent chemotherapy and radiation 
treatments in his hometown of Kansas City during the spring of 2008 and 
returned to work with ESPN on May 21, 2008. He continues to maintain a 
positive attitude and credits this to his faith in Jesus, strong family 
encouragement, incredible friends and immense support all over the world. 
As a result of his trials, he has shown great interest in motivational 
speaking about overcoming trials through your faith for groups such as
