The 1934 Detroit Tigers season was the 34th season for the Detroit Tigers 
since entering the American League in 1901. The Tigers won the American 
League pennant with a record of 101–53, the best winning percentage in 
team history. The team made its fourth World Series appearance, but lost 
the 1934 World Series to the St. Louis Cardinals 4 games to 3. The 1933 
Detroit Tigers finished fifth in the American League with a record of 75–79, 
25 games behind the Washington Senators. In mid-December 1933, team owner 
Frank Navin took two key steps to strengthen his team for the 1934 season. 
On December 12, 1933, the Tigers announced that they had purchased Mickey 
Cochrane from Connie Mack and the Philadelphia Athletics in exchange for 
Johnny Pasek and cash. The Tigers announced that they intended to use Cochrane 
as both a player and the team's manager. One day later, on December 13, 
1933, the Tigers' new manager Cochrane negotiated a trade that brought 
outfielder Goose Goslin to the Tigers in exchange for Johnny Stone.[1] 
The Tigers won the American League pennant with a record of 101–53, finishing 
seven games ahead of the New York Yankees, and compiling the best winning 
percentage in Detroit Tigers history (either before or after). They outscored 
their opponents 958 to 708 and also finished 1st in attendance with 919,161. 
The 1934 Tigers' winning percentage ranks as the best in team history, 
as follows: Hall of Famer Mickey Cochrane was hired as the team's manager 
and catcher in the off-season before the 1934 season started. Cochrane 
was acquired by the Tigers on December 12, 1933, from the Philadelphia 
Athletics for Johnny Pasek and $100,000.[2] Known as "Black Mike", Cochrane 
is considered one of the greatest catchers of all time. In 1934, he won 
the American League's Most Valuable Player award, batting .320 with a .428 
on-base percentage, 76 RBIs, and 32 doubles. He was the first catcher to 
win the American League MVP award[3] Aside from his contributions as a 
player, Cochrane was invaluable as a manager and leader. Second baseman 
Charlie Gehringer later said: "When Mickey was managing the Tigers from 
behind the plate I can't remember him ever fouling up anything. Seemed 
like he made snap judgments that always worked out well, especially in 
'34 and '35."[4] The Detroit infield in the mid-1930s was one of the best-hitting 
combinations in major league history. With Hank Greenberg at first, Gehringer 
at second, Billy Rogell at shortstop, and Marv Owen at third, the 1934 
Tigers infield collected 769 hits (214 by Gehringer, 201 by Greenberg, 
179 by Owen and 175 by Rogell), 462 RBIs (139 by Greenberg, 127 by Gehringer, 
100 by Rogell, and 96 by Owen), and 179 doubles (63 by Greenberg, 50 by 
Gehringer, 34 by Owen and 32 by Rogell). Three members of the 1934 Tigers 
infield (Gehringer, Owen and Rogell) played in all 154 games, and the fourth 
(Greenberg) played in 153. "Hammerin' Hank" Greenberg played his second 
major league season in 1934, hitting .339 with 118 runs and 201 hits. He 
led the league with 63 doubles, and he was third in the AL with a .600 
slugging percentage and 139 RBIs. Late in the 1934 season, he announced 
that he would not play on Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year. Fans grumbled, 
"Rosh Hashanah comes every year but the Tigers haven't won the pennant 
since 1909." Greenberg did considerable soul-searching, and discussed the 
matter with his rabbi; finally he relented and agreed to play on Rosh Hashanah, 
but stuck with his decision not to play on the Day of Atonement, Yom Kippur. 
Of the latter decision, Detroit Free Press columnist and poet Edgar A. 
Guest expressed the general opinion in a poem titled "Speaking of Greenberg", 
in which he used the Irish (and thus Catholic) names Murphy and Mulroney. 
The poem ends with the lines "We shall miss him on the infield and shall 
miss him at the bat / But he's true to his religion—and I honor him for 
that." The complete text of the poem is at the end of Greenberg's biography 
page at the website of the International Jewish Sports Hall of Fame. Charlie 
Gehringer had his best year to date in 1934, playing all 154 games. His 
.356 batting average and .450 on-base percentage were both 2nd best in 
the league. He led the league in runs scored with 134 and hits with 214. 
He was also among the league leaders in doubles with 50 (2nd in AL to his 
teammate Hank Greenberg) and RBIs with a career-high 127 (5th in AL). Gehringer 
finished 2nd in the AL MVP voting, just 2 points behind Detroit's player-manager, 
Mickey Cochrane. Known for his consistency as a hitter and fielder, Gehringer 
was given the nickname "The Mechanical Man" by Yankee pitcher Lefty Gomez. 
[3] Mickey Cochrane joked that "Charlie says `hello' on Opening Day, `goodbye' 
on closing day, and in between hits .350."[5] Shortstop Billy Rogell had 
the best offensive season of his career in 1934, hitting .296, driving 
in 100 runs and scoring 114. He spent much of the season batting fifth, 
frequently hitting after Cochrane, Gehringer, and Goslin and ahead of Greenberg, 
all four of whom were future Hall of Famers. Rogell, unbeknownst to the 
Cardinals or the media, played the 1934 World Series on a broken ankle. 
Despite the injury he was able to collect eight hits and drive in four 
runs over the seven game series. He also found his way into one of the 
most popular plays in World Series history. After driving in a run with 
a single to right in the fourth inning of Game 4, Spud Davis was replaced 
by Hall of Famer Dizzy Dean as a pinch runner at first base. Pepper Martin 
then stepped in and hit a ground ball to Gehringer at second. Gehringer 
turned and threw to Rogell who forced out Dean at second, and then fired 
the ball squarely into Dean's forehead on the relay throw to first. The 
ball ricocheted off Dean's head and landed over a hundred feet away in 
the outfield. Dean, always known for his quick wit and humorous nature, 
remarked after a visit to the hospital, "The doctors X-rayed my head and 
found nothing." Rogell would say of the play later, "If I’d have known 
his head was there, I would have thrown the ball harder." Marv Owen batted 
.317 with 96 RBIs in 1934 and finished 9th in the AL MVP voting. Owen is 
remembered for a famous incident in Game 7 of the 1934 World Series. Joe 
Medwick tripled in the 6th inning with the Cardinals ahead by 7 runs. He 
slid hard into Owen at third, knocking him down. The two fought, and Detroit 
fans pelted Medwick with fruit and garbage when he returned to left field. 
As the fan reaction escalated, Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis ordered 
Medwick removed from the game. Owen batted just .069 (2–29) in the 1934 
World Series. In the outfield, Hall of Famer Goose Goslin played in left 
field, Pete Fox was the primary right fielder, and the speedy Jo-Jo White 
and Gee Walker shared most of the responsibility for center field, with 
White playing in 92 games there (and 100 total games in the outfield). 
Pete Fox hit .285, hit 31 doubles, stole 25 bases, and scored 101 runs. 
Goose Goslin had a good year with a .305 batting average, 100 RBIs, 106 
runs scored, 187 hits, and 38 doubles. After leading the Washington Senators 
to American League pennants in 1924, 1925, and 1933, owner Clark Griffith 
traded Goslin to Detroit before the 1934 season. Griffith told Goose he 
simply couldn't afford to pay his salary. With stars Goslin, Gehringer 
and Greenberg, the 1934 Tigers became known as the "G-Men." Center fielder 
Jo-Jo White hit .313, scored 97 runs, had a .419 on-base percentage, and 
led the team with 28 stolen bases. White's real first name was Joyner, 
but he was called "Jo-Jo" because of the way he pronounced his native state 
of Georgia. Hank Greenberg, who was raised in the Bronx was rommates with 
White, and according to Greenberg the two of them "used to fight the Civil 
War every night." Greenberg recalled a game in which White stole home with 
Greenberg at bat: "He deprived me of a good chance at an RBI, and he did 
it deliberately because he knew it would burn me up."[6] Gee Walker, the 
Tigers fourth outfielder, played in 98 games (80 in the outfield). Known 
as "The Madman from Mississippi", Walker was a fiery competitor who became 
a fan favorite in Detroit. He hit .300 for the 1934 Tigers with 20 stolen 
bases. Though he was regularly among the league leaders in stolen bases, 
he also developed a reputation for being inattentive and overzealous on 
the basepaths. He once tried to steal a base while the batter was being 
given an intentional walk. During the 1934 World Series, he was picked 
off first while arguing with the Cardinals' bench. On June 30, 1934, Walker 
was picked off base twice in the same inning. After Hank Greenberg singled, 
Walker reached base on an error, but was caught off base when the catcher 
threw to first base. Greenberg tried to draw a throw by running to third 
base and was thrown out, with Walker taking second base. Moments later, 
with Walker standing six feet off the bag, the pitcher threw to second 
base and Walker was tagged out. Detroit manager Mickey Cochrane was so 
angered by Walker's inattention that he suspended Walker for 10 days and 
fined him $20. The pitching staff was led by starters Tommy Bridges, Schoolboy 
Rowe, Elden Auker, and Alvin Crowder, who joined the team in August. Tommy 
Bridges had a record of 22–11. In 35 starts, Bridges threw 23 complete 
games. He had 151 strikeouts, and a 3.67 ERA. In a nationwide poll, Bridges 
was named the No. 2 sports hero of 1935, behind Notre Dame football player 
Andy Pilney. [7] Schoolboy Rowe had the best record on the club at 24–8. 
At one point in the season, he won 16 consecutive decisions. Schoolboy 
became a fan favorite not only for his pitching performance in 1934 but 
for his nationally publicized romance. While appearing on the Eddie Cantor 
radio show, Rowe famously asked his fiancee, "How'm I doing, Edna honey?" 
The line endeared Schoolboy to the nation, and also resulted in relentless 
teasing from opposing players and fans. Schoolboy and Edna married after 
the 1934 season and had their first child during the 1935 season. Elden 
Auker, a 23-year-old underhand pitcher out of Kansas A&M, also had a big 
year for the 1934 Tigers. Auker was 15–7 with a 3.42 ERA. During the 1935 
World Series, Auker was interviewed by a young Cubs broadcaster, Ronald 
Reagan. When they met after Reagan had been elected Governor of California, 
Reagan told him, "You probably won't remember me, but I'll remember you 
as long as I live." The 1935 radio interview, Reagan said, "was my first 
big break."[8] The Tigers' #4 starter was Vic Sorrell. Sorrell was 6–9 
with a 4.79 ERA. The Tigers did not employ a closer in the modern sense, 
as their 14 team saves were recorded by 9 different pitchers. Firpo Marberry 
and Chief Hogsett led the way with 3 saves each. Marberry was one of the 
first relief specialists in the major leagues, though he also started many 
games. In 1934, Marberry appeared in 38 games, starting 19 and finishing 
14, and had a record of 15–5. Hogsett became a fan favorite as well, having 
a 3–2 record in 26 games. When Hogsett would take the mound at Navin Field, 
Detroit fans greeted him with "war whoops." Hogsett later reported that, 
while he was "one-thirty-second Cherokee on my mother's side", he got the 
nickname in the minor leagues when he "roomed with a full-blooded Kiowa 
Indian and the nickname just kind of stuck."[9] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9]

The 1934 World Series was a match-up between the St. Louis Cardinals’ "Gashouse 
Gang" and Detroit's "G-Men" (so named because of stars Gehringer, Greenberg, 
and Goslin). Even nearly 50 years later, Charlie Gehringer (interviewed 
in 1982) felt the Tigers were robbed of the 1934 championship by umpire 
Brick Owens. Detroit was ahead 3 games to 2, and in Gehringer's view "we 
should've won the sixth game." Late in the game, Brick Owens called Mickey 
Cochrane out on a play at third base "even though all of the photographs 
show that he was safe by a mile." Gehringer insisted that, if Cochrane 
had been called safe, "we would've had the bases loaded with nobody out 
and we could've had a big inning."[11] The Tigers wound up losing Game 
6 by one run. They then lost Game 7 in an 11–0 shutout thrown by Dizzy 
Dean, despite a 2-for-4 game from Gehringer. In the sixth inning of Game 
7, Joe Medwick slid hard into Marv Owen, the Tigers' third baseman, after 
hitting a triple. They tangled briefly, and when Medwick went to his position 
in left field, the Detroit fans, knowing the game was lost (the score was 
9–0 by then), vented their frustrations on Medwick, throwing fruit, vegetables, 
bottles, cushions, etc., at him. Commissioner Landis ordered Medwick benched 
to end the ruckus. Newsreel footage shows Medwick slamming his glove onto 
the dugout bench in disgust. (Audio) Pete Fox played for the Tigers and 
became the only World Series player to hit six (6) doubles in any Series
