on September 4, 1971 against the Atlanta Braves. In October 1973, the Padres 
traded Caldwell to the San Francisco Giants for Willie McCovey and Bernie 
Williams. Caldwell was traded again in 1976, this time to the St. Louis

Harris and John Curtis. Before the start of the 1977 season, Caldwell was 
traded for the third time, going to the Cincinnati Reds for Pat Darcy. 
After just fourteen games, the Reds traded him to the Milwaukee Brewers 
for minor leaguers Dick O'Keefe and Garry Pyka. Caldwell had his best season 
in 1978 when he went 22–9 with a 2.36 ERA and led the AL in Complete Games

the St. Louis Cardinals in a losing effort. Caldwell was given his unconditional
