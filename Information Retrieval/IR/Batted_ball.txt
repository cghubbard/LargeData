In baseball, a batted ball is any ball that, after a pitch, is contacted 
by the batter's bat. One or more of several terms are used to describe 
a batted ball, depending on how it comes off the bat and where in the field 
it lands. There are generally three descriptive categories for balls hit 
in the air: A ground ball or grounder is a batted ball that rolls or bounces 
on the ground. A line drive in the infield may become a hard grounder to 
an outfielder; these are usually called line drives regardless. Bunts are 
generally not considered to be ground balls; they are a distinct type of 
batted ball, where the batter, in effect, tries to 'block' the ball with 
the bat held steady, rather than taking a full swing. Any of the above 
types of balls might be fair balls or foul balls. Umpires will also signal 
first signal fair or foul on fly outs near the foul line, but the result 
of a foul fly out (or foul out) is no different from a fair fly out; it 
is not a foul ball. A foul tip, a very different type of batted ball, is 
a ball tipped off the bat which goes sharply and directly to the catcher's 
mitt or hand. If the catcher does not catch the ball, it is an ordinary 
foul ball. If the catcher has to move either his mitt/hand or body to catch 
the ball, it is not a foul tip, as the ball would no longer have traveled 
directly to the catch. However, if the ball deflects from either the mitt 
or hand and is subsequently caught before landing, it is still a foul tip. 
A foul tip is always a strike, and is a strike out if there are two strikes
