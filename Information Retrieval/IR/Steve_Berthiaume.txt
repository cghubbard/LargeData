Steven Berthiaume (/bɜːrθˈjuːm/; born 1965 in Medfield, Massachusetts) 
is the television play-by-play announcer for the Arizona Diamondbacks and 
a former anchor on ESPN and a former sportscaster for SportsNet New York 
(SNY). He is married to former SportsCenter anchor Cindy Brunson. He grew 
up in Medfield, Massachusetts where he ran cross country track and was 
the announcer for the basketball team. A graduate of Emerson College, Berthiaume's 
broadcasting career began at WTIC-TV in Hartford, Connecticut, where he 
covered University of Connecticut men's and women's basketball and their 
involvement in the NCAA tournament. He then went on to the now-defunct 
CNNSI network and eventually to ESPN in February 2000, starting at ESPNEWS 
and later, anchoring for SportsCenter. In October 2012, Steve Berthiaume 
was selected as the Arizona Diamondbacks' broadcaster replacing Daron Sutton. 
Along with Bob Brenly the duo will do the play by play for the 2013 baseball

Pensacola, Florida (WEAR), as well as the NBC affiliates in Providence,

WIS-TV, and WVIR-TV, respectively). In 2006, Berthiaume left ESPN to become 
chief sportscaster for the new SNY network started by the New York Mets; 
however, in late January 2007, SNY let Berthiaume out of his contract to 
rejoin ESPN's SportsCenter on March 28, 2007, in order to work closer to 
his wife.[1] He also anchored many (usually weekend) editions of Baseball 
Tonight. In 2012, Berthiaume was hired by MLB's Arizona Diamondbacks to
