Charles Roscoe Barnes[1] (May 8, 1850 – February 5, 1915) was one of the 
stars of baseball's National Association (1871–75) and the early National 
League (1876–81), playing second base and shortstop. He played for the 
dominant Boston Red Stockings teams of the early 1870s, along with Albert 
Spalding, Cal McVey, George Wright, Harry Wright, Jim O'Rourke, and Deacon 
White. Despite playing for these star-studded teams, many claim that Ross 
was the most valuable to his teams. From 1868 to 1870, Ross starred for 
the Rockford Forest Citys, along with Albert Spalding, attaining professional 
status in the second year. When the National Association was formed in 
1871, Harry Wright signed both men to his new team in Boston. Barnes' major 
league career thus started when he was 21. He split time between second 
base and shortstop for the Boston Red Stockings of the new National Association. 
Barnes led the league with 66 runs scored and 91 total bases, finishing 
second in batting average at .401. In 1872, he led the Association with 
a .432 batting average, a .585 slugging percentage, 99 base hits, 134 total 
bases, and 28 doubles. The Red Stockings began a four-year dominance of 
the Association, with Barnes a key player each year. Barnes again led the 
Association in 1873, hitting .425, as well as leading in on-base percentage 
(.456), slugging percentage (.584), base hits (137), runs scored (125), 
total bases (188), doubles (29), bases on balls (28), and stolen bases 
(13). His .340 BA in 1874 was good enough for eighth in the league, while 
his .364 was good for second in 1875, while leading again in runs scored 
(115), base hits (143) and on-base percentage (.375). Before the 1875 season 
ended, Barnes and four other Boston players signed contracts with the Chicago 
White Stockings. When word leaked out in Boston before the end of the season, 
Barnes and his teammates were reviled by Boston fans, being called "seceders", 
a strong epithet just a decade after the Civil War. It was likely that 
the National Association would void the signing, but Chicago owner William 
Hulbert preempted the move by forming the National League and causing the 
NA to disband. Barnes' new team finished first in the NL's first season 
with a 55–12 record, while Boston fell to fourth. Ross led the National 
League batting (.429), on-base percentage (.462), slugging (.562), runs 
(126), hits (138), bases (190), doubles (21), triples (14), and walks (20). 
In the 1876 season, Barnes also established the single-season record for 
runs per game (1.91), a mark which still stands. For those first six years 
of major league play, Barnes had hit .397. However, 1876 was to be his 
last dominant season. Barnes holds the career NA records in runs (459), 
hits (530), doubles (99), walks (55), stolen bases (73), total bases (695), 
times on base (585), runs produced (694), batting average (.390), on-base 
percentage (.413), and slugging percentage (.511). In 1877, he fell ill 
with what was then only described as an "ague" (fever), played only 22 
games, and did not play well when he was in the lineup. The illness robbed 
Barnes of much of his strength and agility, and shortened his career. While 
many baseball histories originally blamed the change in rules that outlawed 
the "fair-foul" hit, of which Barnes was an acknowledged master, his illness 
has become a more widely accepted explanation for his loss of productivity.[citation 
needed] The remainder of his career was an effort to return to glory ending 
in mediocrity. He played for the Tecumseh team in the International Association 
(arguably baseball's first minor league) in 1878, returned to the National 
League with the Cincinnati club in 1879, sat out all of 1880, and finished 
his professional career in 1881, playing his last season in Boston, the 
site of his former glory. After 1876, he never hit better than .272, and 
his other totals were barely half of those from his glory days. He retired 
at age 31. He finished his career with 859 hits, 698 runs, and a .359 average, 
in only 499 games played and 2392 at bats. His 1.4 runs per game played 
remains the best of all time. Barnes has been rated as the best player 
of the National Association, and during his peak, from 1871 to 1876, he 
was a dominant offensive force. His skill at the fair-foul bunt caused 
rule changes, and his defensive abilities were highly regarded. A teammate 
of multiple members of the Baseball Hall of Fame, he was the most valuable 
batter. He also has the distinction of having hit the first home run in 
National League history, on May 2, 1876.[2] A bachelor for most of his 
life, he married Ellen Welsh in 1900. Barnes held a variety of white-collar 
jobs in the Chicago area after his baseball career ended until his death
