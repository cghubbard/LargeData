The Modesto Nuts are a minor league baseball team in Modesto, California, 
United States. They are a Class A – Advanced team in the California League 
and a farm team of the Seattle Mariners. The Modesto Nuts play home games 
at John Thurman Field. Opened in 1955 and renovated in 1997, the park seats 
over 5,000 fans (including standing room only). In March 2007, the City 
of Modesto installed a new video scoreboard and made improvements to the 
infield playing surface. The Nuts adopted their current name in 2005, after 
the team's affiliation with the Oakland Athletics ended. Before then, the 
team was known as the Modesto Athletics (or A's). The new name was chosen 
to reflect the several types of nuts that are grown in the region. In 2012 
Greg Young was replaced by Alex Margulies who now does play-by-play for 
all home and away games, and Modesto Bee sports writer Brian VanderBeek 
does color commentary in the middle innings of most home games. The play-by-play 
position was formerly held by Joshua Suchon, who now works for the Los 
Angeles Dodgers. On June 2, 2006, manager Chad Kreuter resigned to become 
the head baseball coach of the University of Southern California. Kreuter 
replaced his father-in-law, Mike Gillespie. As of 2012, the club is managed 
by Lenn Sakata who replaced the winningest coach in Modesto Nuts history 
Jerry Weinstein who was promoted to the Colorado Rockies at the conclusion 
of the 2011 season.[1] In Spring 2008, the team was the subject of Bush 
League TV's short internet video "Bush League 101: How to Bush League a 
Bush League Baseball Team." The Modesto Nuts have three mascots: Al the 
Almond, Wally the Walnut and Shelley the Pistachio. These mascots make 
their presence seen not only at the park cheering on the Nuts, but in the 
community of Modesto as well. On June 21, 2011 the Modesto Nuts hosted 
the 2011 California/Carolina All Star Smash.[2] On September 1, 2012 Modesto 
Nuts 1st Basemen Jared Clark hit his 24th Home Run of the season against 
the San Jose Giants making him the Modesto Nuts single season Home Run 
leader passing former Nuts outfielder Kent Matthes, who in 2011 set the 
old record with 23 Home Runs in the season. As of 2011 the Modesto Nuts 
have set their attendance record for five straight seasons and have been 
honored as Back to Back California League Organization of the Year for 
2010 and 2011. Following the 2016 season, the Seattle Mariners purchased 
a majority share of the Nuts, and the teams entered in to a player development 
contract making Modesto a Mariners affiliate. HWS Baseball IV, LLC, continues 
to see to the team's day-to-day operations.[3] Pitchers Catchers Infielders
