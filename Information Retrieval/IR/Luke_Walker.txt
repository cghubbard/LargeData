James Luke Walker (born September 2, 1943 in DeKalb, Texas) is a former 
pitcher in Major League Baseball who played between 1965 and 1974 for the 
Pittsburgh Pirates (1965–66, 1968–73) and Detroit Tigers (1974). He batted 
and threw left-handed.[1] Walker did almost everything a pitcher is asked 
to do. He started and filled various relief roles coming out from the bullpen 
as a closer, middle reliever, and set-up man as well. His most productive 
season statistically came in 1970 with Pittsburgh, when he finished 15–6[1] 
(3–1, three saves in relief), while his 3.04 ERA, .714 winning percentage, 
and 7.1 hits per nine innings all ranked him third among National League 
pitchers. He also fired a pair of two-hit shutouts. That year, the Pirates 
won the National League East title for their first post-season berth since 
winning the 1960 World Series.[2] However, they were swept by the Cincinnati 
Reds in the NLCS.[3] Walker was the losing pitcher in Game Two, giving 
up two runs (one unearned) in seven innings in a 3–1 Reds victory. Bobby 
Tolan scored all three Reds runs, including a home run off Walker in the 
fifth inning.[4] In 1971, Walker went 10–8 with a 3.55 ERA for the 1971 
World Series champion Pirates.[1][5] On July 18 of that year, in the second 
game of a doubleheader against the Los Angeles Dodgers at Three Rivers 
Stadium, he had a no-hitter broken up by a Joe Ferguson home run (the first 
of Ferguson's Major League career) with no outs in the ninth. The hit was 
the only one he would allow in a 7–1 Pittsburgh victory.[6] In Game Four 
of that year's World Series, which the Pirates won in seven games over 
the Baltimore Orioles, Walker threw the first pitch in a night game in 
World Series history. His outing was brief: Paul Blair, Mark Belanger and 
Merv Rettenmund began the game with consecutive singles off Walker to load 
the bases. After Blair scored on a passed ball, Walker intentionally walked 
Frank Robinson to re-load the bases. He was then pulled after giving up 
consecutive sacrifice flies to Brooks Robinson and Boog Powell for a 3–0 
Baltimore lead. Walker was then taken out of the game.[7] The Pirates later 
scored two runs in the bottom of the first, the tying run in the third, 
and the go-ahead run (the game ended by that 4–3 score) in the seventh, 
and Bruce Kison threw 6 1⁄3 scoreless innings in relief of Walker. The 
Orioles got only one hit after Walker's departure, a Blair double off Kison 
in the second.[8] In a nine-season career, Walker posted a 45–47 record 
with a 3.65 ERA and 558 strikeouts in 243 appearances, including 100 starts, 
16 complete games, seven shutouts, nine saves, and 824 2⁄3 innings pitched.[1] 
He was also a weak batsman, garnering only 11 hits in 188 at-bats for an
