Jurickson Barthelomeus Profar (born February 20, 1993) is a Curaçaoan professional 
baseball infielder for the Texas Rangers of Major League Baseball (MLB). 
Profar participated in both the 2004 and 2005 Little League World Series. 
He helped the Pabao Little League team from Willemstad, Curaçao beat the 
Conejo Valley East Little League team from Thousand Oaks, California to 
win the championship in 2004. He helped lead the team to the championship 
game again in 2005, but this time lost to West Oahu Little League from 
Ewa Beach, Hawaii.[1] Profar signed with the Texas Rangers on July 2, 2009.[2][3] 
Other teams wanted to sign Profar as a pitcher, but the Rangers signed 
him as a shortstop, his preferred position.[4] He spent his first professional 
season in 2010 playing for the Spokane Indians. He hit .250 with four home 
runs and 23 runs batted in in 63 games. Prior to the 2011 season Profar 
was ranked by Baseball America as the Texas Rangers second best overall 
prospect and the 74th best overall.[5][6] He played the 2011 season for 
the Hickory Crawdads. He was selected to represent the Rangers at the 2011 
All-Star Futures Game.[7] Baseball America ranked him as the 12th best 
prospect in baseball during their midseason top 50 list.[8] He finished 
the season hitting .286/.390/.493 with 12 home runs and 65 runs batted 
in and was named the South Atlantic League MVP.[9] He was named the shortstop 
on Baseball America's 2011 Minor League All Star team.[10] He was named 
to appear in the 2012 All-Star Futures Game.[11] On August 31, 2012, Profar 
was called up to the Rangers as major league rosters expanded and as a 
possible postseason addition. He is the first player born in 1993 to play 
in the majors and was the youngest player active in the major leagues.[12] 
In his major league debut, Profar started at second base in place of Ian 
Kinsler, who was out due to back stiffness, and hit a 388 foot solo home 
run off of Zach McAllister in his first major league at bat. He then later 
doubled in his second at-bat, and went 2 for 4 for the game. In 9 games, 
Profar batted .176 with a home run and 2 RBI. Profar started the 2013 season 
in Triple-A Round Rock. In May 2013, the Rangers called up Profar while 
putting Kinsler on the 15-day disabled list. In a May 26 game at Seattle, 
he hit his second career home run off Hisashi Iwakuma while batting leadoff 
for the first time in his major league career.[13] In 88 games, Profar 
batted .234 with 6 home runs and 26 RBI. After the 2013 season, the Rangers 
traded Kinsler, which could allow Profar to become the Rangers' starting 
second baseman.[14] Profar started the 2014 season on the 60-day disabled 
list, and wasn't expected to make a return until mid-June. On May 22, the 
Rangers organization announced Profar had reinjured his shoulder, and as 
a result missed the entire 2014 season.[15] On February 23, 2015, Profar 
underwent surgery on his shoulder and missed the entire 2015 season.[16] 
After missing a total of two seasons due to the shoulder injury, Profar 
was optioned to Triple-A Round Rock Express on March 21, 2016. On May 27, 
2016, the Rangers called Profar up to the majors as a replacement for Rougned 
Odor, who was suspended by the MLB for 7 games for punching the Toronto 
Blue Jays' Jose Bautista. Profar went 1 for 5 in his return against the 
Pittsburgh Pirates the same day. He hit his first homerun of the season 
on May 31, 2016 against the Cleveland Indians. [17] His performance during 
Odor's suspension earned him a regular roster spot. Upon Odor's return 
from suspension, Hanser Alberto was optioned to the minors. Since his return 
Profar has played, in addition to his normal 2B and SS positions, 3B, 1B, 
and the outfield (the latter two for the first time in his major league 
career). After Team Netherlands advanced to the semi-finals for the 2013 
World Baseball Classic, manager Hensley Meulens made a public plea to have 
Profar on the Dutch roster since Profar was born in Curacao. The Rangers 
gave permission for Profar to be on the roster shortly after. Profar's
