The Cuban Thaw[1][2] (Spanish: deshielo cubano)[3][4] is a warming of Cuba–United 
States relations that began in December 2014, ending a 54-year stretch 
of hostility between the nations. In March 2016, Barack Obama became the 
first U.S. President to visit Cuba since 1928.[5] On December 17, 2014, 
U.S. President Barack Obama and Cuban President Raúl Castro announced the 
beginning of a process of normalizing relations between Cuba and the United 
States. The normalization agreement was secretly negotiated in preceding 
months, facilitated by Pope Francis and largely hosted by the Government 
of Canada. Meetings were held in both Canada and the Vatican City.[6] The 
agreement would see the lifting of some U.S. travel restrictions, fewer 
restrictions on remittances, U.S. banks' access to the Cuban financial 
system,[7] and the reopening of the U.S. embassy in Havana and the Cuban 
embassy in Washington, which both closed in 1961 after the breakup of diplomatic 
relations as a result of Cuba's close alliance with the USSR.[8][9] On 
April 14, 2015, the Obama administration announced that Cuba would be removed 
from the United States State Sponsors of Terrorism list. With no congressional 
action to block this within the permitted time period, Cuba was officially 
removed from the list on May 29, 2015. This marked a further departure 
by the United States from the Cold War conflict and its strain on Cuba–United 
States relations.[10] On July 20, 2015, the Cuban and U.S. "interests sections" 
in Washington and Havana were upgraded to embassies.[11] In May 2012, it 
was reported that the U.S. had declined a "spy swap" proposed by the Cuban 
government, wherein the remaining three of an original group of Cuban prisoners 
the U.S. had convicted of espionage known as the Cuban Five, in prison 
in the U.S. since the 1990s, would be returned to Cuba in exchange for 
USAID contractor Alan Gross. Gross had been imprisoned in Cuba for providing 
illegal cellphone chips of a type used by CIA agents, which are designed 
to evade detection,[12] in addition to computer equipment, satellite phones, 
and internet access to Cuba's Jewish community.[13] Despite initial U.S. 
refusals, the prisoner swap eventually took place in December 2014 following 
the President's announcement of intent to move towards normalized relations.[14] 
In addition to Gross, the swap included Rolando Sarraff Trujillo, a Cuban 
who had worked as an agent for American intelligence and had been in a 
Cuban prison for nearly 20 years.[15][16][17] Additionally, in early January 
2015, the Cuban government began releasing a number of imprisoned dissidents, 
as requested by the United States. On January 12, 2015, it was reported 
that all 53 dissidents had been released.[18] The prisoner swap marked 
the biggest shift in White House policy towards Cuba since the imposition 
of the embargo in 1962, and removed a key obstacle to bilateral relations.[19] 
Since the exchange, Gross has become a vocal advocate of normalization 
of relations, even offering to visit Cuba again in support of such a result. 
Although the Cuban trade embargo can only be ended by the U.S. Congress, 
the Obama administration took executive action to ease some restrictions 
on travel to Cuba by U.S. citizens, as well as restrictions on the import 
and export of goods between each country.[20] In his 2015 State of the 
Union Address to Congress, Obama called on lawmakers to lift the embargo 
against Cuba,[21] a message he reiterated in 2016.[22] In February 2015, 
Conan O'Brien became the first American television personality to film 
in Cuba in more than half a century [23] (besides Michael Moore's Sicko 
in 2007 and Anthony Bourdain's No Reservations in 2011). In May 2015, the 
Minnesota Orchestra performed several concerts in Havana, the first professional 
U.S. orchestra to play in Cuba since 1999.[24] Major League Baseball (MLB) 
held talks about playing spring training games in Cuba in 2015, but lacked 
time to arrange them.[25] MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred said on March 19, 
2015, that the league would likely play an exhibition game in Cuba sometime 
in early 2016.[26] On March 22, 2016, the Tampa Bay Rays played an exhibition 
game against the Cuban national team at Estadio Latinoamericano in Havana 
with Presidents Obama and Castro in attendance.[27] Sun Country Airlines 
began operating charter flights between New York's John F. Kennedy International 
Airport and Havana's José Martí International Airport in March 2015.[28] 
On May 5, 2015, the United States granted approval to four companies to 
offer chartered ferry service between Miami and Cuba.[29] In March 2016, 
Carnival Cruise Line received permission from Cuba to resume cruises from 
Miami to Havana for the first time in fifty years.[30] Cuba, however, still 
prohibited the Cuban-born from returning by sea, and Carnival therefore 
refused to accept reservations from the Cuban-born. Following public protests 
against such an exclusionary policy, Carnival told the Cuban authorities 
it would not sail unless the policy was changed, the Cuban government relented, 
and the first Carnival cruise sailed from Miami on May 1, 2016.[31] Between 
January and May 2015, the number of Americans visiting Cuba who had no 
family ties there was 36% higher than during the same months in 2014.[32] 
A report by the Pew Research Center found that the number of Cubans entering 
the U.S. in 2015 was 78% higher than in 2014.[33] It has been said that 
the United States–Cuban Thaw was spurred by Cuba's main international partner, 
Venezuela, experiencing sharp economic decline.[34][35] Venezuela subsidized 
the government of Cuba, however following the oil price drop resulting 
from the 2010s oil glut, could no longer do so. (see also Pink tide#Decline) 
On January 21, 2015, the United States and Cuba began bilateral talks in 
Havana to discuss further normalization issues. The U.S. delegation led 
by U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Roberta S. Jacobson, and Josefina 
Vidal Ferreiro, Cuba's head of North American affairs, sat down for the 
first day of closed-door talks in the capital’s Convention Center. The 
talks reportedly centered around migration policy.[36] In particular, Cuban 
representatives urged the U.S. to end its immigration privileges to Cuban 
refugees, also known as the Wet feet, dry feet policy, which allows any 
fleeing Cuban citizens U.S. residency and citizenship, as long as they 
are found on U.S. soil and not at sea.[36] Reuters reported that civilian 
uncertainty about the status of U.S. immigration policy following the thaw 
was promoting a surge of emigrants fleeing Cuba for the U.S.[37] In regard 
to U.S. interests, the U.S. delegation made it clear that "improved human 
rights conditions, including freedom of expression and assembly", remain 
a central element of U.S. policy in normalizing U.S.–Cuban relations.[38] 
Furthermore, despite Cuban objections, the U.S. stated that it will stand 
by its Cuban migration policy under the Cuban Adjustment Act.[38] A second 
round of talks took place in Washington, D.C., late in February 2015. Negotiators 
described the talks as productive and said several issues were close to 
resolution. However, the issue of Cuba's listing among state sponsors of 
terrorism by the U.S. government remained a significant sticking point, 
although Cuban diplomat Josefina Vidal said its removal was not strictly 
a precondition to reopening embassies.[39] A third round of talks were 
held in Havana from March 16–17, 2015. However, the talks ended abruptly 
after just a day, without any public comment.[40] Obama and Castro themselves 
met at the Summit of the Americas in Panama on April 10–11, where Castro 
delivered an address praising Obama and apologising for blaming his government 
for the ongoing U.S. embargo.[41] After meeting with Obama, Castro called 
for the reopening of the embassies, while both presidents said they were 
looking forward to more direct engagement between Cuba and the United States 
despite their differences.[42] In addition to Cuba's concern over U.S. 
migration policy, the Cuban delegation assured the U.S. that normalization 
talks would not yield significant changes unless Cuba is removed from the 
U.S. State Department's list of state sponsors of terrorism. Cuba was one 
of four countries on the list, the other three being Iran, Sudan, and Syria. 
The U.S. government said that it had begun an intelligence review in order 
to evaluate whether Cuba can be removed from the list.[43][44] On April 
14, 2015, President Obama informed the U.S. Congress that he had decided 
to lift the designation of Cuba as a state sponsor of terrorism because 
"the government of Cuba has not provided any support for international 
terrorism during the preceding six-month period", and it "has provided 
assurances that it will not support acts of international terrorism in 
the future".[45][10] The U.S. Congress could have blocked this by passing 
legislation within 45 days, but no member of Congress even introduced such 
legislation, and Cuba was officially removed from the list on May 29, 2015.[46][47] 
On May 20, 2015, the Cuban government opened a bank account in the United 
States, enabling it to do non-cash business in the United States for the 
first time since the embargo began.[48] Cuba and the United States officially 
resumed full diplomatic relations at midnight on July 20, 2015, with the 
"Cuban interests section" in Washington, D.C., and the "U.S. interests 
section" in Havana being upgraded to embassies.[49] A ceremony was held 
at the Cuban Embassy to raise the flag of Cuba, with U.S. Secretary of 
State John Kerry and Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodríguez Parrilla holding 
a joint news conference afterward at which they emphasized both the step 
forward in bilateral relations and the remaining political differences 
between the Cuban and U.S. governments.[50] Kerry flew to Cuba in late 
July for a ceremony at which the flag of the United States was raised over 
the US Embassy in Havana.[51] On January 28, 2015, while attending a meeting 
of Latin American leaders in San José, Costa Rica, President Raúl Castro 
asserted that the United States should return the Guantanamo Bay Naval 
Base and lift the embargo on Cuba if relations were to be considered fully 
normalized.[52] The White House responded the next day, saying that it 
had no intention to return the base. White House spokesman Josh Earnest 
indicated any such move is out of the question. "The President does believe 
that the prison at Guantánamo Bay should be closed down, but the naval 
base is not something that we wish to be closed."[53] This issue has yet 
to be resolved. The United States government has stated specific goals 
in improving trade with Cuba. Roberta Jacobson, an American diplomat, suggested 
bolstering Internet access and mobile phone service in Cuba to help its 
integration into the world economy.[54] This has provided American telecommunication 
companies including Verizon and Sprint with a new market in Cuba.[55] By 
July 20, 2016, US companies Airbnb and Netflix were operating in Cuba as 
well.[56] The United States seeks to increase revenue from tourism in Cuba 
by lifting traveling restrictions which can be used for purchase of American 
agricultural and manufacturing exports to Cuba.[57] On March 20, 2016, 
Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide became the first US company to sign 
a deal with Cuba since the 1959 revolution and agreed to manage two Havana 
hotels which had formerly been owned by the Cuban government.[58] The first 
of these hotels opened three months later on June 27.[59] On December 11, 
2015, the United States and Cuba agreed to restore postal service between 
the two countries for the first time since 1963.[60] A week later, on December 
17, 2015–the first anniversary of D17–an agreement was reached to re-establish 
regularly scheduled flights between the U.S. and Cuba for the first time 
since the Cuban Missile Crisis.[61] The agreement, which allows for 110 
flights a day, took effect on February 16, 2016.[62] Mail service between 
the two countries resumed on March 17, 2016.[63] On July 7, 2016, it was 
announced that eight US airline companies had been given tentative approval 
to fly to airports in Cuba and that flights, which would be limited to 
educational trips, would begin as early as September.[64] On August 31, 
2016, JetBlue Airways Flight 387 became the first US commercial airline 
in more than 50 years to land a plane carrying US passengers at a Cuban 
airport when one of its planes took off from Fort Lauderdale, Florida and 
landed in Santa Clara, Cuba.[65][66] President Obama arrived in Cuba for 
a three-day visit on March 20, 2016.[67] Obama headed a delegation of between 
800 and 1,200, including businesspeople and congressional leaders who had 
helped in establishing the 2014 normalization deal.[68] Obama was the first 
sitting U.S. president to visit Cuba since Calvin Coolidge in 1928.[68] 
Obama said that he would only visit Cuba if he could meet with Cuban dissidents: 
"If I go on a visit, then part of the deal is that I get to talk to everybody. 
I’ve made it very clear in my conversations directly with President Raúl 
Castro that we would continue to reach out to those who want to broaden 
the scope for, you know, free expression inside of Cuba."[69] On April 
22, 2016 it was announced that travel restrictions on U.S. commercial vessels 
had been lifted and that the Carnival Cruise Line could travel to Cuba.[70] 
On May 1, 2016, the MV Adonia, a cruise ship operated by Carnival subsidiary 
Fathom Travel, departed from Miami and docked in Havana Bay, marking the 
first time in nearly 40 years that a U.S. passenger ship sailed from the 
U.S. to Cuba.[71] Carnival said that the Adonia would go from Miami to 
Havana every other week.[72] Two other Miami-based cruise lines, Royal 
Caribbean and Norwegian, are interested in running cruises to Cuba and 
are seeking Cuban government authorization.[71] A number of Florida ferry 
companies have received authorization from the U.S. Department of the Treasury 
to begin service to Cuba, but the companies are waiting on Cuban government 
permission.[70][71] Raúl Castro, the Cuban president since 2008 and one 
of the leaders of the Cuban Revolution of the 1950s, declared in 2013 that 
"a slow and orderly transfer of the leadership of the revolution to the 
new generations" was already in progress.[73] Castro has pledged not to 
seek reelection in 2018.[74] In announcing the agreement in December 2014, 
Castro struck a balance between praising the Marxist revolution that brought 
him and his brother Fidel to power almost 60 years prior and extolling 
the benefits that would be brought about by improved relations with the 
United States, namely the end of the Cuban embargo. Fidel Castro appeared 
to welcome the thaw between Cuba and the United States in a statement published 
by Granma on January 26, 2015. Despite saying that he "does not trust United 
States policies", he stated, "We will always defend cooperation and friendship 
with all the peoples of the world, among them our political adversaries."[75] 
In December 2014, Raúl Castro publicly thanked Pope Francis and the Catholic 
Church for their role in the secret talks that led to the U.S.–Cuban prisoner 
exchange. According to Church officials within Cuba, several plans to build 
Catholic churches, which have been blocked since the revolution in 1959, 
are being processed. The first church is to be built in Sandino. It will 
be the first Catholic church to be built in Cuba since 1959, when the communist 
Castro regime declared the country an atheist state.[76][77] At a CELAC 
meeting in 2015, Raúl Castro gave a speech claiming "Cuba will continue 
to defend the ideas for which our people have assumed the greatest sacrifices 
and risks." In that speech, he detailed the history of Cuba's foreign relations. 
Throughout the speech, he condemned the United States' history of manifest 
destiny, detailing a basic history of American and Cuban relations. After 
talking about the United States' policy in Cuba, he went on to condemn 
the United States' assistance in installing the "terrible dictatorships 
in 20 countries, 12 of them simultaneously," referring to the United States' 
supporting of Latin American dictatorships. Following that, Castro detailed 
Cuba's history following the Cuban Revolution. But despite his prior backlash 
against the United States, Castro summarized his speech by praising the 
recent improvements in American-Cuban relations, and wondered why "the 
countries of the two Americas, the North and the South, fight together 
against terrorism, drug trafficking and organized crime, without politically 
biased positions."[78] The Cuban Thaw has received some political backlash 
in the United States, most notably from Senator Marco Rubio of Florida. 
Rubio, a Cuban-American Republican, said that "diplomatic recognition [would] 
provide legitimacy to a government that doesn't deserve it."[79][80] The 
2014 congressional elections were a month prior to the announcement of 
the thaw. Senator Bob Menendez, a Cuban-American Democrat from New Jersey 
and chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee was an early critic 
of Obama's decision to normalize relations with Cuba. Writing in USA Today 
on December 17, Menendez criticized Obama "for compromising on bedrock 
U.S. values", charging that the Obama administration "has wrongly rewarded 
a totalitarian regime and thrown the Cuban regime an economic lifeline".[81] 
Among the few other Democrats who have criticized Obama over the shift 
in relations with Cuba are two members of the House of Representatives: 
Albio Sires[82] and Debbie Wasserman-Schultz.[83] Congressional opponents 
of the new Cuba policy vowed to try to block its implementation, with Rubio 
announcing he would hold up the confirmation of any U.S. ambassador to 
Cuba whom Obama might nominate.[84][85] Republican Senator Ted Cruz of 
Texas described the policy as a "tragic mistake."[86] However, the Associated 
Press reported that business groups like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce would 
likely apply pressure on congressmen to accept the diplomatic thaw, and 
Republican Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona, a supporter of the shift, predicted 
many congressmen would come around.[87] Like Senator Flake, Senator Rand 
Paul, a Republican from Kentucky, supports the thaw on the grounds that 
increased trade relations will benefit both Cubans and Americans. Senator 
Paul, in response to Senator Rubio, argued that “Senator Rubio is acting 
like an isolationist”, and that, “The 50-year embargo just hasn't worked. 
If the goal is regime change, it sure doesn't seem to be working.”[88] 
Similarly, Obama's former Secretary of State and 2016 presidential candidate 
Hillary Clinton strongly endorsed the decision. Clinton has argued that 
the embargo “had propped up the Castro government because they could blame 
all of the country’s problems on the United States. Moreover, the embargo 
did not have any impact on freedom of speech, freedom of expression, or 
on freeing political prisoners.”[89][90] International reactions were overwhelmingly 
positive, with Radio Poland having reported that the Polish foreign ministry 
is encouraging Washington to go further and lift the embargo.[91] Russia, 
one of Cuba's closest allies, encouraged Washington to go further by lifting 
the embargo and removing Cuba from the list of State Sponsors of Terrorism.[92] 
China, also one of Cuba's closest allies, welcomed the resumption of diplomatic 
relations between Cuba and the United States.[93] Israel was one of the 
few countries not to issue a statement welcoming the change, and it was 
reported that the Israeli Foreign Ministry is "miffed" at having been caught 
off guard by the change.[94] Israel-Cuba relations have been icy since 
the 1960s, and Israel has been the only country to consistently side with 
the US against UN resolutions criticizing the embargo. Several Latin American 
leaders publicly welcomed the thaw, with Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro 
hailing Obama's move toward normalization as a "valiant and historically 
necessary gesture", despite being a regular critic of U.S. policy.[95] 
Colombian Liberal ex-President Ernesto Samper in his capacity as President 
of UNASUR said that "this was very good news, not only for Cuba but for 
the entire region". Juan Carlos Varela, the conservative President of Panama, 
said that in the 7th Summit of the Americas to be held in his country after 
April 7, 2015, it will be possible to "achieve the dream of a united region".[96] 
The Canadian government, which maintained more positive relations with 
Cuba than the United States did during and after the Cold War, also responded 
favorably, with Foreign Minister John Baird suggesting to The Atlantic 
commentator Jeffrey Goldberg that the policy shift could help "transform" 
Cuba for the better.[97] Media sources, which were quick to dub the sudden 
turnaround in relations the "Cuban Thaw",[2] have predicted that it will 
lead to a wide variety of social and economic benefits for the two countries, 
as well as some less obvious impacts. Newsweek reported that the stock 
market jumped once elements of the Cuban Thaw were reported.[1] Reuters 
reported that the thaw would "make it more likely the Cuban government 
will extradite fugitives sought by U.S. officials."[98] The Associated 
Press reported environmentalist concerns that the thaw would lead to the 
opening of "one of the most prolific oil and gas basins on the planet," 
which sits off the coast of Cuba.[99] Bloomberg News reported that the 
thaw would even benefit Major League Baseball, with teams gaining major 
new opportunities to sign Cuban players.[100] There were reports on how 
the Cuban Thaw affected Cuban society, including its real estate market 
and greater emphasis on English language education.[101][102] The New Republic 
deemed the Cuban Thaw to be "Obama's finest foreign policy achievement."[103] 
The Indonesian journal Strategic Review proposed that Obama could follow 
the model of normalization of relations which his predecessor Bill Clinton 
had done with Vietnam.[104] Granma, Cuba's state newspaper, published numerous 
articles regarding the Cuban Thaw. It stated that "International public 
opinion supports removal of Cuba from U.S. list of state sponsors of terrorism," 
and that "[t]he decision is recognized as an important step in advancing 
President Obama’s policy change to improve relations between the two countries."[105] 
Additionally, they stated that "[t]he Cuban government recognizes the just 
decision taken by the President of the United States to eliminate Cuba 
from a list on which it never should have been included" and reiterated 
that Cuba "rejects and condemns all acts of terrorism in all their forms 
and manifestations, as well as any action that is intended to instigate, 
support, finance or conceal terrorist acts."[106] A survey conducted by 
Pew Research Center in January 2016 found that 63% of Americans approved 
of Obama's decision to re-establish diplomatic relations with Cuba, while 
28% disapproved. The study found that Democrats (74%) and Independents 
(67%) were more likely to support the re-established relations; 40% of 
Republicans approved. The study also found that 66% of Americans supported 
ending the trade embargo against Cuba, while 28% disapproved. Support for 
both the re-establishment of relations and the lifting of the trade embargo 
was seen broadly amongst all racial and ethnic groups (62% of whites, 64% 
of blacks, and 65% of Hispanics) and amongst all age-brackets, however 
younger Americans were more likely to support it than older Americans. 
Americans who were college or university graduates (77%) overwhelmingly 
supported the restoration of relations, while people with only some college 
education (59%) or only high school education (53%) were less likely to 
support it. Despite broad support for the re-establishment of diplomatic 
relations and the end of the trade embargo, only 32% of Americans surveyed 
believed that Cuba would become "more democratic" over the next several 
years, with 60% believing the situation in Cuba will remain the same.[107]
