John Alban Edwards (born June 10, 1938[1]) is an American former professional 
baseball player. Known for his excellent defensive skills, he played as 
a catcher in Major League Baseball for the Cincinnati Reds (1961–67), St. 
Louis Cardinals (1968) and Houston Astros (1969–74).[1][2] Edwards graduated 
from Ohio State University where he led the team in hits (24) in 1958 and 
became a member of Phi Kappa Tau fraternity. He was signed as an amateur 
free agent by the Cincinnati Reds in 1959.[1] He made his Major League 
debut at age 23 on June 27, 1961 in a 10–8 Reds' win over the Chicago Cubs 
at Wrigley Field. In his first at-bat he pinch-hit in the seventh inning 
for Reds' starting catcher Jerry Zimmerman, drawing a walk against reliever 
Barney Schultz and later scoring on a triple by Jerry Lynch. In his next 
at-bat, in the ninth inning, he got his first hit and first RBI, driving 
in Gordy Coleman with a single against reliever Joe Schaffernoth.[3] During 
Edwards' rookie season, he backed up Zimmerman and helped the Reds win 
the 1961 National League pennant.[4] In the 1961 World Series Edwards had 
4 hits and 2 RBIs in a losing cause, as the New York Yankees defeated the 
Reds in 5 games.[5][6] He put up solid offensive numbers from 1962 to 1965, 
earning three MLB All Star appearances. His offensive numbers diminished 
after he suffered a broken finger on the last day of spring training in 
1966,[7] but he continued to be one of the best defensive catchers in the 
National League.[2] On June 14, 1965, Edwards was the Reds catcher when 
pitcher Jim Maloney went 10 innings against the New York Mets without allowing 
a hit.[8] Edwards left the game in the 10th inning for a pinch runner with 
the game in a scoreless tie, as the Mets went on to break up the no-hitter 
and score a run to win the game in the 11th inning. A little more than 
two months later, on August 19, 1965, Edwards was once again the catcher 
as Maloney threw another 10 innings without allowing a hit.[9] This time 
the Reds scored a run, securing the victory and the no-hitter for Maloney. 
With the arrival of Johnny Bench, the Reds traded Edwards to the St. Louis 
Cardinals for Pat Corrales and Jimy Williams on February 8, 1968.[10] With 
the Cardinals, he played backup catcher to Tim McCarver, helping them win 
the National League pennant, however, they would subsequently lose to the 
Detroit Tigers in the 1968 World Series.[11][12] He caught Ray Washburn's 
no-hitter on September 18 of that 1968 season.[13] On October 11, 1968 
Edwards was traded with minor league player Tommy Smith to the Houston 
Astros for Dave Giusti and Dave Adlesh.[10] After playing his first season 
for the Houston Astros in 1969, he finished 36th in voting for the National 
League Most Valuable Player Award.[14] His final game played, at age 36, 
was a 5–4 10-inning Astros' loss to the Los Angeles Dodgers at the Astrodome 
on October 2, 1974. In his final plate appearance, pinch-hitting in the 
10th inning for Skip Jutze against the Dodgers' Eddie Solomon, Edwards 
drew a walk.[15] In 14 seasons Edwards played in 1,470 games, producing 
1,106 hits in 4,577 at bats for a .242 batting average along with 81 home 
runs and 524 runs batted in.[1] He was voted to three National League All-Star 
teams in 1963, 1964 and 1965.[1] A solid defensive player, he won the National 
League Gold Glove Award for catchers in 1963 and 1964, and led National 
League catchers in fielding percentage four times in 1963, 1969, 1970 and 
1971.[16][17] He also led the league four times in assists and three times 
in putouts.[1] In 1969, Edwards set single season records for catchers 
with 1135 putouts and 1221 total chances.[18] Richard Kendall of the Society 
for American Baseball Research devised an unscientific study that ranked 
Edwards as the second most dominating fielding catcher in major league 
history.[19] He caught 109 shutouts during his career, ranking him 22nd 
all-time among major league catchers.[20] As of the end of the 2009 Major 
League Baseball season he ranked 79th on the All-Time Intentional Walks 
List.[21] During the off-seasons while with the Reds, Edwards worked as 
an engineer for General Electric in research and development for nuclear 
fuel elements. [22] He was inducted into the Ohio State Varsity O Hall 
of Fame in September 2008.[23] He also earned a degree in Engineering from
