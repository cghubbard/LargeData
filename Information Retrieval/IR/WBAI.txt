WBAI, a part of the Pacifica Radio Network, is a non-commercial, listener-supported 
radio station, broadcasting at 99.5 FM in New York City. The station has 
their transmitter atop the Empire State Building, but might be in the process 
of relocating to the Conde Naste Building, also known by its address of 
4 Times Square. Its programming is leftist/progressive, and a mixture of 
political news and opinion from a leftist perspective, tinged with aspects 
of its complex and varied history, such as Freeform radio, which WBAI played 
a role in developing, as well as various music. The station began as WABF, 
which first went on the air in 1941 as W75NY, of Metropolitan Television, 
Inc. (W75NY indicating an eastern station at 47.5 MHz in New York), and 
moved to the 99.5 frequency in 1948.[citation needed] In 1955, after two 
years off the air, it was reborn as WBAI (whose calls were named after 
then-owners Broadcast Associates, Inc.).[citation needed] WBAI was purchased 
by eccentric philanthropist Louis Schweitzer, who donated it to the Pacifica 
Foundation in 1960.[1] The station, which had been a commercial enterprise, 
became non-commercial and listener-supported under Pacifica ownership.[citation 
needed] The history of WBAI is iconoclastic and contentious.[citation needed] 
Referred to in a New York Times Magazine piece as "an anarchist's circus," 
one station manager was jailed in protest, and the staff, in protest at 
sweeping proposed changes of another station manager, seized the studio 
facilities, then located in a deconsecrated church, as well as the transmitter, 
located atop the Empire State Building.[2] During the 1960s the station 
hosted innumerable anti-establishment causes, including anti-war activists, 
feminists, kids lib, early Firesign Theater comedy, and complete-album 
music overnight.[citation needed] Notable were the continual direct daily 
coverage of the Vietnam war, including the daily body count, their refusal 
to stop playing Janis Ian's song about interracial relationships "Society's 
Child" and their live coverage of various bra-burning conventions.[citation 
needed] WBAI played a major role in the evolution and development of the 
counterculture in the 1960s and early 1970s.[3] Arlo Guthrie's "Alice's 
Restaurant" was first broadcast on Radio Unnameable, Bob Fass’ freeform 
radio program on WBAI, a program which itself in many ways created, explored, 
and defined the possibilities of the form.[4] The station covered the 1968 
seizure of the Columbia University campus live and uninterrupted, as well 
as innumerable anti-war protests.[citation needed] With its signal reaching 
nearly 70 miles beyond New York City, its reach and influence, both direct 
and indirect, were significant.[citation needed] Among the station's weekly 
commentators in the 1960s were author Ayn Rand, British politician/playwright 
Sir Stephen King-Hall, and author Dennis Wholley.[citation needed] The 
1964 Political conventions were "covered" satirically on WBAI by Severn 
Darden, Elaine May, Burns and Schreiber, David Amram, Julie Harris, Taylor 
Mead, and members of The Second City improvisational group.[citation needed] 
The station, under Music Directors John Corigliano, Ann McMillan and, later 
Eric Salzman, aired an annual 23-hour nonstop presentation of Richard Wagner’s 
Ring Cycle, as recorded at the Bayreuth Festival the year before, and produced 
live studio performances of emerging artists in its studios.[citation needed] 
Interviews with prominent figures in literature and the arts, as well as 
original dramatic productions and radio adaptations were also regular program 
offerings.[citation needed] In 1970, Kathy Dobkin, Milton Hoffman, and 
Francie Camper produced an unprecedented, critically acclaimed 4½ day round-the-clock 
reading of Tolstoy's War And Peace.[citation needed] The epic novel was 
read cover to cover by more than 200 people—including a large number of 
international celebrities from various fields.[citation needed] "Newsweek" 
called this broadcast "one of the more mind-blowing 'firsts' in the history 
of the media". The complete reading (over 200 audio tapes) was the first 
Pacifica program to be selected for inclusion in the permanent collection 
of the Museum of Broadcasting in NYC.[citation needed] In 1973, the station 
broadcast comedian George Carlin's infamous Filthy Words routine uncensored. 
WBAI's broadcast of Filthy Words became a landmark moment in the history 
of free speech. In a 1978 milestone in the station's contentious and unruly 
history, WBAI lost a 5-to-4 U.S. Supreme Court decision (FCC v. Pacifica 
Foundation) that to this day has defined the power of the government over 
broadcast material it calls indecent.[5] In 1974 WBAI program director 
Marnie Mueller asked Charles Ruas to become director of arts programming.[citation 
needed] Thus the station, already at the forefront of the counterculture 
and anti-war protest, also became a platform for New York’s avant-garde 
in theater, music, performance, art, and poetry.[citation needed] When 
the downtown avant-garde opera A Letter to Queen Victoria by Philip Glass 
and Robert Wilson opened at the Metropolitan Opera, the station was right 
there to tape excerpts in rehearsals for broadcast.[citation needed] Ruas 
initiated a year-long series on Marguerite Young’s epic novel Miss McIntosh, 
My Darling.[citation needed] These readings were transformed into performances 
by Rob Wynne, who scored them with a complex collage of sound effects, 
music, and opera.[citation needed] The participants included Anaïs Nin, 
Marian Seldes, Alice Playten, H. M. Koutoukas, Leo Lerman, Michael Wagger, 
Novella Nelson, Osceola Archer, Owen Dodson, Wyatt Cooper, Michael Higgins, 
Anne Fremantle, Peggy Cass, Ruth Ford, Earle Hyman and Daisy Alden.[citation 
needed] When William Burroughs returned to the United States from Tangier, 
Ruas invited him to present a retrospective of all his works.[citation 
needed] The series consisted of four programs, beginning with Junkie and 
followed by The Yage Letters, read by Burroughs and Allen Ginsburg, The 
Last Words of Dutch Schultz, and, finally, Naked Lunch.[citation needed] 
Bill Kortum oversaw this series as well as retrospectives of the works 
of Jerzy Kosinski and Donald Barthelme, co-produced with Judith Sherman, 
the station’s music director.[citation needed] A semester of Allen Ginsberg’s 
poetry seminar held at the Naropa Institute in Colorado was presented by 
Ruas, and for many years the station covered the annual New Year’s Eve 
celebratory poetry marathon at St. Mark’s Church.[citation needed] The 
day the Vietnam War ended, poet Muriel Rukeyser came to the station to 
read her poem on peace.[citation needed] Ruas inaugurated the Audio Experimental 
Theater, a series presenting the works of avant-garde artists: Meredith 
Monk, Yvonne Rainer, Ed Bowes, Michael Newman, Joan Schwartz, Benjamin 
Folkman, Vito Acconci, Charles Ludlum, Jacques Levy, Willoughby Sharp, 
John Cage, Robert Wilson, Philip Glass, Richard Foreman, and Joan Jonas.[citation 
needed] In drama, the station defended Tennessee Williams against his critics 
during his last years by covering his Memoirs and broadcasting a production 
of Two-Character Play.[citation needed] Other dramatists whose works were 
featured included Jean-Claude van Itallie, Richard Scheckner, Andrei Serban, 
and Elizabeth Swados.[citation needed] Ruas initiated interview programs 
featuring nonfiction writers discussing their fields of expertise—Buckminster 
Fuller, Thor Heyerdahl, Ed Sanders, Jonathan Kozol and Nigel Nicholson.[citation 
needed] Each of the arts had weekly coverage.[citation needed] Courtney 
Callender’s Getting Around covered the cultural scene.[citation needed] 
Moira Hudson was the dance critic.[citation needed] The visual arts critics 
were John Perreault, Cindy Nemser, Liza Baer, Joe Giordano, Judith Vivell, 
Kenneth Koch, and Les Levine.[citation needed] Susan Howe produced a weekly 
poetry program presenting the works of John Ashbery, W. S. Merwin, Maureen 
Owen, Charles Reznikoff, Rebecca Wright, Ron Padgett, Carter Ratcliff, 
John Hollander, Anne Waldman, Helen Adam, Audre Lorde, Michael Brownstein, 
Mary Ferrari, and Muriel Rukeyser.[citation needed] She also produced specials 
featuring William Carlos Williams, V. R. Lang, Jack Spicer, Louise Bogan, 
Paul Metcalf, Jonathan Williams, Harry Mathews, and James Laughlin.[citation 
needed] John Giorno presented his 5-part series Dial-a-Poem Poets.[citation 
needed] For a few years WBAI became a cultural force as these programs 
were disseminated nationally through the Pacifica Network.[citation needed] 
With the decline of the arc of history represented by the 1960s and 1970s, 
the station turned against itself.[citation needed] A new board of directors 
determined a new agenda, and, against the staff resistance provoked by 
what was known internally as The Crisis, and manifest in the seizure and 
occupation of the facilities, a different station emerged, one which attempted 
to offer an alternative perspective within the mainstream commercial aesthetic 
rather than from the outside.[citation needed] In 1998, WBAI moved to the 
tenth floor at 120 Wall Street in the Financial District.[6] In late 2012 
WBAI suffered extensive damages to their offices following the events of 
Hurricane Sandy.[6] The Manhattan offices saw flooding reach the second 
floor, trapping seven staffers inside, and the telephone systems being 
disabled. The devastation by Sandy occurred in the midst of fundraising 
efforts, which ultimately prevented WBAI from acquiring the necessary funds 
to remain operational. As a result of funding and operational difficulties, 
WBAI announced in 2013 it would be moving out of those studios to temporary 
studios of WHCR-FM located in Harlem, a station operated by City College 
of New York (CUNY).[7][6] Lynne Rosen and John Littig, co-hosts of the 
monthly show The Pursuit of Happiness, were found dead on June 3, 2013, 
after committing suicide in their Park Slope home.[8] In June 2013 the 
Corporation for Public Broadcasting suspended payments to WBAI citing accounting 
irregularities and a failure by the station to meet its financial obligations.[9] 
Layoff notices effective July 15 were subsequently issued to the station's 
staff and management.[10][11] On August 9, 2013, Pacifica management announced 
that due to financial problems, WBAI was laying off about two-thirds of 
its staff, effective August 12, 2013. The entire news department was laid 
off.[12] Summer Reese, the interim executive director of the Pacifica Foundation, 
which owns WBAI, said that after talks with SAG-AFTRA, the union that represents 
broadcasting talent, “we will be laying off virtually everyone whose voice 
you recognize on the air,” effective Monday. She corrected that and announced 
the final number was 19 out of the station’s 29 employees, about 66 percent. 
Andrew Phillips, the former general manager of another of Pacifica’s five 
stations, KPFA-FM in Berkeley, California, was appointed WBAI’s interim 
program director. The New York Times reported[13] that the station owes 
$2 million in broadcast fees to Democracy Now! alone, while cash on hand 
was just $23,000. In March 2014 there were assorted rumors that the station 
will be sold or leased or moved, in whole or in part (including their equipment 
and antenna at the Empire State Building[14]) after contentions and firings 
both at WBAI and at Pacifica headquarters.[15] On December 17, 2014 the 
California State Attorney General opened a full and formal investigation 
into the Pacifica Radio Foundation, owner of WBAI, with respect to its 
alleged irregularities as to its finances, violations of California law 
with respect to nonprofit organizations, and violations of its own bylaws.

Minor and Chris Koch reported on the Vietnam War and the Civil Rights struggle.[citation 
needed] Former Station Manager Chris Albertson returned to the music field, 
spent 28 years as Contributing Editor to Stereo Review and authored a biography 
of Bessie Smith.[citation needed] The Apple specialist business Tekserve 
was originally composed of former WBAI employees David Lerner, Dick Demenus, 
and Mike Edl.[citation needed] Through the 1970s, David Rapkin, James Irsay 
and Charles Potter produced some of the finest American radio drama of 
the post "Golden Age", some is still found in the Pacifica Archive, notable, 
an adaptation of Dalton Trumbo's Johnny Got His Gun.[citation needed] In 
the 1980s, new studios at 505 Eighth Avenue were built by Miles Smith who, 
along with WBAI alumna Jane Pipik, is now working at WGBH in Boston.[16] 
About the same time Dennis Coleman, Jim Freund, Sharon Griffiths, Kathy 
O'Connell, Sharon Mattlin, Sidney Smith, Paul Wunder, Max Schmid and Simon 
Loekle [17] formed EMRA, the "Early Morning Radio Alliance".[citation needed] 
Loekle also created the Shakespeare Liberation Front and with Stephen Erickson 
produced radio dramas, dramatic readings and documentaries – notably, Tale 
of the Monkey King and the Communist Manifesto.[citation needed] Loekle 
died November 28th 2015 of complications from pancreatic cancer. Freund 
(Hour of the Wolf), Smith, and Schmid are still at the station.[citation 
needed] After retiring as a NYC High School science teacher, Paul Wunder, 
aka "Doctor Science", became Operations Director, a position he held until 
his death.[citation needed] Erickson, who became program director in 1984 
but was battered by charges of racism (The Village Voice, 1985) when he 
attempted to change the program schedule, moved to Germany where he produced 
radio documentaries and taught documentary production for the EBU Radio 
Master School until 2011.[18] Shelton Walden hosted "Walden's Pond" a public 
affairs program for 25 years. Walden also served as Chief Announcer and 
Operations Director during his time at the station. Democracy Now! is presently 
WBAI’s most widely distributed offering. Gary Null hosts the Gary Null 
Show, Monday through Thursday at noon. A news/talk show that mixes humor 
and public affairs The Julianna Forlano Show hosted by Brooklyn College 
Professor Julianna Forlano airs at 6 p.m, Tuesdays and Thursdays. The station 
also hosts shows such as Golden Age of Radio serials, Free Speech Radio 
News, and Wakeup Call (WBAI's morning drive time news magazine presented 
by several hosts including Mario Murillo and Esther Armah).[citation needed] 
Also included is a regular arts program, The Artsy Fartsy Show with host 
Barika Taheer Edwards.[citation needed] Others are the weekly Off The Hook, 
a program by the 2600 hacker group about the societal implications of communications 
& security technology and related laws.[19] Music programming includes 
Peter Bochan's All Mixed Up, Music of the Grateful Dead and more on Morning 
Dew and Jeannie Hopper's Liquid Sound Lounge on Saturdays, "Through The 
Opera Glass" and Chris Whent's "Hear of a Sunday Morning" on Sunday mornings, 
Chico Alvarez's New World Gallery on Sunday afternoons and David Kenney's 
Everything Old Is New Again, a mix of pop and jazz standards, show tunes, 
cabaret and interviews on Sunday evenings.[citation needed] Longtime overnight 
host Bob Fass continues to host Radio Unnameable in the late Friday night 
time slot as he has since the 1960s. WBAI also offers programming and specials 
targeted primarily toward cultural audience segments that are typically 
under-served by most commercial media outlets.[citation needed] Examples 
include: In 2015 WBAI moved to new studios and offices at 388 Atlantic 
Avenue in the Boerum Hill section of Brooklyn. WBAI's FM subcarrier (SCA) 
(at 67.65 kHz) is leased to Radio Maria New York which airs Catholic programming 
in both Italian and Spanish languages.[citation needed] 1 = Clear-channel
