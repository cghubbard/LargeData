West End Park was a baseball park in Houston from 1905 to the 1940s. It 
was the primary ballpark for the city when it was constructed, and the 
city's first venue for Negro Major League games.[1][2][3] From 1909 through 
1910 and again in 1915, it also served as the spring training facility 
of the St. Louis Browns (known today as the Baltimore Orioles) as well 
as the 1914 New York Yankees of the American League and the 1906 through 
1908 St. Louis Cardinals of the National League in Major League Baseball. 
After its use by its primary tenant, the Houston Buffaloes of the Texas 
League, the ballpark was sold to what is now known as the Houston Independent 
School District for its use until it was demolished. Contrary to its name, 
the ballpark's location was not in West End, Houston, as that area had 
not yet been specifically designated as "West End", and the current municipal 
recreational park of the same has no relation to the ballpark. Instead, 
West End Park was located in the freedmen's town area of the Fourth Ward, 
with its entrance at Andrews and Heiner Streets. It was bounded by Andrews 
Street (third base line), Heiner Street (first base line), and Howe streets 
(left field fence). Today, the Interstate 45 "Pierce Elevated" passes over 
the area where the ballpark was, from Andrews Street to the Bagby Street 
exit.[1][4] Construction of a new ballpark in Houston became necessary 
after the redevelopment of Herald Park into a residential neighborhood 
during the 1904 season.[5] While a temporary ballpark was used to host 
the rest of games for that season, poor transportation availability made 
travel difficult, and a new ballpark in the Westmoreland neighborhood was 
announced to be finished for 1905. On January 9, 1905, the Houston Buffaloes 
organization was given authorization by the Houston City Council for construction 
to begin on West End Park.[6] During construction, a sandy soil was used 
for the field, so as to absorb moisture more easily.[7] By March 15, the 
ball park's construction was nearly completed only lacking paint on the 
grandstand and field preparation. West End Park opened on April 1, 1905 
as an unnamed park with an exhibition game between Houston and the Baton 
Rouge Cajuns of the Cotton States League.[8] Houston lost, 0–2. The ballpark 
later received its name through a contest conducted by a committee consisting 
of the Houston Chronicle sports editor, the Houston Post baseball editor, 
and South Texas League President Bliss P. Gorham. The suggested name chosen 
would allow its submitter to receive a season ticket to the new park.[9] 
Ultimately, John T. Schulte of 1018 LaBranch Street was chosen as the winner 
through a unanimous committee vote on April 16, 1905.[10][11] Other names 
considered included "San Jacinto Park", "Dick Dowling Park", "San Felipe 
Park", "Washington Park", and "Gorham Park" among others. West End Park 
received major renovations in late 1908 when the Houston Buffaloes ownership 
increased capacity to the grandstand, added sidewalks and other pavement, 
and introduced a new grass diamond.[12] During their annual festival, the 
No-Tsu-Oh Carnival Association had originally erected the stands at the 
ballpark as a temporary measure, but they were soon purchased by the Buffaloes 
to expand the grandstand.[13] Other materials used for renovations, such 
as fences and more bleachers were purchased from nearby Marmion Park. On 
December 5, 1911, the grandstand of West End Park was destroyed by a fire. 
The losses were estimated to exceed $5,000.[14] The grandstand roof was 
blown off several years later when a storm hit Houston on November 25, 
1915.[15] On January 5, 1927, Sam Breadon, then owner of the team, announced 
that he wanted to purchase land from the City of Houston to construct a 
new ballpark.[16] On January 18, it was announced that the location had 
been purchased in the East End.[17] Houston's new ballpark, Buffalo Stadium 
was then constructed for the 1928 season, and the Buffaloes moved from 
West End Park to the new stadium. On August 1, 1928, the Houston Board 
of Education officially purchased the park from the Houston Baseball Association 
for $100,000 for use as school athletic fields.[18] The park continued 
under the same name and continued to be used for secondary school, amateur 
and collegiate athletics, and for Negro league baseball games.[19] With 
football being the major event for Houston public schools, West End Park 
was eventually replaced when Public School Stadium (later known as "Robertson 
Stadium") opened in 1942. In the late 1940s and early 1950s, most of the 
land occupied by the ballpark was used for various purposes when Heiner 
Street was extended and the Gulf Freeway was connected to downtown. The 
Sells Floto Circus used the West End Park grounds for their show when they 
came to Houston in September 1907.[20] West End Park was often used as 
a site for American football games. In 1908, the ballpark was the host 
of what was dubbed the "state championship" in high school football with 
a game between Houston High School and San Antonio High School.[21] This 
championship preceded the formation of the University Interscholastic League 
(UIL) that governs Texas high school extracurricular activities today. 
From 1908 through 1911, the Texas Longhorns and Texas A&M Aggies played 
football games at West End Park during Houston's annual No-Tsu-Oh festival.[22] 
On Thanksgiving of 1910, Texas A&M played Tulane there.[23] West End Park 
was also the venue of the inaugural football game of the Rice Owls against 
Houston High School in 1912.[1][24][25][26] Rice later hosted Notre Dame, 
Texas A&M, and LSU in football competitions at the ballpark in the 1915 
season.[27][28] In 1929 the first edition of the Prairie View Bowl, which 
was the first bowl game played by historically black colleges and universities, 
took place at the ballpark between the Prairie View A&M Panthers and Atlanta 
Lions.[29] West End Park was served by the Houston Electric Company's San 
Felipe line, which provided streetcar access during its time.[30] With 
transfers from Houston's Union Station and Grand Central Station, this 
allowed for direct public transportation using interurban lines such as 
the Galveston–Houston Electric Railway and Houston North Shore Railway.[31]
