"Big Apple" is a nickname for New York City. It was first popularized in 
the 1920s by John J. Fitz Gerald, a sports writer for the New York Morning 
Telegraph. Its popularity since the 1970s is due to a promotional campaign 
by the New York Convention and Visitors Bureau, known now as NYC & Company. 
Although the history of Big Apple was once thought a mystery,[1] research 
– primarily by amateur etymologist Barry Popik[2] and Gerald Cohen of Missouri 
University of Science and Technology[3] – has provided a reasonably clear 
picture of the term's history. Previously, there were a number of false 
etymologies,[4] including a claim that the term derived from a New York 
brothel whose madam was known as Eve.[5] This was subsequently exposed 
as a hoax[6] and has been replaced on the source website with more accurate 
information.[7] The earliest citation for "big apple" is the 1909 book 
The Wayfarer in New York by Edward S. Martin, writing: Kansas is apt to 
see in New York a greedy city.... It inclines to think that the big apple 
gets a disproportionate share of the national sap.[8][9] William Safire 
considered this the coinage, but the Random House Dictionary of American 
Slang considers the usage "metaphorical or perhaps proverbial, rather than 
a concrete example of the later slang term".[citation needed] In the early 
1920s, "apple" was used in reference to the many racing courses in and 
around New York City.[citation needed] Apple referred to the prizes being 
awarded for the races – as these were important races, the rewards were 
substantial.[citation needed] The Big Apple was first popularized as a 
reference to New York City by John J. Fitz Gerald in a number of New York 
Morning Telegraph articles in the 1920s in reference to New York horse-racing.[citation 
needed] The earliest of these was a casual reference on May 3, 1921: J. 
P. Smith, with Tippity Witchet and others of the L. T. Bauer string, is 
scheduled to start for "the big apple" to-morrow after a most prosperous 
Spring campaign at Bowie and Havre de Grace.[10] Fitz Gerald referred to 
the "big apple" frequently thereafter.[11] He explained his use in a February 
18, 1924, column under the headline "Around the Big Apple": The Big Apple. 
The dream of every lad that ever threw a leg over a thoroughbred and the 
goal of all horsemen. There's only one Big Apple. That's New York.[12] 
Fitz Gerald's reference to the "dusky" stable hands suggests the term's 
origin may lie in African-American culture. Support for this is found in 
the Chicago Defender, an African-American newspaper that had a national 
circulation. “Ragtime” Billy Tucker, a vaudeville/ragtime performer and 
writer for the Defender, there used "big apple" to refer to New York in 
a non-horse-racing context on September 16, 1922: I trust your trip to 
'the big apple' (New York) was a huge success and only wish that I had 
been able to make it with you.[13] Tucker had earlier used "Big Apple" 
as a reference to a different city, Los Angeles. It is possible that the 
writer simply understood "Big Apple" as an appropriate nickname for any 
large city: Dear Pal, Tony: No, Ragtime Billy Tucker hasn't dropped completely 
out of existence, but is still in the 'Big Apple', Los Angeles.[13] By 
the late 1920s, New York writers other than Fitz Gerald were starting to 
use "Big Apple" and were using it outside of a horse-racing context.[14] 
"The Big Apple" was a popular song[15] and dance[16] in the 1930s. Walter 
Winchell and other writers continued to use the name in the 1940s and 1950s.[17] 
By the 1960s, "the Big Apple" was known only as an old name for New York.[18] 
In the early 1970s, however, the New York Convention and Visitors Bureau 
(now NYC & Company, the official marketing and tourism organization for 
New York City),[19] under the leadership of its president, Charles Gillett, 
began promoting "the Big Apple" for the city.[20] It has remained popular 
since then.[21] Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani in 1997 signed legislation designating 
the southwest corner of West 54th Street and Broadway, the corner on which 
John J. Fitz Gerald lived from 1934 to 1963, as "Big Apple Corner".[22] 
The term "big apple" was used by Frank Sinatra, who was speaking to opera 
singer Dorothy Kirsten, his co-star in a March 28, 1950 airing of the late 
1940s-early 1950s NBC radio program Light Up Time".[citation needed] In 
Evita, Buenos Aires is referred to as "B.A., Buenos Aires, Big Apple" in 
the song "Eva, Beware of the City". This reference was invented by lyricist 
Tim Rice and does not reflect preexisting use. The New York Mets have featured 
a "Home Run Apple" that rises whenever a Mets player hits a home run. It 
has become a symbol of the Mets baseball team, recognized throughout Major 
League Baseball as an iconic feature of the Mets' stadiums. It first appeared 
in Shea Stadium, and the original can still be seen on display at Citi 
Field, outside the Jackie Robinson Rotunda. Citi Field now uses a new apple, 
one that is nearly four times the size of the original.[citation needed] 
Applejack in My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic has a prized apple which 
is literally the Big Apple she keeps in her home by Equestria, the Apple 
Orchard, as shown in the episodes "Bats" and "Do Princesses Dream of Magic
