Thomas Anthony "Tom" Henke (born December 21, 1957[1]), nicknamed "The 
Terminator" because of his ability and success as a closer,[2] is a former 
Major League Baseball relief pitcher. He was one of the most dominant and 
feared closers during the late 1980s and early 1990s, pitching for the 
Texas Rangers (1982–1984, 1993–1994), Toronto Blue Jays (1985–1992), and 
St. Louis Cardinals (1995). On the mound, Henke was easily recognizable 
by the large-rimmed glasses he wore at a time when many players began using 
contact lenses.[3] At a height of 6' 5", he cast an imposing figure and 
dominated batters with his hard fastball early in the count, and his forkball 
for the strikeout. Henke struck out 9.8 batters per 9 innings pitched over 
his career. Tom Henke was born in Kansas City, Missouri, and started out 
throwing every night to his father, who caught his pitches while sitting 
on a five-gallon bucket. "Every kid should have a dad like that", Henke 
said. A couple of friends, who believed he had pro-calibre stuff told him 
they would buy the beer if he showed up at a talent evaluation opportunity; 
he did and was noticed.[4] Henke was first drafted on June 5, 1979, by 
the Seattle Mariners in the 20th round of the 1979 Major League Baseball 
draft, but did not sign. On January 11, 1980, he was drafted by the Chicago 
Cubs in the 1st round (24th pick) of the 1980 MLB draft (January Secondary), 
but again didn't sign. Finally he signed with the Texas Rangers after being 
selected in the 4th round of the 1980 amateur draft (June Secondary).[5] 
After signing with the Rangers, Henke was then assigned to the Gulf Coast 
League Rangers in the Gulf Coast League where he had immediate success, 
going 3-3 with a 0.95 ERA in 38 innings, earning him a promotion to the 
Single-A Asheville Tourists in the South Atlantic League.[6] In 1981, he 
started the season back at Asheville where his 8-6 record with 3 saves 
and 2.93 ERA in 92 innings earned him a promotion to the AA Tulsa Drillers 
in the Texas League. Henke spent the entire 1982 season back at Tulsa despite 
putting up similarly impressive numbers (14 saves with a 2.67 ERA and 100 
strikeouts in 87 2/3 innings). He did however see time with the Rangers 
at the end of the season and made his major league debut on September 10. 
In 1983, Henke would finally be promoted to Oklahoma City in the American 
Association, but again his development would stall and he would spend much 
of the next three seasons at AAA. Despite strong numbers in the minors 
and similar numbers during his intermittent times in Texas, Henke was labelled 
as a pitcher who had trouble finding the strike zone (finishing with 20 
walks in 28 1/3 innings with the Rangers in 1984) and appeared to be the 
odd man out in the Rangers' bullpen.[7] However, Henke would get his chance 
when the Toronto Blue Jays chose him from the Rangers on January 24, 1985 
as a Free Agent compensation pick. After blazing through the hitters at 
AAA Syracuse to the tune of a 0.88 ERA and 18 saves in 51 1/3 innings over 
38 appearances, he was promoted to Toronto and never looked back, not allowing 
a run in his first 11 appearances and finished the season with 13 saves.[8] 
Henke was then made the team's closer in 1986, and played a major role 
in the Toronto Blue Jays' successful run from the mid-1980s to early 1990s, 
finishing with 217 saves with the team[9] and helping Toronto to its first 
championship, a six-game defeat of the Atlanta Braves in the 1992 World 
Series. Over his 14-year career, Henke was named to the All-Star team twice: 
1987, when he led the American League with 34 saves and 62 games finished, 
and 1995, his last season, and only season in the National League. He also 
won the Rolaids Relief Man of the Year Award in 1995.[10] Despite having 
just finished one of the best seasons of his career, Henke decided to retire 
at the end of the 1995 season. Henke was the seventh reliever to eclipse 
the 300 saves plateau[8] and as of June 2013, his 311 career saves rank 
19th all-time on the career list.[7] Henke's nickname, "The Terminator", 
was given to him by teammate John Cerutti in 1985 after they saw the movie 
The Terminator together.[11] Henke currently lives on his 1,000 acres (4.0 km2) 
farm in Taos, Missouri with his family, wife Kathy and children, Linsay, 
Ryan, Kim, and Amanda (who has Down syndrome).[7][12][13] Since 1995, Henke 
has teamed with the Jefferson City, Missouri Cosmo Club to hold the annual 
Tom Henke Charity Classic Golf Tournament which raises money for the Special 
Learning Center, a school for handicapped children.[14] He also volunteers 
with Down syndrome charities, the Special Olympics and the Cancer Society, 
and is on the board of directors with the Missouri Department of Mental 
Health.[13] Henke met his wife Kathy in college. "My catcher one day said, 
'Let's go to McDonald's' and Kathy was working there at the time", Henke 
said. "She sold me a Big Mac and I was done. She was tall and athletic 
and I was pretty shy. Turns out we had a class together and started talking".[4] 
Coming from a small town with a population under 900, Henke admitted that 
he initially had to overcome a fear of big cities. "I hated going to New 
York City", he said. "I felt like a fish out of water there. I’d go from 
the hotel to Yankee Stadium and that's it. It took me two or three years 
before I went out to visit the Statue of Liberty and I never took the subway." 
On living in Toronto, Henke said "I rented an apartment downtown for two 
or three years and that wasn’t for me. I’m just a guy from a small town 
and that's where I’m most comfortable".[4] On January 24, 2011, Henke was 
named to the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame and was inducted into the Hall 
during a ceremony at St Marys, Ontario on June 18, 2011.[9][15] Italics
