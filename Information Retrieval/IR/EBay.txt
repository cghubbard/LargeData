eBay Inc. (/ˈiːˌbeɪ/ ɪ-B-ay;) is an American multinational corporation 
and e-commerce company, providing consumer-to-consumer and business-to-consumer 
sales services via the Internet. It is headquartered in San Jose, California. 
eBay was founded by Pierre Omidyar in 1995, and became a notable success 
story of the dot-com bubble. Today it is a multibillion-dollar business 
with operations localized in over 30 countries.[5] The company manages 
eBay.com, an online auction and shopping website in which people and businesses 
buy and sell a broad variety of goods and services worldwide. In addition 
to its auction-style sales, the website has since expanded to include "Buy 
It Now" shopping; shopping by UPC, ISBN, or other kind of SKU (via Half.com); 
online classified advertisements (via Kijiji or eBay Classifieds); online 
event ticket trading (via StubHub); and other services. It previously offered 
online money transfers (via PayPal),[6] which was a wholly owned subsidiary 
of eBay from 2002 until 2015. The website is free to use for buyers, but 
sellers are charged fees for listing items and again when those items are 
sold.[7] The AuctionWeb was founded in California on September 3, 1995 
by French-born Iranian-American computer programmer Pierre Omidyar (born 
June 21, 1967) as part of a larger personal site.[8] One of the first items 
sold on AuctionWeb was a broken laser pointer for $14.83. Astonished, Omidyar 
contacted the winning bidder to ask if he understood that the laser pointer 
was broken. In his responding email, the buyer explained: "I'm a collector 
of broken laser pointers."[9] The frequently repeated story that eBay was 
founded to help Omidyar's fiancée trade Pez candy dispensers was fabricated 
by a public relations manager in 1997 to interest the media, which were 
not interested in the company's previous explanation about wanting to create 
a "perfect market".[10] This was revealed in Adam Cohen's book, The Perfect 
Store (2002),[8] and confirmed by eBay.[10] Reportedly, eBay was simply 
a side hobby for Omidyar until his Internet service provider informed him 
he would need to upgrade to a business account due to the high volume of 
traffic to his website. The resulting price increase (from $30/month to 
$250) forced him to start charging those who used eBay, and was not met 
with any animosity.[citation needed] It resulted in the hiring of Chris 
Agarpao as eBay's first employee to handle the number of checks coming 
in for fees.[citation needed] Jeffrey Skoll was hired as the first president 
of the company in early 1996. In November 1996, eBay entered into its first 
third-party licensing deal, with a company called Electronic Travel Auction 
to use SmartMarket Technology to sell plane tickets and other travel products. 
Growth was phenomenal; in January 1997 the site hosted 2,000,000 auctions, 
compared with 250,000 during the whole of 1996.[11] The company officially 
changed the name of its service from AuctionWeb to eBay in September 1997. 
Originally, the site belonged to Echo Bay Technology Group, Omidyar's consulting 
firm. Omidyar had tried to register the domain name echobay.com, but found 
it already taken by the Echo Bay Mines, a gold mining company,[12] so he 
shortened it to his second choice, eBay.com.[13] In 1997, the company received 
$6.7 million in funding from the venture capital firm Benchmark Capital.[14] 
Meg Whitman was hired as eBay President and CEO in March 1998. At the time, 
the company had 30 employees,[15] half a million users and revenues of 
$4.7 million in the United States.[citation needed] eBay went public on 
September 21, 1998,[16] and both Omidyar and Skoll became instant billionaires. 
eBay's target share price of $18 was all but ignored as the price went 
to $53.50 on the first day of trading.[17] As the company expanded product 
categories beyond collectibles into almost any saleable item, business 
grew quickly.[9] In February 2002, the company purchased iBazar, a similar 
European auction web site founded in 1998,[citation needed] and then bought 
PayPal on October 3, 2002.[18] By early 2008, the company had expanded 
worldwide, counted hundreds of millions of registered users, 15,000+ employees 
and revenues of almost $7.7 billion.[19] After nearly ten years at eBay, 
Whitman decided to enter politics. On January 23, 2008, the company announced 
that Whitman would step down on March 31, 2008 and John Donahoe was selected 
to become President and CEO.[20] Whitman remained on the Board of Directors 
and continued to advise Donahoe through 2008. In late 2009, eBay completed 
the sale of Skype for $2.75 billion, but will still own 30% equity in the 
company.[21] In 2012 eBay was charged by the United States Department of 
Justice with entering into non-solicitation agreements with other technology 
companies involving their highly skilled employees.[22] On September 30, 
2014, eBay announced it would spinoff PayPal into a separate publicly traded 
company, a demand made nine months prior by activist hedge fund magnate 
Carl Icahn. The spinoff completed on July 18, 2015. eBay’s then chief executive, 
John Donahoe, stepped down from that role.[23][24][25] As of November 2014, 
the board of directors was as follows:[26] In September 2012, eBay introduced 
a new logo set in Univers,[27] installed on the website on October 10, 
2012. 1995–2012 2012–present eBay generates revenue by a complex system 
of fees for services, listing product features, and a Final Value Fee for 
sales proceeds by sellers. As of November 2012, the U.S.-based eBay.com 
charges $0.10 to $2, based on the opening or reserve price, as an insertion 
fee for a basic auction-style listing without any adornments. The Final 
Value Fee amounts to 10% of the total amount of the sale, which is the 
price of the item plus shipping charges.[28] Fixed-price listings have 
an insertion fee of $0.30, and the final value fee varies based on category 
and total amount of the sale (e.g., 13% for DVDs & Movies up to $50).[29] 
The UK-based ebay.co.uk[30] takes from £0.15 to a maximum rate of £3 per 
£100 for an ordinary listing and up to 10% of the final price. Reduced 
Final Value Fees are available to business registered customers. Under 
U.S. law, a state cannot require sellers located outside the state to collect 
a sales tax, making purchases more attractive to buyers. Although some 
state laws require resident purchasers to pay use tax on out-of-state purchases, 
it is not a common practice.[citation needed] However, sellers that operate 
as a business do follow state tax regulations on eBay transactions.[31][32] 
However Value Added Tax (VAT), the EU countries' sales tax, is different. 
eBay requires sellers to include the VAT element in their listing price 
and not as an add-on and thus profits by collecting fees based not only 
on the sale price "ex VAT" but also on the VAT.[33] In a similar manner 
eBay also charges its Final Value Fees on all shipping charges. The company's 
business strategy includes increasing international trade.[34][35] eBay 
has already expanded to over two dozen countries, including China and India. 
Strategic international expansion has failed in Taiwan and Japan, where 
Yahoo! had a head start, and New Zealand, where Trade Me is the dominant 
online auction website. eBay also notably failed in China due to competition 
from local rival Taobao.[36] eBay entered the Chinese market in 2002 and 
shut down its Chinese site in 2007.[37] In its Q1 2008 results, total payment 
volume via PayPal increased 17%, but off the eBay auction site it was up 
61%.[38] For most listing categories, eBay sellers are permitted to offer 
a variety of payment systems such as Escrow.com,[39] PayPal, Paymate, Propay, 
and Skrill.[40] Propay and Skrill were banned effective September 27, 2015, 
citing low usage.[41] Escrow.com is eBay's approved escrow site. The transactions 
processed through Escrow.com largely are in relation to eBay Motors; however, 
they are not restricted to this type of listing.[39] eBay runs an affiliate 
program under the name eBay Partner Network.[42] eBay affiliate marketers 
were originally paid a percentage of the eBay seller's transaction fees, 
with commissions ranging from 50% to 75% of the fees paid for an item purchased. 
In October 2009, eBay changed to an affiliate payout system that it calls 
Quality Click Pricing, in which affiliates are paid an amount determined 
by an undisclosed algorithm. The total earnings amount is then divided 
by the number of clicks the affiliate sent to eBay and is reported as Earnings 
Per Click, or EPC. In October 2013, ePN launched a new pricing model. The 
new model is more transparent, and is based on category-level base commission 
rates with bonuses available for referring new and reactivated buyers.[43] 
On April 18, 2012 eBay reported a 29% Q1 revenue increase to $3.3 billion 
compared to their Q1 in 2011. Net income was reported to be at $570 million 
for the quarter.[44] On May 8, 2008, eBay announced the opening of its 
newest building on the company's North Campus in San Jose, which is the 
first structure in the city to be built from the ground up to LEED Gold 
standards.[45] The building, the first the company had built in its 13-year 
existence, uses an array of 3,248 solar panels, spanning 60,000 square 
feet (5,600 m2), and providing 650 kilowatts of power to eBay's campus.[46][47] 
The array can supply 15–18% of the company's total energy requirements, 
reducing the amount of greenhouse gases that would be produced to create 
that energy by other means.[46] SolarCity, the company responsible for 
designing the array, estimates that the solar panels installed on eBay's 
campus will prevent 37 million pounds of carbon dioxide from being released 
into the environment as a result of replaced power production over the 
next three decades. Creating an equivalent impact to remove the same amount 
of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere would require planting 322 acres 
(1.30 km2) of trees.[47] The design of the building also incorporates other 
elements to reduce its impact on the environment. The building is equipped 
with a lighting system that detects natural ambient light sources and automatically 
dims artificial lighting to save 39% of the power usually required to light 
an office building. eBay's newest building also reduces demand on local 
water supplies by incorporating an eco-friendly irrigation system, and 
low-flow shower heads and faucets. Even during construction, more than 
75% of the waste from construction was recycled. eBay also runs buses between 
San Francisco and the San Jose campus to reduce the number of commuting 
vehicles.[45] In 2014, eBay and several other Oregon businesses signed 
the Oregon Business Climate Declaration to promote local job growth and 
slow carbon pollution.[48] StubHub was acquired by eBay in January 2007 
for a reported $310 million.[49][50][51][52] According to CNN Money, 2007 
was a very successful year for the company, handling five million individual 
transactions, more than in the previous six years combined of its history.[53] 
Staffing at StubHub had increased to 350 workers by the time of the sale.[52] 
Eight months after the acquisition, StubHub reached an exclusive agreement 
with Major League Baseball (MLB).[53] They get a piece of the 25% in commissions 
StubHub earns on either end of a season tiy in 2007, alleging "intentional 
interference" with Ticketmaster's contractual rights.[54] eBay Inc. acquired 
Skype in 2005[55] and significantly expanded its customer base to more 
than 480 million registered users worldwide. To focus on its core e-commerce 
and payments businesses, eBay Inc. sold a majority stake in Skype in November 
2009, retaining a minority investment in the company.[56] In May 10, 2011, 
Microsoft announced that they had acquired Skype for $8.5 billion.[57] 
In the summer of 2004, eBay acknowledged that it had acquired 25% of classified 
listings website Craigslist. Former Craigslist executive Phillip Knowlton 
was the seller, and he insisted that his former employer was aware of his 
plans to divest his holdings. Initially, eBay assured Craigslist that they 
would not ask the company to change the way it does business. eBay spokesman 
Hani Durzy stated that the "investment was really for learning purposes; 
it gives us access to learn how the classified market online works."[58] 
In March 2005, eBay launched the classifieds service Kijiji. In April 2008, 
eBay sued Craigslist to "safeguard its four-year financial investment," 
claiming that in January 2008, Craigslist took actions that "unfairly diluted 
eBay's economic interest by more than 10%."[59] Craigslist countersued 
in May 2008 "to remedy the substantial and ongoing harm to fair competition" 
that Craigslist claimed was constituted by eBay's actions as a Craigslist 
shareholder.[60] In September 2010, Delaware Judge William Chandler ruled 
that the actions of Craigslist were unlawful, and that the actions taken 
by Craigslist founders Jim Buckmaster and Craig Newmark had "breached their 
fiduciary duty of loyalty," and restored eBay's stake in the company to 
28.4% from a diluted level of 24.85%.[61] However, the judge dismissed 
eBay's objection to a staggered board provision, citing that Craigslist 
has the right to protect its own trade secrets.[62][63] eBay spokesman 
Michael Jacobson stated "We are very pleased that the court gave eBay what 
it sought from the lawsuit."[61] GittiGidiyor, a subsidiary of eBay, is 
a Turkish e-shopping mall. The company's URL comes from the Turkish translation 
of "Going, going, gone". GittiGidiyor offers a wide variety of products, 
similar to the main eBay website. On October 3, 2002, PayPal became a wholly 
owned subsidiary of eBay.[64] Its corporate headquarters were sited in 
San Jose, California,[65] United States at eBay's North First Street satellite 
office campus. On September 30, 2014, eBay Inc. announced the divestiture 
of PayPal as an independent company, which was completed on July 20, 2015.[66] 
In October of 2016, eBay acquired Corrigon, a visual search engine, for 
less than $30 million.[67] As eBay is a huge, publicly visible market, 
it has attracted a great deal of interest from economists, who have used 
it to analyze many aspects of buying and selling behavior, auction formats, 
etc., and compare these with previous theoretical and empirical findings. 
Just as economists have shown interest in eBay's operations, computer information 
systems researchers have also shown interest in eBay. Recently Michael 
Goul, Chairman of the Computer Information Systems department of the W. 
P. Carey School of Business at Arizona State University, published an academic 
case based on eBay’s big data management and use. In the case, Goul discusses 
how eBay is a data-driven company that processes 50 petabytes of data a 
day.[68] eBay uses a system that allows different departments in the company 
to check out data from their data mart into sandboxes for analysis. According 
to Goul, eBay has already experienced significant business successes through 
its data analytics. To continue improving the business through data-driven 
decision making, eBay employs 5,000 data analysts.[68] In 2006, the accounting 
software company Intuit launched a free web-based donation tracking service 
called ItsDeductible. The service uses data from eBay to help users assign 
a market value to the items they donate.[69] UK's GCHQ has a suite of tools 
for monitoring target use of eBay, named ELATE.[70] Millions of collectibles, 
decor, appliances, computers, furnishings, equipment, domain names,[71] 
vehicles, and other miscellaneous items are listed, bought, or sold daily 
on eBay. In 2006, eBay launched its Business & Industrial category, breaking 
into the industrial surplus business. Generally, anything can be auctioned 
on the site as long as it is not illegal and does not violate the eBay 
Prohibited and Restricted Items policy.[72] Services and intangibles can 
be sold, too. Large international companies, such as IBM, sell their newest 
products and offer services on eBay using competitive auctions and fixed-priced 
storefronts. Separate eBay sites such as eBay US and eBay UK allow the 
users to trade using the local currency. Software developers can create 
applications that integrate with eBay through the eBay API by joining the 
eBay Developers Program.[73] In June 2005, there were more than 15,000 
members in the eBay Developers Program, comprising a broad range of companies 
creating software applications to support eBay buyers and sellers as well 
as eBay Affiliates. Numerous government and police agencies[74] around 
the world now use eBay as well as traditional auctions to dispose of seized 
and confiscated goods. Controversy has arisen over certain items put up 
for bid. For instance, in late 1999, a man offered one of his kidneys for 
auction on eBay, attempting to profit from the potentially lucrative (and, 
in the United States, illegal) market for transplantable human organs.[75] 
On other occasions, people and even entire towns have been listed, often 
as a joke or to garner free publicity.[citation needed] In general, the 
company removes auctions that violate its Terms of Service agreement. Beginning 
in August 2007, eBay required listings in "Video Games" and "Health & Beauty" 
to accept its payment system PayPal and sellers could only accept PayPal 
for payments in the category "Video Games: Consoles".[76] Starting January 
10, 2008, eBay said sellers can only accept PayPal as payment for the categories 
"Computing > Software", "Consumer Electronics > MP3 Players", "Wholesale 
& Job Lots > Mobile & Home Phones", and "Business, Office & Industrial 
> Industrial Supply / MRO".[77] eBay announced that starting in March 2008, 
eBay had added to this requirement that all sellers with fewer than 100 
feedbacks must offer PayPal and no merchant account may be used as an alternative.[78][79] 
This is in addition to the requirement that all sellers from the United 
Kingdom have to offer PayPal.[80] Further, and as noted below, it was a 
requirement to offer PayPal on all listings in Australia and the UK. In 
response to concerns expressed by the Australian Competition and Consumer 
Commission, however, eBay has since removed the policy on the ebay.com.au 
website requiring sellers to offer PayPal as a payment option.[81] On April 
24, 2006, eBay opened its new eBay Express site, which was designed to 
work like a standard Internet shopping site for consumers with United States 
addresses.[82] It closed in 2008.[citation needed] Selected eBay items 
were mirrored on eBay Express, where buyers shopped using a shopping cart 
to purchase from multiple sellers. The UK version was launched to eBay 
members in mid-October 2006, but on January 29, 2008 eBay announced its 
intention to close the site.[83] The German version, eBay Express Germany,[84] 
was also opened in 2006 and closed in 2008. At the 2008 eBay Developer's 
Conference, eBay announced the Selling Manager Applications program (SM 
Apps).[85] The program allows approved developers to integrate their applications 
directly into the eBay.com interface.[86] The applications created by developers 
are available for subscription by eBay members who also subscribe to Selling 
Manager. eBay maintains a number of specialty sites including the discussion 
boards, groups, answer center, chat rooms, and reviews and guides. eBay's 
mobile offerings include SMS alerts, a WAP site, Java ME clients, and mobile 
applications for Windows Phone, Android OS, and Apple iPhone. The initiative 
Choice in eCommerce was founded on May 8, 2013 by several online retailers 
in Berlin, Germany.[87][88][89][90][91][92][93][94][95] The cause was, 
in the view of the initiative, sales bans and online restrictions by individual 
manufacturers. The dealers felt cut off from their main sales channel and 
thus deprived them the opportunity to use online platforms like Amazon, 
eBay, or Rakuten in a competitive market for the benefit of their customers. 
Many unusual items have been placed for sale on eBay, including at least 
two previously undiscovered species, including the Coelopleurus exquisitus 
sea urchin.[96][97] In its earliest days, eBay was nearly unregulated. 
However, as the site grew, it became necessary to restrict or prohibit 
auctions for various items. Note that some of the restrictions relate to 
eBay.com (the U.S. site), while other restrictions apply to specific European 
sites (such as Nazi paraphernalia). Regional laws and regulations may apply 
to the seller or the buyer. Generally, if the sale or ownership of an item 
is regulated or prohibited by one or more states, eBay will not permit 
its listing. Among the hundred or so banned or restricted categories: Currency 
issued by the Nazi German government, including military scripts Historically 
accurate WWII military model kits that have Nazi symbols[102] and items 
depicting the Confederate battle flag.[103] Bidding on eBay (old or new)'s 
auction-style listing is called proxy bidding and is essentially equivalent 
to a Vickrey auction (sealed-bid), with the following exceptions. In 2008, 
eBay implemented a system of seller ratings with four categories. Buyers 
are asked to rate the seller in each of these categories with a score of 
one to five, with five being the highest rating. Unlike the overall feedback 
rating, these ratings are anonymous; neither sellers nor other users learn 
how individual buyers rated the seller. The listings of sellers with a 
rating of 4.3 or below in any of the four rating categories appear lower 
in search results. Power Sellers are required to have scores in each category 
above 4.5.[124][125][126][127][128] In a reversal of roles, on January 
24, 2010 Auctionbytes.com held an open survey in which sellers could rate 
eBay, as well as competing auction and marketplace sites.[129] In the survey, 
users were asked to rank 15 sites based on five criteria: profitability, 
customer service, communication, ease of use, and recommendation. eBay 
was ranked 13th,[130] after other large sites such as Amazon and Craigslist, 
as well as lesser-known selling sites such as Atomic Mall, eCRATER, and 
Ruby Lane. In individual category rankings, eBay was rated the worst of 
all the 15 sites on customer service and communication, and average on 
ease of use. Some respondents stated they would have given eBay a rating 
of 10, three to five years ago. eBay was rated twelfth out of fifteen in 
the Recommended Selling Venue category. Using MissionFish as an arbiter, 
eBay allows sellers to donate a portion of their auction proceeds to a 
charity of the seller's choice. The program is called eBay Giving Works 
in the US, and eBay for Charity[131] in the UK. eBay provides a partial 
refund of seller fees for items sold through charity auctions.[132] As 
of March 4, 2010, $154 million has been raised for U.S. nonprofits by the 
eBay Community since eBay Giving Works began in 2003.[133] Some high-profile 
charity auctions have been advertised on the eBay home page.[134] As of 
June 2010, the highest successful bid on a single item for charity was 
for the annual "Power Lunch"[135] with investor Warren Buffett at the famous 
Smith & Wollensky Steakhouse in New York. The winning bid was $2.63 million 
with all of the proceeds going to the Glide Foundation. The winning bidder 
was not made public, but was able to bring up to seven friends to the lunch. 
In 2012, a higher bid, of $3.46 million, also going to the Glide Foundation, 
won a lunch with Buffet.[136] The previous highest successful bid on a 
single item for charity was for a letter[137] sent to Mark P. Mays, CEO 
of Clear Channel (parent company of Premiere Radio Networks the production 
company that produces The Rush Limbaugh Show and Glenn Beck Program) by 
Senator Harry Reid and forty other Democratic senators, complaining about 
comments made by conservative talk show host Rush Limbaugh. The winning 
bid was $2,100,100, with all of the proceeds going to the Marine Corps-Law 
Enforcement Foundation, benefiting the education of children of men and 
women who have died serving in the armed forces. The winning bid was matched 
by Limbaugh in his largest charity donation to date.[138] In 2007; eBay 
Canada partnered with Montreal-based digital branding agency CloudRaker 
to develop a campaign to raise money for Sainte-Justine children's hospital 
in Montreal. They aligned themselves with Internet phenomenon Têtes à claques 
to create an eBay auction based on popular T-A-C character Uncle Tom, an 
infomercial host who pitches absurd products. eBay and CloudRaker reproduced 
Uncle Tom's imaginary products, The Body Toner Fly Swatter, The Willi Waller 
Potato Peeler, and the LCD Shovel and sold them online. In six weeks, they 
raised $15,000 for Hôpital St-Justine with one fly swatter, one potato 
peeler, and one shovel, a world record. The Body Toner Fly Swatter sold 
for $8,600, the Willi Waller Potato Peeler sold for $3,550, and the LCD 
Shovel sold for $2,146.21. During auction setup, eBay provides choices 
of shipping options to sellers: standard mail, express mail, or courier 
service. If selected, buyers may choose one of the methods. Since 2012, 
eBay has also allowed U.S. sellers to opt into the Global Shipping Program. 
If offered by the seller, a non-US buyer pays an additional fee to Pitney 
Bowes. The seller sends the item to a Pitney Bowes facility in the U.S., 
which forwards it to the buyer, taking care of all international shipping 
requirements. The program is claimed to enhance the product selection available 
to international buyers.[139] Common eBay criticism involve the policy 
of requiring the use of PayPal, and concerns over fraud, forgeries and 
intellectual property violations in auction items.[citation needed] There 
are also issues of how negative feedback after an auction can offset the 
benefits of using eBay as a trading platform.[citation needed] eBay has 
been criticized for not paying UK taxes: the Sunday Times reported in October 
2012 that eBay paid only £1.2m in tax on sales of over £800m.[140] On May 
21, 2014 the company revealed that the consumer database of usernames, 
passwords, phone numbers, and physical addresses had been breached between 
late February and early March. Users were advised to change their passwords; 
to expedite this, a "change password" feature was added to profiles of 
users who had not yet done so. The Syrian Electronic Army took responsibility 
for the attack. The SEA said that even though the hack revealed millions 
of users' banking details to them, they would not misuse the data. They 
had replaced the front pages of the websites with their own logo, called 
"Defacing" in technical terms. The hack caused eBay's share price to crash 
in intra-day trade as a result of the breach of security.[141][142][143][144]
