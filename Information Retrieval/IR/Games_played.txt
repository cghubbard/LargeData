Games played (most often abbreviated as G or GP) is a statistic used in 
team sports to indicate the total number of games in which a player has 
participated (in any capacity); the statistic is generally applied irrespective 
of whatever portion of the game is contested. In baseball, the statistic 
applies also to players who, prior to a game, are included on a starting 
lineup card or are announced as ex ante substitutes, whether they actually 
play or not,[1] although, in Major League Baseball, the application of 
this statistic does not extend to consecutive games played streaks. A starting 
pitcher, then, may be credited with a game played even as he is not credited
