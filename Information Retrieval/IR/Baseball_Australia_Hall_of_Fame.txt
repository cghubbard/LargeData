The Baseball Australia Hall of Fame or Australian Baseball Federation Hall 
of Fame is a group of baseball players, managers and coaches who have been 
recognised by the Australian Baseball Federation (ABF) as having influenced 
baseball in Australia over a prolonged period of time "at the highest level 
available at the time."[1] The concept of an Australian baseball hall of

in December 2004,[2] and were formally inducted at a presentation ceremony 
on 27 January 2005.[3] Since 2006, new groups have since been inducted 
as part of the Baseball Australia Diamond Awards each year.[4][5][6][7][8] 
There are currently 61 people that have been inducted into the hall of
