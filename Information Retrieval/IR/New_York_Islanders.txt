               The New York Islanders are an American professional ice 
hockey team based in New York City that competes in the National Hockey 
League (NHL). They are a member of the league's Metropolitan Division in 
the Eastern Conference. The team plays its home games at the Barclays Center, 
located in the borough of Brooklyn. The Islanders are one of three NHL 
franchises in the New York metropolitan area, along with the New Jersey 
Devils and New York Rangers, and their primary geographic fan base resides 
on Long Island. The team was founded in 1972 as part of the NHL's maneuvers 
to keep a team from rival league World Hockey Association (WHA) out of 
the newly built Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum in suburban Uniondale, 
New York. After two years of building up the team's roster, they found 
almost instant success by securing fourteen straight playoff berths starting 
with their third season. The Islanders won four consecutive Stanley Cup 
championships between 1980 and 1983, the seventh of eight dynasties recognized 
by the NHL in its history. Their 19 consecutive playoff series wins between 
1980 and 1984 is a feat that remains unparalleled in the history of professional 
sports. Following the team's dynasty era, the franchise ran into problems 
with money, ownership and management, an aging arena, and low attendance. 
Their woes were reflected on the ice, as the team has not won a division 
title since 1987–88, and went 22 seasons without winning a playoff series 
prior to the 2016 playoffs. After years of failed attempts to rebuild or 
replace Nassau Coliseum in suburban Long Island, the Islanders relocated 
to the Barclays Center following the 2014–15 season.[2] Eight former members 
of the Islanders have been inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame, seven 
of whom – Al Arbour, Mike Bossy, Clark Gillies, Denis Potvin, Billy Smith, 
Bill Torrey, and Bryan Trottier – were members of all four Cup-winning 
teams. Pat LaFontaine is the most recent inductee, having been honored 
in 2003. With the impending start of the World Hockey Association (WHA) 
in the fall of 1972, the upstart league had plans to place its New York 
team, the Raiders, in Nassau County's brand-new Nassau Veterans Memorial 
Coliseum.[3] County officials did not consider the WHA a major league and 
wanted to keep the Raiders out. However, they discovered that they couldn't 
legally lock out the Raiders until they persuaded an NHL team to play there.[4] 
William Shea, who had helped bring the Major League Baseball's New York 
Mets to the area a decade earlier, was pressed into service once again. 
Shea found a receptive ear in NHL president Clarence Campbell but faced 
opposition from the New York Rangers, who didn't want additional competition 
in the New York area.[5] Eventually, Campbell and Shea persuaded the Rangers' 
owners, Madison Square Garden, to reconsider. Eventually, Rangers President 
Bill Jennings realized that he had two choices. If he allowed another New 
York-based NHL team, he would at least be able to extract compensation 
from it for sharing the Rangers' NHL territory. In contrast, a WHA rival 
would not be obligated to pay the Rangers anything. Perhaps remembering 
the crucial role the New York Jets had played in ensuring the success of 
the American Football League just a few years earlier, Jennings ended up 
helping to bring a new NHL team into town.[6] Despite expanding to 14 teams 
just two years prior, the NHL hastily awarded a Long Island-based franchise 
named the New York Islanders to clothing manufacturer Roy Boe, owner of 
the American Basketball Association's New York Nets, on November 8, 1971.[6] 
At the same time, a second expansion franchise was given to Atlanta (the 
Flames) to keep the schedule balanced.[5] The developing Islanders, who 
were soon nicknamed the "Isles" by the local newspapers, had an extra burden 
to pay in the form of a $5 million ($28.33 million in 2016 dollars[7]) 
territorial fee to the Rangers.[8] The Islanders' arrival effectively doomed 
the Raiders, who played in Madison Square Garden under difficult lease 
terms and were forced to move to Cherry Hill, New Jersey in the middle 
of their second season.[4] On February 14, 1972, executive Vice President 
of the NHL's California Golden Seals, Bill Torrey, was named as the team's 
General Manager.[9] The Islanders secured veteran forward Ed Westfall, 
Gerry Hart, and goaltender Billy Smith in the 1972 Expansion Draft, along 
with junior league stars Billy Harris, Lorne Henning, and Bobby Nystrom 
in the 1972 Amateur Draft.[10] Soon after the draft, Phil Goyette was named 
as the team's first head coach, however he was fired halfway through the 
season and replaced with Earl Ingarfeld and assistant coach Aut Erickson.[11] 
Unlike most other expansion teams' general managers, Torrey made few trades 
for veteran players in the early years, as he was committed to building 
the team through the draft; he stated, "I told the owners that we're not 
going to beat this team next door by taking the castoffs from others teams. 
We'd have to develop our own stars."[10] Before the season began, Westfall 
was named the team's first captain.[12] Their first win came on October 
12, 1972 in a 3-2 game against the Los Angeles Kings.[11] In the team's 
first season, young players such as Smith, Nystrom, and Henning (all of 
whom would be part of the Islanders dynasty that would win four straight 
Stanley Cups in the 1980s) were given chances to prove themselves in the 
NHL. However, the young and inexperienced expansion team posted a record 
of 12–60–6, setting an NHL record for amount of losses and worst overall 
record in a season.[10][13] A rare highlight occurred on January 18 when 
they defeated the defending Stanley Cup Champion Boston Bruins 9-7.[11] 
Finishing last in the standings that season, they received the right to 
select first in the 1973 draft.[13] Despite several trade offers from Montreal 
Canadiens' General Manager Sam Pollock, Torrey refused to part with the 
first pick and selected junior star defenseman Denis Potvin, who had been 
touted as "the next Bobby Orr" when he was 14 years old.[6][14] During 
the off-season, Torrey convinced former St. Louis Blues coach Al Arbour 
to come coach the Islanders.[6] Even with Arbour as the team's head coach 
and Potvin, who won the Calder Memorial Trophy as NHL Rookie Of the Year, 
the team again finished last in the East Division that season, but allowed 
100 fewer goals than the previous season. The season included their first 
win against the Rangers, on October 27, 1973,[3] which also happened to 
be the game where Potvin scored his first NHL goal. Although they failed 
to make the playoffs, their 56 points represented a 26-point improvement 
from the previous season.[6] With the fourth and twenty-second picks in 
the 1974 draft, the Islanders added young forwards Clark Gillies and Bryan 
Trottier to continue Torrey's building plan.[15] In 1975, the Islanders 
made one of the biggest turnarounds in NHL history. Led by Potvin, forwards 
Westfall, Harris, Nystrom, Gillies, and goaltenders Smith and Glenn "Chico" 
Resch, the team earned 88 points, 32 more than the previous season and 
two more than their first two seasons combined, earning their first playoff 
berth. They defeated the rival New York Rangers in a best-of-3 first-round 
series as J. P. Parise scored just 11 seconds into overtime of the third 
game.[6] In the next round, down three games to none in a best-of-seven 
series against the Pittsburgh Penguins, the Islanders rallied to win the 
next four and take the series winning Game 7 on a late third period goal 
by Westfall. Only four other major North American professional sports teams 
have accomplished this feat (the 1941–42 Toronto Maple Leafs, Major League 
Baseball's 2004 Boston Red Sox, the 2009–10 Philadelphia Flyers, and the 
2013–14 Los Angeles Kings).[16] They were close but not as lucky in the 
following round, rallying from another 3–0 deficit to force a seventh game 
against the defending Stanley Cup champion Philadelphia Flyers before the 
Flyers took the decisive seventh game at home and went on to win the Cup 
again.[6] Despite a disappointing playoff finish, Arbour remained complimentary 
of the team's attitude and maturity, saying "If I called a practice next 
week, every one of them would show up."[9] The Islanders continued their 
climb up the standings in 1975–76, earning 101 points and the fifth-best 
record in the league.[17] It was the first 100-point season in Islanders 
history, in only their fourth year of existence.[18] Rookie center Trottier 
finished the season scoring 95 points and winning the Calder Trophy; his 
points and assists (63) totals set a new league record for most in each 
category by a rookie.[19] It would be the first of four consecutive 100-point 
seasons, including the first two division titles in franchise history.[18][20] 
Despite the emergence of young star players and regular season success 
between 1976 and 1979 the Islanders suffered a series of playoff disappointments. 
In 1976 and 1977, the Islanders were knocked out in the semifinals by eventual 
Stanley Cup champions, the Montreal Canadiens.[21] The Canadiens posted 
a 24–3 record in the playoffs during those two years with all three losses 
coming from the Islanders.[22] In the 1977 draft, Torrey had the 15th overall 
pick and was deciding between forwards Mike Bossy and Dwight Foster. Bossy 
was known as an emerging scorer who lacked physicality, while Foster could 
check and had led the Ontario Hockey League in scoring. Arbour persuaded 
Torrey to pick Bossy, arguing it was easier to teach a scorer how to check.[23] 
In the upcoming 1977-78 season, Bossy became the third Islander to win 
the Calder Trophy, having scored 53 goals that season, the most scored 
by a rookie at the time.[6] The team earned their first Patrick Division 
and Campbell Conference championships.[11] Six players finished the season 
with 30 goals scored or more, with five of them being players drafted by 
the Islanders, showing the success of the draft building process.[6][24] 
The season ended with a familiar result as the team lost in the overtime 
during playoffs Game 7 of the quarterfinals against the Toronto Maple Leafs; 
Billy Harris failed on a breakaway which was followed by Lanny McDonald 
scoring to complete an upset.[23] In 1978–79, the team finished with the 
best record in the NHL, clinching it with three goals in the third period 
of the seasons final game against the Rangers. Trottier was voted the league 
MVP and captured the scoring title, while sophomore Bossy scored 69 goals, 
which also led the league. Despite their regular season dominance, the 
Islanders exited the playoffs with another upset playoff loss, this time 
to the Rangers in the semifinals. As the team was leaving Madison Square 
Garden following their Game 6 elimination, Rangers fans rocked and threw 
objects at the team's bus. Hockey professionals and journalists generally 
questioned whether the Islanders were capable of winning the important 
games needed to win a Stanley Cup. Islander players would cite fear of 
repeating the pain of this loss as spurring their later success. After 
surrendering the captaincy to Gillies the season before, Westfall retired 
and shortly thereafter became a color commentator on the teams telecasts. 
Off the ice, the Islanders were on shaky ground. Boe was losing money on 
both the Islanders and the Nets even as the Islanders quickly surged to 
NHL prominence and the Nets became an American Basketball Association power. 
The Islanders were still far behind on the $10 million they had paid in 
startup costs, and the expenses associated with moving the Nets to the 
National Basketball Association threw Boe's finances into a tailspin. Eventually, 
Boe was forced to sell both his teams. He readily found a buyer for the 
Nets, but had less luck finding one for the Islanders. Torrey orchestrated 
a sale to one of the team's limited partners, John Pickett, who assigned 
Torrey as team President. Soon after purchasing the team, Pickett signed 
a very lucrative cable contract with the fledgling SportsChannel network 
as their owner, Charles Dolan, thought the up-and-coming Islanders would 
be a perfect centerpiece for his new network. Dolan gave Pickett a long-term 
guaranteed contract intended to not only keep the team on Long Island, 
but give area governments an incentive to renew his cable contracts. The 
Islanders have remained on the network, now known as MSG Plus, for over 
a quarter-century. After the Islanders' regular season dominance and playoff 
disappointment in 1979, Arbour decided that he would no longer concern 
himself too greatly with his team's finish in the regular season. Instead, 
he focused his team's energy on how they would perform in the playoffs. 
In 1980, the Islanders dropped below the 100-point mark for the first time 
in five years, earning only 91 points. However, they finally broke through 
and won the Stanley Cup. Before the playoffs, Torrey made the difficult 
decision to trade longtime and popular veterans Billy Harris and defenseman 
Dave Lewis to the Los Angeles Kings for second line center Butch Goring. 
Goring's arrival is often called the "final piece of the puzzle": a strong 
two-way player, his presence on the second line ensured that opponents 
would no longer be able to focus their defensive efforts on the Islanders' 
first line of Bossy, Trottier and Clark Gillies. Contributions from new 
teammates, such as wingers Duane Sutter and Anders Kallur and stay-at-home 
defensemen Dave Langevin, Gord Lane, and Ken Morrow (the latter fresh off 
a gold medal win at the 1980 Olympics), also figured prominently in the 
Islanders' playoff success. In the semifinals, the Islanders faced the 
Buffalo Sabres, who had finished second overall in the NHL standings. The 
Islanders won the first two games in Buffalo, including a 2-1 victory in 
game two on Bob Nystrom's goal in double overtime. They went on to win 
the series in six games and reach the finals for the first time in franchise 
history, where they would face the NHL's regular season champions, the 
Philadelphia Flyers, who had gone undefeated for 35 straight games (25–0–10) 
during the regular season. In game one in Philadelphia, the Islanders won 
4–3 on Denis Potvin's power-play goal in overtime. Leading the series 3–2, 
they went home to Long Island for game six. In that game the Islanders 
blew a 4-2 lead in the third period but Bob Nystrom continued his overtime 
heroics, scoring at 7:11 of the extra frame, on assists by John Tonelli 
and Lorne Henning, to bring Long Island its first Stanley Cup. This was 
the most recent Stanley Cup clinching game won in overtime by the home 
team until the Los Angeles Kings pulled it off in 2014. It was also the 
Islanders' sixth overtime victory of the playoffs. Bryan Trottier won the 
Conn Smythe Trophy as the most valuable player in the playoffs. Torrey's 
strategy of building through the draft turned out very well; nearly all 
of the major contributors on the 1980 champions were home-grown Islanders 
or had spent most of their NHL careers in the Islanders organization. The 
Islanders were the first NHL team to win a Stanley Cup (in 1980) with Europeans 
(Stefan Persson, Anders Kallur) on its roster.[25] The Islanders dominated 
the next two seasons. Bossy scored 50 goals in 50 games in 1981 and the 
Islanders lost only three playoff games en route to defeating the Minnesota 
North Stars in five games to win the Stanley Cup. Butch Goring won the 
Conn Smythe Trophy. During their semifinal sweep of the Rangers, Islander 
fans began taunting the Rangers with a chant of "1940!" – referring to 
the Rangers' last Stanley Cup win in 1940 (the Rangers would not win the 
cup again until 1994). Fans in other NHL cities soon picked up the chant.[26] 
In 1981–82 the Islanders won a then-record 15 straight games en route to 
a franchise-record 118 points, while Mike Bossy set a scoring record for 
right wingers with 147 points in an 80-game schedule. The Islanders won 
the regular-season title, yet once in the playoffs against the Pittsburgh 
Penguins they found themselves down late in the third period of deciding 
game 5 before John Tonelli scored both the tying goal and the overtime 
winner. After defeating the Rangers in six games they swept both the upstart 
Quebec Nordiques and the Cinderella story Vancouver Canucks in the first 
ever coast-to-coast Stanley Cup Final for their third straight championship. 
During that series Bossy, upended by a check from Tiger Williams and falling 
parallel to the ice, managed to hook the puck with his stick and score. 
Bossy netted the Stanley Cup-winning goal and was awarded the Conn Smythe 
Trophy. The next year, although the Islanders had won three straight Stanley 
Cups, more attention was being paid to the upstart Edmonton Oilers, whose 
young superstar Wayne Gretzky had just shattered existing scoring records.[27] 
The 1982–83 season was thus a battle to decide which was the best team 
in the NHL. The Oilers had a better regular season, but the Islanders swept 
them in the Stanley Cup finals to win their fourth straight championship. 
Billy Smith was named the Most Valuable Player of the Playoffs after shutting 
down the Oilers' vaunted scoring machine. Gretzky failed to score a goal 
during the series.[28] The Sutter brothers, Duane and Brent, scored 7 and 
5 points respectively in the first 3 games, while Bossy again scored the 
Stanley Cup-winning goal in game four. After that game, the Oilers players 
walked past the Islanders' dressing room and were surprised to see the 
champions exhausted. Oilers players such as Gretzky and Mark Messier said 
that they realized at that moment how much it would actually take to win 
the Stanley Cup.[28][29] The Islanders finished the 1983–84 regular season 
tied atop the Prince of Wales Conference while successfully defending their 
Patrick Division title. The "Drive for Five" got off to a tense start. 
With 39 seconds remaining of the deciding game of the opening round against 
the Rangers they gave up the tying goal to Don Maloney that the Islanders 
felt was illegal because Maloney's stick was too high. They ultimately 
eliminated the Rangers for the fourth consecutive year. The team then defeated 
the Washington Capitals in five games and the Montreal Canadiens in six 
to set up a finals rematch with the Oilers. The series featured rookie 
Pat LaFontaine scoring two third period goals in 38 seconds. This time, 
the Oilers dethroned the Islanders to win the first of what would be five 
Stanley Cups in seven years. For the 1984 postseason, the NHL changed the 
home and away schedule for the finals, which provided the Islanders home 
ice advantage in the series based on winning a regular season game against 
the Oilers, despite finishing lower than them in the overall standings. 
The new format had them play three straight games in Edmonton, where the 
Oilers managed to lock up the series. Bossy cited the team's hard time 
winning an away game as their downfall in the series.[30] The Oilers also 
ended the Islanders' 19 series playoff winning streak. It remains the longest 
streak in the history of professional sports (one more than the 1959–67 
streak by the Boston Celtics of the National Basketball Association). Unlike 
the 1976–79 Montreal Canadiens, who needed to win three series in the 1976 
and 1977 playoffs under the playoff format in place at that time, the Islanders 
had to win four series in each of their Stanley Cup seasons. The Islanders 
remained competitive for the rest of the decade, even as some of the stars 
from the Cup teams departed. As the decade wore on, Pickett began to keep 
the money from the team's cable deal rather than reinvest it in the team 
as he had done in years past. Although it did not become clear immediately, 
the lack of funds limited Torrey's ability to replace all of the departing 
talent. In the 1984–85 NHL season, the Islanders slipped to third in their 
division, followed by similar results in the 1985–86 and 1986–87 seasons. 
They began facing stiff competition from division rivals, the Philadelphia 
Flyers, who eliminated the Islanders in the Patrick Division Finals in 
1985 and 1987, and the Washington Capitals, who swept the Islanders' 1986 
first round series, the team's first exit without winning a playoff round 
since 1978. In 1986, Nystrom retired due to a serious injury[31] and Clark 
Gillies was picked up on waivers by the Buffalo Sabres.[32] Arbour retired 
as coach following the 1985–86 season and was replaced by longtime junior 
hockey coach Terry Simpson.[33] During the first round of the 1987 playoffs 
against the Capitals, the Islanders had fallen behind in the series three 
games to one but were not eliminated due to a playoff format change from 
a best-of-5 series to a best-of-7.[34] The Islanders evened the series, 
which set the stage for one of the most famous games in NHL history: the 
"Easter Epic". Kelly Hrudey stopped 73 shots on goal while Pat LaFontaine 
scored at 8:47 of the fourth overtime—and at 1:56 a.m. on Easter Sunday 
morning. The win came even though the Islanders had been outshot 75–52.[35][36][37] 
They were eliminated in the next round of the playoffs in seven games by 
the Flyers.[38] Chronic back pain forced Mike Bossy to retire after the 
season.[39] The following season, the Islanders captured another division 
title,[40] but were defeated in the first round of the playoffs by the 
upstart New Jersey Devils.[41] Potvin retired after the playoffs, holding 
records for most career goals (310), assists (742) and points (1052) by 
a defenseman, though he has since been passed in these categories by Ray 
Bourque and Paul Coffey. Around this time, the team's run of good luck 
in the draft began to run out. Of their four top draft picks from 1987 
to 1990, they lost one to a freak knee injury and two others never panned 
out.[42] The 1988–89 season saw the Islanders win only seven of their first 
27 games. Torrey fired Simpson and brought Arbour back. Arbour was unable 
to turn things around, and the team finished with 61 points, tied with 
the Quebec Nordiques for the worst record in the league. It was their first 
losing season and the first time missing the playoffs since their second 
season. Smith, the last remaining original Islanders player, retired after 
the season to become the team's goaltending coach. Not long after the end 
of the season, Pickett moved to Florida and turned over day-to-day operations 
over to a committee of four Long Island entrepreneurs: Ralph Palleschi, 
Bob Rosenthal, Stephen Walsh, and Paul Greenwood. In return, they each 
bought a 2.5 interest in the team.[42] In the next season, the Islanders 
rebounded to get back in the playoffs, but fell to the Rangers in five 
games of the opening round. The team bought out the remaining years of 
Bryan Trottier's contract, sending him off with a team record of games 
played. The 1990–91 season had the team finish well out of the playoffs 
after winning only 25 games. LaFontaine, the Islanders' remaining superstar, 
was frustrated with the team's lack of success and the progress of his 
contract negotiations, and held out rather than report to camp before 1991–92. 
In response to the holdout, Torrey engineered a rebuilding project with 
two blockbuster trades on October 25, 1991. He dealt LaFontaine, Randy 
Wood and Randy Hillier (along with future considerations) to the Buffalo 
Sabres in return for Pierre Turgeon, Benoit Hogue, Uwe Krupp and Dave McLlwain. 
He also sent longtime captain Brent Sutter and Brad Lauer to the Chicago 
Blackhawks for Steve Thomas and Adam Creighton. With these additions and 
a talented core of players such as Derek King, Ray Ferraro, and Patrick 
Flatley, along with incoming Soviet players Vladimir Malakhov and Darius 
Kasparaitis, the Islanders had a new foundation in the early '90s. However, 
the management committee was not nearly as patient as Boe and Pickett had 
been, and forced Torrey to resign after the Islanders missed the playoffs 
again that season. Assistant GM Don Maloney was hired in Torrey's place,[42] 
while Torrey quickly resurfaced with the expansion Florida Panthers. In 
Maloney's first year, 1992–93, the Islanders rebounded to make the playoffs, 
in the process surpassing the 80-point mark for the first time in six years. 
The LaFontaine-Turgeon trade proved successful for both the Islanders and 
Sabres, as both players hit career highs in points and Turgeon won the 
Lady Byng Trophy. Ray Ferraro emerged as a playoff hero, scoring a pair 
of overtime winners in the first round series against the Capitals. Instead 
of celebrating after winning Game 6 at Nassau Coliseum, however, the Islanders 
were both irate and despondent. Turgeon, the team's star center and leading 
scorer, suffered a shoulder separation when Dale Hunter checked him from 
behind as he celebrated a series-clinching goal. Turgeon was believed to 
be out for the entire second round, if not longer. He returned only for 
spot power play duty in the last game of the second round. Hunter received 
a then-record 21-game suspension. The Islanders' next opponent, the Pittsburgh 
Penguins, were twice-defending Stanley Cup champions and full of stars 
such as Mario Lemieux, Jaromir Jagr, and Ron Francis. The Penguins had 
roared through the regular season with 119 points, as well as recording 
a record 17 consecutive wins towards the end of the season, and were overwhelmingly 
favored to win a third straight championship. Jim Smith of Newsday, Long 
Island's hometown newspaper, predicted that with Turgeon on the sidelines, 
the Penguins would sweep the Islanders out of the playoffs. However, on 
the strength of outstanding goaltending from Glenn Healy and contributions 
from all four lines, the Islanders achieved a huge upset when David Volek 
scored at 5:16 of overtime of the deciding seventh game. Newsday's front 
page the day following the win was a picture of Healy with a headline reading, 
"It's a Miracle!" This was the last playoff series won by the Islanders 
for 23 years, until the 2015-16 season. Turgeon returned to the Islanders' 
top line for the Wales Conference Finals against the Montreal Canadiens, 
though he was not in peak form as he had not fully recovered. The Islanders 
bowed out of the playoffs after a hard-fought five games, two of which 
went to overtime. After beating the Islanders, the Canadiens went on to 
win the Cup. Maloney had avoided making many personnel changes his first 
year, but on the eve of the 1993 Expansion Draft he traded backup goaltender 
Mark Fitzpatrick to the Quebec Nordiques for Ron Hextall. The clubs also 
exchanged first-round picks in the deal. Able to protect only one netminder 
in the Expansion Draft, the Islanders left Healy exposed. He was claimed 
by the Anaheim Mighty Ducks, then was claimed by the Tampa Bay Lightning 
in Phase II of the draft the next day, and finally had his rights traded 
to the Rangers, where he was the backup. The Islanders barely squeezed 
past the Panthers to make the 1994 playoffs before being swept in a lopsided 
opening series by the first-place Rangers, who went on to win the Cup. 
Arbour retired for good as coach and was succeeded by longtime assistant 
Lorne Henning. Hextall, who allowed 16 goals in three games, drew most 
of the criticism for the failed playoff campaign and was shipped to Philadelphia 
for Tommy Soderstrom in September. In the lockout-shortened 1994–95 season, 
the Islanders not only failed to qualify for the playoffs, they finished 
ahead of only the third-year Ottawa Senators. By the end of the 1994–95 
season, Maloney was under considerable heat from the press and fan base 
for his handling of the team. Since taking over in 1992, the only noticeable 
attempt he made to upgrade the roster was the acquisition of Hextall. Near 
the end of the failed 1995 campaign, Maloney decided that the core of players 
he had left alone for three seasons needed to be revamped, leading to a 
rebuilding project. He traded Turgeon and Malakhov to the Montreal Canadiens 
for Kirk Muller and Mathieu Schneider, while Hogue was sent to Toronto 
for young goaltender Eric Fichaud. Additionally, Maloney allowed the team's 
leading scorer, Ferraro, to depart as an unrestricted free agent at the 
conclusion of the season. Fans' displeasure at Maloney for trading the 
popular Turgeon was magnified when Muller balked at joining a rebuilding 
team. He played 45 games for the Islanders before being sent to Toronto 
as well. Before the 1995–96 season, Maloney fired Henning and named Mike 
Milbury head coach. The same year, the Islanders' attempt at updating their 
look resulted in the unveiling of a new team logo that was said to resemble 
the advertising character Gorton's Fisherman and Stan Fischler. Reactions 
were negative, as Islanders' fans disliked it and the rival Rangers' fans 
mockingly called the Islanders "fishsticks". The team reverted to a modified 
version of the old logo as soon as the league allowed them to do so. The 
year was a disappointment on the ice as well, as the Islanders finished 
in last place with a record of 22–50–10. During the season, team management 
fired Maloney, whom fans blamed for the team's downfall,[43] and gave Milbury 
full control of hockey operations as both a coach and general manager. 
Milbury went on to resign as head coach during the following season and 
elevated assistant Rick Bowness to the position. After another unsuccessful 
season with little improvement, Milbury took over as coach again during 
the 1997–98 season. The team improved to fourth place in their division 
but again failed to make the playoffs. Milbury followed by once again stepping 
down as coach during the following season while retaining his job as general 
manager. During the continued playoff drought, instability in the front 
office mirrored the Islanders' substandard performance on the ice. Pickett 
sold the team to Dallas businessman John Spano in 1996. However, three 
months after the 1997 closing, Spano had only paid Pickett a fraction of 
the first installment on the cable rights deal. Several Islanders executives 
tipped off Newsday that something was amiss about their new boss.[44] In 
July, Newsday exposed Spano as a fraud who did not have the assets required 
to complete the deal. The investigation showed that Spano had deliberately 
misled the NHL and the Islanders about his net worth, and also had two 
lawsuits pending against him. Within days of the report, Spano was forced 
to relinquish the team to Pickett. Federal prosecutors turned up evidence 
that Spano had forged many of the documents used to vouch for his wealth 
and to promise payment to Pickett, and even appeared to have sent many 
of the documents from his own office in Dallas. He was sentenced to 71 
months in prison for bank and wire fraud. The NHL took additional heat 
when reports surfaced that the league spent well under $1,000 (depending 
on the source, the league spent either $525[44] or $750[42]) to check Spano's 
background. It subsequently stiffened the process for vetting future owners. 
The incident and its aftermath were covered in the ESPN 30 for 30 documentary, 
Big Shot.[45] Pickett finally found a buyer, a group led by Howard Milstein 
and Phoenix Coyotes co-owner Steven Gluckstern, a deal which almost fell 
through when Spectacor Management Group, which managed the Coliseum for 
Nassau County, tried to force Pickett to certify that the Coliseum was 
safe. Pickett refused, since the Coliseum had fallen into disrepair in 
recent seasons. SMG backed down under pressure from the Islanders, the 
NHL, and Nassau County officials. Initially, the team made numerous trades 
and increased their payroll in an effort to assemble a better team. In 
one transaction, young players Todd Bertuzzi and Bryan McCabe were traded 
for veteran Trevor Linden. After the Islanders finished 12 points short 
of the playoffs in the 1997–98 season, however, Milstein and Gluckstern 
decided to run the team on an austere budget in an attempt to make a profit. 
They also complained about the condition of the Nassau Coliseum and made 
noises about moving the team elsewhere. They began trading or releasing 
many popular players to avoid paying their salaries, including star scorer 
Zigmund Palffy, team captain Linden, former rookie of the year Bryan Berard, 
and rugged defenseman Rich Pilon. Losing the highly regarded players, the 
team finished with similar results the next two seasons. Attendance, which 
had been in a steady decline over the past few years, decreased even further 
to under 12,000 per game. Around that time, Milstein bid hundreds of millions 
of dollars in unsuccessful attempts to purchase the National Football League's 
Washington Redskins and Cleveland Browns. Let's face it, the Coliseum is 
a dump, and the team, well, they're losers. It's a real shame. We want 
to see it change because this is our home. We all deserve better. In 2000, 
Milstein and Gluckstern sold the team to Computer Associates executives 
Charles Wang and Sanjay Kumar. The sale cost $187.5 million ($258.08 million 
in 2016 dollars[7]) and gave fans hope for the team to turn its lack of 
success around.[46] The new owners allowed Milbury to spend money and invest 
in free agents. His first attempt proved unpopular with fans, as he traded 
away future star players Roberto Luongo and Olli Jokinen to the Florida 
Panthers for Oleg Kvasha and Mark Parrish. Milbury then further surprised 
the hockey world when he took Rick DiPietro with the first selection in 
the 2000 draft, ahead of consensus picks Dany Heatley and Marian Gaborik. 
Reporters and fans were alternately confused and enraged by the moves, 
which Milbury acknowledged, saying, "As dangerous as this may be, we think 
Mad Mike maybe has something going for him."[47] Establishing a record 
of controversial decisions, Milbury held onto the "Mad Mike" nickname for 
years to follow. He remained adamant that his moves were to immediately 
improve the team, whose poor winning percentage that year was only ahead 
of only that of the franchise's first season.[48] The team's uninspired 
play led Milbury to fire head coach and past player Butch Goring. Fans 
vocalized their dislike of Goring taking the fall rather than Milbury, 
which was further worsened when Milbury passed on hiring Ted Nolan as Goring's 
successor; Instead, Boston Bruins assistant coach Peter Laviolette was 
hired.[49] Three key personnel acquisitions were made prior to the 2001–02 
season, Laviolette's first. Alexei Yashin was acquired from the Ottawa 
Senators in exchange for forward Bill Muckalt, defenseman Zdeno Chara and 
the Islanders' second overall pick in the 2001 draft. Next, Islanders prospects 
Tim Connolly and Taylor Pyatt were traded to the Buffalo Sabres in exchange 
for Michael Peca, who became the team's captain.[50][51] By virtue of finishing 
with the worst record in the previous season, Detroit Red Wings goaltender 
Chris Osgood was the next addition, taken as the first pick in the September 
2001 waiver draft, adding a former Stanley Cup championship goaltender 
without giving up any players in exchange.[52] The additions proved to 
be a great help, as the team opened the season with a 9–0–1–1 record, the 
best in franchise history. They finished the season with new broken records; 
their 96 points marked the fourth biggest one-year turn-around in the league's 
history (44 points higher than the previous season), while Osgood's 66 
starts surpassed Billy Smith's previous record of 65.[9] During the 2002 
Stanley Cup playoffs, they were seeded fifth and faced the fourth-seeded 
Toronto Maple Leafs. The Islanders lost in a very physical first round 
series in seven games; the home team won every game of the series. Notably, 
Game 5 featured Gary Roberts charging Islander defenseman Kenny Jonsson, 
and Darcy Tucker submarining Peca with a questionable check that tore the 
Islander captain's anterior cruciate ligament, sidelining both players 
for the series' final game. The situation between Tucker and Peca caused 
a bit of outrage, with speculation that Tucker had intended to injury Peca 
before the game has even began, which Tucker denied.[53] Despite the promise 
shown in the Toronto playoff series, the Islanders had a slow start to 
the 2002–03 season. They rebounded to make the playoffs, but lost a five-game 
series in the first round to the top-seeded Ottawa Senators.[54] Milbury 
continued his controversial move-making by firing Laviolette after the 
season, citing post-season interviews with the players in which they expressed 
a lack of confidence in the coach.[55] He was replaced with Steve Stirling, 
who had previously been coaching the team's top minor league affiliate, 
the Bridgeport Sound Tigers. In the following season, the Islanders again 
lost in the first round of the playoffs, this time to the eventual champion 
Tampa Bay Lightning.[56] Following the 2004–05 NHL lockout, which eliminated 
that season of play, the Islanders made several player moves to increase 
offense for following season. Peca was traded to the Edmonton Oilers for 
center Mike York, freeing up room under the NHL's new salary cap.[57] The 
same day, the team signed winger Miroslav Satan to play alongside Yashin.[58] 
Milbury also worked on remaking the team's defense, adding Alexei Zhitnik, 
Brad Lukowich and Brent Sopel to replace the departed Adrian Aucoin and 
Roman Hamrlik, who left as free agents, and Jonsson, who left the NHL to 
play in the HockeyAllsvenskan in Sweden.[59] In the aftermath, Yashin was 
named as the team's new captain.[60] The team's inconsistent play led to 
Stirling's dismissal midway through the season.[11] On the day of Stirling's 
firing, January 11, 2006, Milbury also announced that he would step down 
as general manager once a successor was found.[9][61] He served as Vice 
President of Wang's sports properties for one year before resigning in 
May 2007.[62] Wang proceeded by hiring Neil Smith as general manager and 
Ted Nolan as head coach, following a brief stint by Brad Shaw as the team's 
interim head coach.[63][64] Smith, however, was fired after approximately 
one month and quickly replaced by the team's backup goaltender Garth Snow, 
who retired from his playing career to accept the position.[9] Before his 
dismissal, Smith made several free agent acquisitions, including defensemen 
Brendan Witt and Tom Poti, and forwards Mike Sillinger and Chris Simon.[63] 
On September 12, 2006, the Islanders signed DiPietro to a 15-year, $67.5 
million ($79.37 million in 2016 dollars[7]) contract, which was believed 
to be the longest contract to date in the NHL and the second-longest in 
North American sports, behind a 25-year contract for National Basketball 
Association player Magic Johnson.[65][66] DiPietro, Wang and Snow all spoke 
confidently and felt it was the best move for both sides, despite the mixed 
reactions it received from the rest of the hockey world. Specifically, 
Wang stated, "This is not a big deal. You have to have a commitment to 
who you're working with."[65] As speculation began as to whether other 
teams would follow suit and give lengthy contracts to star players, Atlanta 
Thrashers General Manager Don Waddell felt that, "It's highly unlikely 
that you will see teams go beyond that. This is a once-in-a-lifetime contract. 
Ownership must feel very strongly that he's their guy for the next 15 years."[66] 
The new-look Islanders were picked by most analysts to languish towards 
the bottom of the standings.[67] Eyeing a playoff spot, Snow traded for 
forward Ryan Smyth from the Edmonton Oilers at the trade deadline on February 
27, 2007.[68] Injuries to DiPietro and a distracting stick swinging incident 
that resulted in Simon's suspension for the rest of the season provided 
extra setbacks, but not enough to drop the team from playoff contention.[69][70] 
They qualified for the post-season, assisted by a late-season winning steak 
and a 3–2 shootout victory against the New Jersey Devils in their final 
regular season game.[71] Despite DiPietro's return to the team in time 
for the playoffs, the team lost their first round matchup in five games 
to the Presidents' Trophy-winning Buffalo Sabres.[72] Management announced 
in June 2007 that they would buy out captain Alexei Yashin's contract, 
which had four seasons remaining on it.[73] Free agents Smyth, Poti, Viktor 
Kozlov, Jason Blake, and Richard Zednik also left in July 2007.[74][75] 
During that month, the Islanders signed Bill Guerin to a two-year contract 
as he immediately assumed team captaincy.[74] Also in the off-season, free 
agents Mike Comrie, Andy Sutton and Jon Sim joined the team.[76][77] That 
summer, it was announced that Nolan extended an invitation to Al Arbour 
to return as a coach for one game in order to bring his total number of 
games coached to 1,500.[78][79] Arbour signed a one-day contract, the shortest 
in league history, on November 3, 2007; it put him behind the bench the 
following day as the Islanders defeated the Pittsburgh Penguins 3–2, raising 
his career coaching win total to 740.[80] The team remained in the playoff 
hunt through the trade deadline as they resigned Comrie to a one-year contract 
and traded away Simon and Marc-Andre Bergeron.[81] A rash of injuries saw 
them plummet to the fifth-worst record in the league by the end of the 
season.[82] At the 2008 NHL Entry Draft, the Islanders made two trades 
to move down from the fifth to the ninth overall pick, with which they 
selected center Josh Bailey. They also added free agents Mark Streit and 
Doug Weight. The team dismissed head coach Ted Nolan over alleged philosophy 
differences,[83][84] and later that summer replaced him with Scott Gordon.[85] 
Near the trade deadline, Snow traded Comrie and Chris Campoli to the Ottawa 
Senators in exchange for forward Dean McAmmond and the San Jose Sharks' 
first-round draft pick in the 2009 NHL Entry Draft and sent captain Bill 
Guerin to the Pittsburgh Penguins in exchange for a conditional draft pick.[86][87] 
In the 2008–09 season, the Islanders finished in last place in the league 
with a record of 26–47–9, which was the team's worst record since the 2000–01 
season. After the conclusion of regular season, they won the draft lottery 
to retain the first overall pick in the 2009 NHL Entry Draft.[88] Beginning 
an effort to rebuild the team with new and young talent, the Islanders 
selected John Tavares with the first-overall pick of the 2009 NHL Entry 
Draft.[89] Tavares went into the draft as the top prospect in the majority 
of scouting reports,[90] and it was widely expected that the Islanders 
would select him after they secured the first overall pick by winning the 
draft lottery, although there was plenty of competition between Tavares, 
Victor Hedman, and Matt Duchene.[91] NHL Central Scouting Bureau's Chris 
Edwards spoke highly of him, stating, "[Tavares] is phenomenal at getting 
the puck through traffic to his linemates, getting to opening. The way 
he reads the play and can get to where he figures the rebounds will be 
and bangs in the rebound. He's a real smart player."[92] They traded up 
twice in the first round to also select defenseman Calvin de Haan with 
the 12th overall pick,[93] as well as Casey Cizikas and Anders Lee in later 
rounds, all of whom would go on to play consistently on the main roster 
by the 2014–15 season.[94] The 2009–10 season started out slow, with the 
team winless its first six games.[95] The team continued to play inconsistently 
due to injuries as many wrote them off as potential postseason contenders.[96] 
The team hit a mid-season hot streak,[97] however nine losses in 11 games 
before the Olympic break set them right back.[98] They ultimately ended 
up at bottom of the standings again, finishing the season 26th in the league.[99] 
The placement led to a fifth overall pick in 2010. Continuing with their 
rebuilding process, they used the first round to draft young forwards Nino 
Niederreiter and Brock Nelson with picks five and 30, respectively.[100] 
As the 2010–11 season got underway, the team quickly fell into a ten-game 
losing streak, leading to the firing of head coach Scott Gordon.[101][102] 
He was replaced on an interim basis by Jack Capuano, who had been coaching 
the Bridgeport Sound Tigers.[102][103] Early in the season, they also acquired 
Michael Grabner from waivers, who went on to score 34 goals and was selected 
as a finalist for the Calder Memorial Trophy;[104][105] he would go on 
to sign a five-year contract with the team at the end of the season.[105] 
This year also featured the infamous Penguins–Islanders brawl, which resulted 
in a combined 346 penalty minutes and a $100,000 fine to the Islanders 
for "failure to control their players". The following season was a breakout 
year for Tavares. The newly named assistant captain gained 31 goals and 
50 assists,[106] in addition to being selected to play in the 59th NHL 
All-Star Game at the age of 21;[107] his 81 points were seventh-best in 
the league.[108] Tavares' left-winger Matt Moulson also had a strong season, 
finishing with career highs of 36 goals, 33 assists and 69 points.[109] 
Despite strong seasons from their top players, the team finished 27th in 
the league with a record of 34-37-11, continuing their pattern of racking 
up top prospects with early picks at the drafts.[110] They used the first 
round of the 2012 draft to select defenseman Griffin Reinhart with the 
fourth overall pick.[111] On August 1, 2011, voters in Nassau County rejected 
a proposal for a new arena to replace Nassau Coliseum. This followed the 
failed decade-long attempt by owner Charles Wang to build a mix-used development 
called The Lighthouse Project, which would renovate the arena.[112] In 
the wake of the vote, speculation began that the team would eventually 
move to Barclays Center in Brooklyn, new arenas in Queens or Suffolk County, 
the Sprint Center in Kansas City, or the Videotron Centre in Quebec City, 
the last of which is coincidentally set to open at the same time as the 
expiration of the Islanders' lease on the Nassau Coliseum in 2015.[113][114][115] 
On October 24, 2012, the Islanders made the announcement that the franchise 
will indeed be moving to the Barclays Center in Brooklyn for the 2015–16 
NHL season, after signing a lease that would keep the team in the arena 
until 2040. The team will retain its name, logo and colors as part of the 
move.[2][116] As part of the deal, the management of the Barclays Center 
will take over running the team's business operations once the Islanders 
move to the Barclays Center, though Charles Wang will remain owner.[117] 
Beginning on April 1, 2013, of the 2012–13 season, the team went on a near 
month-long unbeaten streak in regulation time, posting a 12-game streak 
of earning points until falling to the Philadelphia Flyers later that month.[118] 
During that streak, on April 23, 2013, they clinched their first playoff 
berth since 2007 with a 4–3 shootout loss to the Carolina Hurricanes, ending 
a six-year playoff drought.[118][119] Behind goaltender Evgeni Nabakov, 
the team was ultimately eliminated in six games by the Pittsburgh Penguins 
in the first round of the playoffs, continuing their winless streak in 
playoff series.[120][121] On September 10, 2013, Tavares was introduced 
as the 14th captain in New York Islanders history, replacing former Islander 
Mark Streit of the Philadelphia Flyers, who served as team captain since 
2011.[122] After posting a 4–4–3 record in their first 11 games, the Islanders 
made a trade, sending fan favorite and three-time 30-goal scorer Matt Moulson, 
their 2014 first-round draft pick and their 2015 second-round draft pick 
to the Buffalo Sabres in exchange for Thomas Vanek, a highly regarded and 
dynamic goal scorer.[123][124] Despite chemistry with linemates Tavares 
and Kyle Okposo, however, the overall lack of on-ice success and his desire 
to test free agency led to Vanek being dealt to the Montreal Canadiens 
at the trade deadline for Sebastian Collberg and a second-round pick in 
2014.[125][126] After a season of player swapping and goaltending issues, 
they failed to qualify for the playoffs, finishing with a record of 34–37–11.[127] 
In the 2014 off-season, the Islanders made several moves to improve the 
team before their final season at Nassau Coliseum. In May, the Islanders 
acquired the rights to Jaroslav Halak from the Washington Capitals in exchange 
for a fourth-round pick in 2014. Halak was then signed to a four-year contract. 
The Islanders also signed Mikhail Grabovski, Nikolai Kulemin and goaltender 
Chad Johnson as free agents. Additionally, on October 4, the Islanders 
acquired Johnny Boychuk from the Boston Bruins for two second round picks 
in 2014 and 2015 and a conditional third round pick in 2015, as well as 
Nick Leddy from the Chicago Blackhawks in exchange for prospect Ville Pokka, 
T. J. Brennan and the rights to Anders Nilsson. The NHL Board of Governors 
approved the Islanders' sale to businessmen Jon Ledecky and Scott D. Malkin 
in October 2014. Ledecky and Malkin served as minority partners during 
a two-year transition period. At the end of the 2016-16 season, they formally 
took majority control from Wang, who will retain a share of the franchise.[128] 
The Islanders finished the 2014–15 regular season with a record of 47–28–7 
for 101 points, and met the Washington Capitals in the first round of the 
2015 playoffs. The Capitals held home ice advantage in the series after 
the Islanders lost their final regular season game to the Columbus Blue 
Jackets, 5–4, in a shootout, as the Islanders lost the season series to 
the Capitals after posting a 2–1–1 record in the season series. On April 
19, 2015, in the third game of their first round series against Washington, 
John Tavares scored 15 seconds into overtime to win the game for the Islanders, 
2–1. It was the second-shortest overtime playoff game in Islanders history, 
and was the first overtime, game-winning goal for the Islanders in the 
playoffs since 1993. The Islanders lost the fourth and fifth games of their 
series before rebounding in the sixth game to force a seventh game in the 
series. However, they were denied entry into the second round by a single 
goal and would ultimately fall to the Capitals in seven games. As a result, 
Game 6 was the Islanders' last game at Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum; 
the Isles' Cal Clutterbuck scored the final NHL goal in the building. In 
June 2015, the Islanders selected forward Andong Song in the 6th round 
of the 2015 NHL Entry Draft, making him the first Chinese player to be 
drafted by an NHL team.[129] On October 9, 2015, the Islanders played their 
first regular season game at the Barclays Center, losing 3–2 in overtime 
to the Chicago Blackhawks. Artem Anisimov scored the first regular season 
goal, while Tavares scored the first regular season Islanders goal. The 
Islanders posted the fourth-best penalty kill rate and allowed the fewest 
power play goals during the season. However, in the last quarter of the 
regular season, some players, including Halak and defenseman Travis Hamonic, 
suffered key injuries. The team finished the regular season fourth in the 
Metropolitan Division with 100 points, enough to clinch the first wild 
card spot in the Eastern Conference. In the first round of the playoffs, 
they faced off against the Florida Panthers; goaltender Thomas Greiss only 
played in 40 minutes of playoff hockey with the San Jose Sharks prior to 
this series. Both teams split the first four games of the series. The fifth 
game of the series proved to be a major turning point, as late season call-up 
Alan Quine scored the game-winning goal on the power play with four minutes 
left in double overtime to end the second-longest game in franchise history; 
that goal gave them a 3–2 series lead and a chance to clinch the series 
on home ice. In the sixth game, the Islanders trailed 1–0 for much of the 
game, but Tavares tied it late in the third period. Tavares would score 
again with the series-clinching goal in double overtime to give the Islanders 
their first playoff series win since 1993. In the second round of the playoffs, 
they faced the Tampa Bay Lightning for the first time since 2004. Despite 
winning the first game of the series, the Islanders lost their series to 
the Lightning in five games. An advertising executive, John Alogna, created 
the original version of the Islanders logo with the NY over a silhouette 
of part of Long Island: Nassau and Suffolk counties. Part of the Y is made 
to resemble a hockey stick, with three orange stripes near the bottom of 
the shaft and a puck located to the right of the stick blade. At the bottom 
of the logo, the name of the team is written so that the tip of the "I" 
ends in a point aimed at Uniondale, Nassau County, the location of the 
Nassau Coliseum. The Islanders later updated the stripes, adding a fourth 
to represent the four Stanley Cups won by the franchise. Aside from the 
1995 rebrand attempt, this logo has remained largely intact throughout 
the team's history. Before the 1995–96 season, the Islanders attempted 
to update their look. The result was the unveiling of a logo depicting 
a fisherman holding a hockey stick. The logo was a marketing disaster; 
the reaction among the fan base was so negative that management announced 
it would revert to the original logo as soon as league rules allowed them 
to do so. Many fans found that the logo bore a strong resemblance to the 
Gorton's fisherman; indeed, New York Rangers fans taunted the Islanders 
with chants of "we want fishsticks" long after the logo was discarded. 
The traditional logo was phased back in over the next two seasons, starting 
as an alternate jersey logo in 1996–97 before fully replacing the fisherman 
in 1997–98. The only change to the classic logo at this time was its colors; 
as the team had replaced its original royal blue with navy, the logo was 
recolored to match. Beginning in 2008, the Islanders introduced another 
modification to their original logo for their new third jersey. The "new" 
logo, once again in royal blue, now features four orange stripes on the 
hockey stick instead of three, representing the four consecutive Stanley 
Cup titles in the 1980s. This became the team's full-time logo in 2010 
when the team retired their inaugural Reebok Edge uniforms. In the 2011–12 
season, the Islanders added a third jersey. This one was primarily black 
with the word "Islanders" written in orange on the front and numbers centered 
under. This also marked the second time the Islanders introduced the color 
gray into their uniforms, the first time since the "fisherman era." For 
the 2014 NHL Stadium Series, the Islanders used a new logo with the "NY" 
with the hockey stick found on the team's main jersey in chrome. Beginning 
with the 2014-15 NHL season, the NY logo is used on the team's third jersey. 
The Islanders debuted in 1972 with traditional-style jerseys: one was white 
with orange and royal blue stripes near the waistline and on the sleeves, 
the other was royal blue with white and orange stripes. The design remained 
largely the same, despite minor tweaks, through the 1994–95 season. Prior 
to the 1995–96 season, team executives decided to change the jersey. The 
fisherman logo replaced the "NY" circular design, incorporating navy blue 
and a brighter orange, and introducing teal and gray shades. The team was 
seeking increased merchandise revenues, with the outward justification 
of connecting the team more overtly to Long Island. The jersey included 
a lighthouse shoulder patch, a reference to the Montauk Lighthouse, and 
featured uneven stripes resembling an ocean wave near the waistline, on 
the sleeves, and across the shoulders. All of the numbering and lettering 
on the jerseys also followed the wave pattern.[130] Late in the season, 
the team eliminated the fisherman logo, but league rules forbade them from 
switching jersey designs for the 1996–97 season on only a few months' notice. 
Instead, they debuted their first third (and fourth) jerseys, which were 
identical to the home and road jerseys worn by the team, besides the circular 
"NY" crest that was used in place of the fisherman. The team wore these 
jerseys in approximately fifteen games during that season and adopted them 
permanently for in the 1997–98 season. Prior to the 1998–99 season, the 
team's new ownership reverted to the traditional design but kept the navy 
blue and bright orange from the "wave" era jersey. They added a shoulder 
patch of four bars, alternating in color, to represent the Islanders' four 
straight Stanley Cup championships. The new design also changed the borders 
around the numbers and "C" and "A" letters, featuring a raised outline 
instead of leaving no space between the orange border and the white or 
blue numbers. A third jersey was introduced in 2002 with orange and had 
navy blue stripes, outlined in white, going vertically on the sleeves and 
then cutting horizontally on the bottom of the sleeve. The navy blue stripes 
came out of the sleeve diagonally and jabbed out to a point into the bottom 
of the jersey. The team wore these jerseys through the 2006–07 season. 
For the 2007–08 season, the Islanders redesigned their uniforms as all 
NHL teams changed over to the Reebok Edge system. This new jersey resembled 
the prior design but included uniform numbers on the right chest above 
the logo. The name plates were also in two colored format: white on orange 
on the navy blue home jersey and navy blue on orange on the white road 
jersey. The sleeves on both jerseys were orange, with a wide navy stripe 
above a thin white stripe at the elbow. The jerseys had a thin stripe tracing 
around the shoulders, and featured "retro" laces at the neck. Their third 
jersey was a royal blue throwback design resembling the jersey worn from 
1972 to 1977, with white letters and numerals (as worn from 1973 on; the 
team wore orange numerals on the blue jerseys in their inaugural season). 
The logo on the jersey features four stripes on the hockey stick instead 
of the original three, another nod to the championship teams of 1980–83. 
Before the 2010–11 season, the Islanders retired their inaugural navy blue 
Edge uniforms, replacing them with the throwback design as their new home 
jersey. A corresponding new white road jersey was unveiled during the Islanders' 
draft party at Nassau Coliseum.[131] For the following season, they unveiled 
an alternate jersey in black with grey on the shoulder yoke. The front 
of the jersey bore the team name above the player's number in orange with 
blue and white trim. The Islanders crest was placed on the shoulder yoke. 
Diagonal side panels, blue trimmed in orange and gray, combined with similar 
panels on the black pants to form a diamond shape on the sides of each 
player. During the 2014 NHL Stadium Series, the Islanders wore a special 
edition jersey. The front side featured the "NY" from the primary logo 
in a special chrome treatment, while the back side featured a white nameplate 
with blue letters for player names, and bigger numbers in white trimmed 
in orange for visibility purposes. The sleeve numbers were also angled 
diagonally. The primary Islanders logo would be placed on the left shoulder 
within the white yoke. This jersey was promoted to an alternate third jersey 
in the 2014–15 season, replacing the black third jersey. During that season, 
on February 3, 2015, the team wore an updated version of the fisherman 
jersey for warmups before their game against the Florida Panthers.[132][133] 
The Islanders retired the Stadium Series third jersey after only one season, 
replacing it with a new black alternate that was unveiled to coincide with 
the team's move to Brooklyn. Unlike the previous black alternate, this 
version featured little blue and orange at all (these colors appear only 
on the rear collar), while the "NY" insignia that was carried over from 
the Stadium Series thirds was stripped of its chrome accents. The four 
stripes on the sleeves symbolize the franchise's four Stanley Cup wins. 
The Islanders' team mascot is named "Sparky the Dragon", who served at 
one point as cross-promotion with the Arena Football League's New York 
Dragons team, who also played their home games at Nassau Coliseum. In the 
mid-1990s, the Islanders had a mascot named "Nyisles" whose body style 
went from round to human-shaped, and facial features vaguely resembled 
the logo fisherman, excluding its red hair and beard. Nyisles was discontinued 
toward the end of the 1997–98 season when the team distributed "Who kidnapped 
Nyisles?" flyers implying the reason for his disappearance was because 
of another NHL mascot, ultimately revealed to be Toronto Maple Leafs mascot 
Carlton the Bear. From the 2001–02 season to the 2014–15 season, the Islanders 
also had an ice crew named the "Ice Girls", made up of only women who skated 
onto the ice during television breaks to clean up the snow that piled up 
during the game. The Ice Girls were also used for promotional purposes 
during games and at community events. Starting in the 2015–16 season, a 
co-ed ice crew would replace the Ice Girls. Note: GP = Games played, W

8, 2016[134] Six past Islanders have been inducted into the Hockey Hall 
of Fame, the most recent being Pat LaFontaine in 2003. Denis Potvin and 
Mike Bossy were the first Islanders to be inducted, in 1991. Besides the 
six players, two team builders have been inducted; Bill Torrey and Al Arbour 
were inducted in 1995 and 1996, respectively. All six players, in addition 
to Bob Bourne, have since been inducted into the Islanders' Hall of Fame, 
established in 2007. In February 2008, the team unveiled the Hall of Fame 
plaques for each player, which are displayed on the walls outside of the 
team's locker room at Nassau Coliseum. In November 2011, first Islanders 
captain Ed Westfall was added to their Hall of Fame, followed by the addition 
of defenseman Ken Morrow in December 2011, and right-winger Patrick Flatley 
("Chairman of the Boards") in January 2012.[135] Kenny Jonsson was most 
recently added in February 2012. There are two other banners hanging with 
the retired numbers: one honors Al Arbour in recognition of his 1,500 games 
coached for the Islanders, and the other honors Bill Torrey, who held the 
titles of General Manager, Vice President, President, and Chairman of the 
Board for the Islanders organization from 1972 until 1993. In place of 
a number, Torrey's banner features the words "The Architect" and his trademark 
bowtie. Bryan Trottier holds the franchise record for most points with 
the team (1353), as well as most games played (1123). Only Trottier and 
two others, Mike Bossy and Denis Potvin have scored over 1000 points with 
the team, while six others have gained more than 500, with Derek King only 
one point shy. Potvin is the only other player besides Trottier to play 
in over 1000 games with the team, playing in 1060; he is also the only 
defenseman in the top ten of the franchise scoring leaders, ranking third 
overall. The Islanders have had fourteen team captains. The team's first, 
Ed Westfall, won the Bill Masterton Trophy during his captaincy;[137] Michael 
Peca, who won the Frank J. Selke Trophy after the 2001–02 season, is the 
only other captain to have won an award during his term.[138] The longest 
captaincy reign was Denis Potvin's from 1979 through 1987, during which 
he played 521 regular season games.[139] Bryan McCabe served for the shortest 
length of time, a mere 56 regular season games before being traded to the 
Vancouver Canucks.[140][141] Also traded mid-season was Bill Guerin, who 
went to the Pittsburgh Penguins during the 2008–09 season.[87] The team's 
fourteenth and current captain, John Tavares, was named to the position 
on September 9, 2013.[122] Two seasons have been played without a captain. 
Nobody was assigned to the position for the 1996–97 season after previous 
captain Patrick Flatley was released from his contract.[142] The 2000–01 
season also went by without a captain after Kenny Jonsson stepped down 
from the position on November 18, 2000.[143] The current general manager 
is Garth Snow, who was named on July 18, 2006.[144] The current head coach 
is Jack Capuano. On November 15, 2010, Capuano was named interim head coach 
of the Islanders after head coach Scott Gordon was fired. Capuano was retained 
by the team ever since. Most Islanders games are shown locally on sports 
channels MSG Plus and MSG Plus 2. Howie Rose and Jiggs McDonald alternate 
as the team's play-by-play announcers, while former Islanders player Butch 
Goring is their color analyst. Shannon Hogan joined the broadcast team 
for the 2014–15 season as their studio host.[145] Islanders' radio broadcasts 
are aired over a three-station network comprising flagship station WRHU 
(88.7 FM) in Hempstead, WNYE-FM (91.5 FM) in New York City and WRCN-FM 
(103.9 FM) in Riverhead.[146] WRHU is licensed to Hempstead-based Hofstra 
University and WRCN to Riverhead, New York. WRHU is the student radio station 
of Hofstra University; its signal covers the western section of Long Island 
and Nassau County. WRCN serves the middle section and Suffolk County. WNYE 
serves New York City and its suburbs. The play-by-play is done by longtime 
Islanders broadcaster Chris King. Hofstra students provide color commentary 
and reporting for all home games and several away games, and are also involved 
in engineering the broadcasts from on-and-off site. The Islanders are unusual 
among professional sports teams in their use of a noncommercial radio station 
as its primary outlet due to other New York/New Jersey area teams filling 
the available tri-state radio stations covering sports; due to the complications 
of such an arrangement in regard to advertising and commercial breaks, 
the team does not maintain a traditional radio network. Beginning in the 
2016 playoffs, Islanders games began to be carried by WCBS, returning the
