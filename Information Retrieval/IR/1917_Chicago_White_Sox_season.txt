The 1917 Chicago White Sox dominated the American League with a record 
of 100â€“54. The 100 wins is a club record that still stands.[1] Their offense 
was first in runs scored while their pitching staff led the league with 
a 2.16 ERA. Facing the New York Giants in the 1917 World Series, the team 
clinched the series in six games, thanks in large part to the workhorse 
efforts of Eddie Cicotte and Red Faber. It would be the team's last world 
championship until 2005. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] Infielders Other

Eddie Collins across home plate in the deciding game. Zimmerman was later
