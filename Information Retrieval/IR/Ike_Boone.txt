Isaac Morgan Boone (February 17, 1897 – August 1, 1958) was a right fielder 
in Major League Baseball. Boone batted left-handed and threw right-handed. 
He was born in Samantha, Alabama. His older brother, Dan, also played in 
the major leagues from 1919 to 1923. Boone reached the majors in 1922 with 
the New York Giants, spending one year with them before moving to the Boston 
Red Sox (1923–25), Chicago White Sox (1927) and Brooklyn Dodgers (1930–32). 
His most productive season came in 1924 with Boston, when he posted career-highs 
in batting average (.337), home runs (13), RBI (98), hits (157), runs (79), 
doubles (34), triples (5), and games played (133). In 1924 and 1925 he 
was considered for the MVP Award. In an eight-season major league career, 
Boone was a .321 hitter with 26 home runs and 194 RBI in 356 games. Boone 
was one of the greatest minor league hitters of all time. His .370 minor 
league career batting average set a new record, and in 1929 he set a professional 
baseball record, collecting 553 total bases while hitting .407 with 55 
home runs and 218 RBI in 198 games played in the Pacific Coast League. 
The same season, Boone and his brother Danny (46) combined for 101 home

with a .402 average in 1923.[1] As player/manager of the Toronto Maple 
Leafs, Boone led the team to the International League championship in 1934 
and also was named the league MVP, winning the batting title with a .372
