Bobby Brooks Winkles (born March 11, 1930 in Tuckerman, Arkansas) is a 
former baseball coach at Arizona State University and manager in Major 
League Baseball. Winkles from 1959–1971 was Arizona State's first varsity 
baseball coach at Arizona State. Winkles laid the foundation for the legacy 
that has become Sun Devil baseball. His overall record while head coach 
at ASU is 524-173. In his 11 years, Winkles coached ASU to its first three 
national titles (1965, 1967, and 1969). Winkles coached several great players 
while he was at the helm of the Sun Devils, including Rick Monday, Sal 
Bando, Reggie Jackson, Sterling Slaughter, and Larry Gura. He was named 
the 1965 and 1969 NCAA Coach of the Year and The Sporting News Coach of 
the Year in 1965, 1967, and 1969. Winkles was inducted into the ABCA Collegiate 
Baseball Hall of Fame in 1997. After coaching at ASU, Winkles went on to 
manage four years in Major League Baseball with the California Angels (1973–1974) 
and the Oakland Athletics (1977–1978). His No. 1 jersey is honored at Packard 
Stadium where the field is named in his honor. Winkles is a graduate of 
Illinois Wesleyan University, where he became a member of the Sigma Chi 
Fraternity. A right-handed-hitting and -throwing infielder, he played minor 
league baseball in the Chicago White Sox organization during the 1950s 
before becoming the Sun Devils' head coach in 1958 and served through 1971. 
He compiled a winning percentage of .751 (524-173) during his 14 seasons 
in Tempe. In 1972, he jumped to Major League Baseball as a coach for the 
American League California Angels. In 1973, Winkles became manager in Anaheim, 
succeeding Del Rice.[1] His 1973 club won 79, lost 83 and finished fourth 
in the AL West. In 1974, after the Angels lost 44 of their first 75 games, 
Winkles was fired; his permanent successor was Dick Williams. Winkles then 
became a coach for the Oakland Athletics; he managed them for parts of 
the 1977 and 1978 seasons, as he replaced (in 1977) and then was succeeded 
by (in '78) the same manager: Jack McKeon. The A's were then a struggling 
outfit in the final throes of the Charlie Finley era. His final managerial 
record: 170 wins, 213 defeats (.444). Winkles also spent a season, 1976, 
as a coach for the San Francisco Giants. A brief coaching stint with the 
White Sox immediately followed his 1978 firing as A's manager. Then, in 
the late 1970s and early 1980s, Winkles spent several years leading the 
player development department of the Montreal Expos, when the Expos had 
one of the most productive farm systems in the game. In 2006, he was inducted
