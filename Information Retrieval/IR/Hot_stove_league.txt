Hot stove league is a baseball-related term referring to the sport's off-season. 
The phrase does not denote an actual league, but instead calls up images 
of baseball fans gathering around a hot stove during the cold winter months, 
discussing their favorite baseball teams and players.[1][2] The term has 
also come to refer to the wave of off-season player transactions (contract 
negotiations, re-signings, trades, free agency, etc.) that occur between 
seasons. Since most free-agent signings and trades occur during the off-season, 
this time of significant player transactions (including rumors and speculation 
about possible trades), is often referred to as the hot stove league or 
more simply, hot stove. According to Hardy, the term hot stove league dates 
from nineteenth-century small town America when, during the winter, people 
"gathered at the general store/post office, sat around an iron pot-bellied 
stove, and discussed the passing parade. Baseball, along with weather, 
politics, the police blotter and the churches, belonged in that company".[3] 
Hardy states that the term was popularly employed by sportswriters until 
World War II, after which rural America gave way to larger, urban centers. 
Baseball analysis and conversation now became the province of radio and 
television commentators, with off-season chatter becoming less interactive 
and more impersonal.[4] According to Anderson, the news and coverage provided 
by hot stove league newspaper columnists during the first half of the 20th 
century, when professional football and basketball had not yet come into 
being, gave baseball its foothold as "the national pastime and dominant 
professional sport for more than half of the twentieth century".[5] The 
hot stove league was especially important in the era of the reserve clause, 
when the only leverage a player had to receive more money or better contract 
provisions was to hold out from re-signing, refuse to play, or threaten 
to retire. During the off-season, when contract negotiations were underway, 
the rumors and reports flew fast and furious, and fans kept up with the 
news through hot stove league chatter. The introduction of free agency 
reduced the importance of the hot stove league.[5] In the twenty-first 
century, the term is still used to describe the "endless discussions", 
speculation and predictions bandied about by "baseball fans, baseball columnists, 
baseball bloggers, baseball writers, baseball podcasters and baseball radio 
talk show hosts" to fill the time between the end of the Baseball Winter 
Meetings and the start of spring training.[6][7][8] The MLB Network's daily 
off-season show of record is called Hot Stove.[9] Hot Stove League was 
the name of a radio segment featuring hockey chatter and analysis that 
was broadcast between periods on the radio show Hockey Night in Canada 
beginning in 1939.[10] The segment became a pre-game series on CBC Television
