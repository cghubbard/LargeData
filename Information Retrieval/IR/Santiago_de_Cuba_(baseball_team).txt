are historically one of the most successful teams in the National Series, 
the main domestic competition in post-revolutionary Cuban baseball. The 
team is similar to the Boston Red Sox in MLB in the sense that they have 
fans all over the country (especially in the east), and are the eternal 
rivals of Industriales, the New York Yankees of Cuban baseball. The traditional 
rivalry on the baseball diamond also represents the rivalry between the 
two cities (La Habana and Santiago de Cuba) dating back to the era when 
Cuba was a colony of Spain two centuries ago. The Super Classic of the 
Cuban National Series between Santiago de Cuba and Industriales takes place 
six times per season. The Avispas (Wasps) won three straight titles during 
the seasons ending in 1999, 2000, and 2001. The club also won the title 
during the season ending in 2008. Santiago de Cuba sent only one player
