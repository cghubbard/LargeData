The New York Mets are a Major League Baseball franchise based in New York 
City. They play in the National League East division. Since the institution 
of Major League Baseball's Rule 4 Draft, the Mets have selected 61 players 
in its first round. Officially known as the "First-Year Player Draft",[1] 
the Rule 4 Draft is Major League Baseball's primary mechanism for assigning 
amateur baseball players from high schools, colleges, and other amateur 
baseball clubs to its teams. The draft order is determined based on the 
previous season's standings, and the team that had the worst record receives 
the first pick.[1] In addition, teams that lost free agents in the previous 
off-season may be awarded compensatory or supplementary picks.[2] The First-Year 
Player Draft is unrelated to the 1961 expansion draft in which the Mets 
initially filled their roster. Of the 62 players picked in the first round 
by the Mets, 25 have been pitchers, the most of any position; 18 of these 
were right-handed, while 7 were left-handed. 17 of the players picked in 
the initial round were outfielders, while eight shortstops, six catchers, 
and three third basemen were selected. The team also selected two players 
at first base and one at second base.[3] 14 of the players came from high 
schools or universities in the state of California, while Florida and Texas 
follow, with nine and five players, respectively.[3] Four Mets' first-round 
picks have won championships with the franchise. No first-round picks were 
on the 1969 championship team.[4] Outfielders Lee Mazzilli (1973) and Darryl 
Strawberry (1980), shortstop Wally Backman (1977), and pitcher Dwight Gooden 
(1982) played in the 1986 World Series for the Mets' second championship 
team.[5] Three first-round draft picks have gone on to win the Rookie of 
the Year Award with the Mets: Jon Matlack in 1972, Strawberry in 1983, 
and Gooden in 1984.[6][7][8] Gooden went on to win the Cy Young Award in 
1985, his second season, after placing second in the voting his rookie 
year.[8] Gooden is also the only first-round draft pick of the Mets to 
make the All-Star team in his rookie season.[8] The Mets have made 11 selections 
in the supplemental round of the draft. They have also made the first overall 
selection five times (1966, 1968, 1980, 1984, and 1994), tied for the most 
such picks with the San Diego Padres.[3][9] The first of these picks, Steve 
Chilcott (1966), is one of only two first overall picks (along with Brien 
Taylor) to never play in the major leagues.[10] The Mets have had 18 compensatory 
picks since the institution of the First-Year Player Draft in 1965. These 
additional picks are provided when a team loses a particularly valuable 
free agent in the prior off-season,[V][2][11] or, more recently, if a team 
fails to sign a draft pick from the previous year.[12] One player, George 
Ambrow (1970), did not sign with the Mets after he was drafted but they
