The 2011 Detroit Tigers season was the team's 111th season. The season 
began on March 31 at New York against the Yankees, and the home opener 
was on April 8 against the Kansas City Royals.[1] The Tigers honored the 
late Sparky Anderson during the season. The Tigers sent five players to 
the 2011 Major League Baseball All-Star Game: starting pitcher Justin Verlander, 
first baseman Miguel Cabrera, catcher Alex Avila, shortstop Jhonny Peralta, 
and closer José Valverde.[2] The regular season concluded September 28 
at home against the Cleveland Indians, with the Tigers holding a 95–67 
record. The season saw the team's first eleven-game winning streak since 
1968, and first nine-game winning streak since 1984 – both years in which 
the Tigers went on to win the World Series. The streak ended at 12 games 
on September 14. It consisted of four consecutive three-game sweeps over 
their AL Central Division rivals. It was the Tigers longest winning streak 
since the 1934 team won 14 straight.[3] On September 16, the Tigers clinched 
the AL Central Division title with a 3–1 win over the Oakland Athletics. 
It is their first AL Central title since they joined the division in 1998, 
and the team's first division title of any kind since 1987.[4] They became 
the first team of the season to qualify for the American League Division 
Series, and first team in either league to clinch their division. The Tigers 
clinched the division with 11 games left to play, tying the franchise record 
set by the 1984 team. Justin Verlander was named both American League Cy 
Young Award winner and AL Most Valuable Player for an outstanding season 
that saw him lead the league in wins (24), strikeouts (250) and ERA (2.40).[5] 
On October 6, the Tigers beat the New York Yankees in Game 5 of the ALDS, 
winning the series 3–2, and advancing to the American League Championship 
Series, which they lost to the Texas Rangers 4–2. On July 3, after Tigers 
pitchers had given up 51 runs in the previous five games (including three 
games in which 14 or more runs were allowed), pitching coach Rick Knapp 
was fired. Then-bullpen coach Jeff Jones was named the new pitching coach 
and Mike Rojas was made the new bullpen coach.[24] Infielders Outfielders 
Coaches On November 4, 2010, Sparky Anderson, Tigers manager from 1979–1995, 
died at age 76.[25] In his honor, the Tigers wore a memorial patch on their 
sleeves (seen at right), and a flag was raised in his honor on Opening 
Day. Additionally, Anderson's No. 11 jersey was officially retired by the 
Tigers on June 26, 2011. His name and number were also placed on the left-field 
wall at Comerica Park, joining other past Tiger greats. Anderson is the 
second non-player (after broadcaster Ernie Harwell) to have his name on 
this wall.[26] Below is a chronology of highlights during the 2011 Detroit 
Tigers regular season.[27] Ace starting pitcher Justin Verlander had the 
best season of his career. On May 7, Verlander took a perfect game against 
the Toronto Blue Jays into the 8th inning, and after a walk to J. P. Arencibia, 
Verlander got his double play and went on to the 9th inning to complete 
his second career no-hitter. It was the seventh no-hitter in Tigers history. 
He faced the minimum 27 batters and recorded four strikeouts with one walk 
and a pitch count of 108.[28] Verlander became the second Tigers pitcher 
since Virgil Trucks, and the thirtieth pitcher in the history of baseball, 
to throw multiple no-hitters. Verlander also won the 100th game of his 
career and became the first Tiger pitcher to win 20 games in a season since 
Bill Gullickson in 1991. Verlander's regular season total of 24 wins is 
the highest for a Tiger pitcher since Mickey Lolich won 25 in 1971. Verlander 
finished the season by winning the AL pitching Triple Crown, leading the 
American League in wins (24), ERA (2.40) and strikeouts (250). On November 
15, Verlander was named the AL Cy Young Award winner in a unanimous vote.[29] 
On November 21, it was announced that Verlander had also won the American 
League MVP Award in a much closer vote.[30] 2011 was also a career best 
season for closer José Valverde. On September 11, he recorded his 43rd 
consecutive save of the season, passing Todd Jones as the Tigers' all-time 
single season saves leader.[31] His 45th save of the season helped the 
Tigers clinch the AL Central title. On the final day of the regular season, 
he recorded his 49th straight save, completing his perfect season. He recorded 
2 saves against the New York Yankees in the ALDS, the second of which sent 
the Tigers to the ALCS. He saved one of the Tigers' two ALCS wins. He also 
won the 2011 Major League Baseball Delivery Man Award and the 2011 AL Rolaids 
Relief Man of the Year Award. Valverde finished fifth in the 2011 AL Cy 
Young Award voting, which was won by teammate Justin Verlander. With his 
Major League-best .344 batting average, Miguel Cabrera won the AL Batting 
Championship. Cabrera became the first Tiger since Norm Cash and Rocky 
Colavito in 1961 to reach triple-digits in RBIs (105), runs (111) and walks 
(108). He also led the AL in on-base percentage (.448) and doubles (48). 
Miguel finished fifth in the voting for the AL MVP Award, which was won 
by teammate Justin Verlander. He also won the Luis Aparicio Award, an award 
given to the best Venezuelan player each year. Catcher Alex Avila had the 
best season of his young career, hitting .295 with 19 home runs and 82 
RBIs. He started in the 2011 MLB All Star game and won the Silver Slugger 
Award for catchers.[32] Super utility-man Don Kelly made his career debut 
as a pitcher on June 29, pitching one-third of an inning in a blowout loss 
to the New York Mets. Three days later, he made his major league debut 
at catcher, when he relieved Victor Martinez in the fourth inning against 
the San Francisco Giants. This gave Kelly the rare distinction of playing 
all nine defensive positions in his major league career.[33] Note: G =
