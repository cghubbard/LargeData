The 2009 NFL season was the 90th season in the history of the National 
Football League (NFL). The preseason started with the Pro Football Hall 
of Fame Game on August 9, 2009,[1] and the regular season began September 
10. The season ended with Super Bowl XLIV, the league's championship game, 
on February 7, 2010 at Sun Life Stadium with the New Orleans Saints defeating 
the Indianapolis Colts 31–17.[2] in Miami Gardens, Florida.[3]The Colts 
and Saints began the season 14-0 and 13-0. This was the first time in NFL 
history two teams won their first 13 games or more. The 2009 NFL Draft 
was held at Radio City Music Hall in New York City on April 25 and 26, 
2009. The 2009 season began on September 10, 2009 (under the current scheduling 
system, this is the latest date the NFL can start its season as the season 
typically starts the weekend after Labor Day, which falls on its latest 
possible date in 2009). For the 2009 season, the intraconference and interconference 
matchups were: Intraconference Interconference The 2009 schedule was released 
on April 14, 2009 and featured the following highlights: The Pro Football 
Hall of Fame Game was on August 9, 2009 at 8:00 pm EDT on NBC. The Tennessee 
Titans defeated the Buffalo Bills 21–18, and both wore "throwback" jerseys 
celebrating the two franchises' AFL origins.[4] It was the first time since 
1970 that the teams have not been from opposing conferences; also, both 
Bills owner Ralph Wilson, a 2009 Hall of Fame inductee, and Titans owner 
Bud Adams have owned their teams continuously since the AFL's inception 
in 1960, making them the longest-tenured team owners in the league. Both 
teams made their first Hall of Fame Game appearance since the 1980s (Buffalo 
last played in Canton in 1989, Tennessee in 1985 as the former Houston 
Oilers). The rest of the pre-season matchups were announced March 30, 2009. 
Highlights, among others, included a rematch of Super Bowl XLIII between 
the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Arizona Cardinals on ESPN.[5] The first 
game of the season was held on Thursday, September 10, at 8:30 pm EDT, 
with the Super Bowl XLIII champion Pittsburgh Steelers defeating the Tennessee 
Titans 13–10 in overtime at Heinz Field. The opening weekend game on NBC 
Sunday Night Football featured the Chicago Bears at Green Bay Packers, 
which the Packers won, 21–15. The opening weekend doubleheader games on 
Monday Night Football were both part of the AFL 50th Anniversary celebration: 
Buffalo Bills at New England Patriots in the first game, and San Diego 
Chargers at Oakland Raiders in the second game.[6] New England defeated 
Buffalo in an epic end-of-game rally, coming from behind 24–13 to win 25–24 
in the final three minutes in what has been dubbed the "Nightmare in New 
England" by at least one newspaper.[7] San Diego defeated Oakland by a 
score of 24–20 in the nightcap with their own fourth quarter comeback. 
During the month of October, teams across the league honored National Breast 
Cancer Awareness Month by wearing gloves, wristbands, patches, towels and 
shoes accented with pink. Banners were hung around league stadiums to raise 
awareness, and the NFL's website featured a pink background. Referees and 
coaches hats also had pink accents. In addition, the NFL Referee's Association 
donated $24,000 to breast cancer charities throughout the month. Also used 
were pink goal post padding, pink coins, and pink ribbon decals on the 
field and on footballs.[8] This year's International Series game was played 
October 25, 2009 at 1:00 pm EDT (5:00 pm local time in London) again at 
Wembley Stadium in London. The New England Patriots defeated the designated 
"home" team, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, 35–7.[9] CBS televised this game 
on a regional basis as the Patriots were the "visiting" team. The Thanksgiving 
Day games were contested on Thursday, November 26, 2009. On Fox, Green 
Bay won over Detroit, 34–12. The Dallas Cowboys defeated the Oakland Raiders,[10] 
24–7 on CBS, and in the prime time NFL Network game, the Denver Broncos 
were victorious over the New York Giants, 26–6. The second regular-season 
game of the Bills Toronto Series, in which the Buffalo Bills play in the 
Rogers Centre in Toronto, Ontario, was played December 3 on Thursday Night 
Football, with the New York Jets winning 19–13. Earlier reports on a potential 
Bills-Toronto Argonauts doubleheader and reports of the league favoring 
other teams were proven inaccurate.[11][12][13] No preseason game was played 
in this series for 2009. The league scheduled a rare Friday night game 
on December 25, in lieu of a Thursday night game that week. The game, held 
at LP Field in Nashville, saw the San Diego Chargers trounce the Tennessee 
Titans 42–17. Although both teams are charter AFL franchises and thus celebrated 
their 50th season in 2009, this game was not part of the organized celebrations. 
All other games were announced on April 14, 2009 on the NFL Network and 
the NFL website, though several teams had partial details leaked prior 
to that time.[14] This season marked the first time ever that the Buffalo 
Bills and Tampa Bay Buccaneers met at Ralph Wilson Stadium in Buffalo in 
regular season play. In 2002, when the current scheduling formula was arranged, 
the fact that Buffalo had never hosted Tampa Bay in the Buccaneers' history 
was one of the quirks cited in creating the formula. Also, the Houston 
Texans won nine games in the regular season, the franchise's first-ever 
winning season. The playoffs began Saturday, January 9, 2010 with Wild 
Card Weekend. Divisional playoffs followed the next week. The defending 
world champions Pittsburgh Steelers did not take part in the post-season 
as they were eliminated from contention in the final week 17, thus this 
was the fifth year in a row the NFL crowned a new Super Bowl champion. 
The AFC Championship Game was Sunday, January 24, 2010 at 3:00 pm,which 
saw the Indianapolis Colts come from behind to defeat the New York Jets, 
30–17. It was followed by the NFC Championship Game at 6:30 pm which featured 
many back to back scoring drives by two high scoring Vikings and Saints 
offenses. But the Minnesota Vikings 4 fumbles and a Brett Favre interception 
late in the fourth quarter proved to be too much to handle as the New Orleans 
Saints won 31–28 in overtime which granted the franchise's first Super 
Bowl appearance in its 43-year history. Super Bowl XLIV was held February 
7 at Miami Gardens, Florida's Sun Life Stadium (home of host team Miami 
Dolphins, who were also eliminated from post-season contention). The 2010 
Pro Bowl was held on January 31, one week before Super Bowl XLIV, at the 
same site of the league championship game, Sun Life Stadium in Miami Gardens, 
Florida.[15] This was the first time since 1979 (held for the 1978 season) 
that the Pro Bowl was held in the Continental United States as opposed 
to Hawaii. The NFL also announced that the site and date of Pro Bowl games 
after 2010 will include playing the game on a rotating basis in Honolulu.[15] 
NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said the move was made after looking at 
alternatives to strengthen the Pro Bowl and to make the end of the season 
more climactic.[15] As a result of the move, players will not be allowed 
to play in both the Super Bowl and the Pro Bowl in the same year. In addition, 
ESPN replaced CBS as broadcaster for that game only.[16] Playoff seeds 
are marked in parentheses and shaded in green. No ties occurred this year. 
The playoffs began with Wild Card Weekend on January 9–10, 2010. The Divisional 
Playoffs were played on January 16–17 and the Conference Championship Games 
on January 24. Super Bowl XLIV was played on February 7 at Sun Life Stadium 
in Miami Gardens, Florida. Within each conference, the four division winners 
and the two wild card teams (the top two non-division winners with the 
best overall regular season records) qualified for the playoffs. The four 
division winners are seeded 1 through 4 based on their overall won-lost-tied 
record, and the wild card teams are seeded 5 and 6. The NFL does not use 
a fixed bracket playoff system, and there are no restrictions regarding 
teams from the same division matching up in any round. In the first round, 
dubbed the wild-card playoffs or wild-card weekend, the third-seeded division 
winner hosts the sixth seed wild card, and the fourth seed hosts the fifth. 
The 1 and 2 seeds from each conference then receive a bye in the first 
round. In the second round, the divisional playoffs, the number 1 seed 
hosts the worst surviving seed from the first round (seed 4, 5 or 6), while 
the number 2 seed will play the other team (seed 3, 4 or 5). The two surviving 
teams from each conference's divisional playoff games then meet in the 
respective AFC and NFC Conference Championship games, hosted by the higher 
seed. Although the Super Bowl, the fourth and final round of the playoffs, 
is played at a neutral site, the designated home team is based on an annual 
rotation by conference. The 2009 season marked the fiftieth season of the 
Original Eight charter members of the American Football League, whose owners 
became collectively known as "The Foolish Club." The fifth league to use 
the AFL moniker (previous leagues in 1926, 1934, 1936–37, and 1940–41, 
all had failed) began play in 1960 and would form the major portion of 
the American Football Conference (AFC) when the NFL completed its merger 
with the AFL in 1970: The Bills and Jets used AFL-era throwback uniforms 
as their alternate jerseys prior to 2009, and continued them beyond that. 
The league had the other six teams use a third jersey replicating those 
from the AFL in their heyday. Each of the Original Eight played against 
another original AFL team, one at home and one away, on two "AFL Legacy 
Weekends", and had a special 50th Anniversary AFL patch on the throwback 
uniforms. In a waiver given by these eight, they would wear the anniversary 
throwbacks a maximum of four times a season, whereas all of the other teams 
have a limit of twice per season. The Patriots and Raiders wore the throwbacks 
the maximum four times, while the Bills, Chiefs (Texans), Chargers, Jets 
(Titans), and Titans (Oilers) were worn three times. The Chargers also 
wore their regular powder blue alternate jersey of the current design for 
two other allowed games.[23] In the second game of two meetings opposite 
of the first game for their divisional matches against the Raiders and 
Chiefs, the Chargers wore their newer look powder blue jerseys against 
the Raiders in week 8, and also celebrated their 50th Anniversary in the 
modern powder blue jerseys against the Chiefs later in the season during 
Week 12, when the meeting against those two clubs shifted to San Diego. 
The Broncos elected to wear their throwbacks only twice (the team wore 
the infamous 1960–1961 brown and yellow throwbacks with the vertically-striped 
socks) and wore wear their regular orange alternate jersey of the current 
design in the other two allowed games,[24] giving the team six different 
uniforms over a 16-game season. Both of the games involving the orange 
jerseys involved the Dallas Cowboys and the Pittsburgh Steelers—two "old" 
NFL teams before the merger, with the Steelers joining the Broncos in the 
AFC in 1970 as a result of the merger. An AFL patch is already a permanent 
part of the Kansas City Chiefs' jerseys, in honor of team and AFL founder 
Lamar Hunt, who died in December 2006. The program kicked off on August 
9 in the 2009 Pro Football Hall of Fame Game with the Bills playing the 
Titans (Oilers). Besides the Legacy Games, the Chiefs wore Dallas Texans 
uniforms in one home game against the NFC's Dallas Cowboys, who also wore 
throwbacks, while the Cowboys hosted the Raiders in a Thanksgiving Day 
game in Arlington, Texas. (The Chiefs and Cowboys throwbacks both feature 
team-colored jerseys, making it the first dark color vs. dark color game 
since the Bears-Cowboys 2004 Thanksgiving game.) For all games other than 
those cited above, the Original Eight wore their 2009 uniforms, each with 
a team-specific 50th Anniversary shoulder patch, save for the Titans, who 
wore the AFL 50th Anniversary logo on all uniforms. For the legacy weekends, 
on-field officials working the Original Eight's games also had their own 
throwbacks – shirts with Chinese-red stripes, and an AFL chest and cap 
logo. The fields for the regular season games were painted in the innovative 
designs introduced by the AFL in the 1960s (for instance, the Broncos' 
end zones are painted in an argyle pattern). Although the Dolphins and 
Bengals were both part of the AFL, they did not join the league until 1966 
and 1968, respectively. The Dolphins played in three of the Legacy games 
(wearing their current uniforms), while the Bengals were not part of the 
events. After the season, the Patriots adopted their AFL-era throwbacks 
as their new third uniform for 2010, while the Broncos continue to paint 
their end zones at Invesco Field at Mile High in the argyle pattern, similar 
to the Steelers decision to paint the south end zone at Heinz Field in 
plain diagonal white lines after their 2003 preseason game against the 
Philadelphia Eagles honoring the 60th anniversary of the Steagles season. 
It was the fortieth season since the AFL–NFL merger was officially completed 
in 1970, and also the sixtieth season since the All-America Football Conference 
merged with the NFL, adding the Cleveland Browns and San Francisco 49ers 
to the league.[26] No celebrations were held for any of those teams, but 
San Francisco reverted to their old colors (lighter shades of red and gold 
from their glory seasons of five Super Bowl victories) in an unrelated 
move. The NFC's Dallas Cowboys also celebrated their fiftieth season in 
2009. After the NFL had rebuffed Lamar Hunt's overtures to place an NFL 
team in Dallas, saying they had no plans to expand, the league granted 
the Cowboys a franchise in 1960 in reaction to Hunt's AFL Dallas Texans. 
The NFL's Cowboys franchise started out in 1960 with a record of no wins, 
eleven losses and one tie, but has since gone on to appear in eight Super 
Bowls (the only other teams to appear in eight was the Pittsburgh Steelers 
on February 6, 2011, and the New England Patriots on February 1, 2015), 
winning five of them, tied for second with the San Francisco 49ers behind 
only the Pittsburgh Steelers. Ironically, the Texans' franchise, which 
left Dallas to become the Kansas City Chiefs, won Super Bowl IV, two years 
before the Cowboys won their first. Though there was never an actual game 
between the Dallas Texans and the Cowboys, the 2009 "throwback" game played 
against Kansas City (Dallas Texans) and the Dallas Cowboys was played as 
"The Game that Never Was". The [Dallas] Cowboys won the game at Arrowhead 
Stadium in Kansas City, Missouri, 26–20 in overtime. Strangely, the visiting 
Cowboys wore home throwback jerseys, so both teams wore home uniforms. 
All four members of the NFC North celebrated significant anniversaries. 
The Green Bay Packers and Chicago Bears, two of the oldest teams of the 
NFL remaining in the league, marked their 90th seasons in 2009. While the 
Packers did not join the NFL until 1921, the team marks its founding with 
the team's creation in 1919. The first Sunday Night Football game of the 
season featured the two teams, pitted in "The League's Oldest Rivalry." 
Likewise, the Minnesota Vikings celebrated their being in existence for 
50 years. The team traces its existence to the founding of the AFL in 1959, 
but although they participated in that league's inaugural draft, they were 
instead lured to the NFL before playing a game. (The Oakland Raiders replaced 
Minnesota in the AFL.) The Minnesota team, not named the Vikings until 
after they joined the NFL and did not take any of their drafted players 
with them, were granted their own expansion draft by the NFL and did not 
play until 1961. As such, the Vikings were only in their 49th season, and 
will celebrate their 50th NFL season in 2010, while the Detroit Lions will 
be in its 80th season in the NFL, and their 76th in Detroit. Last season, 
Detroit reintroduced its throwback jersey, while Minnesota continues using 
theirs. None of the teams held significant celebrations in 2009. This was 
the fourth season under the current television contracts with the league's 
television partners: CBS (all AFC Sunday afternoon away games and one Thanksgiving 
game), Fox (all NFC Sunday afternoon away games and one Thanksgiving game), 
NBC (16 Sunday night games and the kickoff game), ESPN (17 Monday night 
games over sixteen weeks), NFL Network (eight late-season games on Thursday 
and Saturday nights, including one Thanksgiving game and a Christmas night 
game), and DirecTV's NFL Sunday Ticket package. The current agreements 
with CBS, Fox and DirecTV were extended two years through the 2013 season 
on May 19, 2009; NBC's contract was extended through that same season on 
August 19 of the same year. CBS celebrated their 50th season of NFL coverage; 
CBS has covered NFL games from 1956 to 1993 and again from 1998 to the 
present. Ironically, CBS which was ordered by the NFL not to give American 
Football League scores during its NFL broadcasts of the 1960s, now covers 
the AFC, while Fox covers the NFC. This season was also the fortieth consecutive 
season that Monday Night Football has been a permanent part of the NFL 
schedule, though the league had played games on Monday night sporadically 
before this. Monday Night Football originally aired on ABC before switching 
to ESPN in 2006, when the two networks' sports operations were merged. 
The first Monday night of the regular season featured two AFL Original 
Eight games, a doubleheader with the Bills at the Patriots and the Chargers 
at the Raiders. NFL Network continued to have coverage disputes with major 
cable providers. In particular, Comcast, the largest cable provider in 
the United States, was considering removing the network from its lineups 
on April 30, 2009, shortly after the draft but before the start of the 
preseason. Comcast was carrying the network on a digital sports tier and 
negotiations continued past the April 30 deadline as NFLN would continue 
on Comcast, which ended with a resolution on May 19 that could open the 
door for other major cable providers such as Cablevision and Cox to carry 
the network on a what would be equal to Comcast's digital classic tier, 
with around 10 million subscribers.[27] However, the most notable holdout, 
Time Warner Cable, still is nowhere near a deal.[28] Additionally, the 
NFL Network created a new "Red Zone Channel" starting with the season openers 
September 13. Comcast-owned Versus has signed a deal to carry United Football 
League games on Thursday nights; the tail end of the UFL schedule overlapped 
with the first few weeks of the Thursday night NFL package. In related 
news, the NFL has reached a settlement with DISH Network over the satellite 
provider's decision to move NFL Network to a higher tier. NFL Network has 
also dropped the use of the names "Run to the Playoffs" and "Saturday Night 
Football", opting to standardize all of its broadcasts under the "Thursday 
Night Football" banner. The Saturday night and Friday night games airing 
on the network was marketed as "Thursday Night Football Special Edition." 
This was also the first NFL season after the DTV transition in the United 
States, which had originally been scheduled to take place on February 17, 
2009 but was delayed until June 12, 2009. Hawaiʻi made the digital switchover 
on January 15, 2009.[29] (Low-power translators will still be allowed to 
broadcast in analog until at least 2012, and cable providers will continue 
to distribute analog signals for the foreseeable future.) After fifty seasons 
as a player, coach, broadcaster and video game maven, John Madden retired 
on April 16 from his position on Sunday Night Football. Cris Collinsworth 
moved from NFL Network to NBC to assume Madden's in-game analyst role with 
Al Michaels; Matt Millen replaced Collinsworth on NFL Network. In addition, 
Tony Kornheiser left MNF and former Raiders and Buccaneers coach Jon Gruden 
replaced him. In radio, it was reported that the league was exploring ending 
its contract with Westwood One or sharing games with another network due 
to Westwood One's financial problems. The Sports USA Radio Network, ESPN 
Radio and Sporting News Radio were mentioned as possible partners; Fox 
Sports Radio was notably excluded from consideration. Sports USA currently 
carries Sunday afternoon games by agreement with individual teams, while 
ESPN carries the NBA and Major League Baseball, the latter causing a potential 
schedule conflict between Sunday Night Football and Sunday Night Baseball, 
plus the MLB Playoffs. Sunday night, Monday night, Thanksgiving and all 
other Thursday and Saturday games are covered by the contract.[30] Of the 
offers, Westwood One was the high bidder (and reportedly the only one offering 
guaranteed money), ESPN requested a longer-term deal, the Sporting News 
offered a revenue-sharing plan in lieu of rights fees, and Sports USA was 
described as a "long shot."[31] After a restructuring shored up the company's 
financial situation, Westwood One in March 2009 earned a two-year extension 
for all of the night games, paying US$33,000,000 for the two-year deal.[32] 
In addition to the official feature game package, three networks will carry 
nationwide radio broadcasts of Sunday afternoon games. The newest such 
network is Compass Media Networks, which has signed deals with eight teams. 
Sports USA and Westwood One will carry games from the other 24 teams. Dial 
Global, which previously backed Sports USA's coverage in 2008, will instead 
handle Compass's package for 2009. The 2009 season was the first season 
for the new self-named stadium of the Dallas Cowboys in Arlington, Texas 
(now known as AT&T Stadium). It also served as the last season for Giants 
Stadium, as both the New York Giants and Jets moved into a new stadium 
for 2010. The Giants exited with an auspicious 41–9 loss to Carolina on 
December 27, while the Jets defeated the Cincinnati Bengals by a 37–0 score 
in the season finale on Sunday night, January 3, 2010. After having no 
major uniform changes for the 2008 NFL season, the trend of at least one 
major uniform change per season among the 32 teams returned with two major 
uniform changes, as well as one with some minor modifications. The San 
Francisco 49ers, who had been long-rumored to be returning to their 1964–1995 
uniforms (and have had the red variation of those uniforms as their third 
uniform since the 2002 season) did so for this season.[33] The team returned 
to a brighter, scarlet red and a less metallic "49ers gold" as its team 
colors, replacing the darker cardinal red and the more metallic "49ers 
gold" which the team has worn since it last overhauled their uniforms in 
1996.[34] The new uniforms were unveiled on April 25, 2009. The Jacksonville 
Jaguars got new uniforms for the 2009 season.[35][36] Team owner Wayne 
Weaver reportedly wanted to "clean up" the look, feeling that the team 
has too many uniform styles.[36] The changes aren't a complete overhaul, 
but similar to the Atlanta Falcons and Minnesota Vikings' recent overhauls.[35] 
The new uniforms were introduced at a press conference on April 22.[37] 
The Detroit Lions designated their popular 1950s-era throwbacks as their 
third uniform and completely dropped their unpopular black jerseys.[38] 
The team had not worn the throwbacks from 2005–07 to make room for the 
Matt Millen-designated black jerseys. In addition, the team unveiled a 
new helmet logo on April 20, updating "Bubbles" with a fiercer look and 
wordmark, with modified uniforms. Those logos were accidentally leaked 
by NFL.com in their online shop, then quickly removed on March 23, 2009.[39] 
Besides the above-mentioned throwbacks for the 50th anniversary season 
of the AFL, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers wore their "Creamsicle" throwbacks 
for the November 8 home game against the Green Bay Packers, in conjunction 
with the creation of the Buccaneers Ring of Honor.[40] The Buccaneers defeated 
the Packers 38–28, the only home game the team won in 2009. The St. Louis 
Rams wore their 1973–1999 blue uniforms in select home games to honor former 
owner Georgia Frontiere, who died in early 2008 (too late to inform the 
NFL about wearing a throwback uniform in her honor during the 2008 season; 
the team instead opted for a memorial patch) and also celebrate the tenth 
anniversary of their win in Super Bowl XXXIV.[41] Ironically, the Rams 
cut ties with its last two remaining offensive players from the "Greatest 
Show on Turf" era during the offseason by releasing Orlando Pace and Torry 
Holt for salary cap reasons plus opting for a rebuilding mode after a 2–14 
season in 2008 (second only to the Lions’ historic 0–16 season) and no 
trips to the postseason since the 2004 season. Defensive end Leonard Little 
is the only player remaining who wore the pre-2000 uniforms again in 2009. 
These uniforms were worn on October 11 against the Vikings and December 
20 against the Texans. The Cleveland Browns, Dallas Cowboys, Minnesota 
Vikings, and Pittsburgh Steelers retained their throwback alternates worn 
in previous seasons. The Atlanta Falcons wore replicas of their first season 
uniforms from 1966, in lieu of their all-black uniforms. The Tennessee 
Titans wore a Number 9 decal on the back of their helmets to honor former 
Titans quarterback Steve McNair, who was killed on July 4, while the Philadelphia 
Eagles wore a decal with the initials of Jim Johnson, their longtime defensive 
coordinator who died on July 28. The Seattle Seahawks also unveiled a lime 
green jersey with blue shoulders, to pay tribute to the new Major League 
Soccer team with whom they share Qwest Field. The jersey No. 71 was retired 
for former offensive lineman Walter Jones on December 9, 2009. The Miami 
Dolphins, after a four-year hiatus, brought back their alternate orange 
jerseys and wore them against the New York Jets on October 12. Several 
rule changes were passed at the league's annual owners meeting in Dana 
Point, California during the week of March 23. The following rules were 
passed to improve player safety and reduce injuries:[42] The replay system 
will now be allowed to cover the following situations:[44] Other new rules 
included:[44] After one season with the New York Jets, Brett Favre retired 
again from football on February 11, 2009 and was released on April 28, 
2009, making him a free agent. On May 4, 2009, rumors began nationwide 
on the Internet, radio and t.v. outlets about him coming out of retirement 
again and possibly joining the Minnesota Vikings, his division arch-rival 
when he was with the Green Bay Packers, also meeting with Vikings head 
coach Brad Childress that week. On May 11, in an indication of Favre's 
possible return, it was reported he was scheduled to have a procedure on 
his torn biceps tendon on his throwing arm he injured when he was with 
the Jets and it was either a surgical or non-surgical process but wasn't 
confirmed throughout May. On June 15, 2009, he revealed he had surgery 
on his right torn biceps tendon and considered on playing again. On July 
15, 2009, he informed the Vikings that he would make his decision of coming 
out of retirement or not by July 30, 2009, the day Vikings training camp 
started. On July 28, 2009, two days early before training camp, he informed 
the Vikings that he would remain retired. On August 18, 2009, it was reported 
that Favre got on a private jet and was heading to Minnesota to join the 
Vikings. It was later confirmed and he officially signed with the Minnesota 
Vikings. He was signed to a two-year, $25 million deal with an option for 
2010 for $13 million.[47] On December 6, 2009, Favre played in his 283rd 
consecutive game, breaking Jim Marshall's long-standing record. The Vikings 
finished their season with a record of 12–4 and made the playoffs as the 
number two seed. Favre was voted to the 2010 Pro Bowl, but did not participate 
and was replaced by Tony Romo. Free agent quarterback Michael Vick was 
reinstated on July 27, 2009 after finishing his 2-year prison term and 
on August 13, 2009, he signed a one-year, $1.6 million contract with the 
Philadelphia Eagles also with an option in 2010 for 5 million.[48] Vick 
finished the season with one passing touchdown and two rushing touchdowns. 
He helped the Eagles to an 11–5 record and the NFC's number six seed. After 
disagreements between Jay Cutler and the Denver Broncos management, on 
March 15, 2009, Cutler requested a trade from the team. On April 2, 2009, 
Cutler was traded to the Chicago Bears from the Broncos along with a fifth-round 
pick in the 2009 NFL Draft. In return, the Broncos acquired quarterback 
Kyle Orton along with the Bears' first and third-round selections in 2009 
also the first round pick in 2010. Later in the season on October 20, 2009, 
the Bears signed Cutler to a two-year, $30 million contract extension up 
to 2013. The Indianapolis Colts started the season 14–0, and the New Orleans 
Saints started the season 13–0, the first time that two teams went that 
deep into the season without suffering a loss. The Colts also set the record 
for consecutive regular season wins over multiple seasons, running their 
mark to 23 before losing in Week 16 to the New York Jets.[49] On August 
17, 2009 Oakland Raiders head coach Tom Cable was accused of punching assistant 
coach Randy Hanson in the face and fracturing his jaw. The incident allegedly 
took place on August 5 during the Raiders training camp, held in Napa. 
On October 22, 2009, the Napa district attorney announced that no charges 
would be filed against Cable.[50] The Raiders finished their season with 
a record of 5–11. Cincinnati Bengals wide receiver Chris Henry died on 
December 17, 2009. He was placed on the injured reserved list four weeks 
before the accident. He suffered from injuries after falling from the back 
of his pick-up truck in Charlotte, North Carolina the previous day.[51] 
Chicago Bears defensive end Gaines Adams died on January 17, 2010, a few 
weeks after the Bears season had ended. He died in Greenwood, South Carolina 
from cardiac arrest caused by an enlarged heart.[52] On January 24, 2010, 
the New Orleans Saints defeated the Minnesota Vikings in the NFC Championship 
Game in overtime by a score of 31–28. The win secured their berth in Super 
Bowl XLIV, the franchise's first ever Super Bowl. Later on February 7, 
the Saints defeated the Indianapolis Colts in the Super Bowl by a score 
of 31–17. Quarterback Drew Brees was named the MVP. The St. Louis Rams 
finish as the NFL's tenth 1–15 or 0–16 team, giving them a record from 
2007 to 2009 of six wins and forty-two losses. Since a regular schedule 
began in 1936, only the wartime Cardinals have achieved a comparably bad 
record over three seasons: going 1–29 between 1943 and 1945 if one includes 
Card-Pitt, and 4–27 if one only includes Cardinals seasons. The New Orleans 
Saints became the first team in NFL history to lose their last three regular 
season games and then go on to the Super Bowl and win. For the first time 
since the 1993 season, the AFC‘s and NFC's top seeds, the Indianapolis 
Colts and the New Orleans Saints respectively, played one another in the 
Super Bowl, where the Saints defeated the Colts, 31–17. In a Week 6 game 
against the Tennessee Titans, the New England Patriots’ Tom Brady threw 
five touchdown passes in the second quarter, an NFL record. The Patriots 
led the Titans 45–0 at halftime, also a league record, before winning the 
game 59–0, tied for the league's largest shutout margin since the 1970 
AFL–NFL merger.[56] DeAngelo Williams and Jonathan Stewart of the Carolina 
Panthers became the first teammates in NFL history to rush for 1,100 yards 
in the same season. Williams rushed for 1,117 yards, and Stewart ran for 
1,133 yards. In Week 2, the Arizona Cardinals’ Kurt Warner set a new NFL 
record for completion percentage, completing 92.3% of his passes (24 completions 
in 26 attempts) in a 31–17 win over the Jacksonville Jaguars. The previous 
record had been set by Vinny Testaverde in 1993. If postseason games are 
included, the record holder is Tom Brady of the New England Patriots, who 
completed 26 of 28 attempts on January 12, 2008, also against the Jaguars. 
In Week 13, the Denver Broncos' Brandon Marshall caught a record 21 catches 
in a losing effort against the Indianapolis Colts. (The record was previously 
held by the San Francisco 49ers' Terrell Owens, who had 20 catches in a 
2001 game.) Aaron Rodgers of the Green Bay Packers became the first quarterback 
to throw for 4,000 yards in each of his first two seasons as a starter. 
(Rodgers, Cam Newton of the Carolina Panthers, Andrew Luck of the Indianapolis 
Colts, and Kurt Warner of the St. Louis Rams are the only quarterbacks 
to throw for 4,000 in their first season as a starter. Warner, however, 
passed for only 3,429 in 2000. Rodgers passed for 4,038 in 2008 and 4,434 
in 2009.)[57] On January 3, 2010, Chris Johnson of the Tennessee Titans 
became the sixth rusher in NFL history to eclipse 2,000 rushing yards in 
a season. Johnson also broke the all-purpose yards from scrimmage record 
previously held by Marshall Faulk. In a Week 15 game against the Kansas 
City Chiefs on December 20, 2009, the Cleveland Browns’ Joshua Cribbs returned 
two kickoffs for touchdowns, giving him eight for his career, and setting 
a new league record. Cribbs also became one of only two players to score 
two 100-plus yard touchdowns in the same game. (The feat was first accomplished 
by Ted Ginn, Jr. of the Miami Dolphins in Week 8 of the 2009 season.) For 
the opening game of their new stadium, the Dallas Cowboys distributed 105,121 
tickets, setting an NFL record for attendance in a single game. The old 
mark of 103,467 occurred in October 2005 at a 49ers-Cardinals game at Azteca 
Stadium in Mexico. Drew Brees of the New Orleans Saints set an NFL record 
for completion percentage in a season. Brees was 363 of 514, a completion 
percentage of 70.6. (The record of 70.55% had previously been set in the 
strike-shortened 1982 season by Ken Anderson of the Cincinnati Bengals. 
Brees sat out the last game of the 2009 season since New Orleans had secured 
home-field advantage throughout the NFC Playoffs.) On January 10, 2010, 
the Arizona Cardinals defeated the Green Bay Packers 51–45 for a combined 
total of 96 points, setting a new NFL playoff record for total combined 
points scored.[58] This game has been given the nicknames "The Shootout", 
and the "Nobody Stopping Nobody Game".[59] On January 24, 2010, the NFC 
and AFC championship games averaged 52.9 million viewers, making it the 
most-viewed conference championship day since the two games in 1982 averaged 
60.2 million viewers. Fox's telecast of the Saints’ 31–28 overtime win 
over the Vikings earned a 30.6 fast-national Nielsen rating (57.9 million 
viewers), marking Fox's biggest audience ever for an NFC championship game. 
It was also the second largest all-time audience for any conference title 
telecast, trailing only the 1982 49ers-Cowboys game (68.7 million viewers 
on CBS).[60] Excluding Super Bowl telecasts, the Saints-Vikings game was 
the most-viewed television program since the "Seinfeld" finale in 1998. 
Meanwhile, CBS earned a 26.3 fast-national rating (46.9 million viewers) 
for the Colts–Jets AFC championship game in the early window, marking the 
largest audience for an AFC title game since NBC earned 47.5 million viewers 
for Patriots–Dolphins in 1986.[60] Super Bowl XLIV surpassed the 1983 finale 
of M*A*S*H, as the most viewed program in history. It was watched by 153.4 
million people.[61] Compelling story lines included the city of New Orleans 
and its ongoing recovery from Hurricane Katrina, as well as Colts quarterback 
Peyton Manning's attempt at a second Super Bowl ring. Eight teams hired 
new head coaches prior to the start of the 2009 season, while two made 
their interim coaches permanent, and another moved from one team to another 
after being fired by a team: The following coaches were fired during the 
2009 season: [63] [64] The following were the players of the week during
