Jeffrey Franklin Kent (born March 7, 1968, in Bellflower, California) is 
a former Major League Baseball second baseman. Kent won the National League 
Most Valuable Player award in 2000 with the San Francisco Giants, and he 
is the all-time leader in home runs among second basemen.[1] He drove in 
90 or more runs from 1997 to 2005, a streak of run production for a second 
baseman which is a position typically known for its defense.[1][2] Kent 
is a five-time All-Star, and his 560 career doubles put him tied for 21st 
on the all-time doubles list.[1][3] Born in Bellflower, California, Kent 
graduated from Edison High School in Huntington Beach, California. Kent 
played at UC Berkeley prior to being drafted in the 20th round of the 1989 
amateur draft by the Toronto Blue Jays. Prior to attending college, Kent 
had a serious run-in with his Edison High School baseball coach; he was 
removed from the team as a result.[4] After four seasons in the minor leagues, 
Kent was invited to spring training with the Toronto Blue Jays in 1992 
and made the opening day roster. He made his debut on April 12 against 
the Baltimore Orioles and recorded his first career hit (a double) in the 
6th inning against José Mesa. He hit his first home run on April 14 against 
New York Yankees pitcher Lee Guetterman. He saw limited at-bats early in 
the season; however, an injury to starting third baseman Kelly Gruber granted 
Kent a more regular role in the line-up. Kent was traded to the Mets on 
August 27, 1992, for pitcher David Cone, as Toronto bolstered their pitching 
rotation for a successful World Series run. Kent's time with the Mets was 
marked with some success and some failure. Although he batted well, particularly 
for a second baseman, the Mets were among the worst teams in the National 
League. Furthermore, he acquired a very poor reputation in the clubhouse, 
where he was known for a quick temper and isolationism. He refused to participate 
in his hazing ritual with the Mets, feeling he had left his rookie status 
back in Toronto. During the 1992 season, he started the only game of his 
career at shortstop in order to allow Willie Randolph to play his final 
career game at second base. In a deal made prior to the 1996 trade deadline, 
the Mets infamously sent Kent and José Vizcaíno to the Cleveland Indians 
for Álvaro Espinoza and Carlos Baerga. The following offseason, Kent was 
again traded, this time to the San Francisco Giants along with José Vizcaíno 
and Julián Tavárez. The San Francisco trade was initially very unpopular, 
as it sent Matt Williams, a longtime Giant and a fan-favorite, to the Indians. 
Brian Sabean, in his first year as general manager of the Giants, was so 
widely criticized for the move that he famously defended himself to the 
media by saying, "I am not an idiot." Kent's career took off in San Francisco, 
starting in 1997. Immediately inserted in the line-up behind superstar 
Barry Bonds, and with the confidence of manager Dusty Baker, Kent finally 
rose to his full potential, hitting .250 with 29 home runs and 121 RBI.[5] 
He was consistently among the top RBI hitters in the league over his next 
five seasons with the Giants, amassing 689 RBI over six years. He also 
won the 1998 Willie Mac Award for his spirit and leadership. Kent's contributions 
were recognized in 2000 (33 HR, 125 RBI, .334 BA, and a .986 fielding percentage)[5] 
with the National League MVP Award, beating out teammate and perennial 
MVP candidate Barry Bonds. Despite the fact that Bonds overshadowed Kent 
in almost every offensive category, it was Kent's clutch hitting in RBI 
spots that won many games for the Giants that year, and ultimately won 
him the award. The Giants finished first in the NL West at 97–65, but lost 
to the Mets in the National League Division Series 3-games-to-1.[6] In 
2002, Kent had another stellar year for a second baseman (37 HR, 108 RBI, 
.313 BA, and a .978 fielding percentage).[5] The combination of Kent and 
MVP-winner Bonds propelled the Giants to a 95–66 record, good enough for 
the NL Wild Card. The Giants would beat the Atlanta Braves in the National 
League Division Series 3–2, and the St. Louis Cardinals in the National 
League Championship Series 4–1. In the World Series for the first time 
since 1989, the Giants would nearly clinch the championship (failing to 
hold a 5–0, 7th-inning lead) in the sixth game, before falling to the Anaheim 
Angels in seven games.[7] Despite the team's success that season, Kent's 
relationship with the Giants had soured. The Giants front office had lost 
confidence in Kent after an incident during spring training left him with 
a broken wrist. Kent had initially claimed that the wrist was broken while 
washing his truck; ensuing media reports indicated that Kent had crashed 
his motorcycle while performing wheelies and other stunts, in direct violation 
of his contract.[8] In addition, growing tension had developed between 
Kent and Bonds: a midseason shoving match in the Giants dugout was widely 
reported in 2002.[9] The departure of manager Dusty Baker also factored 
into Kent's eventual decision to leave the Giants. Kent signed a two-year, 
$19.9 million deal with the Houston Astros, citing his desire to be closer 
to his family's Texas ranch. Kent turned one of the outs and collected 
an assist during a triple play on August 19, 2004, against Philadelphia, 
when Todd Pratt grounded out with the bases loaded in the fifth inning. 
Kent forced Marlon Byrd out at second base before throwing Pratt out at 
first base. It was Houston's first triple play turned in 13 years.[10] 
On October 2, 2004, he hit his 288th home run as a second baseman, surpassing 
Ryne Sandberg as the all-time home run leader at that position. In possibly 
his finest moment as an Astro, Kent hit a three-run homer in the bottom 
of the ninth in Game 5 of the 2004 National League Championship Series 
to put Houston ahead of the St. Louis Cardinals 3–2 in the series. However, 
the Cardinals would win games 6 and 7 in St. Louis to capture the pennant. 
On December 14, 2004, he signed a $21 million contract for 3 years with 
his hometown Los Angeles Dodgers. Kent had a good 2005 season, leading 
the Dodgers in batting average, on-base percentage, slugging, runs, hits, 
doubles, home runs and RBI (.289, .377, .512, 100, 160, 36, 29, and 105 
respectively).[11] This was the best year by a Dodger second baseman since 
Jackie Robinson. While missing games early on in the 2006 season because 
of an oblique injury, he came back late in the season and helped the Dodgers 
reach the postseason.[12] After the 2005 season, Kent signed an extension 
that would take him to the 2008 season.[13] Following 2008, Kent announced 
his retirement from baseball on January 22, 2009.[14] Kent and his wife 
Dana reside near Austin, Texas, where they raise their four children, a 
daughter and three sons.[15] He also owns the 4,000-acre (1,600 ha) "Diamond 
K" cattle ranch near Tilden, Texas.[16] In 2008, Kent purchased the Lakecliff 
Country Club in Spicewood, Texas.[17] Kent also owns Kent Powersports, 
a chain of motorcycle and ATV dealerships.[18] Kent appeared as a contestant 
on the Summer 2009 television series Superstars, where he was teamed with 
actress Ali Landry in a series of sports competitions. They finished in 
fifth place in the competition.[19] In 2012, Kent participated in Survivor: 
Philippines, the twenty-fifth season of the American CBS competitive reality 
television series Survivor. He was the 9th contestant voted off, which 
placed him tenth and made him the second member of the jury, giving him 
a right to vote for the eventual winner.[20] When he was voted off, Kent 
claimed that the million dollar prize was "six hundred grand by the time 
Obama takes it".[21] He has been an advocate for Major League Baseball 
using blood tests for HGH.[22] Since 2011, Kent has served as a spring 
training instructor for the San Francisco Giants.[23] He also coaches his 
sons' Little League teams, and in 2014 he became a volunteer assistant 
for Southwestern University's baseball team.[24] In 2011, Kent donated 
$100,000 and raised awareness to help reinstate the Cal baseball program, 
which was being cut for cost-saving purposes.[25] In 2014, Kent announced 
the creation of the Jeff Kent Women Driven Scholarship Endowment to provide 
a full scholarship each year to one female student-athlete at UC Berkeley 
in perpetuity.[18][26] Eligible for the Hall of Fame for the first time 
in 2014, his chances were felt to be low because of poor defense and the 
tainted era he played in;[27] indeed, the writers gave Kent just 15.2% 
of their votes in his first year, well short of the required 75% for induction. 
In the following 2015 Hall of Fame vote, among the 17 returnees to the 
ballot, Kent was one of only three who saw a decrease in support, dropping
