As player As coach Timothy Shawn Teufel (born July 7, 1958) is a former 
Major League Baseball second baseman, and currently the third base coach 
for the New York Mets. Teufel was a member of the 1986 World Series champion 
New York Mets. Throughout his career, Teufel was also known for his batting 
stance, the "Teufel shuffle", in which he wiggled his buttocks back and 
forth before the pitcher's delivery. Teufel attended St. Mary's High School 
in Greenwich, Connecticut, and Clemson University in South Carolina. At 
age 19, he was drafted by the Milwaukee Brewers in the sixteenth round 
of the 1978 Major League Baseball Draft, but did not sign. Teufel was drafted 
by the Chicago White Sox in the third round of the secondary phase of the 
1979 Major League Baseball Draft, but again did not sign. In the 1980 Major 
League Baseball Draft, Teufel was drafted in the second round and signed 
with the Minnesota Twins where he started for 20 straight games. Teufel 
spent all of 1980 and 1981 with the Double-A Orlando Twins. He raised his 
average to .282 in 1982 earning a mid-season promotion to the Triple-A 
Toledo Mud Hens. In 1983, Teufel lit up the International League with a 
.323 batting average, 1.022 OPS, 27 home runs and 100 runs batted in resulting 
in a September call-up to the major leagues. He made his major league debut 
on September 3 in 13-0 drubbing at the hands of Scott McGregor and the 
Baltimore Orioles.[1] Teufel went 2-for-4 and score two runs to help the 
last place Twins snap a five-game losing streak on September 6.[2] On September 
16, Teufel led off the game by hitting his first major league home run 
off Jim Gott of the Toronto Blue Jays. His second career home run came 
in the eighth inning of the same game. In all, Teufel went 5-for-5 with 
two home runs and five runs scored in arguably the best offensive game 
of his career.[3] By the end of the season, the Twins surpassed the Seattle 
Mariners to avoid a last place finish. The following season, Teufel snatched 
the starting second base job away from former Rookie of the Year John Castino. 
In his rookie season, Teufel had 149 hits, 30 doubles, fourteen home runs, 
61 RBIs and provided solid defense at second base for the Twins. The Twins 
improved to 81-81 in 1984, which was good enough for a second-place finish 
in the American League West. Teufel finished fourth behind Alvin Davis, 
Mark Langston and teammate Kirby Puckett in American League Rookie of the 
Year balloting. The Twins fell back into fifth place in 1985. Following 
the season, Teufel was traded with minor leaguer Pat Crosby to the New 
York Mets for Billy Beane, Bill Latham and Joe Klink.[4] Although Tim had 
hit far better against right-handed pitchers in 1985, he was used mainly 
against left-handed pitchers in a platoon system with New York. Splitting 
time with Wally Backman, Teufel started quickly in 1986 with a go-ahead 
14th inning single in his first game with the Mets (although they lost 
in the bottom half of the inning). His average stayed around .220 into 
June. On June 10, Teufel had one of the most exciting moments in the Mets 
championship season with a walk-off pinch-hit grand slam in the bottom 
of the 11th inning against the Philadelphia Phillies. The Mets' reputation 
as a rowdy bunch was punctuated on July 19 when Tim, Ron Darling, Bob Ojeda, 
and Rick Aguilera were arrested after a bar fight with off-duty police 
officers in Houston, Texas. Tim was fined $200 for his part and none of 
the four missed any playing time, though this incident did help fuel some 
rivalry between the Mets and their impending 1986 National League Championship 
Series competitors, the Houston Astros. Teufel managed just one hit and 
no RBI against the Astros in the Championship Series won by the Mets in 
six games.[5] In game one of the 1986 World Series against the Boston Red 
Sox, the Mets suffered a fate eerily similar to that which they suffered 
in game one of the 1973 against the Oakland Athletics, in which the usually 
sure handed Félix Millán committed a third inning error that led to both 
of Oakland's runs in their 2-1 victory over the Mets.[6] With a runner 
on second and one out, Rich Gedman hit a ground ball to Teufel at second 
which Teufel misplayed, allowing the runner to score. Boston held on for 
the 1-0 victory.[7] He hit a home run in Game five of the Series, but the 
Mets lost that game.[8] For the series, Teufel batted .444 with four hits 
in nine at bats. The home run was the only postseason RBI and run scored 
of Teufel's career. 1987 was Tim's best season statistically as he tied 
his 1984 home run and RBI highs despite playing in only 97 games. His .308 
batting average, .398 on-base percentage and .545 slugging percentage were 
career-highs. Despite significantly outperforming Wally Backman, he continued 
to be used in a platoon role. He was given the chance to play every day 
in 1988, but spent all of April below .200 and missed three weeks from 
mid-May with an injury causing the platoon to be reinstated. After a poor 
second half, Teufel was used in just one game in the 1988 NLCS. In 1989, 
hot prospect Gregg Jefferies was given most of the time at second base 
and Tim spent half of his time at first base. His playing time further 
decreased in 1990 as he played in career-lows of 80 games with 175 at-bats 
while shifting between first, second and third base. Teufel's 1991 average 
was at a paltry .118 on May 31 when the Mets traded him to the San Diego 
Padres for Garry Templeton, who retired after the season. Teufel hit between 
.220 and .250 in all three seasons with San Diego while continuing to play 
at all three bases defensively. On April 14, 1993, he went 5-for-5 for 
the second time in his career but the Padres lost the game on their way 
to a 101-loss season.[9] Teufel was granted free agency and retired after 
the 1993 season. Teufel returned to the Mets as a roving instructor for 
2001 and 2002. He was named the manager of the Mets' Rookie-level minor 
league Brooklyn Cyclones for 2003 and was promoted to the Single-A St. 
Lucie Mets for 2004 and 2005.[10][11] After the two seasons near .500, 
the Mets announced Teufel was being replaced by new Baseball Hall of Fame 
member, Gary Carter, for 2006. Teufel decided to take a break from baseball 
for the year.[12] He was named manager of the Savannah Sand Gnats on January 
11, 2007, and was a Mets' representative at the 2008 Major League Baseball 
Draft.[13][14] He returned as St. Lucie's manager in 2008 and 2009. In 
2010, in his first season managing the Double-A Binghamton Mets, he led 
the team to a 66-76 record and a fifth-place finish in the Eastern League.[15] 
He was named manager of the Buffalo Bisons in January 2010.[16] In 2011 
he was named manager of Leones del Caracas in the Venezuelan Professional 
Baseball League. On November 16, 2011 he was replaced as manager by Carlos 
Lezcano.[17] Teufel returned to the New York Mets organization as the new 
third base coach replacing former coach Chip Hale.[18] In December, 2010, 
Teufel was sued for $1.2 million by Irving Picard for bogus profits he
