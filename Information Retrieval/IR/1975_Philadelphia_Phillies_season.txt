The 1975 Philadelphia Phillies season was the 93rd in the history of the 
franchise. The Phillies finished in second place in the National League 
East with a record of 86-76, 6 1⁄2 games behind the NL East champion Pittsburgh 
Pirates. As a result, the Phillies had their first winning season in eight 
years. Early in the 1975 season, Phillies general manager Paul Owens wanted 
a righthanded power hitter and a first baseman with more power than Tommy 
Hutton, a lefthanded contact hitter. Both Mike Schmidt and Dave Cash lobbied 
Owens to acquire Dick Allen. Allen had to be persuaded by several of his 
future teammates that both the organizational and racial climate in Philadelphia 
had changed for the better since his 1969 departure from the team. On May 
4, the Phillies traded their first baseman Willie Montañez to the Giants 
for Garry Maddox which provided a bat for the outfield and opened first 
for Allen.[4] The Phillies acquired Allen three-days later on May 7, 1975. 
Fans welcomed Allen's return. On May 14, 1975, 30,908 fans came to Veterans 
Stadium for Allen's return to Philadelphia and saw Steve Carlton shut-out 
Cincinnati by the score of 4 to 0. Allen played first base, batted fifth 
between Greg Luzinski and Mike Schmidt and was given a standing ovation 
when he stepped into the batter's box in a Phillies uniform for the first 
time since the final game of the 1969 season. Allen lined a two-out single 
to center, prompting another standing ovation.[5] Infielders Other batters
