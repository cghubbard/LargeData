Heard Smith – Chief Operating Officer Troy Squires – Global Director of 
Sales and Marketing AstroTurf is a brand of artificial turf. The original 
AstroTurf product was a short-pile synthetic turf.[1] The prime reason 
to incorporate AstroTurf on game fields was to avoid the cost of laying 
natural turf, especially indoors. The name "AstroTurf" has evolved into 
a generic trademark and is sometimes used to refer to all brands of artificial 
turf.[2] The original AstroTurf brand product was co-invented in 1965 by 
Donald L. Elbert, James M. Faria and Robert T. Wright. It was patented 
in 1965 and originally sold under the name "ChemGrass." It was re-branded 
as AstroTurf by a company employee named John A. Wortmann after its first 
well-publicized use at the Houston Astrodome stadium in 1966.[3] Early 
iterations of the short pile turf swept the major stadia, but the product 
did need improvement. Concerns over directionality and traction led Monsanto's 
R&D department to implement a texturized nylon system. By imparting a crimped 
texture to the nylon after it was extruded, the product became highly uniform. 
In 1987, Monsanto consolidated its AstroTurf management, marketing, and 
technical activities in Dalton, Georgia, as AstroTurf Industries, Inc. 
In 1988, Balsam AG purchased all the capital stock of AstroTurf Industries, 
Inc. In 1994, Southwest Recreational Industries, Inc. (SRI) acquired the 
AstroTurf brand. In 1996, SRI was acquired by American Sports Products 
Group Inc. (ASPG). While AstroTurf was the industry leader throughout the 
late 20th century, other companies emerged in the early 2000s. FieldTurf, 
AstroTurf's chief competitor in the early 2000s and today, marketed a product 
of tall pile polyethylene turf with infill. This third generation turf, 
as it became known, changed the landscape of the marketplace. Although 
SRI successfully marketed AstroPlay, a third generation turf product, increased 
competition gave way to lawsuits. In 2000, SRI was awarded $1.5 million 
in a lawsuit after FieldTurf was deemed to have lied to the public by making 
false statements regarding its own product and making false claims about 
AstroTurf and AstroPlay products.[4] Despite their legal victory, increased 
competition took its toll. In 2004, SRI declared bankruptcy.[5] Out of 
the bankruptcy proceedings, Textile Management Associates, Inc. (TMA) of 
Dalton, Georgia, acquired the AstroTurf brand and other assets. TMA began 
marketing the AstroTurf brand under the company AstroTurf, LLC. In 2006, 
General Sports Venue (GSV) became TMA's marketing partner for the AstroTurf 
brand for the American market. AstroTurf, LLC handled the marketing of 
AstroTurf in the rest of the world.[6] In 2009, TMA acquired GSV in order 
to enter the marketplace as a direct seller. AstroTurf, LLC focused its 
efforts on research and development, which has promoted rapid growth. AstroTurf 
introduced new product features and installation methods, including AstroFlect 
(a heat reduction technology)[7] and field prefabrication (indoor, climate-controlled 
inlaying).[8] AstroTurf also introduced a product called "RootZone" consisting 
of crimped fibers designed to encapsulate infill.[9] This product has been 
adopted by many professional organizations and colleges in the United States.[10] 
In 2016, SportGroup Holding announced that it would purchase AstroTurf, 
along with its associated manufacturing facilities.[11] 1964 1966 1967
