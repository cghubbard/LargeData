John Derran Lackey (born October 23, 1978) is an American professional 
baseball starting pitcher for the Chicago Cubs of Major League Baseball. 
He previously played for the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, Boston Red 
Sox, and St. Louis Cardinals. A three-time World Series champion, Lackey 
is regarded as a key figure in his clubs' postseason success, winning the 
title-clinching games of two out of the three Series. Selected to the MLB 
All-Star Game in 2007, he won that year's American League (AL) earned run 
average (ERA) title. After missing the 2012 season due to ulnar collateral 
ligament reconstruction surgery in his pitching elbow, and helping the 
Red Sox win the 2013 World Series, Lackey was named the winner of the Tony 
Conigliaro Award. A right-handed pitcher and batter, the Anaheim Angels 
selected Lackey from Grayson County College in Texas in the 1999 amateur 
draft. He made his MLB debut with the Angels in 2002 and helped the franchise 
win its first World Series title that year. After winning more than 100 
games with the Angels, Lackey signed with Boston in free agency prior to 
the 2010 season. Declining performance and elbow injuries in 2011 led him 
to allow the most earned runs in the American League before missing the 
next season due to elbow surgery. Lackey rebounded in 2013 to win his second 
championship. Boston traded him to St. Louis in July 2014, and prior to 
the 2016 season, he signed with Chicago as a free agent. Known for his 
intense competitiveness and overall durability, Lackey has reached at least 
200 innings pitched six times in his career, and in five seasons has been 
in the top ten in games started. He has reached at least 10 wins in each 
year that he has played in since 2003. In ten of 14 seasons, he registered 
an ERA below 4.00 − once below 3.00 − and four times, has been in the top 
ten in ERA. He has also twice reached the top ten in both wins and strikeouts. 
He has appeared in eight postseasons overall. In 2007 and 2015, he received 
votes for the Cy Young Award. Lackey was born in Abilene, Texas to Derran 
and Sharon Lackey. Before Lackey was in high school, he played at Dixie 
Little League in Abilene. Lackey attended Abilene High School, and was 
a letterman in football, basketball, and baseball. In baseball, he was 
a two-time first team All-District honoree and as a senior, he was also 
an All-State selection. He played one season of baseball at the University 
of Texas at Arlington (UTA), playing first base and sometimes moonlighting 
as a relief pitcher. The first summer after attending UTA, Lackey first 
learned to pitch in the Kansas Jayhawk Summer League. In 1999, he played 
on the Junior College World Series champion Grayson County College team 
in Denison, Texas, which went 50–13. In 100 innings pitched (IP), he posted 
a 10–3 record with a 4.23 earned run average (ERA) and 88 strikeouts. At 
the plate, he batted .428 with 15 home runs (HR) and 81 runs batted in 
(RBI). In the World Series, he tallied eight hits, two HR, and seven RBI.[1] 
The Anaheim Angels selected Lackey in the second round of the 1999 Major 
League Baseball draft as the 68th overall. He began his professional career 
with the Boise Hawks in the Short Season Class A Northwest League, posting 
a 6–2 record and a 4.98 ERA. Already in his first year, Lackey became known 
for his competitiveness. According to MLB.com, Tom Kotchman, the veteran 
manager, recalled "one particular game when he tried to replace Lackey 
only to have the tall Texan tell him otherwise. Sure enough, Kotchman trotted 
back to the dugout and Lackey kept dominating, as if to say, 'See? I'm 
not done yet.'"[2] In 2000, Lackey split his time between the Single-A 
Cedar Rapids Kernels, High-A Lake Elsinore Storm, and Double-A Erie SeaWolves. 
Because of his quick ascent up the minor league ladder, he was named the 
Angels' Minor League Pitcher of the Year,[3] posting a combined 15–9 record 
with a 3.15 ERA. He began 2001 with Double-A Arkansas before being promoted 
in July of that year to the Triple-A Salt Lake Bees, where he struggled 
a bit, posting a 3–4 record and a 6.71 ERA. He recovered in the 2002 season, 
being named Best Pitching Prospect of the Pacific Coast League and accumulating 
an 8–2 record with a 2.57 ERA.[3] The Angels called Lackey up to the major 
leagues on June 24, 2002, dropping his first major league start against 
the Texas Rangers. He was optioned back to Salt Lake, only to be recalled 
on June 28 to replace pitcher Al Levine. Two days later, he replaced Scott 
Schoeneweis in the Angels' rotation and gained his first victory against 
the cross-town rival Los Angeles Dodgers. Lackey was also the winning pitcher 
for the American League (AL) Wild Card-clinching victory against Texas 
on September 26. With the AL Wild Card in hand, the Angels began their 
march through the 2002 postseason, facing the New York Yankees in the American 
League Division Series (ALDS). He made his relief and postseason debut 
in Game 3, allowing two earned runs in the midst of an Angels rally to 
win 9–6. He gained his first postseason victory against the Minnesota Twins 
in Game 4 of the American League Championship Series (ALCS), pitching seven 
innings while allowing only three hits and striking out seven. With their 
victory in five games over the Twins, the Angels earned their first AL 
pennant and trip to the World Series. After starter Kevin Appier was pulled 
after two-plus innings in Game 2, Lackey pitched two innings giving up 
two earned runs on two hits, receiving a no-decision in the eventual 11–10 
Angel victory over the San Francisco Giants. He started Game 4 of the Series, 
pitching four scoreless innings, but gaining a no-decision after allowing 
three hits and three earned runs in the 5th inning in the eventual Angels 
loss. However, it was in Game 7 of the World Series on October 27, 2002, 
Lackey allowed one earned run on four hits while striking out four in five 
innings,[4] allowing the Angels to hold an early 4–1 lead to hand over 
to their bullpen trio of Brendan Donnelly, Francisco Rodríguez, and Troy 
Percival to seal their World Series title. Lackey became only the second 
rookie in World Series history to start and win Game 7, the other being 
Babe Adams of the 1909 Pittsburgh Pirates.[5] It was the first of two Series 
title-clinching games in which he received credit as the winning pitcher.[6] 
Mike Scioscia announced that Lackey would start on Opening Day 2003, replacing 
injured ace Jarrod Washburn.[7] Lackey struggled his sophomore year, compiling 
a 10–16 record with a 4.63 ERA while leading the team in hits and earned 
runs allowed, and wild pitches. He finished 2004 with a record of 14–13 
and a 4.67 ERA, helping the Angels win their first division title since 
1986. The 2005 campaign saw Lackey mature further, working into the sixth 
inning in 30 of his 36 starts, earning a 14–5 record with a 3.44 ERA. He 
ranked second in strikeouts per nine innings (with 8.6 K/9 IP) and third 
in strikeouts (199). However, he finished with the third most wild pitches 
in the league. He participated in the MLB 2006 All-Star Series in Japan.[1] 
After the Angels placed 2005 Cy Young winner Bartolo Colón on the disabled 
list in 2006, Lackey emerged as the team's ace, and skipper Mike Scioscia 
made him the number one starter after the All-Star break. On July 7, 2006, 
Lackey retired 27 consecutive batters after Mark Kotsay of the Oakland 
Athletics led off the first inning with double. He threw a career high 
30 2⁄3 scoreless innings from July 2 through July 19, 2006, when he gave 
up a fifth-inning home run to Ben Broussard of the Cleveland Indians, leaving 
his scoreless streak 5 1⁄3 innings short of the club record, set by Jim 
McGlothlin in 1967.[8] He was later named American League Pitcher of the 
Month for July 2006. On June 13, 2007, Lackey became the first pitcher 
to win 10 games for the 2007 season.[9] On July 1, Lackey was named as 
one of three Angels to represent the club and the American League at the 
2007 All-Star Game. Lackey finished the 2007 season with an American League 
leading 3.01 ERA. He finished in third place for that season's Cy Young 
Award voting. On July 10, 2008, Lackey allowed six runs on 15 hits in 5 
2⁄3 innings. The 15 hits tied an all-time Angels' franchise record for 
hits allowed by a starter in a single game.[10] On July 18, 2008, Lackey 
recorded his 1000th career strikeout, against Kevin Youkilis of the Boston 
Red Sox. Lackey was the sixth Angels pitcher to accomplish that feat.[11] 
On July 29, 2008, Lackey pitched against the Red Sox at Fenway Park, carrying 
a no-hitter into the ninth inning. He came within two outs of a no-hitter 
before Dustin Pedroia singled to left to spoil it. The next batter, Youkilis, 
hit a two-run homer to break up the shutout. Lackey still finished the 
game and the Angels won 6–2. In Game 1 of the 2008 ALDS, he gave up a two-run 
home run to Jason Bay of the Red Sox, and was charged with the Angels' 
first loss in the series. In his first start of 2009, on May 16, Lackey 
was ejected after his first two pitches of the season in a game against 
the Texas Rangers. Lackey threw his first pitch behind Ian Kinsler's head, 
and hit Kinsler in the side with his second pitch. Home plate umpire Bob 
Davidson immediately ejected Lackey. Since Kinsler scored, Lackey was charged 
with an earned run, giving him an ERA of infinity.[12] Kinsler had hit 
two home runs against the Angels the night before.[13] On August 30, 2009, 
Lackey earned his 100th career win against the Oakland Athletics, giving 
up one run (on an error by shortstop Erick Aybar) through eight innings. 
Lackey is one of only six major league pitchers who won at least 11 games 
in each year from 2004 to 2009, the others being CC Sabathia, Derek Lowe, 
Johan Santana, Javier Vázquez, and Jason Marquis. At the end of the 2009 
season Lackey became a free agent, widely regarded as the best free agent 
starting pitcher on the 2010 market. Baseball Prospectus declared, "Lackey 
stands alone as the best of the best, a relatively young righty who carries 
significantly less risk than the other high-upside hurlers", additionally 
noting he faced a tough division and tougher league and his statistics 
would likely be even better if he were a National League pitcher.[14] As 
one of the top free agent starters on the market, he was predicted to command 
a deal worth around $70 to $80 million, similar to the deal A. J. Burnett 
received from the Yankees. Lackey drew interest from many teams, including 
the Seattle Mariners, the Milwaukee Brewers,[15] the New York Yankees,[16] 
the New York Mets, the Boston Red Sox, and the Pittsburgh Pirates.[17] 
He formally declined the Angels' offer of salary arbitration on December 
8.[18] On December 16, 2009, Lackey officially signed a five-year contract 
worth $82.5 million with the Boston Red Sox.[19] His contract had a clause 
where if he missed a full season due to injury, the Red Sox would have 
a team option at the end of the contract worth the league minimum.[20] 
On April 7, 2010 Lackey made his debut for Boston at Fenway Park against 
the Yankees, pitching six innings of three-hit, shutout ball. Lackey posted 
a 10–5 record and a 4.26 ERA during the first half of the 2010 season and 
finished his first season with the Red Sox with a 14–11 record, 4.40 ERA 
over 215 innings pitched. Lackey went 2–5 with an 8.01 ERA in his first 
seven starts, and in May, he was placed on the disabled list with an elbow 
strain in his throwing arm.[21] Lackey returned shortly, recording an ERA 
over 5.00 in every month but one.[22] In 28 starts, Lackey finished the 
season 12–12 with a 6.41 ERA and 1.62 WHIP, both career worsts. The 114 
earned runs he allowed were the most in the American League,[23] and his 
ERA was the highest in Red Sox history for a starter with at least 150 
innings pitched. In the end of the 2011 season, Lackey and two more starting 
pitchers (Josh Beckett and Jon Lester, allegedly) were in the center of 
a controversy that told that the three (and sometimes more) drank beers 
and ate fried chicken in the clubhouse during games in which they were 
not pitching.[24][25][26] During a press conference, Ben Cherington, the 
new GM of the Boston Red Sox, revealed that John Lackey had Tommy John 
surgery during the 2011 offseason. As a result, Lackey did not pitch for 
the entire 2012 season.[27] Lackey was later seen drinking beer in the 
clubhouse during his rehabilitation, causing further controversy.[28][29] 
On April 6, Lackey injured his arm in his first start since September 2011. 
The Red Sox announced it was a right biceps strain.[30] On April 28, Lackey 
got his first win since the 2011 season, going six innings, giving up one 
run and five hits in a 6-1 win over the Houston Astros.[31] On October 
30, Lackey was the winning pitcher in Game 6 of the 2013 World Series, 
which clinched the Boston Red Sox' eighth World Series title. In doing 
so, Lackey became the first starting pitcher in Major League history to 
win two World Series "clinching" games with two different teams. Lackey 
garnered much media attention by his refusal to leave the game when Manager 
John Farrell came to the mound with two outs in the seventh inning, telling 
Farrell "this is my guy" (referring to the next batter, Matt Holliday). 
Farrell allowed Lackey to stay in the game, but he eventually walked Holliday 
to load the bases. Lackey exited to a standing ovation from Fenway Park.[32][33] 
Many credited Lackey's turnaround as a major reason for the Red Sox' success 
in 2013, especially at mid-season when Clay Buchholz went on the disabled 
list and Jon Lester was going through a rough stretch. Lackey finished 
2013 with a 10-13 record and a 3.52 ERA. He was plagued by a lack of run 
support throughout the season, but threw two complete games, the first 
time in a season that he had multiple complete games since 2008. After 
the season, Lackey was awarded with the Tony Conigliaro Award, an award 
given out to the player who has overcome the most adversity.[34] Lackey 
began the 2014 season as the Red Sox' number-two starter behind Lester. 
He made six starts in April, with four being quality starts, and two giving 
up six runs in less than six innings. Dating back to the previous May 23, 
he had thrown six straight quality starts, going 3-1 with a 1.60 ERA and 
34 strikeouts. On July 5, Orioles designated hitter Nelson Cruz went 3-for-3 
with a double off of Lackey. Cruz had served a 50-game suspension for his 
involvement in the Biogenesis baseball scandal the previous season, which 
Cruz claimed he had sought help from Biogenesis of American to fight a 
gastrointestinal infection. After the Cruz' big game, Lackey stated, "I'm 
not going to comment on him. I've got nothing to say about him. There are 
some things I would like to say but I'm not going to. You guys forget pretty 
conveniently about stuff."[35] Orioles manager Buck Showalter countered 
by saying, "Considering the timing of things, it's one of those things 
that you keep quiet about it and it reflects poorly upon the person who 
said it."[36] On July 31, 2014, the Red Sox traded Lackey with minor league 
pitcher Corey Littrell to the St. Louis Cardinals for outfielder Allen 
Craig and pitcher Joe Kelly.[37] In his Cardinals debut, Lackey pitched 
seven innings but was behind 2–0 when he exited the game. The Cardinals 
rallied for three runs the next inning, and ended up winning the game 3–2 
while crediting him the win,[38] the 150th of his career. Catcher A. J. 
Pierzynski, acquired from the Red Sox the same month, caught Lackey for 
the 19th time in 22 starts in 2014.[39] Wearing uniform number 41 during 
his tenure with Anaheim and Boston, Lackey acquired the number from new 
teammate Pat Neshek in exchange for an autographed Babe Ruth baseball.[40] 
In 10 regular season starts for the Cardinals, Lackey allowed two or fewer 
runs in seven of them.[41] He totaled a 3–3 W–L with a 4.30 ERA in 60 2⁄3 
IP with St. Louis, and his totals for the year including those with Boston 
were 14-10 W–L with a 3.82 ERA and 164 strikeouts in 198 innings. He made 
the postseason for the seventh time in his career, starting once each against 
the Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League Division Series (NLDS) and 
the San Francisco Giants in the National League Championship Series (NLCS). 
The Giants defeated the Cardinals in five games, ending their season. Instead 
of retiring and foregoing being paid the league minimum, Lackey had stated 
in the previous August that he would pitch in 2015 if the Cardinals picked 
up the option that actuated because he missed the 2012 season due to Tommy 
John surgery. On October 30, the Cardinals announced they had picked up 
the Tommy John option.[42] With a guaranteed base salary of $507,000, the 
club added performance bonuses before the start of the season.[43] In 7 2⁄3 
IP against the Chicago Cubs on May 7, 2015, Lackey struck out 10. He also 
drove in his third career run with a double, his third career extra base 
hit in a 5–1 win.[44] On July 12, despite the Cardinals losing to the Pittsburgh 
Pirates 6–5 in 14 innings, he achieved his sixth consecutive quality start, 
and 12th in 15 appearances.[45] He lost to the Cincinnati Reds on July 
29, but gave up just one run with eight strikeouts while allowing one walk 
and two hits. It was the fewest hits he allowed through that point in the 
season. He also allowed three runs or fewer in all but of one his prior 
17 starts.[46] By earning his 10th win of 2015 in a 6–2 defeat of the Miami 
Marlins on August 15, Lackey recorded his 12th consecutive season of double-digit 
victory totals. He struck out six in 8 1⁄3 innings and retired nine batters 
in a row at one point. One of the hits Lackey allowed was a single to Ichiro 
Suzuki, a hit with which Ichiro passed Ty Cobb for the total attained in 
top-level professional baseball organizations, including Nippon Professional 
Baseball and Major League Baseball.[47] With seven scoreless innings of 
the Milwaukee Brewers on September 17, Lackey reached 200 IP for the sixth 
time in his career and first time since 2010. He had a 2.23 ERA over his 
last 17 starts.[48] By reaching 200 IP, he triggered a $400,000 bonus, 
bringing his earnings for the season over $2 million.[43] Further, Lackey 
turned in a season that exceeded his career norms, including a career-best 
2.77 ERA, seventh-best in the league, and recorded 218 IP, his highest 
total since 2010. His fastball average speed for the season was 91.6 miles 
per hour (147.4 km/h), the highest since 2009.[49] The Cardinals won 100 
games and the National League Central division, and made Lackey the Game 
1 starter of the NLDS against the Cubs. He opposed Jon Lester – both men 
had faced the Cardinals in the World Series two years earlier as teammates 
with the Red Sox. Lackey held the Cubs hitless through the first five innings 
on the way to pitching 7 1⁄3 shutout innings in a 4–0 win.[50] The Cardinals 
started him on three days' for Game 4, the elimination game. He allowed 
a three-run home run to Javier Báez, Lackey's first allowed in the playoffs 
since 2008, a span of 75 1⁄3 innings.[51] The Cubs won this game and the 
series, ending the Cardinals' season,[52] with Lackey's free agency following.[53] 
On December 8, 2015, Lackey signed a two-year, $32 million contract with 
the Chicago Cubs.[54][55] On April 18, 2016, in a game against the Cardinals, 
his former club, Lackey struck out 11 hitters in seven innings, earning 
his third win of the season. It was also his first regular season win against 
St. Louis, making him only the 16th player to notch a win against all 30 
major league teams.[56] He joined Al Leiter, Randy Johnson, Kevin Brown, 
Barry Zito, Terry Mulholland, Curt Schilling, Woody Williams, Jamie Moyer, 
Javier Vazquez, Vicente Padilla, Derek Lowe, Dan Haren, A.J. Burnett, Kyle 
Lohse, and Tim Hudson as the only players to achieve this milestone.[57] 
He reached double-digit win totals for the 13th consecutive season on September 
21, 2016, in a 9−2 win over the Cincinnati Reds.[58] In 29 starts of 2016, 
Lackey finished 11-8 with a 3.35 ERA. With the Cubs finishing the season 
103-58, the team clinched the NL Central Division. Lackey won the World 
Series for the third time of his career, and with a third different team 
after the Cubs beat the Cleveland Indians in the 2016 World Series, ending 
a 108-year long drought for a championship.[59] On August 30, 2011, Lackey 
filed for divorce from Krista, his wife of almost three years, who had 
been battling cancer since March and underwent chemotherapy through June.[60][61][62][63] 
The divorce was finalized by February 2012.[64][65][66] Lackey resides 
in the Austin area in the off-season. He and his wife, Kristina Carter, 
are expecting their first child, a daughter, in November 2015. John is 
stepfather to Carter and Mavi, Kristina's children from her first marriage.[1] 
In 2009, the satirical publication The Onion published an article about 
Lackey, titled Superstitious John Lackey Has To Build, Destroy A Luxury 
Hotel Before Every Start.[67] The article was intended to satirize superstitious 
professional athletes. He was featured in a 2011 Kevin Fowler music video 
alongside fellow Red Sox starting pitchers Josh Beckett, Jon Lester, Tim
