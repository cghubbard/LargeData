With twelve national championships to date, Seattle's sports history began 
at the start of the 20th century with the Pacific Coast Hockey Association 
(PCHA)'s Seattle Metropolitans, which in 1917 became the first American 
hockey team to win the Stanley Cup. Seattle's sports history continues 
today with the city's five major professional teams: the National Football 
League (NFL)'s Seattle Seahawks, Major League Baseball (MLB)'s Seattle 
Mariners, Major League Soccer (MLS)' Seattle Sounders FC, the Women's National 
Basketball Association (WNBA)'s Seattle Storm and the National Women's 
Soccer League (NWSL)'s Seattle Reign FC. Seattle also boasts a strong history 
in collegiate sports, with two National Collegiate Athletic Association 
(NCAA) Division I schools: the University of Washington and Seattle University, 
and one NCAA Division II school, Seattle Pacific University. Seattle, now 
the fastest growing major city in the United States, is the largest metropolitan 
area in the U.S to have less than three teams representing the traditional 
"Big Four" – Baseball, Ice Hockey, Basketball and Football – American professional 
sports at the same time.[1] In 1976, the NFL's Seattle Seahawks began play. 
The Seahawks played at the Kingdome until its implosion in 2000. The Seahawks 
now play in CenturyLink Field. Professional soccer in Seattle has always 
involved the Seattle Sounders, whose original team played in the defunct 
NASL in the 1970s through to its demise in 1983. The name lived on in a 
second incarnation of the team, which played in the second level of US 
soccer from 1994 through 2008. In November 2007, Major League Soccer announced 
that Seattle would host the league's fifteenth franchise to start play 
in 2009. The team held a vote among its fan base for the team's name between 
March 27 and 31, 2008 and Seattle Sounders FC was chosen. The current version 
of the Sounders plays at CenturyLink Field. In 1977, following years of 
legal wrangling over the move of the Seattle Pilots, the MLB awarded Seattle 
a new baseball franchise, the Seattle Mariners. From 1977 the Mariners 
played in the Kingdome until mid-season 1999 when the team moved across 
the street to Safeco Field where they continue to play today. The WNBA's 
Seattle Storm arrived in Seattle in 2000, and they currently play in KeyArena. 
In 2013, Seattle's professional women's soccer team Seattle Reign FC, including 
several members of the decorated US women's national team, opened their 
first season at Starfire Sports Complex and have since played at Memorial 
Stadium in Seattle Center. In September 2012, the Seattle City Council 
agreed to move forward in a process towards building a $490 million new 
arena in the SoDo neighborhood.[2] This could bring the NBA back to Seattle 
along with the NHL.[citation needed] The NHL has proposed relocating or 
expanding to Seattle.[citation needed] National Titles* include all-league 
level championships. In U.S. professional men's soccer, there are currently 
three annual national champion honors: the MLS Cup, the Lamar Hunt U.S. 
Open Cup and the Supporters' Shield. In U.S. professional women's soccer, 
there are currently two annual national titles: the NWSL Shield and the 
NWSL Championship. The city of Seattle has a total of twelve national championship 
honors, including one Stanley Cup, one NBA Championship, one Super Bowl 
victory, two WNBA championships, four U.S. Open Cup championships, one 
MLS Supporters' Shield and two NWSL Shields. Seattle's first professional 
sports championship was brought to the city by the Seattle Metropolitans 
in 1917, when they became the first American team to win the coveted Stanley 
Cup by beating the Montréal Canadiens three games to one. They returned 
to the Stanley Cup finals twice more. Their first return, again versus 
Montreal, was in 1919; that series was cancelled due to an outbreak of 
influenza with the two teams tied at 2–2–1. The Metropolitans last went 
to the Stanley Cup finals in 1920, when they lost to the Ottawa Senators. 
Led by Lenny Wilkens, the Seattle SuperSonics made it to the NBA Finals 
in two consecutive years in the late 1970s. In 1978 they lost the championship 
series to the Washington Bullets in seven games, but rebounded in 1979 
to defeat the Bullets by four games to one to win the NBA Championship. 
The next time the Sonics made it to NBA Finals was in 1996 when they met 
the Chicago Bulls, to whom they lost the series in six games. Another national 
basketball championship trophy arrived in 2004, when the Seattle Storm 
defeated the Connecticut Sun two games to one to win the WNBA championship. 
The Seattle Storm won their second WNBA title in 2010, beating the Atlanta 
Dream in 3 games. The Seattle Mariners have won the American League West 
Pennant three times – in 1995, 1997, and, most recently, in 2001, after 
a record 116-win season. The Mariners, however, have yet to win an American 
League Championship or a World Series Championship. The Seattle Sounders 
FC won the Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup in the team's inaugural season of 2009. 
The Sounders won the U.S. Open Cup again in 2010, becoming the first MLS 
team to have back-to-back U.S. Open Cup Titles. Seattle continued its U.S. 
Open Cup dominance in the 2011 campaign, becoming the fourth team ever 
to win the tournament three consecutive years (the last being the New York 
Greek Americans in 1967–69). The Sounders beat the Chicago Fire 2-0 in 
front of a then record-setting MLS crowd of 35,615 at CenturyLink Field 
on October 4, 2011. On September 16, 2014, the Sounders captured their 
fourth U.S. Open Cup title, overcoming the Philadelphia Union – on the 
Union's home pitch – in extra time by a final score of 3-1. On October 
25, 2014, in front of a crowd of 57,673 at CenturyLink Field, the Sounders 
topped the Los Angeles Galaxy by a score of 2-0 to claim their first MLS 
Supporters’ Shield. In 2014 – the second regular season of the U.S. National 
Women's Soccer League – Seattle Reign FC attained the highest season point 
total of all nine league teams to receive their first NWSL Shield award. 
The Reign became the league's first team to repeat this achievement when 
they defeated the Boston Breakers at Memorial Stadium on August 26, 2015. 
The Seahawks have won nine NFL division titles, including two in the AFC 
West and seven in the NFC West. They won the NFC championship in 2006, 
earning them their first trip to Super Bowl XL, where they lost to the 
Pittsburgh Steelers 21-10. In 2014, the Seahawks defeated the San Francisco 
49ers at CenturyLink Field, to clinch their second NFC title and a berth 
in Super Bowl XLVIII, where they routed the Denver Broncos 43-8 to win 
their first Lombardi trophy. The following season, the Seahawks overcame 
a deficit in the NFC championship game with the Green Bay Packers in the 
final minutes of the fourth quarter to claim their first back-to-back George 
Halas trophies. In Super Bowl XLIX at the University of Phoenix Stadium, 
the Seahawks missed the opportunity to claim their second Super Bowl win 
in the final seconds of the fourth quarter, falling to the New England 
Patriots by a score of 28-24. The Seattle Thunderbirds are a Major Junior 
league ice hockey team that plays at the ShoWare Center. The Thunderbirds 
arrived in Seattle in 1977 as the Seattle Breakers, before changing to 
their current name in 1985. They play in the Western Hockey League, one 
of three components of the Canadian Hockey League, traditionally a major 
feeder system for the NHL. In 1976, Seattle was awarded a conditional NHL 
franchise, however the deal did not come to fruition. Originally arriving 
in 1974, the men's soccer team Seattle Sounders played in Seattle until 
1983 when the North American Soccer League collapsed due to overexpansion. 
The Seattle Sounders were brought back in 1994 and played in the USL First 
Division at what was then known as Qwest Field. Six years later the men's 
team was joined by a women's team of the same name (now known as the Seattle 
Sounder Angels) which plays in a nearby suburb, Tukwila. In 2008, the USL 
incarnation of the Sounders played its last season, and in 2009 Seattle 
Sounders FC began playing in MLS, America's top soccer division. The Sounders 
play league matches at the since-renamed CenturyLink Field, but use the 
Starfire Sports Complex in Tukwila for matches in the Lamar Hunt U.S. Open 
Cup (except when they host the final). In 2013, a new professional women's 
team, the Seattle Reign (named after a women's basketball team in the former 
American Basketball League), began play in the newly launched National 
Women's Soccer League. The Seattle Sounders (USL) won the A-League championship 
1995 and 1996 and the US First Division championship in 2005 and 2007. 
The Seattle Thunderbirds were the Western Hockey League champions in 1997. 
The Seattle SeaDogs defeated the Houston Hotshots two games to 0 for the 
CISL championship in 1997. The Washington Stealth defeated the Toronto 
Rock 15-11 for the Champion's Cup in 2010. The Seattle Sockeye won the 
USA Ultimate Club Championships in 2004, 2006 and 2007. They also won Seattle 
the gold medal at the World Ultimate Club Championships (WUCC) in 1997 
(Vancouver, BC). They also won the silver at the World Ultimate Games (WUGC) 
in 2008 (Vancouver, BC) and at WUCC in 2010 (Prague, Czech Republic). The 
University of Washington, Seattle University, and Seattle Pacific University 
field teams in a variety of sports, including football, basketball, and 
rowing. Their teams are known as the Huskies, Redhawks, and Falcons, respectively. 
The Husky football team has a following that ranks with those of the major 
professional teams in the city. In 1991, the Huskies shared an NCAA Division 
I collegiate football championship with the Hurricanes of the University 
of Miami. In 2005 the Huskies volleyball team won the NCAA National Championship. 
A Huskies rowing team represented the United States at the 1936 Summer 
Olympics in Berlin, Germany and defeated the Nazi Germany team to win the 
gold medal. The story was later chronicled in the 2013 book The Boys in 
the Boat.[3] In addition to the Seattle-based teams, the Spokane-based 
Gonzaga Bulldogs play one men's basketball game each season at KeyArena 
in an event billed as the Battle in Seattle. Rugby is growing in Seattle 
at the high school and youth level, with several schools adding programs, 
such as Shorecrest, Roosevelt and Nathan Hale High School.[4] The first 
professional team to play in Seattle was the PCHA Seattle Metropolitans, 
which played in the Seattle Ice Arena between 1915 and 1924. In 1967, the 
NBA's Seattle SuperSonics (more commonly known as the "Sonics") became 
the first modern-day major professional sports franchise in Seattle. However, 
in 2008, the Sonics' ownership group moved the team to Oklahoma City. In 
1969, the Major League Baseball Seattle Pilots were established, but only 
played one year in Seattle before moving to Milwaukee. The Pilots' sole 
season was immortalized in Jim Bouton's book Ball Four. Swimmer Helene 
Madison (1913–1970) of Seattle won three gold medals at the 1932 Olympic 
Games. The Seattle Dojo[1], which was founded before 1907, is the oldest 
judo academy in the United States. Seattle has been host to number of important 
sporting events. It hosted the NFL Pro Bowl in 1977, the Major League Baseball 
All-Star Game in 1979 and 2001, the NBA All-Star Game in 1974 and 1987, 
the MLS Cup in 2009, the Goodwill Games in 1990 and the NCAA Final Four 
in 1984, 1989 and 1995. In 1998, the Seattle City Council rejected a resolution 
8-to-1 that would have allowed Seattle to be considered for the 2012 Summer 
Olympics.[5] The Seattle Marathon has taken place annually since 1970. 
Seattle has hosted several United States men's national soccer team and 
United States women's national soccer team events in the past, including 
men's FIFA World Cup qualifying matches in 1976 and 2013.[6] CenturyLink 
Field has hosted CONCACAF Gold Cup matches in 2005 and 2013.[7] The stadium 
was also proposed as a 2016 Copa América venue and was considered, along 
with Husky Stadium, in the failed U.S. bid for the 2022 FIFA World Cup.[8][9]
