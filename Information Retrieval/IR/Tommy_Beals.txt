Thomas Lamb Beals (August 1850 – October 2, 1915) was an American Major 
League Baseball player in the National Association of Professional Base 
Ball Players and the National League. He played mostly in the outfield 
and at second base for the Washington Olympics, Washington Blue Legs, Boston 
Red Stockings, and Chicago White Stockings from 1871 to 1880.[1] Beals 
made his debut for the Olympics playing under the name W. Thomas on July 
27, 1871.[2] The Olympics franchise did not last beyond nine games into 
their 1872 schedule, and Beals was able to join the Blue Stockings the 
next season as a second baseman/catcher. He had the best season of his 
career, hitting .272 with a career-high 24 RBI on 46 hits.[2] In 1874, 
Beals started playing under his given name with the perennially powerful 
Red Stockings.[2] As a part-time second baseman/outfielder, he only managed 
to hit .196.[2] He reprised his part-time role in the Boston outfield the 
next season but significantly increased his production, hitting .265. After 
that 1875 season, the National Association became the National League, 
and Beals was without a job in Major League Baseball for the next four 
seasons.[1] Beals reemerged in 1880 with the White Stockings at age 29. 
He played 13 games for the Chicago club that season, hitting a career-low 
.152, and hung up his spikes after the season.[1] Beals died, at the age 
of 65, on October 2, 1915 in San Francisco, California, and he is interred
